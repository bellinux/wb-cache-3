The evacuation from the DAO Compound was completed by about 19:00 after which all helicopters would be routed to the Embassy; Major Kean was informed that operations would cease at dark. Major Kean advised that the LZ would be well lit and had vehicles moved around the parking lot LZ with their engines running and headlights on to illuminate the LZ. At 21:30 a CH-53 pilot informed Major Kean that Admiral Whitmire, Commander of Task Force 76 had ordered that operations would cease at 23:00. Major Kean saw Ambassador Martin to request that he contact the Oval Office to ensure that the airlift continued. Ambassador Martin soon sent word back to Major Kean that sorties would continue to be flown. At the same time, General Carey met Admiral Whitmire to convince him to resume flights to the Embassy despite pilot fatigue and poor visibility caused by darkness, fires and bad weather.|$|E

A Confederate sympathizer, Mrs. Thomas Humphreys, saw the approaching Union troops and sent her young son on horseback to warn the Confederates. As Mrs. Humphreys watched, she saw Union pickets capture her son and fired her pistol at them. She missed, but her shots began the attack prematurely.|$|E

[...] Even with this new perspective, {{there are indications that}} alertness at Mary Ann was not as good as it could have been. Many accounts by men stationed at Mary Ann mention that <b>perimeter</b> <b>security</b> was uneven at best. One member of the 1-46th Headquarters Company stated that [...] "I don't think Captain Knight [...] had a clue as to how lax the security was...because in that area, and only that area, Knight wasn't diligent. He left it up to his lieutenants and sergeants to check the bunker line." [...] In many cases they failed to do so, and the failure was compounded by Charlie Company being understrength and unable to man all the perimeter bunkers. Manning bunkers was not the only problem. Trip flares located in the concertina wire around the base were not always reset or replaced when they went off, a common occurrence caused in some cases by the rotor wash created by large CH-47 Chinook helicopters bringing in supplies or backhauling material as 1-46th Inf prepared to hand the base over to the ARVN. This lax attitude, combined with the skill of the attacking sappers, had fatal consequences for many in Charlie Company. Although not [...] "cringing in their bunkers", the defenders of Mary Ann were not prepared for a ground attack. This lack of readiness was not noted by the 196th LIB commander, Colonel William S. Hathaway during a visit to the base on 27 March, the day before the attack. He later stated that what he'd seen at Mary Ann that day [...] "was a big improvement over that I had seen before...the troops were alert." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper examines, for {{the first}} time, the trade and FDI impacts of a North American <b>Security</b> <b>Perimeter</b> that would liberalize the post 9 / 11 {{security}} measures at the Canada-US border. First, the study estimates econometrically the impact of post 9 / 11 security measures on bilateral (US-Canada) trade flows using a gravity model. Second, using these econometric estimates together with a three-region nine-sector general equilibrium model, we compute sectoral tariff rates “equivalent ” to the 9 / 11 security measures. Finally, we assess the (general equilibrium) impacts on trade and FDI of a change of security paradigm toward a North American <b>Security</b> <b>Perimeter.</b> The paper shows that the economic opportunity gains occurring to Canada and the US from the liberalization of the 9 / 11 security measures amount to US$ 20 billion annually.
