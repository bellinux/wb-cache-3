5|$|Similar to its {{induction}} <b>pharmacokinetics,</b> methoxyflurane {{has very}} slow and somewhat unpredictable emergence characteristics. During initial clinical studies in 1961, {{the average time}} to emergence after discontinuation of methoxyflurane was 59minutes after administration of methoxyflurane for an average duration of 87minutes. The longest time to emergence was 285minutes, after 165minutes of methoxyflurane administration.|$|E
5|$|Methoxyflurane has a {{very high}} lipid {{solubility}} (oil:gas partition coefficient of around 950), which gives it very slow <b>pharmacokinetics</b> (induction and emergence characteristics); this being undesirable for routine application in the clinical setting. Initial studies performed in 1961 revealed that in unpremedicated healthy individuals, induction of general anesthesia with methoxyflurane-oxygen alone or with nitrous oxide was difficult or even impossible using the vaporizers available at that time. It {{was found to be}} necessary to administer an intravenous anesthetic agent such as sodium thiopental to ensure a smooth and rapid induction. It was further found that after thiopental induction, it was necessary to administer nitrous oxide for at least ten minutes before a sufficient amount of methoxyflurane could accumulate in the bloodstream to ensure an adequate level of anesthesia. This was despite using high flow (liters/minute) of nitrous oxide and oxygen, and with the vaporizers delivering the maximum possible concentration of methoxyflurane.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacia & Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) {{started its}} own oxazolidinone {{research}} {{program in the}} 1990s. Studies of the compounds' structure–activity relationships {{led to the development}} of several subclasses of oxazolidinone derivatives, with varying safety profiles and antimicrobial activity. Two compounds were considered drug candidates: eperezolid (codenamed PNU-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766). In the preclinical stages of development, they were similar in safety and antibacterial activity, so they were taken to Phase I clinical trials to identify any difference in <b>pharmacokinetics.</b> Linezolid was found to have a pharmacokinetic advantage—requiring only twice-daily dosage, while eperezolid needed to be given three times a day to achieve similar exposure—and therefore proceeded to further trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved linezolid on April 18, 2000. Approval followed in Brazil (June 2000), the United Kingdom (January 2001), Japan and Canada (April 2001), Europe (throughout 2001), and other countries in Latin America and Asia.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone has {{predictable}} <b>pharmacokinetics.</b> The single-dose kinetics are linear in {{the oral}} dose range of 2.5–10mg.

25|$|In vitro {{studies with}} {{cytochrome}} (CYP) P450 enzymes indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit 80 CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2, suggesting that moxifloxacin {{is unlikely to}} alter the <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Citalopram is {{considered}} safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic dose range. Distinct {{from some other}} agents in its class, it exhibits linear <b>pharmacokinetics</b> and minimal drug interaction potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or comorbid patients.|$|E
25|$|Multiplex assays {{are used}} to {{simultaneously}} measure the presence, concentration, activity, or quality of multiple analytes in a single test.

25|$|A {{study that}} {{investigated}} the <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of topical progesterone using a hydrophilic (gel), lipophilic, or emulsion-type base {{found that in}} all three cases the time to peak concentrations was around 4nbsp&hours and the elimination half-life was {{in the range of}} 30 to 40nbsp&hours.

25|$|Geriatric {{patients}} (>65 years old) exhibit altered <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of atorvastatin {{compared to}} young adults, with mean AUC and Cmax {{values that are}} 40% and 30% higher, respectively. Additionally, healthy elderly patients show a greater pharmacodynamic response to atorvastatin at any dose; therefore, this population may have lower effective doses.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of honokiol {{have been}} {{explored}} in rats and mice; however, further research {{must be done}} in humans. Intravenous delivery of 5–10mg/kg in rodent models has shown a plasma half-life of around 40–60 minutes while intraperitoneal injections of 250mg/kg had a plasma half-life around 4–6 hours with maximum plasma concentration occurring between 20–30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The route or {{course the}} active {{substance}} takes from application location {{to the location}} where it has its target effect is usually rather a matter of <b>pharmacokinetics</b> (concerning the processes of uptake, distribution, and elimination of drugs). Exceptions include the transdermal or transmucosal routes, which are still {{commonly referred to as}} routes of administration.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{bioavailability}} {{has been}} found to be 8% ±6% on its own and, when co-administered with cyclosporine, bioavailability increased to 90% ± 44%. In practice, docetaxel is administered intravenously only to increase dose precision. Evaluation of docetaxel <b>pharmacokinetics</b> in phase II and III clinical studies were with 100mg/m² dosages given over one-hour infusions every three weeks.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of {{progesterone}} {{are dependent}} on its route of administration. The drug is approved {{in the form of}} oil-filled capsules containing micronized progesterone for oral administration, termed oral micronized progesterone or OMP. It is also available in the form of vaginal or rectal suppositories or pessaries, topical creams and gels, oil solutions for intramuscular injection, and aqueous solutions for subcutaneous injection.|$|E
25|$|Sex: at {{the same}} number of drinks, women are more prone to {{hangover}} than men, and this is likely explained by sex differences in the <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of alcohol. Women attain a higher blood alcohol concentration (BAC) than men {{at the same}} number of drinks. At equivalent BACs, men and women appear to be indistinguishable with respect to most hangover effects.|$|E
25|$|Elimination: Duloxetine has an {{elimination}} half-life {{of about}} 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its <b>pharmacokinetics</b> are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state is usually achieved after 3 days. Only trace amounts (<1%) of unchanged duloxetine {{are present in}} the urine and most of the dose (approx. 70%) appears in the urine as metabolites of duloxetine with about 20% excreted in the feces.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline {{is absorbed}} slowly when taken orally, {{achieving}} its maximal {{concentration in the}} plasma 4–6hours after ingestion. In the blood, it is 98.5% bound to plasma proteins. According to in vitro studies, sertraline is metabolized by multiple cytochrome 450 isoforms: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. It appeared unlikely that inhibition of any single isoform could cause clinically significant changes in sertraline <b>pharmacokinetics.</b> No differences in sertraline <b>pharmacokinetics</b> were observed between people with high and low activity of CYP2D6; however, poor CYP2C19 metabolizers had a 1.5-times-higher level of sertraline than normal metabolizers. In vitro data also indicate that the inhibition of CYP2B6 should have even greater effect than the inhibition of CYP2C19, while the contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to the metabolism of sertraline would be minor. These conclusions have not been verified in human studies. Sertraline can be deaminated in vitro by monoamine oxidases; however, this metabolic pathway has never been studied in vivo. The major metabolite of sertraline, desmethylsertraline, is about 50 times weaker as a serotonin transporter inhibitor than sertraline and its clinical effect is negligible.|$|E
25|$|In-feed {{treatments}} {{are easier to}} administer and pose less environmental risk than bath treatments. Feed is usually coated with the drug and drug distribution to the parasite {{is dependent on the}} <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of the drug getting in sufficient quantity to the parasite. The drugs have high selective toxicity for the parasite, are quite lipid-soluble so that there is sufficient drug to act for approximately 2 months, and any unmetabolized drug is excreted so slowly that there are little to no environmental concerns.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of {{zopiclone}} {{in humans}} are stereoselective. After oral {{administration of the}} racemic mixture, Cmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) and terminal elimination half-life values are higher for the dextrorotatory enantiomers, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller volume of distribution (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the levorotatory enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the dextrorotatory enantiomers of the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites are {{higher than those of}} the respective antipodes.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol has an {{additive}} effect {{when combined with}} zopiclone, enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of zopiclone significantly. Erythromycin appears to increase the absorption rate of zopiclone and prolong its elimination half-life, leading to increased plasma levels and more pronounced effects. Itraconazole has a similar effect on zopiclone <b>pharmacokinetics</b> as erythromycin. The elderly may be particularly sensitive to the erythromycin and itraconazole drug interaction with zopiclone. Temporary dosage reduction during combined therapy may be required, especially in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} <b>pharmacokinetics,</b> {{cimetidine}} in particular interferes {{with some of}} the body's mechanisms of drug metabolism and elimination through the liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway. To be specific, cimetidine is an inhibitor of the P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4. By reducing the metabolism of drugs through these enzymes, cimetidine may increase their serum concentrations to toxic levels. Many drugs are affected, including warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, quinidine, propranolol, labetalol, metoprolol, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, some benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, sulfonylureas, metronidazole, and some recreational drugs such as ethanol and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).|$|E
25|$|The {{systemic}} bioavailability of azelastine {{is approximately}} 40% when administered intranasally. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are observed within 2–3 hours. The elimination half life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance are 22 h, 14.5 l/kg and 0.5 l/h/kg respectively (based on intravenous and oral administration data). Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family into its active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, and two inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Approximately 75% of an oral dose is excreted in feces. <b>Pharmacokinetics</b> of orally administered azelastine are {{not affected by}} age, gender or hepatic impairment.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one study}} {{appears to have}} {{evaluated}} the <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of iprindole. A single oral dose of 60mg iprindole to healthy volunteers {{has been found to}} achieve mean peak plasma concentrations of 67.1ng/mL (236nmol/L) after 2 to 4hours. The mean terminal half-life of iprindole was 52.5hours, which is notably much longer than that of other TCAs like amitriptyline and imipramine. Following chronic treatment with 90mg/day iprindole for 3weeks, plasma concentrations of the drug ranged between 18 and 77ng/mL (63–271nmol/L). Theoretical steady-state concentrations should be reached by 99% within 15 to 20days of treatment.|$|E
25|$|MDMA {{is known}} to be metabolized by two main {{metabolic}} pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The metabolism may be primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and COMT. Complex, nonlinear <b>pharmacokinetics</b> arise via autoinhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2D8, resulting in zeroth order kinetics at higher doses. It is thought that this can result in sustained and higher concentrations of MDMA if the user takes consecutive doses of the drug.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of {{lamotrigine}} follow first-order kinetics, with a half-life of 29 {{hours and}} volume of distribution of 1.36 L/kg. Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Its absolute bioavailability is 98% and its plasma Cmax occurs from 1.4 to 4.8 hours. Available {{data indicate that}} its bioavailability is not affected by food. Estimate of the mean apparent volume of distribution of lamotrigine following oral administration ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. This is independent of dose and is similar following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers.|$|E
25|$|Pre-treatment with {{corticosteroids}} {{has been}} used to decrease hypersensitivity reactions and oedema in response to docetaxel and has shown no effect on the <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of docetaxel. The efficacy of docetaxel was improved by treatment with oral capecitabine, and after more than 27 months follow-up the survival benefit has been confirmed. Doxorubicin was combined with docetaxel in one study of 24 patients and resulted in an increased AUC of docetaxel by 50 to 70%, indicating doxorubicin may affect the disposition of docetaxel. Etoposide has also been shown to decrease docetaxel clearance, though patient numbers for this observation have been low.|$|E
