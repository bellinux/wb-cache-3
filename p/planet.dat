5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a <b>planet</b> orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This <b>planet</b> received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the <b>planet</b> was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third <b>planet.</b> Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible <b>planet</b> received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of Pluto's orbit by Matthew J. Holman and Matthew J. Payne found perturbations {{much larger than}} predicted by Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit for <b>Planet</b> Nine. Holman and Payne suggested three possible explanations: systematic errors in the measurements of Pluto's orbit; an unmodeled mass in the Solar System, such as a small <b>planet</b> {{in the range of}} 60– (potentially explaining the Kuiper cliff); or a <b>planet</b> more massive or closer to the Sun instead of the <b>planet</b> predicted by Batygin and Brown.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{discovery}} in 2001, 47 Ursae Majoris was already known to host one extrasolar <b>planet,</b> designated 47 Ursae Majoris b. Further measurements of the radial velocity revealed another periodicity in the data unaccounted for by the first <b>planet.</b> This periodicity {{could be explained by}} assuming that a second <b>planet,</b> designated 47 Ursae Majoris c, existed in the system with an orbital period close to 7 years. Observations of the photosphere of 47 Ursae Majoris suggested that the periodicity could not be explained by stellar activity, making the <b>planet</b> interpretation more likely.

5|$|At {{the time}} of discovery, Gliese 876 was already known to host an extrasolar <b>planet</b> {{designated}} Gliese 876 b.

The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found to be exactly half that of the outer <b>planet,</b> which meant that the radial velocity signature of the second <b>planet</b> was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no matter where it is speculated to be, if <b>Planet</b> Nine exists, then its mass is higher than what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates {{the outer edge of}} the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a <b>planet</b> by current definitions. Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that only at the smallest size and farthest distance was it on the border of being called a dwarf <b>planet.</b> Margot himself says that <b>Planet</b> Nine satisfies the quantitative criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, <b>Planet</b> Nine will qualify as a planet—if and when it is detected.|$|E

40|$|As of December 2007, radial {{velocity}} measurements and planetary transit surveys for nearby stars have already identified more than 250 <b>planets</b> around other stars.

The discovery of many extrasolar <b>planets</b> have revealed the existence of exotic <b>planets</b> such as “hot Jupiters ” and “eccentric <b>planets,</b> ” showing the diversity of planetary systems. Among the discovered extrasolar <b>planets,</b> there are special targets called “transiting <b>planets,</b> ” whose orbits seen from the Earth pass {{in front of the}} stellar surfaces of their host stars by chance, and these <b>planets</b> provide us precious opportunities for studying extrasolar <b>planets</b> more closely. So far we have pursued two techniques which are only applicable for transiting planetary systems, in order to investigate the environment and the formation process of extrasolar <b>planets.</b> For the purposes, we have conducted spectroscopic observations of transiting planetary systems using the Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS).

50|$|Most of the <b>planets</b> {{discovered}} {{outside the}} Solar System are giant <b>planets,</b> {{because they are}} more easily detectable.

5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} the capture of a <b>planet</b> from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or free-floating planets, in a process similar to the capture of irregular satellites around the giant planets, leaving one in a stable orbit around the Sun. A <b>planet</b> that originated in a system with a number of Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of capture by another star. Although this increases the odds of the Sun capturing another <b>planet</b> from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing the probability of a <b>planet</b> being captured on an orbit like that proposed for <b>Planet</b> Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where the capture takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the <b>planet,</b> potentially allowing this capture scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of the capture of a free-floating <b>planet</b> is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated free-floating planets being captured on orbits similar to that proposed for <b>Planet</b> Nine.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second <b>planet,</b> tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a <b>planet</b> in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets. Current models of <b>planet</b> formation cannot easily explain how a <b>planet</b> could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant <b>planet</b> could have formed. Instead, the <b>planet</b> may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
5|$|Due to its extreme {{distance}} from the Sun, <b>Planet</b> Nine would reflect little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. It {{is expected to have}} an apparent magnitude fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than Pluto. If <b>Planet</b> Nine exists and is close to its perihelion, astronomers could identify it based on existing images. For its aphelion, the largest telescopes would be required. However, if the <b>planet</b> is currently located in between, many observatories could spot <b>Planet</b> Nine. Statistically, the <b>planet</b> {{is more likely to be}} closer to its aphelion at a distance greater than 500 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their aphelion, in accordance with Kepler's second law.|$|E
