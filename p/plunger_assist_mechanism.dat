40|$|The WALK mode {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{navigation}} interfaces for 3 D virtual environments. However, due to the limited view angle and low frame rate, users are often blocked by obstacles when they navigate in a cluttered virtual scene with such a mode. Intelligent 3 D navigation interfaces with <b>assisting</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as motion planning methods or virtual force fields, have been proposed in the literature to improve navigation efficiency. Nevertheless, the applicability of these methods is subject to individual discrepancy, and the control parameters of these methods are usually determined by empirical means.

The simulation experiment method searches for the optimal control parameters for a user in a systematic manner while the dynamic adjustment method makes the <b>assisting</b> <b>mechanism</b> adaptive to user control behaviors as well as environmental variations in real time.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{laboratory}} experiments designed {{to investigate the}} microphysical processes that result in rate- and state-dependent friction behavior. We study the effect of relative humidity (RH) (< 5 to 100 %) in velocity stepping tests (10 – 20 mm/s) and slidehold-slide (SHS) tests (3 – 1000 s) on 3 mm thick layers of quartz and alumina powders sheared at 25 MPa normal stresses. Granular powders are conditioned in situ under controlled RH to create new surface area before shearing. We find a transition from velocity strengthening to velocity-weakening frictional behavior as RH increases. The transition occurs at 30 – 35 % RH for quartz and 55 – 60 % RH for alumina. Frictional healing is negligible at low humidity and increases with increasing RH for both materials. The coefficient of sliding friction is independent of humidity. We use normal stress vibrations in SHS tests to isolate chemically <b>assisted</b> healing <b>mechanisms</b> operative within contact junctions from compaction induced granular strengthening. We find that reorganization of granular particles influences friction but that chemically <b>assisted</b> <b>mechanisms</b> dominate.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} skill assist efficiency control by using semi-active <b>assist</b> <b>mechanisms</b> based on phase difference limitation method. The skill assist in this study means the motion correction effect in periodical motions. The semi-active <b>assist</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can make the assist force with the phase difference, because the mechanism uses elastic materials {{as the source of}} the assist force. This force is controlled by adjusting the fixed point of the elastic materials by using the connected actuator as a series-elastic actuator. We confirmed the motion correction effect of our skill assist based on the phase difference control in previous study. Our proposed method in this study can control the skill assist efficiency to arbitrary value by limitation of the phase difference. Moreover, we confirmed that the proposed method can control its effect through experiments with several value of the efficiency. As a result of this study, we confirmed the fundamental ability of our developed method to control the motion correction ratio depending on types of task or personal differences in periodical motions...|$|R

The rate law for the bromide anation of PtBr 5 H 2 O−indicates two parallel reaction paths. The term k′Br− 2 corresponds to a bromide <b>assisted</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The second term in the rate expression can be accounted for by assuming that a dimeric intermediate is formed from the platinum(IV) substrate and hydrated PtBr 42 −. The formation of the reaction product PtBr 62 − is preceded by a substitution of water by bromide in this dimer. A bromide <b>assisted</b> <b>mechanism</b> can also describe the bromide anation kinetics of cis-PtBr 4 (H 2 O) 2, the rate law determined. The bromide anation of trans-PtBr 4 (H 2 O) 2 {{in the presence of}} PtBr 42 − occurs by a two-term rate law, indicating two parallel paths, k′ corresponding to formation of PtBr 5 H 2 O− and k″ to formation of PtBr 62 −. Trans-PtBr 4 (H 2 O) 2 reacts so slowly with bromide in the absence of PtBr 42 − that no reaction can be observed. The large difference in bromide anation rates for PtBr 5 H 2 O− and cis-PtBr 4 (H 2 O) 2 compared to trans-PtBr 4 (H 2 O) 2 might indicate that halide assisted anations are possible only for complexes having a halide (or some other effective bridging group) in trans-position to the aqua ligand to be replaced...|$|R

As a result, more powerful braking performance is obtained with less pedal pressure in emergency braking situations even when carrying a large payload.

40|$|Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) as the {{state-of-the-art}} mid-infrared (mid-IR) coherent {{sources have}} been greatly developed in aspects such as output power, {{energy efficiency and}} spectral purity. However, there are additional applications of QCLs in high demand, namely mode-locking, mid-IR modulation, etc. The inherent optical properties and ultrafast carrier dynamics can lead to solutions to these challenges. In this dissertation, we further characterize QCLs using mid-IR femtosecond (fs) pulses generated from a laser system consisting of a Ti:sapphire oscillator, a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier, an optical parametric amplifier and a difference frequency generator. We study the Kerr nonlinearity of QCLs by coupling resonant and off-resonant mid-IR fs pulses into an active QCL waveguide. We observe {{an increase in the}} spectral width of the transmitted fs pulses as the coupled mid-IR pulse power increases. This is explained by the self-phase modulation effect due to the large Kerr nonlinearity of QCL waveguides. We further confirm this effect by observing the intensity dependent far-field profile of the transmitted mid-IR pulses, showing the pulses undergo self-focusing as they propagate through the active QCL due to the intensity dependent refractive index. The finite-difference time-domain simulations of QCL waveguides with Kerr nonlinearity incorporated show similar behavior to the experimental results. The giant Kerr nonlinearity investigated here may be used to realize ultrafast pulse generation in QCLs. In addition, we temporally resolved the ultrafast mid-infrared transmission modulation of QCLs using a near-infrared pump/mid-infrared probe technique at room temperature. Two different femtosecond wavelength pumps are used with photon energy above and below the quantum well (QW) bandgap. The shorter wavelength pump modulates the mid-infrared probe transmission through interband transition <b>assisted</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> resulting in a high transmission modulation depth and several nanoseconds recovery lifetime. In contrast, pumping with a photon energy below the QW bandgap induces a smaller transmission modulation depth but much faster (several picoseconds) recovery lifetime, attributed to intersubband transition <b>assisted</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The latter ultrafast modulation (> 60 GHz) can provide a potential way to realize fast QCL based free space optical communication...|$|R

Calculations by Qiao et al suggest that the water assisted stepwise proton transfer from Gar-N to THF-N is 80-100 kj/mol more favorable than the concerted transfer suggested by Klein.
