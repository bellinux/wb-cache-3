50|$|Innis gave no precise {{definition}} of the term, but did suggest that he was extending the concept of monopoly {{in the field of}} economics to knowledge in general. Monopolies of knowledge arise when ruling classes maintain their political power through their control of key communications technologies. An example of this occurs in ancient Egypt where a complex writing system conferred a monopoly of knowledge on literate priests and scribes. Mastering the art of writing and reading required long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship</b> and instruction, confining knowledge to this powerful class.|$|R

40|$|Forced {{immigration}} from the Southwest Indian Ocean marked {{life at the}} Cape of Good Hope for over a century. Winds, currents, and shipping linked the two regions, as did a common international currency, and complementary seasons and crops. The Cape's role as a refreshment station for French, Portuguese, American, and Spanish slave ships proved particularly important {{in the development of}} a commerce linking East Africa, Madagascar, and the Mascarenes with the Americas. This slave trade resulted in the landing at the Cape of perhaps as many as 40, 000 forced immigrants from tropical Africa and Madagascar. Brought to the Cape as slaves, or freed slaves subjected to strict <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship,</b> these individuals were marked by the experience of a brutal transhipment that bears comparison with the trans-Atlantic Middle Passage. The history of the Middle Passage occupies a central place in the study of slavery in the Americas and plays a vital role in the way many people today situate themselves socially and politically. Yet, for various reasons, this emotive subject is absent from historical discussions of life at the Cape. This article brings it into the history of slavery in the region. By focusing on the long history of this forced immigration, the article also serves to underline the importance of the Cape to the political and economic life of the Southwest Indian Ocea...|$|R

25|$|On 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to {{engraver}} James Basire of Great Queen Street, at {{the sum of}} £52.10, for a term {{of seven}} years. At {{the end of the}} term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> Blake's <b>apprenticeship,</b> but Peter Ackroyd's biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries – and then crossed it out. This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier stipple or mezzotint styles. It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.|$|R
50|$|Yun’s {{poetry is}} notable for the childlike persona of his narrators, a {{sensitive}} awareness {{of a lost}} hometown, and an unusual scapegoat mentality deriving {{from a sense of}} shame at not being able to lead a conscientious life in a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> gloomy social realities. “Life and Death” (Salmgwa jugeum) is representative of the poems dating from 1934 to 1936, his <b>period</b> <b>of</b> literary <b>apprenticeship.</b> It describes the conflict between life and death, or light and darkness, but its poetic framework is more or less crude. From 1937 onwards, however, his poems reveal ruthless introspection and anxiety about the dark realities of the times. The poems <b>of</b> this later <b>period</b> reach a clear literary fruition in terms of their reflection on the inner self and their recognition of nationalist realities, as embodied in the poet's own experiences. In particular, they evince a steely spirit that attempts to overcome anxiety, loneliness, and despair and to surmount contemporary realities through hope and courage.|$|R

50|$|Francis Baring's other {{distraction}} from his firm was his directorship of the East India Company from 1779.By 1783 {{he led the}} City interest on the company's court, and in 1786 he was reckoned its most able member.His commitment was significant; he gave up each Wednesday and occasionally a Friday to its affairs. Notwithstanding his views on the liberalization of American trade, he promoted the company's monopoly and commercial independence ‘with an ardour contrary to the usual moderation of his character’ (Public Characters, 1805).He joined the East India Company when the British government was anxious to exert greater political control over it, recognizing the great territorial power that it had become. Baring actively fought off the far-reaching proposals of Lord North and Charles James Fox, believing that ‘India is not a colony and God forbid that it ever should be’ (Barings archives, Northbrook MSS, N4.5), but he worked with an old friend from the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> his <b>apprenticeship</b> and now a fellow director, Richard Atkinson, to modify and facilitate the acceptance of Pitt's India Act.

50|$|Abolitionists in the Americas and in Europe became vocal {{opponents of}} the slave trade {{throughout}} the 19th century. The importation of slaves to the colonies was often outlawed years {{before the end of the}} institution of slavery itself. It was well into the 19th century before many slaves in the Caribbean were legally free. The trade in slaves was abolished in the British Empire through the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in 1807. Men, women and children who were already enslaved in the British Empire remained slaves, however, until Britain passed the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833. When the Slavery Abolition Act came into force in 1834, roughly 700,000 slaves in the British West Indies immediately became free; other enslaved workers were freed several years later after a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> forced <b>apprenticeship.</b> Slavery was abolished in the Dutch Empire in 1814. Spain abolished slavery in its empire in 1811, with the exceptions of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Santo Domingo; Spain ended the slave trade to these colonies in 1817, after being paid ₤400,000 by Britain. Slavery itself was not abolished in Cuba until 1886. France abolished slavery in its colonies in 1848.|$|R

At the time when the paper appeared she was still living in her hometown Erlangen, during what may be called the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> her <b>apprenticeship,</b> studying the highlights of contemporary mathematics of the time. Her guide and mentor in this period was Ernst Fischer. We can almost be sure that Steinitz’s paper was the object of extensive discussions between Fischer and Emmy Noether. 1 Steinitz’s ideas contributed essentially to the shaping of Emmy Noether’s concept of mathematics and in particular of algebra. During the next decade every one of Noether’s papers (except those on mathematical physics...|$|R
