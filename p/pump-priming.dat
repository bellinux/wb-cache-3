2500|$|Roosevelt {{appointed}} Wallace to be Secretary of Commerce in January 1945, {{shortly before}} Roosevelt's death, {{as a sort}} of consolation prize for losing the vice presidency. Wallace's nomination prompted an intense debate. During his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in early January 1945, Wallace [...] "called to a guaranteed annual minimum wage for all employees, maintenance of high wartime wages in the postwar era, and automatic government <b>pump-priming</b> to be triggered whenever the number of jobs in the nation fell below 57 million. For both supporters and opponents, therefore, Wallace's nomination was a symbol of the Administration's intent to resume New Deal reform, with its emphasis on Executive leadership, at war's end." [...] Senate conservatives tried to stymie Wallace's prospective future powers through a measure, proposed by Walter F. George, to remove the Federal Loan Administrationand therefore the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and its $32 billion in lending authorityfrom the Commerce Department. This measure was adopted. Some conservatives, such as Harry F. Byrd and Josiah Bailey, sought to defeat Wallace's nomination altogether; Bailey made a motion on February 1 to immediately proceed to the nomination, [...] "in the belief that if the powers of the Commerce Department were not diminished, Henry Wallace would never win confirmation." [...] The motion was defeated on a 42-42 vote, however, and the George bill was approved before the Wallace nomination came to the floor.|$|E
2500|$|The GDP of the Philippines rose {{during the}} martial law, rising from P55 million to P193 million in about 8 years. This growth was spurred by massive lending from {{commercial}} banks, accounting for about 62% percent of external debt. As a developing country, the Philippines during the martial law {{was one of}} the heaviest borrowers. These aggressive moves were seen by critics as a means of legitimizing martial law by purportedly enhancing the chances of the country in the global market. Much of the money was spent on <b>pump-priming</b> to improve infrastructure and promote tourism. However, despite the aggressive borrowing and spending policies, the Philippines lagged behind its Southeast Asia counterparts in GDP growth rate per capita. The country, in 1970–1980, only registered an average 3.4 percent growth, while its counterparts like Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia garnered a mean growth of 5.4 percent. This lag, which became very apparent {{at the end of the}} Marcos Regime, can be attributed to the failures of economic management that was brought upon by State-run monopolies, mismanaged exchange rates, imprudent monetary policy and debt management, all underpinned by rampant corruption and cronyism. As said by Emannuel de Dios “main characteristics distinguishing the Marcos years from other periods of our history has been the trend towards the concentration of power in the hands of the government, and the use of governmental functions to dispense economic privileges to some small factions in the private sector.” ...|$|E

In pressing for its passage, lobbyists from numerous organizations argued that highways would be essential evacuation routes in wartime, and would encourage population and industrial decentralization away from the vulnerable cities. Other supporters emphasized the civilian economic aspects, as well as the <b>pump-priming</b> impact of such a large construction project.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{public health}} {{argument}} for developing and maintaining workplace wellness programmes in organisations is well‐documented, particularly within the healthcare sector {{which aims to}} “set the example” for workplace health. However, workplace wellness also makes good business sense, since it is established that investing in employee health can reduce absenteeism, improve job satisfaction and productivity and enhance corporate image. Organisations often place workplace wellness low in their priorities. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present the case for an initial resource investment and top‐level support to <b>pump‐prime</b> a financially sustainable, and even profitable, programme. Design/methodology/approach – A discussion is presented based on academic literature and practical applications from the authors' experiences in practice. Findings – The authors use their own in‐house scheme, “Q‐active” as a case example based in an NHS Trust setting, to demonstrate how such schemes can be developed and successfully implemented and maintained in practice. The paper presents the use of the Business Healthcheck Tool for developing a business case for such schemes.

50|$|At {{the outset}} of Joseph Estrada’s presidency, the Asian {{financial}} crisis that characterized the period prompted the national leadership {{to take a second}} look at the country’s economic policies and strategies. To maintain macroeconomic stability in light {{of the effects of the}} economic turmoil, the government had to raise domestic demand by sustaining expenditures and <b>pump-priming</b> the areas of public infrastructure and social services. It had to adopt an expansionary fiscal policy by allowing a reasonable level of cyclical deficit to be financed largely through foreign borrowing while offsetting the negative impact of deficit by introducing structural reforms in the budget process.|$|E

He set up the charity and designed its 'solution focused' approach to early intervention, based on the pioneering work of Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg. Additional funding was received at the end of 1995 through a Home Office 'reducing criminality' initiative which enabled the fledgling charity to pilot its approach over the following three years.|$|E
50|$|Between 1970 and 2000 Canada lost between 21 and 23 {{percent of}} its {{historic}} building stock, 21 percent in the larger cities, and 23 percent in smaller rural towns. The rate of loss in rural Newfoundland and Labrador is nearly double the national average. Where possible, HFNL has encouraged the retention of historic buildings, and promoted the adaptive reuse of older structures for commercial and public functions. The economic benefits of historic preservation - such as total job creation and increased income - surpass those of other investments such as new housing or new commercial construction. Given the powerful economic <b>pump-priming</b> effect of historic preservation, public programs to foster preservation can realize sizable economic development gains often at little or no cost to the taxpayer.|$|E

This reports provides detail around the article processing charges (APC) data and RCUK Call for Evidence report. Background In April 2013, the revised RCUK Policy on Open Access came into effect. The policy requires journal articles or conference proceedings arising from research funded wholly or partially by a RCUK grant should be made freely available online (or “Open Access”). There are two main routes to make papers open access: a) the Green route, which is the LSE preferred route, when {{the full text of}} papers are deposited into an institutional repository such as LSE Research Online. To select this route, embargo periods must be no longer than the 12 months permitted by RCUK (no charge applies); b) the Gold route, which provides immediate, unrestricted access to {{the final version of the}} paper via the publisher's website, often using a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence - it may involve payment of an APC to the publisher. In 2013, we received the RCUK OA block grant for 2013 / 14 of £ 62, 862. We set up the LSE Institutional Publication Fund using this grant and this was managed by the Library, allowing eligible RCUK-funded researchers to apply for APC funds.

50|$|The UAP {{had been}} {{formed as a}} new {{conservative}} alliance in 1931, with Labor defector Joseph Lyons as its leader. The stance of Lyons and other Labor rebels against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the Great Depression had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives. With Australia still suffering {{the effects of the}} Great Depression, the newly formed party won a landslide victory at the 1931 Election, and the Lyons Government went on to win three consecutive elections. It largely avoided Keynesian <b>pump-priming</b> and pursued a more conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets as a means of stewarding Australia out of the Depression. Lyons' death in 1939 saw Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of war. Menzies served as Prime Minister from 1939 to 1941 but resigned as leader of the minority World War II government amidst an unworkable parliamentary majority. The UAP, led by Billy Hughes, disintegrated after suffering a heavy defeat in the 1943 election.|$|E

40|$|Although {{circumstances}} are propitious {{for a modest}} expansion in output, business confidence is low and there is as yet no indication {{of the increase in}} investment necessary for a sustained longer-term recovery. Given the traumatic shocks of the past three years, industry may be slow to respond to relatively modest changes in the exchange rate and in the level of domestic demand, and more substantial <b>pump-priming</b> may be needed to make any impact on current unemployment levels. However, the high level of import propensity means that even a moderately-large growth in demand may not encourage significant growth in output and employment, and may instead lead to the familiar cycle of balance of payments problems, sterling depreciation and higher import prices, and renewed inflation.

The paper argues further that conventional <b>pump-priming</b> policies are incapable of closing this employment gap. In order to tackle the formidable labor market challenges observed in the United States over the last few decades, policy could benefit from a fundamental reorientation away from trickle-down Keynesianism and toward what is termed here a bottom-up approach to fiscal policy.

Within Japan, a growing number acknowledged the reform imperative but while some progress was made in restoring financial health of the beleaguered banking system, political leaders relied mainly on ineffective <b>pump-priming</b> policies to "fix" the economic problem policies.

40|$|Resource {{wealth in}} Australia is often {{presented}} as an asset, {{waiting to be}} exploited. Reflecting this, the recent resource boom is unquestioned indeed celebrated [...] as a great windfall for the Australian people. There is a broad-based assumption that Australia's resource-based economy successfully diversified in the later twentieth century, while retaining a foundation in agricultural exports, and latterly minerals. As the saying goes, the country rode to prosperity 'on a sheep's back', {{and then on the}} back of the mining sector. The recent resources boom may be seen as simply the latest phase in that process, <b>pump-priming</b> the country's twenty-first century information-age service economy. The mining boom has undoubtedly been a key foundation of Australia's recent economic growth. But how far should it be welcomed? This article debates the impact of the resource boom in Australia, arguing we should at the very least be willing to discuss whether this presumed blessing is, for many, in fact a 'curse in disguise. In the context of accelerated climate change, and a continuing rural crisis in Australia, it is salutary to be reminded of what Sheik Ahmed Yamani, long-time Oil Minister of Saudi Arabia, said in regard to their major resource asset: 'All in all, I wish we had discovered water' (quoted in Ross 1999) ...|$|E

Would the mere desire to live more healthily be enough for organic farmers? We will examine the growth in popularity of organic food which is illustrated by the existence of 2000 organic farms in the Czech Republic and also by the supply of organic food in shops. The theoretical part deals with the explanation of the term "organic farming". Attention also will be paid to legal regulations because organic farming in the Czech Republic is defined by Act No 242 / 2000 coll. on organic farming, by MoA Decree 16 / 2006 coll., by Commission Regulation (EC) No 889 / 2008, by Council Regulation (EC) No 834 / 2007 on organic production which came into effect on January 1, 2009. The thesis also deals with Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union between 2007 and 2013, the Action Plan of the Czech Republic for the Development of Organic Farming and principles of subsidisation in the year 2009. The practical part will be focused on results on economic analysis at approximately 3 farms which are specialised in bull or goat production...|$|E
40|$|Conventionally {{economic}} growth theory {{was based on}} the assumption of a constant rate of time preference. Uzawa (1968) and Obstfeld (~, 1981) introduced the rate of time preference that increases with the utility level. Irving Fisher (The Theory of Interest) has a different opinion, however, that people are more time impatient at the lower level of income. This paper assumes a non-monotonic time preference schedule such that people are more patient at the middle income levels and are less patient when they are either very poor or rich. Based on a nonlinear savings function out of wealth implied by such a time-preference schedule, this paper develops a single-good, multi-country growth model of a global economy with free capital mobility. The long-run property of this System is characterized by three kinds of long-run equilibrium: the starvation (fatal attractor) equilibrium, the imperialism equilibria dominated by a nation or by a group of nations, and the co-prosperity equilibrium where the wealth and the income of countries in the system grow proportionately. Bifurcation phenomena and the global stability of the system by the Lyapunov function will be discussed. Our system has a strong resemblance to some models of ecology where species compete for their survival (May, Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems). Here we can properly analyze the transition of a debtor to a creditor country from a global perspective, and make a case for the <b>pump-priming</b> foreign aid or debt relief policy. ...|$|E
