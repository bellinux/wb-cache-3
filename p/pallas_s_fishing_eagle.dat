5000|$|The grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (Haliaeetus ichthyaetus) is a {{fish-eating}} {{bird of prey}} from South East Asia. It is a large stocky raptor {{with adults}} having dark brown upper body, grey head and lighter underbelly and white legs. Juveniles are paler with darker streaking. It is often confused with the lesser <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (Ichthyophaga humilis) and the Pallas's <b>fish</b> <b>eagle.</b> The lesser <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> is similar in plumage but smaller and the Pallas’s <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> shares the same habitat and feeding behaviour but is larger with longer wings and darker underparts. Is often called tank eagle in Sri Lanka due to its fondness for irrigation tanks.|$|R
40|$|African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> (Haliaeetus vocifer) are {{important}} {{birds of prey}} and indicator of ecosystem integrity in aquatic environments. We assessed the population abundance and spatial distribution of African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> along three major rivers in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. Data were collected using walked transect surveys along Mwenezi, Runde and Save rivers in Gonarezhou between March and April 2011. A total of 54 African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> were recorded with an average density of 0. 62 individuals per km. African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> were mostly distributed in areas with large water pools along Gonarezhou’s three major rivers. The results suggest that large pools along perennial rivers {{are important}} in the distribution and density of African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> in Gonarezhou. Future studies should aim at establishing the long-term population trends of birds of prey in Gonarezho...|$|R
50|$|The lesser <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird of prey}} that is primarily gray-brown in colour with broad, blunt wings and coarse featherless legs. They are smaller than the similar Ichthyophaga ichthyaetus (gray-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle)</b> and may often get confused with the similar species. The lesser <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> has a brown breast with white thighs and belly. They have a short, rounded tail with a long neck and a small head. Juvenile lesser <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> are similar in appearance to adults, although they have brown eyes whereas an adult has yellow. Adults have a wingspan reaching 1.2 m and can grow to up to 64 centimeters tall.|$|R
25|$|Common {{bird species}} are peafowl, grey partridge, quail, malabar, pied hornbill, swallow, nightjars, dronge, paradisefly, kingfisher, bulbul, mainas, pigeon, wood pigeon, blue jay, owl, falcon, kite, eastern {{imperial}} eagle, greater spotted eagle, white-tailed <b>eagle,</b> Pallas's <b>fish</b> <b>eagle,</b> grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle,</b> lesser kestrel and vulture.|$|R
50|$|Ichthyophaga is a genus of {{two species}} of eagles, {{closely related to the}} sea eagles in the genus Haliaeetus. In fact, some taxonomic {{authorities}} place this genus within Haliaeetus. Both are native to southeastern Asia, from the Indian subcontinent southeast to Sulawesi. They are smaller than the Haliaeetus eagles, though overlapping in size with the smaller species of that genus. They share similar plumage, with grey heads grading into dull grey-brown wings and bodies, and white belly and legs. They differ in tail colour, with the lesser <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> having a brown tail, and the grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> having a white tail with a black terminal band, and also in size, with the lesser <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> only about half of the weight of the grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alongside human activities, {{natural enemies}} include cheetahs, leopards and lions, which all {{sometimes}} prey on this species. Eggs may be also {{at risk of}} predation by African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles.</b> At one colony in Kisumu, Kenya, approximately 61% of eggs counted between all nests hatched and 38% were predated by <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagles.</b> The success rate of fledglings was only 0.33 young per nest. However, increased egg predation by <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagles</b> {{has been reported to}} be linked to decline in fish stocks in the Winam Gulf.|$|R
40|$|During {{one week}} {{of a survey}} for the {{endangered}} Madagascar <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagle</b> conducted along the coast between Mahajanga and Soalala of western Madagascar in June 1995, all mangroves that were accessible by boat were searched. In addition to one pair of <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagles,</b> a pair and a large flock of 81 Madagascar Teal were observed on a tidal mudflat in the Betsiboka River delta and another pair was sighted 15 km south flying by a <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagle</b> nest located in the mangroves of this estuary...|$|R

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle's affinities {{beyond the}} Sanford's sea eagle {{are a little}} less clear; {{molecular}} data indicate that {{it is one of}} four species of tropical sea eagle (along with the African <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> and the Madagascar <b>fish</b> <b>eagle),</b> while allozyme data indicate it might have a closer relationship with the sea eagles of the northern hemisphere. A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be basal to the four <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus Ichthyophaga).|$|R

5000|$|The African <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> is {{a species}} {{placed in the}} genus Haliaeetus (sea eagles). Its closest {{relative}} {{appears to be the}} critically endangered Madagascar <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (H. vociferoides). Like all sea eagle species pairs, this one consists of a white-headed species (the African <b>fish</b> <b>eagle)</b> and a tan-headed one. These are an ancient lineage of sea eagles, and as such, have dark talons, beaks, and eyes Both species have at least partially white tails even as juveniles. The scientific name is derived from Haliaeetus, New Latin for [...] "sea eagle" [...] (from the Ancient Greek haliaetos), and vocifer is derived from its original genus name, so named by the French naturalist François Levaillant, who called it 'the vociferous one'.|$|R

40|$|Coastal and inland surveys for the endemic and “Critically Endangered ” Madagascar <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagle</b> Haliaeetus vociferoides were {{conducted}} in western Madagascar from Antsiranana in the north to Manja in the south during the 2005 and 2006 breeding seasons (May–October). Surveys covered typical Madagascar <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagle</b> habitat: lakes, rivers, mangroves, estuaries, and marine islands within their known distribution. In total, 287 individuals were encountered, including 98 breeding pairs (196 individuals), 23 breeding trios (69 individuals), 15 single adults and seven immature birds. Of these 287 birds, 128 individuals (44. 6 %) were observed on lakes; 116 (40. 4 %) in coastal areas, consisting of 103 (35. 9 %) in mangroves and 13 (4. 5 %) in estuaries; 32 (11. 2 %) on marine islands and 11 (3. 8 %) on rivers. There was an increase between surveys in 1995 and this study {{in the number of}} Madagascar <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagles</b> counted, from 222 to 287, and in the number of pairs from 99 to 121. This study confirms that the Madagascar <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagle</b> population is still low due to human persecution (hunting, collection of eggs and nestlings), overfishing and habitat destruction. We recommend monitoring <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> annually at the higher concentration sites to evaluate human activities and conducting a population survey every five years throughout western and northern Madagascar...|$|R

50|$|Pallas's <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (Haliaeetus leucoryphus), {{also known}} as Pallas's sea <b>eagle</b> or band-tailed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle,</b> is a large, {{brownish}} sea-eagle. It breeds in Central Asia, between the Caspian Sea and the Yellow Sea, from Kazakhstan and Mongolia to the Himalayas, Bangladesh and northern India. It is partially migratory, with central Asian birds wintering among the southern Asian birds in northern India, and also further west to the Persian Gulf.|$|R
50|$|Although not {{currently}} {{considered to be}} threatened with extinction, the population of grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> is declining, the result of numerous and varied threats. The loss of suitable wetland habitat, deforestation, over-fishing, siltation, persecution, human disturbance and pollution resulting {{in a loss of}} nesting sites and reduced food supply. Tingay et al. noted that these statements are based mostly on anecdotal evidence, although their studies found a definitive negative link between human habitation and grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> nest occupancy rates in Cambodia. Another critical threat to the Cambodian populations of the grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> on the Tonlé Sap is the damming of the Mekong River for hydropower, which will possibly have adverse effects on critical flood regimes of the Tonlé Sap.|$|R
