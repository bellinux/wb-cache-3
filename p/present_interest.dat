60|$|This {{encouraging}} reply {{cost him}} an effort.

60|$|Therefore Helen {{went in to}} {{chat with}} Mrs. Zane, for she was always glad {{to listen to the}} colonel's wife, who was so bright and pleasant, so helpful and kindly in her womanly way.

6000|$|Blonay, originally, {{must have}} been a hold of no great importance, as neither the magnitude, strength, nor {{position}} of the older parts, is sufficient to render the place one to be seriously assailed or obstinately defended. Without knowing the fact, I infer that its <b>present</b> <b>interest</b> arises from its great antiquity, coupled with the circumstance of its having been possessed by the same family for so long a period. Admitting a new owner for each five-and-twenty years, the present must be somewhere about the twenty-fifth De Blonay who has lived on this spot! ...|$|E

He crossed the trail by which Sparrer had come in, sniffed at it, looked up in Sparrer's direction suspiciously, it seemed to him, sniffed again and then trotted on as if the matter were of no <b>present</b> <b>interest.</b> The dry snow had not held the scent sufficiently to cause alarm.|$|E
60|$|Glossin extricated {{himself from}} the Deacon's grasp and from the discussion, though not with rudeness; for it was his <b>present</b> <b>interest</b> to buy golden {{opinions}} from all sorts of people.

60|$|There {{was plenty}} of merriment, as he drew and {{measured}} at the very scanty ruins, which {{were little more than}} a few fragments of wall, overgrown luxuriantly with ivy and clematis, but enclosing some fine old coffin-lids with floriated crosses, interesting to those who cared for architecture and church history, as Mr. Dutton tried to make the children do, so that their ecclesiastical feelings might be less narrow, and stand on a surer foundation than <b>present</b> <b>interest,</b> a slightly aggressive feeling of contempt for all the other town churches, and a pleasing sense of being persecuted.|$|E
6000|$|The {{reader is}} not to be {{surprised}} at Thousandacre's trifling blunders of this sort; for, those whose rule of right is <b>present</b> <b>interest,</b> frequently, in the eagerness of rapacity, fall into this very kind of error; holding that cheap at one moment, which they affect to deem sacred at the next. I dare say, if the old squatter had held a lease of the spot he occupied, he would at once have viewed the character and rights of a [...] "common tenant," [...] as connected with two of the most important interests of the country. It happened now, however, that it was [...] "his bull that was goring our ox." ...|$|E

The sale of a former lot of smuggled goods had resulted in a large profit and Cristoval had received a bank draft for the amount, one half of which was due my father. When we last saw Cristoval at San Bernardino, before we left for New York, he promised my father to cash the draft and send him the proceeds. This he never did, although he advanced my father, at that time, a sum of money from other sources to pay our expenses until we could establish ourselves in the east.|$|E

60|$|To observe this trio--the simple, complacent {{little man}} and his two young nieces--no {{stranger}} would suspect them to be other than ordinary tourists, bent on escaping the severe Eastern winter; but in New York the name of John Merrick was spoken with awe in financial circles, where his many millions made him an important figure. He had practically retired from active business and his large investments were managed by his brother-in-law, Major Gregory Doyle, who was Miss Patsy's father and sole surviving parent. All of Mr. Merrick's <b>present</b> <b>interest</b> in life centered in his three nieces, and because Louise was happily married and had now an establishment of her own--including a rather new but very remarkable baby--Uncle John was drawn closer to the two younger nieces and devoted himself wholly to their welfare.|$|E

I won't trouble you at any length with my theory on the subject--I will confine myself to telling you only what it is your <b>present</b> <b>interest</b> to know. It has often occurred {{to me in the}} course of my medical practice, to doubt whether we can justifiably infer--in cases of delirium--that the loss of the faculty of speaking connectedly, implies of necessity the loss of the faculty of thinking connectedly as well. Poor Mr. Candy's illness gave me an opportunity of putting this doubt to the test. I understand the art of writing in shorthand; and I was able to take down the patient's 'wanderings', exactly as they fell from his lips.--Do you see, Mr. Blake, what I am coming to at last?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Maggot was a powerfully-built man, {{rough in}} his outer aspect {{as well as}} in his inner man, but by no means what is usually termed a bad man, although, morally speaking, he could not claim to be {{considered}} a good one. In fact, he was a hearty, jolly, reckless fisherman, with warm feelings, enthusiastic temperament, and no principle; a man who, though very ready to do a kind act, had no particular objection to do one that was decidedly objectionable when it suited his purpose or served his <b>present</b> <b>interest.</b> He was regarded by his comrades {{as one of the greatest}} madcaps in the district. Old Maggot was, as we have said, a blacksmith to trade, but he had also been bred a miner, and was something of a fisherman as well, besides being (like most of his companions) an inveterate smuggler. He could turn his hand to almost anything, and was [...] "everything by turns, but nothing long." ...|$|E
