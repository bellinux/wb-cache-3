5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the discovery that <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcer</b> disease and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcer</b> disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcer</b> disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} modern {{studies that have}} {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives. Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcer</b> and gastric cancer as the cause of death.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} {{digestive}} tract lesions, mild bleeding and mild resultant anemia is treated with iron supplementation, and no specific treatment is administered. There is limited data on hormone treatment and tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding and anemia. Severe anemia or episodes of severe bleeding {{are treated with}} endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) or laser treatment of any lesions identified; this may {{reduce the need for}} supportive treatment. The expected benefits are not such that repeated attempts at treating lesions are advocated. Sudden, very severe bleeding is unusual—if encountered, alternative causes (such as a <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcer)</b> need to be considered—but embolization may be used in such instances.|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcer</b> and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} of a 2 -week anti-Helicobacter therapy in the healing of H. pylori-associated bleeding <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Methods: Omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxycillin 1 g, twice daily, were given for 2 weeks to 180 patients with H. pylori-associated bleeding <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Endoscopy was repeated 4 weeks after the eradication therapy to assess healing of the <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Results: Repeat endoscopies were performed in 168 patients (42 gastric ulcer and 126 duodenal ulcer) who followed the protocol. Thirty-eight patients with bleeding gastric ulcers and 124 patients with bleeding duodenal ulcers healed 4 weeks after treatment (per protocol analysis; gastric ulcer: 91 % vs. duodenal ulcer: 98 %; P = 0. 035). No patients who were compliant to the study medications suffered from re-bleeding. Stepwise discriminant analysis demonstrated that small ulcers (< 15 mm) {{and the presence of}} duodenal ulcers best predicted healing of the <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Conclusions: Ulcer-healing drugs should be continued after a 2 -week course of omeprazole-containing anti-Helicobacter therapy for gastric <b>ulcers</b> and large <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcers</b> that have bled, but can be omitted in most patients with a bleeding duodenal ulcer. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Later in 1937, Jessie became seriously {{infected}} with boils and, {{while under the}} care of a Glanton Brethren family, became a Christian. Before the end of the year, Jenner and Jessie began living together again. Although Jenner gave up gambling, he was often unemployed because he would evangelise at his workplace and then be fired. In 1939, Jessie developed a <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcer.</b> At the time, it was believed that such ulcers were caused by stress, and Jessie's ulcer was therefore attributed to the stress induced by the family's lack of money. Consequently, she and Ann moved to India to live with Jenner's aunt Emily McKenzie, who ran the Kotagiri Keswick Missionary Home. Ann subsequently attended Hebron School in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, until she was ten years old. Once Jessie had recovered from her illness, they returned to Sydney on SS Oronsay.|$|E
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if <b>peptic</b> <b>ulcer</b> disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
