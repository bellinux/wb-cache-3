50|$|For Apollo missions, the {{communications}} blackout was approximately three minutes long.

For the Apollo 13 mission, the blackout was much longer than normal because the flight path of the spacecraft was unexpectedly at a much shallower angle than normal. According to the mission log maintained by Gene Kranz, the Apollo 13 re-entry blackout lasted around 6 minutes, beginning at 142:39 and ending at 142:45, and was 1 minute 27 seconds longer than had been predicted.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a restricted {{form of the}} axiom rule in calculi of Partial Inductive Definitions (PID). The paper argues that in calculi of PIDs the distinction between atomic and non-atomic formulae is not as clear as in traditional sequent calculi. Therefore the common restriction of the axiom rule to the atomic case is not adequate {{for this type of}} calculi. A novel <b>proviso</b> <b>for</b> the axiom rule and corresponding <b>provisos</b> <b>for</b> the left and right definition rules are introduced with an accompanying discussion and suggestions for possible applications in the domain of declarative specification of operational behaviour of logic programs. 1 Background and motivation In sequent calculi of Partial Inductive Definitions (PID) (see e. g. [1, 2, 3]) the axiom (Initial Sequent) rule has been modelled on the "Axiom schema" of the traditional (logical) sequent calculus (see e. g. [4]). However, in calculi of PIDs defined atoms are in many respects more properly understood as complex expression [...] ...|$|R

This question can be resolved by applying voting systems designed for single winner elections to a multiple-choice referendum.|$|R
