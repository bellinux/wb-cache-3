Yet her soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E

Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz, who for six months had given part of his ration and a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> to Levi without asking for anything in return.

25|$|The College was {{in great}} {{disrepair}} when Jan Standonck took over—some {{of the walls}} were falling down. It had {{become known as the}} Collège de Montaigu, after the Archbishop's brother, and Jan was to make it famous. He imposed a very severe regime on the students. They could leave only with his permission and had to return before nightfall—he took the key from the porter every night. They wore only a single cloth gown and were given only a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> each day to eat. They {{had to go to the}} door of a nearby monastery at eleven o'clock each morning to receive a hand-out of food. They were punished for the slightest fault, and were encouraged—out of pure charity—to inform of any misdemeanours, and to criticise each other's conduct. Erasmus, one of the students, later said he did not think anyone could forget—or even survive unscathed—their time at the College.|$|E
25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} a simple dish, but comes in many varieties {{due to its}} versatility. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or food processor and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, {{there is a general}} rule regarding compatibility. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten is often mopped up with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread.</b> Pasta is largely carbohydrates (mainly as starch), with moderate amounts of protein and manganese.|$|E

500|$|The film stars Kitty Horn as the maid, but {{the other}} actors in the film are unknown. Both the {{scenario}} writer {{and the director of}} the film are unknown. Produced and released in time for Washington's Birthday, the crossing of the Delaware River was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware. Though official materials openly postulated as to how Washington received word of the British being weak, Washington's plan was never sporadic and a landing of all the men was not done at the behest of a single maid. American accounts have long held the notion that the Hessian forces would be drunk and sluggish. According to Patriot John Greenwood, who fought in the battle and supervised Hessians afterward, who wrote, [...] "I am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during the whole night, nor, as I could see, even a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> eaten.
