40|$|For {{screening}} {{the active}} <b>phloroglucinols</b> on influenza virus (H 5 N 1) from Dryopteris crassirhizoma NaKai, a database was established including twenty-three <b>phloroglucinols</b> {{that had been}} isolated from Dryopteris crassirhizoma. Their inhibitory effect on the neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus H 5 N 1 was screened by molecular docking. As a result, three candidates were selected. The rhizomes of D. crassirhizoma were subjected to isolation and purification processes to obtain the inhibitor candidates. Thirteen <b>phloroglucinols</b> were obtained, including three selected candidates and two new <b>phloroglucinols.</b> The five <b>phloroglucinols</b> were investigated for their inhibitory activity on NA in vitro. The results showed that dryocrassin ABBA and filixic acid ABA exhibited inhibitory effects on NA with IC 50 as 18. 59 ± 4. 53 and 29. 57 ± 2. 48 μM, respectively, {{and the other three}} <b>phloroglucinols</b> showed moderate inhibitory activity. Moreover, the anti-influenza virus (H 5 N 1) activity and cytotoxicity of dryocrassin ABBA and filixic acid ABA were tested on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with the cell counting kit- 8 (CCK 8) method. The results confirmed that dryocrassin ABBA exhibited an inhibitory activity with low cytotoxicity (TC 50 > 400 μM) against influenza virus (H 5 N 1) which will have to be investigated in further detail. In conclusion, <b>phloroglucinols</b> from D. crassirhizoma were shown to have anti-influenza virus activity, and especially dryocrassin ABBA, one of the <b>phloroglucinols,</b> may have the potential to control influenza virus (H 5 N 1) infection...|$|R

40|$|Ethnopharmacological {{relevance}} Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don fil. (family Asteraceae) {{has been}} used for its medicinal properties for a long time and, even nowadays, continues {{to play an important role}} in the traditional medicine of Mediterranean countries. Based on this traditional knowledge, its different pharmacological activities have been the focus of active research. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of the pharmacological activities of Helichrysum italicum, as well as its traditional uses, toxicity, drug interactions and safety. Materials and methods The selection of relevant data was made through a search using the keywords “Helichrysum italicum” and “H. italicum” in “Directory of Open Access Journals”, “Google Scholar”, “ISI Web of Knowledge”, “PubMed”, “ScienceDirect” and “Wiley Online Library”. Information obtained in local and foreign books and other sources was also included. Results There are reports on the traditional use of Helichrysum italicum in European countries, particularly Italy, Spain, Portugal and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In these countries, its flowers and leaves are the most used parts in the treatment of health disorders such as allergies, colds, cough, skin, liver and gallbladder disorders, inflammation, infections and sleeplessness. In order to validate some of the traditional uses of Helichrysum italicum and highlight other potential applications for its extracts and isolated compounds, several scientific studies have been conducted in the last decades. In vitro studies characterized Helichrysum italicum as an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agent. Its flavonoids and terpenes were effective against bacteria (e. g. Staphylococcus aureus), its acetophenones, <b>phloroglucinols</b> and terpenoids displayed antifungal action against Candida albicans and its flavonoids and <b>phloroglucinols</b> inhibited HSV and HIV, respectively. Helichrysum italicum acetophenones, flavonoids and <b>phloroglucinols</b> demonstrated inhibitory action in different pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism and other pro-inflammatory mediators. Regarding Helichrysum italicum in vivo activity, the highlight goes to the anti-erythematous and photoprotective activities of its flavonoids, demonstrated both in animals and humans, and to the anti-inflammatory properties exhibited by its flavonoids, acetophenones and <b>phloroglucinols,</b> as seen in animal models. Concerning its safety and adverse effects, while Helichrysum italicum does not display significant levels of cytotoxicity or genotoxicity, it should be noticed that one of its flavonoids inhibited some CYP isoforms and a case has been reported of an allergic reaction to its extracts. Conclusions Helichrysum italicum is a medicinal plant with promising pharmacological activities. However, most of its traditionally claimed applications are not yet scientifically proven. Clinical trials are needed to further confirm these data and promote Helichrysum italicum as an important tool in the treatment of several diseases...|$|R
