40|$|Late frost {{is one of}} {{the more}} serious {{adversity}} for Italian agriculture. Several methods have been developed to protect cultivations, but their application results particularly effective (also from an economic point of view) only if supported by forecasting systems during the more susceptible period of the year. On these basis a forecasting system of late frost in Val di Chiana (an area in central Italy mainly cultivated with cereals and high quality fruits) was developed. The system consists in an empirical model, based on a preventive agroclimatic analysis of the area to identify night cooling dynamics (for several meteorological conditions) in the spring. A network of 10 thermohygrometric stations was installed in the area integrating the information obtained by a local <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>station</b> network.

40|$|Abstract. The {{weather is}} a key factor for {{outbreaks}} of plant diseases. Therefore, the monitoring of climate is essential to any intelligent system of cultivation. Usually, such monitoring is carried through <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>stations</b> that acquire data like temperature, humidity, wind speed and leaf wetness. Unfortunately, {{the high cost of}} stations limits the number of monitoring points within the same area. This forces the use of tools of mathematical interpolation. However, such procedure does not lead to good results in the estimation of precipitation and leaf wetness. In this work was developed a monitoring system, composed for a set of microstations of data acquisition. They presented low cost and highest autonomy. Therefore, they can be installed throughout the area of cultivation, collecting data like temperature and leaf wetness. The microstations communicate with each other through wireless communication. Thus, daily, the data collected are transferred to a central station, where become available for analysis. The system made it possible to monitor the entire area of cultivation, providing reliable data, which make it possible to characterize the microclimate. This makes it possible to, for example, the efficient use of pesticides, reducing production costs and generating healthy foods...|$|R

In this paper, we developed the Normalized Weighted Difference Water Index (NWDWI) for identifying the unique characteristics of rice during the flooding and transplanting period. With the aid of the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model and the phenological data observed at <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>stations,</b> the spatial distributions of single cropping rice and double cropping early and late rice in the Yangtze River Delta region were generated using the NWDWI and time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index data derived from MODIS/Terra data during the 2000 – 2010 period. The accuracy of the MODIS-derived rice planting area was validated against agricultural census data at the county level. The spatial accuracy was also tested based on a land use map and Landsat ETM+ data. The decision coefficients for county-level early and late rice were 0. 560 and 0. 619, respectively. The MODIS-derived area of late rice exhibited higher consistency with the census data during the 2000 – 2010 period.

40|$|Frost is the {{condition}} that exists when {{the temperature of the}} earth's surface and earthbound objects falls below freezing (0 C). These events may have serious consequences on crop production, so actions must be taken to minimize damaging effects. In particular, temperature predictions are of much help in frost protection decisions by providing the hortoculturist with warnings of critical temperatures. Consequently, reliable temperature prediction methods would be of significant economic value. These methods are usually empirical formulae based on significant correlations between the minimum temperature observed {{towards the end of the}} night and one or several meteorological variables measured at least several hours before this minimum is reached. These empirical regressions employ antecedent air temperature, various humidity measures, wind speed and cloud cover values. In this work we explore the possibility of developing an empirical prediction system for frost protection of fruits and vegetables in the southern part of the Santa Fe province in Argentina, in the region covered by the <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>station</b> located at Zavalla (3301 S, 6053 W). To this end we consider a handful of Machine Learning techniques usually employed in regression and classification problems, including Artificial Neural Networks, Simple Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbors.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{sensitivity}} of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) to global warming in Spain {{at the end of}} the 21 st century. The FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith equation was used to estimate ETo, and we examined {{the sensitivity of}} the latter to changes in temperature and relative humidity. Changes in stomatal resistance in response to increased CO 2 concentration were not evaluated, nor were the changes in wind velocity and solar radiation. Different scenarios were used for estimation of future ETo in different river basins as a consequence of trends in the maximum and minimum temperatures and maximum and minimum humidities during the period 1973 – 2002, as observed from 38 meteorological stations. The temperature increases ranged between 0. 3 and 0. 7 °C decade – 1, and the relative humidities fluctuated between 0. 1 and – 3. 7 % decade – 1 Four scenarios were simulated that. considered the variations in linear tendency of the maximum and minimum temperatures and maximum and minimum relative humidities. The trends of the 4 scenarios were incorporated with the data from 338 <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>stations</b> to estimate future ETo. In all cases, there was an annual increase in ETo of 11, 21, 36 and 7 % above the annual ETo (1196 mm) for Scenarios 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of insect pest populations in agricultural and forest ecosystems {{is an important}} and useful tool for integrated pest management (IPM). Insect population models are mainly driven by environmental temperature data, which are usually collected from <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>stations</b> or derived from geographic statistical extrapolations. The present study describes the modeling of olive fly (Bactrocera oleae) populations in the Eastern Mediterranean region using the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Image Spectro Radiometer) land surface temperature (LST) product from NASA TERRA satellite. These data, together with in situ temperature data, were used to estimate the tree-canopy temperatures at the pixel resolution (1 km). The estimated canopy temperature was used as input for the olive fly population model. Our main aim was to demonstrate the use of satellite-acquired information for modelling biological and ecological phenomena. Eleven years (2001 – 2012) of olive fly population fluctuations were simulated for three different geographic locations, representing different geo-climatic conditions. The model successfully simulated the seasonal population fluctuations throughout the 11 -year period and {{did a good job}} of connecting all of the life stages of the insect. To evaluate the validity of these findings, we compared them with adult olive-fly trapping data. We observed a high degree of correlation between the trapping data and our model's predictions. Here, we demonstrate that satellite thermal data can be used to predict insect pest population fluctuations for IPM purposes. The study also advances some new modelling concepts, such as the “window of opportunity” which links physiological development with chronological age. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Background: Annual {{crop yield}} data {{is a typical}} time series data in Precision Agriculture. Most data is {{constituted}} by some observations at irregularly scattered points in time due to the finite cost of data acquisition and its difficulties, so the data is corresponding to {{a subset of the}} whole study period. In this study, we aim to present an improved interpolation method for the annual crop yield data by introducing wavelet filtering to auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Methods: With the proposed method, wavelet transforms were conducted to decompose the original time series data into approximation coefficient and detail coefficients, and each coefficient was fitted by ARIMA model. Then, the interpolated data was obtained by re-aggregating the fitted approximation coefficient and detail coefficients, and a cross-validation was applied to evaluate the interpolating accuracy. Results: In the experiment, annual wheat yield data got from 27 <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>stations</b> distributed throughout main winter wheat producing areas of China over a 30 -year period (1981 to 2010) was used to evaluate the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed method yielded more accurate results than conventional ARIMA and linear interpolation. Moreover, the proposed method is not sensitive to the length of the time series, because the wavelets have the advantage of handling multi­ scale features of the original data. Discussions: Besides the greater interpolation accuracy, the proposed method concerns of multi-scale feature of the time series data, and brings about multi-scale decomposition of the data, which will reveal more inherent information of the data. Conclusion: The method introduced in this paper increases the accuracy of annual crop yield data interpolation, and also will be an effective method of analysing the data...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{evapotranspiration}} in arid and semi-arid environments plays a {{key role}} in water irrigation scheduling for water use efficiency. This work presents an operational method for evapotranspiration retrievals based on disaggregated Land Surface Temperature (LST). The retrieved LSTs from Landsat- 8 and MODIS data were merged in order to provide an 8 -day composite LST product at 100 x 100 m resolution. The method was tested in the arid region of Copiapo, Chile using data from years 2013 - 2014 and validated using data from years 2015 - 2016. In-situ measurements from <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>stations</b> such as air temperature and potential evapotranspiration (ETU) estimated at the location were used in the ET estimation method. The disaggregation method was developed by taking into account (1) the spatial relationship between Landsat- 8 and MODIS LST, (2) the spatial relationship between LST and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at high spatial resolution (Landsat- 8), and (3) the temporal variations along the year of both relationships aforementioned. The comparison between disaggregated LST at 100 m resolution and in situ LST measurements presents a coefficient of determination (r(2)), in average, equal to 0. 70 and a RMSE equal to 3. 6 K. The disaggregated LST was used in an operational model to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa). The ETa shows good results in terms of seasonal variations and in comparison to the evapotranspiration estimated by using crop coefficients (kc). The comparison between remotely sensed and in situ ETa presents an overall r(2) close to 0. 67 and a RMSE equal to 0. 6 mm day(- 1) for both crops. These results are important for further improvements in water use sustain ability in the Copiapo valley, which is currently affected by high water demand...|$|R

We observed the influence of both temperature and moisture conditions of experimental area on sunflower yield of achenes (conventional, medium-late hybrids: NK Brio, NK Armoni). Preceding crop of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) every experimental year was wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Technological system of sunflower cultivation was realized in accordance with conventional technology of cultivation. The basic fertilization was made by balance method on the base of agrochemical soil analysis for expected yield 3 t. ha− 1. The meteorological data were got out from <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>station</b> of the Central Controlling and Testing Institute in Agriculture in Veľké Ripňany. During every experimental year the change of inner energy (ΔU) was evaluated for thermodynamic characteristic analysis (security of the temperature and moisture) and the impact of changes on yield forming with maximal yield (Ymax in 2008) and minimal yield (Ymin in 2009). Achieved value of yield from thermal and precipitation energy introduces concrete energy amount, which is available in given period for concrete height of yield.

For this purpose, 16 meteorological stations were {{selected on the basis of}} accessibility of required data, their adequate representativeness, homogeneity, and situation of the stations. It was necessary to make a database of climatological factors (wind velocity, precipitations and air temperature) in the periods of 1961 - 2003 for analyses of climatological data. The data were evaluated for the periods of 1961 - 2003, 1961 - 1990, 1991 - 2000 and 1971 - 2000. Climatic erosion factor, which explains the potential erodibility of soil by wind, was determined through analyses of factors affecting the wind erosion. The assessment of the effect of expected climate change on the intensity and spreading of wind erosion consists in the selection of a suitable climatological model and climate change scenarios on the basis of ability to model the three climatological factors. Climate change scenarios were applied on the data of the selected climatological stations and the assessment of changes in data sets and the comparative analysis of the outputs of the scenarios with measured data from the normal period of 1961 - 1990 were done. The climatic erosion factor was also determined from the altered data of the scenarios.

The water consumption of maize was recorded day by day and the evapotranspiration was calculated by following the water balance of plant stands. The mechanical injury has changed the water loss of plants. Just after the simulation the evapotranspiration increased independently {{on the time of}} intervention. Later on, the deviation in water loss of maize depended on the actual weather. When the weather is dry and bright, the damaged plants increased their evapotranspiration. During humid or wet weather the water loss of injured maize decreased compared to water loss of their undamaged control.

However this requires that models simulate an accurate water balance. Comparing model results with field observations will provide information {{on the performance of}} the models. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the performance of DSSAT model in simulating the water balance by comparing the simulations with observed measurements. The soil water balance in DSSAT uses a one dimensional “tipping bucket” soil water balance approach where available soil water is determined by the drained upper limit (DUL), lower limit (LL) and saturated water content (SAT). A continuous weighing lysimeter was used to get the observed values of drainage and evapotranspiration (ET). An automated <b>agrometeorological</b> weather <b>station</b> close to the lisymeter was also used to record the climatic data. The model simulated accurately the soil water content after the optimization of the soil parameters. However it was found the inability of the model to capture small changes in daily drainage and ET. For that reason simulated cumulative values had larger errors as the time passed by. These results suggested the need to compare outputs of DSSAT and some hydrological model that simulates soil water movement with a more mechanistic approach. The comparison of the two models will allow us to find which mechanism can be modified or incorporated in DSSAT model to improve the simulations...|$|R
40|$|The crop {{coefficient}} (Kc) {{is widely used}} for operational estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and crop water requirements. The standard method for obtaining Kc is via a lookup table from FAO- 56 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56), which broadly treats Kc {{as a function of}} four crop-growing stages. However, the distinctive physiological characteristics of overwintering crops, such as winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which is extensively planted in the North China Plain (NCP), are not addressed in this method. In this study, we propose a stage-wise method that accounts for Kc variations for winter wheat at each critical phenological stage, thereby estimating Kc at finer temporal scales. Compared with the conventional FAO method, the proposed stage-wise method successfully captures the bimodal pattern in Kc time series for winter wheat, which is shown at both ten-day and phenological time scales. In addition, the accuracies of the proposed stage-wise Kc method and the FAO method were evaluated using micro-meteorological measurements of ETa collected at the Gucheng <b>agrometeorological</b> experimental <b>station</b> in the NCP. Using a leave-one-out strategy, the evaluation revealed that the stage-wise method significantly outperformed the FAO method at both daily and critical phenological time scales, with root-mean-square errors in ETa for the stage-wise method and the FAO method being 0. 07 mm·day- 1 and 0. 16 mm·day- 1, respectively, at the daily time scale, and 0. 01 mm·day- 1 and 0. 27 mm·day- 1 at the critical phenological time scale. Generally, the FAO method underestimates ETa during the initial stage and overestimates ETa during both the development and mid-season stages. It is shown that the proposed stage-wise method is important for the water-stressed NCP where precision irrigation is highly desirable, especially during the critical phenological stages. Results from this study provide insight into accurate estimation of water requirements for winter wheat at phenological time scales...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Farklı ekosistemlerin karbon bütçelerini belirlemek küresel karbon döngüsünü anlayabilmek açısından oldukça önemli bir konudur. Özellikle küresel ısınmanın en büyük sebebinin insan kaynaklı sera gazlarının (karbondioksit ve metan başta olmak üzere) atmosferik konsantrasyonlarının artışı olduğu düşünülünce, bu konuda yapılan bilimsel araştırmaların artış göstermesi yadsınamaz. FLUXNET (Akı Ağı) projesi kapsamında dünya üzerindeki farklı ekosistemlerin karbon bütçesini belirleyebilmek için altı kıtada karbondioksit akıları ölçülmektedir. Akı Ağında ölçüm alanları başta ormanlar olmak üzere, tarım alanları ve çayırlardır. Türkiye ise, bu akı ağı projesine hala dahil değildir. FAO’ya göre Avrupa’nın 1 / 3 ’ünü tarım alanları oluşturmaktadır. Bu sebeple toplam karbon döngüsündeki etkileri küçük de olsa tarım alanları üzerinde yapılan ölçümler, farklı tarım ürünleri ekilmesinin ve farklı tarımsal faaliyetler yürütülmesinin karbon bütçesi üzerindeki etkilerini belirleyebilmek için oldukça gereklidir. Bu ölçümlerin uzun dönemler devam ettirilmesi elde edilecek sonuçların güvenilirliği açısından oldukça önemli bir husustur. Bu çalışmada, Kırklareli’nde bulunan Atatürk Toprak Su ve Tarımsal Meteoroloji Araştırma İstasyonu Müdürlüğü’ne ait deneme alanında eddy kovaryans ölçüm sistemi kurularak 2009 - 2010 ve 2010 - 2011 gelişme dönemleri için buğday bitkisinin karbondioksit akıları ölçülmüştür. Ölçülen verilere frekans tepki düzeltmeleri, Webb-Pearman-Leuning düzeltmesi ve koordinat düzeltmesi yapılmıştır. Yapılan düzeltmelerden sonra elde edilen verilerden yağış, rüzgar yönü, yetersiz türbülans sebebiyle hatalı kabul edilen veriler atılmış ve eksik veriler uluslararası çalışmalarda kabul görmüş tamamlama yöntemleriyle doldurulmuştur. Bu ölçüm sonuçlarından bitkinin ne kadar karbonu atmosferden aldığını ve ne kadarını atmosfere tekrar geri verdiğini gösteren NEE (Net Ekosistem Değişimi), GPP (Brüt Fotosentez) ve Reco (Ekosistem Solunumu) değerleri hesaplanmıştır. Yapılan çalışma sonucunda kışlık buğdayın toplam NEE, GPP ve Reco değerleri 2009 - 2010 gelişme döneminde sırasıyla - 354. 9, 1142. 2 ve 788. 6 g C m- 2 olarak bulunmuştur. Bu dönem için ortalama günlük GPP 4. 21 g C m- 2, Reco 2. 91 g C m- 2 ve NEE - 1. 31 g C m- 2 olmuştur. 2010 - 2011 gelişme döneminde toplam NEE, GPP ve Reco değerleri sırasıyla - 441. 3 g C m- 2, 1046. 8 g C m- 2 ve 605. 5 g C m- 2 olmuştur. Bu dönem için ortalama günlük NEE, GPP ve Reco değerleri ise sırasıyla - 1. 72 g C m- 2, 4. 09 g C m- 2 ve 2. 37 g C m- 2 ’dir. Bu çalışmada ayrıca karbon akıları ile meteorolojik faktörler ve yine karbon akıları ile vejetasyon dinamikleri (NDVI, LAI, sPRI, biyokütle) arasında ilişki olup olmadığı incelenmiştir. Karbon akıları ile meteorolojik faktörler arasındaki ilişkiler incelendiğinde, özellikle bitkinin fotosentez aktivitesinin arttığı zaman aralığında PPFD ile GPP arasında doğrusal olmayan iyi bir ilişki olduğu görülmektedir. Reco daha çok toprak sıcaklığıyla bağlantılı çıkmıştır. Ayrıca vejetasyon dinamikleri ile karbon akıları arasında da oldukça yüksek belirlilik katsayısına sahip ilişkiler tespit edilmiştir. One of {{the most}} {{important}} research subjects of agricultural meteorology is evaluating the possible effects of agriculture on climate change. Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, especially anthropogenic carbon dioxide, is seen as the most significant reason of global warming. Therefore, determination of the carbon dioxide released to and captured from the atmosphere within the components of global carbon cycle is still being searched by scientists. Terrestrial ecosystems are among the most important components of global carbon cycle on earth because they capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release it to the atmosphere again. Hence, evaluation of the effect of plants in these terrestrial ecosystems on the carbon cycle must be done carefully. Additionally, searching the agricultural activities that affect the amount of captured and released carbon (dioxide) is a scientifically supported issue and long-term flux measurements of different ecosystems are required {{to be able to do}} all related researches. For this reason, flux networks are established to measure carbon dioxide, water vapor and energy fluxes between different terrestrial ecosystems (forests, croplands, grasslands, peat lands etc.) and the atmosphere across five continents. Most of the micrometeorological systems are installed first in forests then in croplands. The amount of micrometeorological tower sites is increasing in order to measure mass and energy fluxes above canopies. In Turkey, there are limited studies about these issues. To fulfill this lack,, changes in carbon dioxide fluxes during the two growing periods of winter wheat were measured and determined in the Thrace Region using a micrometeorological method called Eddy Covariance for the first time in Turkey in the frame of the TÜBİTAK project named “Determination of Carbon Dioxide, Water Vapor and Energy Fluxes for Winter Wheat”. The research field was located at Atatürk Soil Water and Agricultural Meteorology Research Station, Kırklareli. An eddy covariance measurement system that consists of a 3 -dimensional sonic anemometer, open path infrared CO 2 /H 2 O gas analyzer, temperature, humidity sensors and data logger was used to calculate fluxes. Additionally, an <b>agrometeorological</b> <b>station</b> measuring air temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction (at different heights), precipitation, global radiation and photosynthetically active radiation etc. was installed in the research field. Furthermore, spectral measurements have been done periodically. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and scaled photochemical reflectance index (sPRI) have also been calculated from spectral measurements. Additional Leaf area index (LAI) measurements have been done once in a two-week period. General principle of eddy covariance measurements is the covariance between concentration of interest and vertical wind speed in eddies. Eddy covariance is a widely used micrometeorological method to calculate turbulent fluxes within the atmospheric boundary layer. Complexity of the method, high cost of the system, correction issues etc. are some disadvantages of this technique. Moreover; experimental knowledge, micrometeorological and agrometeorological background are needed to apply the method correctly. Being a direct measuring method and having no need to empirical constants are the main advantages of this method. In this study; frequency response corrections, WPL (Webb, Pearman, Leuning) correction and coordinate rotation (tilt correction) have been applied to 10 Hz time series of eddy covariance data after de-spiking. Heavy precipitation and low turbulent exchange conditions affect the eddy covariance measurements so that the system produces bad data. Hence, the data gaps caused by the above conditions must be filled. Here, international standard procedures have been followed. Finally, flux partitioning was done and the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) values were calculated during 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 growth period of winter wheat. NEE is positive (+) when carbon dioxide flux is from winter wheat ecosystem to atmosphere and negative when carbon dioxide flux is from atmosphere to winter wheat ecosystem. In the 2009 - 2010 growth period, winter wheat was planted on 9 October 2009 and harvested on 6 July 2010. The eddy covariance flux measurements showed that cumulative NEE, GPP and Reco were - 354. 9, 1142. 2 and 788. 6 g C m- 2 respectively for the whole growing period. Daily means of NEE, GPP and Reco for the whole growth period are - 1. 31, 4. 21 and 2. 91 g C m- 2, succesively. During the 2010 - 2011 growth period, the crop was sown on 25 October 2010 and harvested on 8 July 2011. For this growth period, cumulative NEE, GPP and Reco have been determined as - 441. 3, 1046. 8 and 605. 5 g C m- 2, respectively. Similarly, succesive daily means of NEE, GPP and Reco for 2010 - 2011 of winter wheat were obtained as - 1. 72, 4. 09 and 2. 37 g C m- 2. A further step was taken by the analysis of possible relationships between winter wheat NEE, GPP and Reco and some meteorological factors such as air temperature, soil temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PPFD). These relationships were examined by taking different winter wheat growing seasons into account. The first period was between sowing and tillering, the second period was between tillering and bolting, whereas the third period was between bolting and flowering and finally the fourth one was between flowering and harvest. In 2009 - 2010 growth period, the highest value of the determination coefficient (r 2 = 0. 7) between GPP and air temperature has been determined for the third period. Determination coefficient between GPP and soil temperature for the third period was also 0. 7. In the other three periods, GPP was less or even not related to air or soil temperature. There were nonlinear relationships between GPP and PPFD during the first (r 2 = 0. 72) and the third periods (r 2 = 0. 6). For the second and the last periods, no significant relationship could be obtained. The results have shown that NEE was not related to air and soil temperature at all. The relationship between NEE and PPFD was the best (r 2 = 0. 82) during the first period. There were strong nonlinear correlations (determination of coefficients are between 0. 89 and 0. 99) between Reco and both air and soil temperatures during the first and the third periods. Similar relationships between carbon fluxes and meteorological factors have also been determined for the 2010 - 2011 winter wheat growth period. However, the relationships are not appreciable when compared with these during the previous growth period. Another goal of this study was to evaluate the possible interactions between cumulative carbon fluxes and vegetation indices (NDVI, sPRI, LAI and biomass). To achieve this, the relationships between cumulative NEE, GPP, Reco and NDVI have been determined for the whole 2009 - 2010 growth period. Determination coefficients were 0. 86 for NEE and Reco and 0. 95 for GPP. Same relationships have been investigated for two separated periods in case of the 2010 - 2011 growth season. The first period was the one during which NDVI is continuously rising whereas NDVI was continuously decreasing in the second period. There were strong nonlinear relationships between cumulative carbon fluxes (NEE, GPP and Reco) and NDVI. The determination coefficients between cumulative GPP and NDVI were 0. 74 when NDVI was continuously rising and 0. 91 when NDVI was continuously decreasing. r 2 values for the correlation between cumulative NEE and NDVI were 0. 7 while NDVI was continuously rising and 0. 99 while NDVI was continuously decreasing. Strong nonlinear relationships have also been found (r 2 values are 0. 79 while NDVI was rising and 0. 997 while NDVI was decreasing) between cumulative Reco and NDVI. Furthermore, it has been found that cumulative carbon fluxes were strongly correlated with LAI both for 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 growing seasons. During the 2009 - 2010 growth season, the coefficients of determination (r 2) between cumulative GPP, NEE, Reco and LAI were 0. 97 for the period in which the LAI values were continuously rising (0 <LAI< 3. 7). The determination coefficients between carbon fluxes and LAI varied from 0. 0. 87 to 0. 98 while LAI values were decreasing. In addition, strong linear correlations have also been specified between all cumulative carbon fluxes and LAI values in 2010 - 2011 growth season. Associations between cumulative carbon fluxes and biomass values have been investigated for the whole growth period. In this context, determination coefficients between cumulative NEE, GPP, Reco and biomass were obtained as 0. 97, 0. 99 and 0. 97, for the 2009 - 2010 growth period, respectively. Also in 2010 - 2011 growth period, strong relationships (0. 93 < r 2 < 0. 97) between cumulative carbon fluxes and biomass values have been determined. The relationships between carbon exchange parameters and sPRI were evaluated by using all the data within the growing period. Consequently, good nonlinear relationships (0. 86 &# 8804; r 2 &# 8804; 0. 87) have been obtained between these parameters. For the whole growth period, a good nonlinear relationship (r 2 = 0. 87) has been obtained between cumulative GPP and sPRI. Consequently, the results of this study showed that carbon exchange parameters of winter wheat plant are affected by many meteorological and environmental factors. Clarification of the effects of these factors by making related studies would enable the researchers to define, explain and model the carbon exchange of winter wheat. Onthe other hand, evaluation of long term eddy covariance measurements is necessary for the reliability of the model results. After that, carbon budget of winter wheat can be estimated for wide areas. In addition to these, it is a clear need to measure and observe fluxes, meteorological factors, vegetation dynamics such as NDVI, sPRI, LAI, biomass for different plant varieties. Modeling by associating the carbon flux measurements with meteorological factors and vegetation dynamics gives the opportunity to use the results for wider areas. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
