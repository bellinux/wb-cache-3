5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E
5|$|The North West Development Agency used a {{compulsory}} <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> to {{take control}} of the main site in 2003. This allowed the Heritage Lottery Fund to give a £7.164M grant towards the restoration of the complex. Together with an additional grant from the North West Development Agency, a £10M regeneration project took place between 2004 and 2006. The project included repair and strengthening of the structure, the restoration of the canal basin, a new roof and windows, and the reinstatement of two missing floors from the Murray Street block.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was {{the headquarters of}} the Manchester Fire Brigade until the brigade was replaced by the Greater Manchester Fire Service in 1974. The fire station closed in 1986, since when it has been largely unused despite several redevelopment proposals. It was placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register in 2001 and in 2010 Manchester City Council served a compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> on the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels. Britannia announced in 2015 their intention to sell the building opening up the possibility of redevelopment after nearly 30 years of dereliction.|$|E

5|$|The club {{succeeded in}} a further legal {{challenge}} bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld {{a decision by}} then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> {{in support of the}} scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate and open. The road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.|$|E

On 8 July 2015, Tottenham announced brand new revised plans, including a larger 61,000 capacity, making it the biggest club stadium in London. The revised stadium design also includes a 17,000 seat single tier stand, the biggest {{of its kind in}} the UK. The new plan also comprises a combination of 579 new homes (increased from the 285 in previous plan), a 180-room hotel, an extreme sports building, a community health centre, enhanced public spaces and 'The Tottenham Experience' - an interactive museum and club shop complex incorporating the listed Warmington House. The anticipated stadium opening date is currently scheduled for the start of the 2018/19 season.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the grounds}} of Kings Weston House, in Bristol, were briefly considered— which then, and until 1969, {{accommodated}} the College's School of Architecture and Building Engineering— the City of Bristol was unable to offer the expanding college an appropriately sized single site. Following discussions between the College Principal and the Director of Education in Bath, an agreement was reached to provide the college with {{a new home in}} Claverton Down, Bath, on a greenfield site, purchased through a compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> from the Candy family of Norwood Farm, overlooking the city.|$|E

25|$|The London Borough of Croydon {{actively}} supported {{an alternative}} proposal, developed {{in partnership with}} property company Arrowcroft, which would involve {{the construction of a}} 12,500-seat indoor arena, named the Croydon Arena, as well as 59,234 m² of offices and 874 homes—including affordable housing. Unlike the Stanhope scheme, this proposal received the full backing from Croydon Council, then went to a public inquiry after being 'called in' by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. It also required compulsory purchase of the site. The Council made a Compulsory <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> to assemble the land required and the objections to which were considered at the same public inquiry. The public inquiry took place between September and November 2007. The Secretary of State rejected the CPO and Planning Permission in July 2008.|$|E

Swale Borough Council were also reported as backing the scheme. At a full meeting of Swale Borough Council on 17 September, General Manager Tony James's speech resulted in the council unanimously voting to support the railway in its fight to survive. Mr James accredited the Heritage Railway Association as influencing {{the decision of the}} council by their actions in giving the award. On 21 September, the railway was visited by Baron Faulkner, chairman of the Railway Heritage Committee, a statutory body which oversees the preservation of railway artefacts in the United Kingdom. Lord Faulkner has asked that the railway write to the Secretary of State for Transport in a bid for powers to gain a Compulsory <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> which will enable the railway to buy the trackbed.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 {{the long}} {{wait for a}} victory in a final ended at last, with the club lifting the West Of Scotland Cup after a replay against Vale of Clyde. The club was also forced to move home in 1936 when the Glasgow Corporation {{exercised}} a compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> on Barrowfield Park in order to construct a new housing scheme (also called Barrowfield) on the land. Waverley identified a new site at Westthorn on the boundary of Parkhead, Dalmarnock and Braidfauld adjacent to Belvidere Hospital. This ground was named New Barrowfield, meaning there were three different football venues known by that name, albeit the others no longer existed. The move brought the club into even closer proximity with Strathclyde (whose Springfield Park ground {{was on the other}} side of the hospital) and Parkhead (whose Helenslea Park was just yards away across London Road). Parkhead Stadium railway station was nearby.|$|E

[...] The family, which still owned {{the buildings and}} the land, drew up plans to replace the four villas and the gatekeepers' cottages with flats. [...] These were intended for private ownership; but council housing was so scarce in Brighton at the time (1945) that Brighton Borough Council bought the land using a compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> and redeveloped it with council flats based on the family's designs. The new flats, built in the early 1950s, were large and well-built, and the old gardens were retained. [...] At first, no young children were allowed to live there, and only higher earning council tenants could apply.|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, Argent, {{developers}} proposed leasing {{the building}} from Britannia Hotels to {{transform it into}} a music and arts venue. Manchester City Council backed the plans and refused to rule out a compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> (CPO) if the owner did not act to redevelop the building. Britannia Hotels branded Argent's plans [...] "unworkable" [...] and proposed turning the building into a company headquarters, 200-bed hotel, and fire station museum. A planning application was promised by March 2006, but by May none had been made. Work {{was carried out by}} February 2007 to make the building watertight and in autumn 2007 a proposal was made by Britannia to convert the building into a hotel.|$|E
500|$|In September 2016 Lewisham Council {{approved}} a compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> (CPO) of land surrounding The Den rented by Millwall, {{as part of}} a major redevelopment of the [...] "New Bermondsey" [...] area. The plans were controversial because the developer, Renewal, is controlled by offshore companies with unclear ownership, and is seen by the club and local community to be profiteering by demolishing existing homes and businesses as well as Millwall's car-park and the Millwall Community Trust facility to build up to 2,400 new private homes, with no social housing. The club contemplated the possibility of having to relocate to Kent. Millwall had submitted their own plans for regeneration centred around the club itself, but the council voted in favour of Renewal's plans.|$|E
