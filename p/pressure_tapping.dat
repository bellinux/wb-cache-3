50|$|Overall {{pressure}} loss across different pressure meters using a Venturi tube to measure flow causes a {{pressure drop in}} the flow which is partly recovered downstream of the meter. In dry gas flows the recovery is greater than in wet gas flows due to the liquid component. This difference can be exploited to provide a measurement for the liquid fraction.

40|$|The {{present study}} explores a novel design of cone {{flowmeter}} for bi-directional flow metering application. Two identical cone shapes are machined with their base circle surfaces joined {{together with a}} small step in between them and differential pressure measurement is done across {{the apex of the}} cones. The bidirectional cone flowmeter is tested under fully developed flow conditions and its performance under double 90 degrees bend (out-of-plane) is also evaluated. The bi-directional cone flowmeter is tested in a circular pipe (inside diameter of 101 mm) with water as the working medium for the flow Reynolds number ranging from 1. 18 x 10 (5) to 5. 48 x 10 (5). Influence of the half cone angle (alpha) and the location of static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> on the coefficient of discharge (C-d) of a cone flowmeter are studied. Two cones with half cone angles alpha= 30 degrees and alpha= 45 degrees with a constant constriction ratio (beta) of 0. 75 are studied. Static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> are located {{on both sides of the}} bi-directional cone. Two sets of locations of static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> are studied. First set includes two static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> on the pipe wall in the planes of apexes of the bi-directional cone-called apex taps. Second set includes <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> on the pipe wall in the planes at a distance D/ 4 away from the apexes of the bi-directional cone-called D/ 4 taps. Double 90 degrees bend (out-ofplane) is placed at 1. 5 D, 5. 5 D, 9. 5 D and 13. 5 D upstream to the bi-directional cone flowmeter. It is observed that the apex static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> located in the plane of apexes of the bi-directional cone result in statistically consistent coefficient of discharge for all Reynolds numbers covered in this study. The results suggest that the bi-directional cone flowmeter is insensitive to the swirl created by double 90 degrees bend (out-of-plane) placed at the upstream of cone flowmeter, if placed at a distance of 9. 5 D or more.

Pressure measurements were also performed using a <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> located on the side wall of the test section slightly upstream of the windows. Though the pressure measurements and the LV measurements were not taken at exactly the same location, extrapolation of the pressure data into the location of the LV measurements indicated a very close agreement between the velocity values obtained using the two different methods.

A closer look onto the pressure distribution of a blunt body reveals that only the front part of a probe is subject to the constraint while base pressure is not affected.

40|$|Acquiring {{pressure}} maps of aerodynamic surfaces is {{very important}} for improving and validating the performance of aerospace vehicles. Traditional pressure measurements are taken with <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> embedded in the model surface that are connected to transducers. While <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> allow highly accurate measurements to be acquired, they do have several drawbacks. <b>Pressure</b> <b>taps</b> do not give good spatial resolution due to the need for individual pressure tubes, compounded by limited space available inside models. Also, building a model proves very costly if taps are needed because of the large amount of labor necessary to drill, connect and test each one. The typical cost to install one tap is about $ 200. Recently, a new method for measuring pressure on aerodynamic surfaces has been developed utilizing a technology known as pressure sensitive paints (PSP). Using PSP, pressure distributions can be acquired optically with high spatial resolution and simple model preparation. Flow structures can be easily visualized using PSP, but are missed using low spatial resolution arrays of <b>pressure</b> <b>taps.</b> PSP even allows pressure distributions to be found on rotating machinery where previously this has been extremely difficult or even impossible.

Experiments at low Reynolds {{numbers were}} {{performed}} on a <b>pressure</b> <b>tapped</b> NACA 2313 wing in a 3 x 2 x 9 meter wind tunnel under nominally smooth (Ti = 1. 2 %) and turbulent (Ti = 7. 2 %) flows at a mean flow velocity of 8 ms- 1 (Re ≈ 120, 000). The NACA 2313 wing is a replica of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) wing of the Flash 3 D aircraft used at RMIT University for research purposes. Unsteady surface pressures were measured to understand if the information could be adopted for resolving turbulence-induced perturbations and to furthermore {{use it in a}} turbulence mitigation system. Two span-wise locations of chord-wise pressure were acquired when tested under the two different flow conditions. It was discovered that at both span-wise locations, a local Coefficient of Pressure (Cp) held high correlation to the chord-wise Cp integration and allowed for a linear relationship to be formed between the two variables. The defined relationship provided a 95 % confidence for angles of attack below stall and was used to estimate the integrated chord-wise pressure coefficient at a particular span wise location. The relationship between a single <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> and the integrated Cp of that chord-wise section was valid for the two different span-wise locations with similar defining equations. As one <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> is sufficient to adequately estimate the integrated Cp on a chord-wise wing section, a limited amount of <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> across the wings span approximates the pressure distribution across the span and eventually approximates the flight perturbations.
