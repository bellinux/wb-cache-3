The distribution area {{is limited to the}} mountains of central and south regions of Europa; in Italy this plant is found in the Alps and central Apennines. A few number of studies refer to the biologically active components isolated from H. richeri, but, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report on the GC-MS detemination of the essental oil composition of this plant. Fresh plant material was subjected to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h yielding 0. 08 % of a yellowish oil. The oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored in sealed vials under refrigeration prior to analysis. The essential oil composition of aerial parts of H. richeri from Italy was analysed by GC and GC-MS. Fifty-one components of the essential oil were identified, representing 98. 5 % of the oil. The most abundant components were (Z) [...] ocimene (19. 5 %), n-nonane (13. 8 %), -bisabolene (8. 7 %), and (E) [...] ocimene (8. 0 %). Other compounds: 2. 6 -dimethyl heptane, 2 -methyl octane, 2 -methyl- 4 -heptanone, -pinene, -pinene, sabinene, -myrcene, limonene, 1. 8 -cineole, p-cymene, 2, 3. 5 -trimethyl decane, <b>pentyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> (E) -thujone, -ylangene, -copaene, linalool, -funebrene, -caryophyllene, terpinen- 4 -ol, -himachalene, -guaiene, trans-pinocarveol, allo-aromadendrene, germacrene, -terpineol, verbenone, valencene, -muurolene, -cadinene, myrtenol, -calacorene, (Z) -nerolidol, caryophyllene oxide, humulene epoxide-l, (E) -nerolidol, viridiflorol, globulol epi [...] cadinol, spathulenol, epi [...] muurulol, thymol, -cadinol, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, n-hexacosane, trans-phytol, and hexadecanoic acid...|$|E
40|$|Chemical group 1 (CG 1) {{consists}} of straight-chain primary aliphatic alcohols/aldehydes/acids, acetals and esters with esters containing saturated alcohols and acetals containing saturated aldehydes of which 86 are currently authorised {{for use as}} flavours in food. The FEEDAP Panel was unable to perform an assessment of ethyl oleate because of its insufficient purity. The following compounds {{are considered to be}} safe for all animal species at the use level proposed for feed flavourings: formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, oleic acid, decanol, dodecanol, decyl acetate and dodecyl acetate. The remaining substances are considered safe for all animal species at 5 mg/kg complete feed (with a margin of safety between 1 and 120) and at 25 mg/kg complete feed (ethyl acetate and hexyl acetate, with a margin of safety between 2 and 6); and at 1 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry and 1. 5 mg/kg complete feed for all other species (ethylacrylate, ethyl hex- 3 -enoate, ethyl trans- 2 -butenoate, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl isovalerate, butyl isovalerate, methyl isovalerate, hexyl isobutyrate, methyl 2 -methyl butyrate, <b>pentyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> butyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl isovalerate, ethyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl 2 -methyl butyrate and methyl 2 -methylvalerate). No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 1 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. The FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat all compounds under assessment as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract and as skin sensitizers. No risk for the safety for the environment is foreseen. Since all 85 compounds are used in food as flavourings, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
