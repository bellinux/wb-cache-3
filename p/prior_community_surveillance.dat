An exploratory content analysis of these videos allowed for identification of themes in police conduct and police portrayal. Trends in <b>community</b> <b>surveillance,</b> including bystander conduct and influence, have also been identified. Interview research was conducted with four Canadian police officers to compliment previous findings. Interview participants established that Canadian police officers have similar perspectives towards <b>community</b> <b>surveillance</b> and social media. Finally, statistical analysis of YouTube video data allowed for the exploration of viewer reception to videos in the sample. This multi-methodical research surrounding the topic of <b>community</b> <b>surveillance</b> of police-citizen encounters allows for an extensive understanding of Canadian police portrayal in YouTube, and how <b>community</b> <b>surveillance,</b> bystander influences, and social media impact the field of policing...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} effect of a {{programme}} of postoperative <b>community</b> <b>surveillance</b> on the rate of detection of wound complications after operation for inguinal hernia. DESIGN [...] Prospective audit of wound complications including complications recorded in case notes and those discovered by <b>community</b> <b>surveillance.</b> SETTING [...] Academic surgical unit of three consultant surgeons. PATIENTS [...] 510 patients undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair between June 1985 and August 1989. RESULTS [...] The wound infection rate recorded in the hospital notes was 3 % compared with 9 % when additional information was obtained from <b>community</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Wound complications were detected in 143 (28 %) patients by <b>community</b> <b>surveillance</b> compared with a complication rate of 7 % in the case records for the same patients.

Complication rates are a reflection not only of the standards of surgical practice but also the rigour with which they are sought.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{attempts to}} unravel competing explanations of collabora-tive leadership styles of state legislative committee chairs. Specifically, the paper considers {{the influence of}} community or volunteer experience, gender, and institutional variables. The data show that women chairs {{are more likely than}} their male peers to cite as valuable the leadership skills and experiences that they gain through community and volunteer expe-rience. Compared to their male colleagues, women committee chairs on average also report a greater reliance on collaborative strategies in the management of their committees. <b>Prior</b> <b>community</b> or volunteer experi-ence has little or no direct effect on collaborative styles.

40|$|Abstract Background Pharmacologic {{treatments}} are efficacious in reducing post-myocardial infarction (MI) morbidity and mortality. The potential influence of socioeconomic factors on {{the receipt of}} pharmacologic therapy has not been systematically examined, even though healthcare utilization likely influences morbidity and mortality post-MI. This study aims to investigate the association between socioeconomic factors and receipt of evidence-based treatments post-MI in a <b>community</b> <b>surveillance</b> setting. Methods We evaluated the association of census tract-level neighborhood household income (nINC) and Medicaid coverage with pharmacologic treatments (aspirin, beta [β]-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors; optimal therapy, defined as receipt {{of two or more}} treatments) received during hospitalization or at discharge among 9, 608 MI events in the ARIC <b>community</b> <b>surveillance</b> study (1993 - 2002). Prevalence ratios (PR, 95 % CI), adjusted for the clustering of hospitalized MI events within census tracts and within patients, were estimated using Poisson regression. Results Seventy-eight percent of patients received optimal therapy. Low nINC was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving β-blockers (0. 93, 0. 87 - 0. 98) and a higher likelihood of receiving ACE inhibitors (1. 13, 1. 04 - 1. 22), compared to high nINC. Patients with Medicaid coverage were less likely to receive aspirin (0. 92, 0. 87 - 0. 98), compared to patients without Medicaid coverage. These findings were independent of other key covariates. Conclusions nINC and Medicaid coverage may be two of several socioeconomic factors influencing the complexities of medical care practice patterns. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The term HbA 1 c (glycated haemoglobin) is {{commonly}} used in relation to diabetes mellitus. The measure gives {{an indication of the}} average blood sugar levels over a period of weeks or months prior to testing. For most low- and middle-income countries HbA 1 c measurement in <b>community</b> <b>surveillance</b> is prohibitively expensive. A question arises about the possibility of using a single blood glucose measure for estimating HbA 1 c and therefore identifying poor glycaemic control in resource-poor settings. Design: Using data from the 2011 – 2012 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, we examined the relationship between HbA 1 c and a single fasting measure of blood glucose in a non-clinical population of people with known diabetes (n= 333). A linear equation for estimating HbA 1 c from blood glucose was developed. Appropriate blood glucose cut-off values were set for poor glycaemic control (HbA 1 c≥ 69. 4 mmol/mol). Results: The HbA 1 c and blood glucose measures were well correlated (r= 0. 7). Three blood glucose cut-off values were considered for classifying poor glycaemic control: 8. 0, 8. 9, and 11. 4 mmol/L. A blood glucose of 11. 4 had a specificity of 1, but poor sensitivity (0. 37); 8. 9 had high specificity (0. 94) and moderate sensitivity (0. 7); 8. 0 was associated with good specificity (0. 81) and sensitivity (0. 75). Conclusions: Where HbA 1 c measurement is too expensive for <b>community</b> <b>surveillance,</b> a single blood glucose measure may be a reasonable alternative. Generalising the specific results from these US data to low resource settings may not be appropriate, but the general approach is worthy of further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, {{the first}} choice for {{uncomplicated}} falciparum malaria in Africa, exerts strong selection pressure for resistance because of its slow elimination. It is likely that resistance will emerge rapidly, {{and there is no}} widely affordable replacement. Chlorproguanil-dapsone is cheap, rapidly eliminated, more potent than pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, and could be introduced in the near future to delay the onset of antifolate resistance and as "salvage therapy" for pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine failure. A total of 448 children were randomly allocated (double blind) to either a single dose of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine or to one of two chlorproguanil-dapsone regimens: a single dose or three doses at 24 -h intervals. Reinfections are clinically indistinguishable from recrudescence and are more likely after treatment with rapidly eliminated drugs; we measured the incidence of parasitemia in 205 initially aparasitemic children to allow comparison with the three treatment groups. The patients and a <b>community</b> <b>surveillance</b> group were followed up for 28 days. At the study end point, 31. 2 % (95 % confidence interval, 24. 9 - 38. 0) of the <b>community</b> <b>surveillance</b> group subjects were parasitemic, compared with subjects in the treatment groups, whose rates of parasitemia were 40. 8 % (32. 9 - 49. 0; relative risk [RR], 1. 31 [0. 99 - 1. 73]) after triple-dose chlorproguanil-dapsone, 19. 7 % (13. 5 - 27. 2; RR, 0. 63 [0. 43 - 0. 93]) after pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, and 65. 6 % (57. 5 - 73. 0; RR, 2. 10 [1. 66 - 2. 65]) after single-dose chlorproguanil-dapsone. Pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine and triple-dose chlorproguanil-dapsone were effective treatments. Pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine provided chemoprophylaxis during follow-up because of its slow elimination. Triple-dose chlorproguanil-dapsone should now be developed in an attempt to reduce the rate of emergence of antifolate resistance in Africa and for affordable salvage therapy in cases of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine failure...|$|R
