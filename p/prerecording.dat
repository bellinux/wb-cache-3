25|$|Pardo {{nominally}} {{retired from}} NBC in 2004. However, {{he continued to}} announce for Saturday Night Live {{at the behest of}} executive producer Lorne Michaels, initially under the assumption that a permanent replacement would be found quickly. In 2006, he began <b>prerecording</b> his announcements from a studio in his Arizona home. That arrangement lasted only a few episodes before producers insisted that they needed him in Studio 8H, and he resumed weekly flights to New York. On Saturday, February 23, 2008, Pardo appeared at the closing of Saturday Night Live to blow out the candles of his 90th birthday cake. During this period, Pardo missed approximately five episodes due to illness; cast member Darrell Hammond (who would be Pardo's successor following his death) filled in for him but was uncredited.|$|E
2500|$|... an {{enormous}} advantage in <b>prerecording</b> his radio shows. The scheduling {{could now be}} done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Phil Harris, and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 February 2006, Pavarotti sang [...] "Nessun dorma" [...] at the 2006 Winter Olympics opening {{ceremony}} in Turin, Italy, at his final performance. In the last {{act of the}} {{opening ceremony}}, his performance received the longest and loudest ovation of the night from the international crowd. Leone Magiera, who directed the performance, revealed in his 2008 memoirs, Pavarotti Visto da Vicino, that the performance had been recorded weeks earlier. [...] "The orchestra pretended {{to play for the}} audience, I pretended to conduct and Luciano pretended to sing. The effect was wonderful," [...] he wrote. Pavarotti's manager, Terri Robson, said that the tenor had turned the Winter Olympic Committee's invitation down several times because it would have been impossible to sing late at night in the subzero conditions of Turin in February. The committee eventually persuaded him to take part by <b>prerecording</b> the song.|$|E

2500|$|You Bet Your Life {{debuted in}} October 1947 on ABC radio (which aired it from 1947 to 1949), {{sponsored}} by costume jewelry manufacturer Allen Gellman; {{and then on}} CBS (1949–50), and finally NBC, continuing until May 1961—on radio only, 1947–1950; on both radio and television, 1950–1960; and on television only, 1960–1961. The show proved a huge hit, {{being one of the}} most popular on television by the mid-1950s. With George Fenneman as his announcer and straight man, Groucho entertained his audiences with improvised conversation with his guests. Since You Bet Your Life was mostly ad-libbed and unscripted—although writers did pre-interview the guests and feed Groucho ready-made lines in advance—the producers insisted that the network prerecord it (instead of it being broadcast live). There were two reasons for this: <b>prerecording</b> provided Groucho with time to fish around for funny exchanges and any intervening dead spots to be edited out; and secondly to protect the network, since Groucho was a notorious loose cannon and known to say almost anything. The television show ran for 11 successful seasons until it was canceled in 1961. Automobile marque DeSoto was a longtime major sponsor. For the DeSoto ads Marx would sometimes say: [...] "Tell 'em Groucho sent you", or [...] "Try a DeSoto before you decide".|$|E

50|$|Audio {{recording}} technology {{continued to}} evolve, {{making it easier}} to record and replay sound. As this happened, the more commonly used and harder-to-replicate sound effects were pre-recorded to make them more accessible. <b>Prerecording</b> also allowed the same sound effect to be used many times.|$|E
50|$|An {{animated}} sketch {{that first}} appeared on the show, The Ambiguously Gay Duo, featuring the voices of Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell, became well known on SNL after Carvey's show was canceled.

Whilst Underground was being broadcast, a key actor suddenly collapsed and died.

The announcers include Kingsley McLaren, Sue Harland, Gabriela Guinea-Johnston (chief Spanish announcer) and Gordon Brown. Most of the programming is automated, with the announcers <b>prerecording</b> their identifications of titles, artists and composers. At midnight each day, El Himno Nacional Mexicano (The Mexican National Anthem) is played.|$|E
5000|$|Strictly speaking, voice-tracking {{refers to}} the process of a disc jockey <b>prerecording</b> his or her on-air [...] "patter". It is then {{combined}} with songs, commercials, and other elements in order to produce a product that sounds like a live air shift. Voice-tracking has become common on many music radio stations, particularly during evening, overnight, weekend, and holiday time periods. It is seen by most radio station owners as an economical alternative to employing live disc jockeys around the clock.|$|E

50|$|A voice actor's role in anime {{consists}} {{of reading the}} lines before the production is finished. In Japan, the lines are usually performed before the anime has completed. The artist then draws in every expression to the key of the voice actors reading it off. This {{is the most common}} way of <b>prerecording</b> in Japan. Young voice actors are used in both the anime and OVAs. However, in fan-oriented productions and products they use voice actors because voice actors are often used as a selling point.|$|E
5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} of recording {{first is that}} the public may know the outcome of an event from another source, which may be a [...] "spoiler". In addition, <b>prerecording</b> prevents live radio announcers from deviating from an officially approved script, as occurred with propaganda broadcasts from Germany in the 1940s and with Radio Moscow in the 1980s. Many events are advertised as being live, although they are often [...] "recorded live" [...] (sometimes called [...] "live-to-tape"). This is particularly true of performances of musical artists on radio when they visit for an in-studio concert performance. Similar situations have occurred in television production ("The Cosby Show is recorded in front of a live television studio audience") and news broadcasting.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Golden Age, American radio network programs were almost exclusively broadcast live, as the national networks prohibited the airing of recorded programs until the late 1940s because of the inferior sound quality of phonograph discs, the only practical recording medium. As a result, prime-time shows would be performed twice, once for each coast. However, [...] "reference recordings" [...] were made of many programs as they were being broadcast, for review by the sponsor and for the network's own archival purposes. With the development of high-fidelity magnetic wire and tape recording in the years following World War II, the networks became more open to airing recorded programs and the <b>prerecording</b> of shows became more common.|$|E
