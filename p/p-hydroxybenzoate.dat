40|$|The {{solubilities}} of an {{homologous series}} of compounds (alkyl <b>p-hydroxybenzoates)</b> were measured in hexane and water at 298 K. The hexane solubilities followed {{a trend that}} could be predicted by the melting points, but the aqueous solubilities showed a linear decrease with increasing alkyl chain length, until the chain was over 4 carbon units long, then {{the effect of adding}} extra methylene groups was significantly lower. With both solvents the effect on solubility was small after the chain exceeded 5 (+/- 1) carbon units in length. This phenomenon is explained on the basis that the side chain has greater rotational freedom about C-C bonds as it extends beyond five carbons. The freedom of movement will potentially influence the crystal packing (due to the increased possibility for different orientations and conformations) and hence the hexane solubility results, and the orientation of the molecules that are to be dispersed in the solvent (thus the aqueous solubility). Chain lengths of 2 - 5 showed no significant variation in aqueous contact angle for the powders. The contact angle did increase slightly above a chain length of 6 carbons. The results indicate that the crystal packing is influenced by chain length and that for chain lengths up to five carbons, the chain is not all present in the crystal surface (no increase in contact angles). For wettability and solubility there is a critical point at a chain length of 5 (+/- 1) carbons where the physical properties of the alkyl <b>p-hydroxybenzoates</b> change.

40|$|This {{proposal}} is {{to investigate the}} application of dual-site phase-transfer catalyst tosynthesize hydroxybenzoates via ultrasound-assisted phase transfer catalysis with the third orthird-liquid phase in a batch reactor or continuous-flow reactor. The formation of thethird-liquid or third phase and the catalytic activity of dual-site phase-transfer catalyst underultrasonic irradiation, reaction mechanism, and kinetics will be explored. The purpose of this{{proposal is}} to setup the green process of ultrasound-assisted dual-site phase-transfer catalysis,which behaves high product yield and is an environmentally benign technology without usinghalide-containing solvents. Phase transfer catalysts have been employed to enhance the reaction of immisciblereactants under mild conditions with high conversion and high product selectivity. If amolecule of catalyst contains dual sites, {{it can be used}} to increase the reaction rate more andmore. Thus it is valuable to change the traditional manufacturing method into a phase-transfercatalyzed esterification processes with third phase which is highly concentrated in a separatephase and can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction mixture. The ultrasoundtechnology has been proved to greatly enhance the rate of chemical reaction and product yield. Hence, this proposal is willing to explore the activity of dual-site phase transfer catalysts intri-phase system under ultrasonic irradiation. It is expected to develop the related theory ofphase transfer catalysis and interfacial catalysis. The benzoates are widely used as flavoring agents, perfumery, lacquers and solvent forcellulose derivatives, and as an additive in liquid crystal materials. <b>p-Hydroxybenzoates</b> areused in perfumery, sunscreeing agent, etc. In the past, the manufacturing processes forsubstituted benzoates were to conduct esterification reaction with the corresponding alcoholsin the presence of sulfuric acid, and having the disadvantages of severe reaction conditions,slow reaction rates, and low yields due to reversible reactions and hydrolysis side recations. Moreover, the materials of reactors should be specially considered due to the use of sulfuricacid. Those drawbacks can be overcome by applying phase-transfer catalyzed esterificationprocesses. This proposal is the extended work of the last project and is willing to be completedwithin two years. The goal and items done are as follows. For the first year, the formation ofthe third-liquid or the third phase by the novel dual-site phase-transfer catalyst will beexplored. Effects on the third phase formation investigated will include the aqueous reactant,inorganic salt, dual-site PTC and reaction conditions, etc. the reactivity of dual-site PTC withthe organic reactant and the distribution of the catalytic intermediate between the tri-phases,the interfacial reaction mechanism and kinetics of the overall reaction under ultrasoundirradiation. The kinetic model is also developed to describe the interfacial reactions intri-phase system. For the second year, a continuous flow reactor system with ultrasoundirradiation will be set-up and employed to investigate the catalytic activity of dual-sitephase-transfer catalyst, reaction mechanism, catalyst distribution, and the effect of ultrasound,etc. The system model for the continuous flow reactor in tri-phases will be developed.

40|$|The key {{precursors}} for <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> production by engineered Pseudomonas putida S 12 are phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose- 4 -phosphate (E 4 P), {{for which the}} pentose phosphate (PP) pathway is an important source. Since PP pathway fluxes are typically low in pseudomonads, E 4 P and PEP availability is a likely bottleneck for aromatics production which may be alleviated by stimulating PP pathway fluxes via co-feeding of pentoses in addition to glucose or glycerol. As P. putida S 12 lacks the natural ability to utilize xylose, the xylose isomerase pathway from E. coli was introduced into the <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> producing strain P. putida S 12 palB 2. The initially inefficient xylose utilization was improved by evolutionary selection after which the <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> production was evaluated. Even without xylose-co-feeding, <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> production was improved in the evolved xylose-utilizing strain, which may indicate an intrinsically elevated PP pathway activity. Xylose co-feeding further improved the <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> yield when co-fed with either glucose or glycerol, up to 16. 3  Cmol% (0. 1  g p-hydroxybenzoate/g substrate). The yield improvements were most pronounced with glycerol, which probably related to {{the availability of the}} PEP precursor glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate (GAP). Thus, it was demonstrated that the production of aromatics such as <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> can be improved by co-feeding different carbon sources via different and partially artificial pathways. Moreover, this approach opens new perspectives for the efficient production of (fine) chemicals from renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulose that typically has a high content of both glucose and xylose and (crude) glycerol...|$|E
40|$|A gene, fdxP, was {{identified}} upstream of the rrnA gene in Caulobacter crescentus and shown to encode ferredoxin II (FdII) by insertional inactivation. FdII is homologous {{to a class}} of [2 Fe- 2 S] ferredoxins typified by putidaredoxin. Furthermore, reconstitution assays demonstrated that FdII was able to promote <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> hydroxylase activity in ferredoxin-depleted extracts. Thus, biodegradation of <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> may be ferredoxin dependent in C. crescentus...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} various topical anesthetics and their {{preservatives}} {{on the growth}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphyloccoccus albus, and Candida albicans was investigated. The topical anesthetics were proparacaine HCl, tetracaine HCl, cocaine HCl, and benoxinate HCl. The preservatives were chlorobutanol and butyl <b>p-hydroxybenzoate.</b> Proparacaine inhibited C. albicans but not P. aeruginosa or S. albus. All three test organisms were inhibited to varying degrees by tetracaine, benoxinate, cocaine, chlorobutanol, and butyl <b>p-hydroxybenzoate...</b>|$|E
