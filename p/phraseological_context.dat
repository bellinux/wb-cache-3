40|$|Purpose This paper {{wants to}} propose a system {{architecture}} for a context-sensitive terminology management system (TMS) {{in the domain of}} legal LSP. The TMS is expected {{to meet the needs of}} the translation services in the Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice in that our TMS will allow to search, (re) use and edit each term in its customized archetypical <b>phraseological</b> <b>context.</b> In a second part, we propose to link this TMS to EN 15038, the EU standard on Translation Services, which has been developed to streamline translation projects aiming to deliver more efficient multilingual LSP documentation. Method In a first step, automatic knowledge acquisition algorithms will be developed to mine context-sensitive terminological information from the online corpora of legal translations. In a second step, a feed-back loop between interface developers and expert users will be set up to optimize user access to the contextualized terminological knowledge base during the actual translation process. To meet these requirements, there will be an intense co-operation between terminologists, the developers of the knowledge extraction algorithms, database and software engineers, and expert users. Results The TMS is expected to display an interface offering the look-and-feel of a standard desktop CAT-tool. The actual application will run remotely on a server in a cloud-based architecture which will be available via an online interface. As a collaborative working environment, the tool will allow extensive and real-time interactive user management. Conclusion This paper analyses the challenges legal translators are facing in the Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice. At present, translation-oriented authoring and translation proper of legal documentation are being carried out on an ad-hoc basis. An R&D project has been set up to design a TMS which is expected to deliver correct and consistent legal terminology and collocations in both source and target languages. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTranslation of phraseological units is topical for the {{contemporary}} translatology nowadays. According to many outstanding specialists, phraseological units are lexical combinations, {{the meaning of}} which {{is defined by the}} whole expression. The most distinctive feature of phraseological unit is its emotional expressiveness and conciseness of thought expression. Fairly often, phraseological units are functioning in the newspaper style. It should be noted that phraseological units are very often transformed into “stock phrases”. Defining phraseological units in the text and the ability to find an equivalent to it during the translation process is the most important stage for the translat or. In order to translate a phraseological unit, the translator should use <b>phraseological</b> dictionaries and <b>context</b> plays an important role during the translation process. In conclusion {{it should be noted that}} phraseological units reflect culture and a national mentality of a definite nation. Due to this reason, translation of phraseological units is one of the topical issues for {{the contemporary}} translatology. Phraseological units are an integral part of any language or culture and knowing these units and appropriate interpretation of them is an evidence of appropriate translation of the whole expression or a work of art...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{treatment}} given to phraseological {{units in the}} teaching/learning of Italian as a foreign language. For this purpose, some textbooks of Italian based on the CEFR were analysed to determine when, how and in what <b>contexts</b> <b>phraseological</b> units are introduced and studied, and to determine {{to what extent the}} selected textbooks represent an effective support in the process of teaching/learning Italian as a foreign language. Because of their characteristics, phraseological units represent a stumbling-block for non-native speakers, especially if their L 1 {{is not one of the}} Romance Languages. Until the advent of the communicative approach – but also later – phraseology received only little attention in the teaching and learning of foreign languages; it was assumed that a student would develop a phraseological competence through imitation, and it seemed that phraseological units were to be treated only at higher levels of language proficiency. On the contrary, as many recent studies convincingly suggest, phraseological units should be systematically and explicitly taught/learnt from  level A 1 on.   In the CEFR phraseological units are presented as an important element of lexical competence, while they are mostly neglected in the level descriptors. This approach seems to leave no objective criteria for textbook authors who consider whether and how to incorporate phraseology in their textbooks...|$|R
