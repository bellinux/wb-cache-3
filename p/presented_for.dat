40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if men with malignancy have increased sperm DNA fragmentation compared with men <b>presenting</b> <b>for</b> sperm donation. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: Tertiary-level fertility center. Patient(s) : Eighty-nine men with cancer <b>presenting</b> <b>for</b> prophylactic semen cryopreservation and 35 men <b>presenting</b> <b>for</b> sperm donation. Intervention(s) : None. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) measured by sperm chromatin assay. Result(s) : The mean sperm DFI in {{men with a}} diagnosis of cancer, 9. 88 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 7. 84 %- 12. 44 %), {{did not differ from}} that found in men <b>presenting</b> <b>for</b> sperm donation 10. 46 % (95 % CI 8. 68 %- 11. 80 %). There {{were no significant differences in}} mean sperm DFI within cancer subgroups or when comparing testicular and nontesticular cancers. Subgroup analysis lacked statistical power. Men with testicular cancer have significantly reduced sperm concentration compared with both control subjects and men with nontesticular cancer. Conclusion(s) : In our study population there was no difference in sperm DFI between men undergoing prophylactic semen cryopreservation and men <b>presenting</b> <b>for</b> sperm donation. Sperm DFI assessment has limited utility in the routine evaluation of men <b>presenting</b> <b>for</b> semen cryopreservation...|$|R
40|$|We {{asked whether}} wolf re-colonization would {{facilitate}} increased growth and reproduction of three browse-sensitive plant species. We hypothesized plant {{size and the}} proportion of reproductive individuals would be lowest in areas with no wolves, intermediate where wolves had been <b>present</b> <b>for</b> 4 - 6 years, and highest where wolves had been <b>present</b> <b>for</b> 12 - 13 years. Two plant species exhibited significantly greater reproduction where wolves were <b>present</b> <b>for</b> 12 - 13 years. Mean leaf size of indicator plants was significantly greater in areas where wolves were <b>present</b> <b>for</b> 12 - 13 years, as compared with that in areas where wolves were not present or were <b>present</b> <b>for</b> 4 - 6 years, but the effect size appears small. While the return of wolves to this region is likely to benefit browse-sensitive plant species, our findings suggest that wolf recovery will not generate atrophic cascade of sufficient magnitude to halt or reverse the loss of plant diversity in the Great Lakes region in the near term...|$|R
