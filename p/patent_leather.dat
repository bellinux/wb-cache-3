5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the <b>Patent</b> <b>Leather</b> Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The <b>Patent</b> <b>Leather</b> Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E
5|$|Pflueger, {{who started}} as a working-class {{draftsman}} and never went to college, established his imprint {{on the development of}} Art Deco in California architecture yet demonstrated facility in many styles including Streamline Moderne, neo-Mayan, Beaux-Arts, Mission Revival, Neoclassical and International. His work as an interior designer resulted in an array of influential interior spaces, including luxurious cocktail lounges such as the Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, the <b>Patent</b> <b>Leather</b> Bar at the St. Francis Hotel and the Cirque Room at The Fairmont, three of the most successful San Francisco bars in their day.|$|E

5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the <b>Patent</b> <b>Leather</b> Bar, in 1939.|$|E

25|$|Ballroom shoes {{fall into}} two categories: Ballroom and Latin American. Both are characterised by suede soles. Men's ballroom shoes are {{typically}} lace-ups with one-inch heels and <b>patent</b> <b>leather</b> uppers. Ladies' ballroom shoes are typically court shoes with two-inch heels, made of fabric that can be colored to match the dancer's dress. In contrast to the low Ballroom heel, which evenly distributes weight across the foot, Latin American shoes have higher heels designed to shift weight onto the toes. Latin shoes are also more flexible than ballroom shoes. Men's Latin shoes typically have 1.5- to 2-inch high, shaped heels, while Ladies' Latin shoes have 2,5-inch to 3-inch heels. Ladies shoes are typically open-toed and strapped.|$|E
25|$|Shoes were {{narrow and}} often emphasized. They had a pointed toe and a medium height heel. Buttons, <b>patent</b> <b>leather,</b> and laced {{models of the}} shoe were also {{manufactured}} and readily available. Similarly, there were shoes for every occasion; oxfords for a tailored costume, slippers with straps for festive occasions or pumps with pearl buckles, and finally, boots which were often edged in fur {{to stave off the}} winter chill when riding in a carriage in the winter. At the beginning of 1900s shoes still maintained the same design of the Victorian era. Shoes were commonly made with seal skin or Moroccan leather. Having boots made of seal skin was most common for people in a higher social class. Seal skin boots were known to be extremely durable and could be worn during every season. Boots made from Moroccan leather were more uncomfortable and stiff. World War I caused this opulent era to tone down due to the increased sanctions on the trade of leather and other fabrics, and shoes were starting to incorporate a fabric topping.|$|E
500|$|The second verse {{shows her}} in the garden dress, as she {{continually}} rides an elevator through the warehouse; in a separate scene, the background dancers also ride the elevator. In front of a flower wallpaper, Stefani wears a fluffy, pink dress as she gracefully falls to floor. The next chorus shows Stefani in a black bob wig, [...] "walk effortlessly down some stairs in <b>patent</b> <b>leather,</b> thigh-high stilettos." [...] The song's bridge shows Stefani wearing {{a black and white}} leotard with thigh-high silver boots, sitting on a stool. A black horse appears alongside Stefani who is in a black and white-striped dress, before she slowly runs away from it. The song's final chorus has Stefani riding a bicycle through a brightly-lit parking garage, before she returns to the smoke machine and, once again, falls to the ground. As the song concludes, the screen fades to black.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{identifies}} {{the effect of}} changing patenting priorities in the emerging global leather trade. A landscape of invention portfolios generated through research and development in global leather sector has been investigated covering a three-year aggregated reference period of 1998 - 2000 relative to 1988 - 1990. Patents have been classified based on country of origin, applicant type and subject areas. Changing direction of global R&D in leather in various subject areas as indicated by generation of patents has been mapped. Technology trends have been analyzed. The trends indicate that product oriented research and bio-product alternatives to chemical inputs in leather processing are gaining higher significance and interest in leather research. The relationship between the balance of trade in leather world during 1998 - 2000 {{and the growth of}} patenting practices has also been studied. <b>Leather</b> <b>patents</b> <b>Patent</b> landscaping <b>Leather</b> processing Chemicals Devices Products Balance of trade WTO IPR...|$|R

500|$|The theatre {{critic for}} Time Out New York called the show [...] "the very {{model of a}} modern major musical." [...] The Associated Press termed it [...] "a big ol’ sweet love story about sons, the {{families}} we make and red <b>patent</b> <b>leather.</b> ... Thank goodness for Harvey Fierstein – he spins theatrical magic", but despite criticisms of the script the “perpetual cheer-churning machine” that is Kinky Boots certainly serves an important end goal; to empower not just its central characters, but the entire audience, {{in the spirit of}} acceptance. [...] According to Grossman, Kinky Boots facilitates the retraining of the eye to gender conventions and “repositions the marginalised figure as central to the spectacle of mass theatre... enacting a shift in the perspective of the viewer”. The finale “Raise You Up/Just Be” epitomises the empowerment of the individual, empowerment to “Just Be” regardless of the “oppressive gender roles directly connected to patriarchal views of legacy and inheritance” under which Charlie and Lola initially suffer.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{took the}} role of Catwoman (Selina Kyle) in Tim Burton's Batman Returns (1992) {{opposite}} Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito. For {{the role of}} Catwoman, she trained in martial arts and kickboxing. Pfeiffer has received universal critical acclaim for her performance and is consistently {{referred to as the}} greatest portrayal of Selina Kyle/Catwoman of all time by critics and fans. She was constantly praised for the amount of dimension and authenticity she brought to the character. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised her for giving the [...] "feminist avenger a tough core of intelligence and wit" [...] and called her a [...] "classic dazzler". Premiere retrospectively lauded her performance: [...] "Arguably the outstanding villain of the Tim Burton era, Michelle Pfeiffer's deadly kitten with a whip brought sex to the normally neutered franchise. Her stitched-together, black <b>patent</b> <b>leather</b> costume, based on a sketch of Burton's, remains the character's most iconic look. And Michelle Pfeiffer overcomes Batman Returns heavy-handed feminist dialogue to deliver a growling, fierce performance". The movie met a big box office success, grossing over $266million worldwide (equivalent to $million).|$|E
500|$|Love {{spent her}} {{early years in}} the Haight-Ashbury {{district}} of San Francisco until her parents' 1969 divorce, after which her father's custody was withdrawn when her mother alleged that he had fed LSD {{to her as a}} toddler, which he denied. Love's mother, who was studying to be a psychologist, had her in therapy by the age of two. In 1970, her mother moved the family to the rural community of Marcola, Oregon, where they lived along the Mohawk River, while her mother completed her degree at the University of Oregon. She described her parents' household as being full of [...] "hairy, wangly-ass hippies running around naked [...] Gestalt therapy. My mom was also adamant about a gender-free household: no dresses, no <b>patent</b> <b>leather</b> shoes, no canopy beds, nothing." [...] Love was adopted by her then-stepfather, Frank Rodriguez. He and her mother had two daughters and a son who died in infancy of a heart defect when Love was ten. They also adopted a boy. [...] Love attended a Montessori school in Eugene, where she struggled academically and had trouble making friends. At age nine, a psychologist noted that she exhibited signs of autism.|$|E
60|$|That {{tenement}} had {{a certain}} quiet distinction; {{there was no sign}} upon its face that he made for any of the Royal Family--merely his own German name of Gessler Brothers; and in the window a few pairs of boots. I remember that it always troubled me to account for those unvarying boots in the window, for he made only what was ordered, reaching nothing down, and it seemed so inconceivable that what he made could ever have failed to fit. Had he bought them to put there? That, too, seemed inconceivable. He would never have tolerated in his house leather on which he had not worked himself. Besides, they were too beautiful--the pair of pumps, so inexpressibly slim, the <b>patent</b> <b>leathers</b> with cloth tops, making water come into one's mouth, the tall brown riding boots with marvellous sooty glow, as if, though new, they had been worn a hundred years. Those pairs could only have been made by one who saw before him the Soul of Boot--so truly were they prototypes incarnating the very spirit of all foot-gear. These thoughts, of course, came to me later, though even when I was promoted to him, at the age of perhaps fourteen, some inkling haunted me of the dignity of himself and brother. For to make boots--such boots as he made--seemed to me then, and still seems to me, mysterious and wonderful.|$|R
