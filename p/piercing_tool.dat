50|$|Press {{tools are}} {{commonly}} used in hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical presses to produce components at high volumes. Generally press tools are categorized by the types of operation performed using the tool, such as blanking, piercing, bending, forming, forging, trimming etc. The press tool will also be specified as a blanking tool, <b>piercing</b> <b>tool,</b> bending tool etc.|$|E
50|$|Bo-shuriken were {{constructed}} {{from a wide}} variety of everyday items, hence there were many shapes and sizes. Some derived their names from the materials of which they were made, such as kugi-gata (nail form), hari-gata (needle form) and tantō-gata (knife form); some were named after an object of similar appearance, such as hoko-gata (spear form), matsuba-gata (pine-needle form); others have names that are a simple description of the object being thrown, such as kankyuto (<b>piercing</b> <b>tool</b> form), kunai-gata (utility tool form), or teppan (plate metal) and biao (pin).|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the forward extrusion process of tubes. In this process, a piercing process was carried out on the billet to produce the tube, followed directly by {{a reduction in the}} wall thickness. A specific geometrical shape for the piercing zone and the wall thickness reduction zone were chosen and designed. The effects of the redundant shear strain and the magnitude of the extrusion load were investigated and simulated with the finite element method using Q Form software program. Lead was used as model materials since (if the experiments were carried out at room temperature) it has the similar behavior of the steel at high temperature. The results obtained have shown that at the piercing zone, the lowest values of the extrusion load, the redundant strain, the total strain and the finite element effective strain were when a <b>piercing</b> <b>tool</b> (mandrel) of (C = 1. 1) was used. While, at the die zone, the lowest values of the extrusion load, the redundant strain, the total strain was when a die of (C = 0. 9) was used. </p...|$|E

50|$|Underground {{pneumatic}} <b>piercing</b> <b>tools</b> {{are often}} referred to as a hog, air hog, or pneuma gopher. The tool is used to bore a hole underground between two points without disturbing the surface ground. This open air chamber {{is referred to as the}} bore hole and is used to either run ducting for product or the raw product itself between the two points.|$|R
50|$|Firstly {{among the}} {{artifacts}} of Africa, archeologists found they could differentiate and classify those {{of less than}} 50,000 years into many different categories, such as projectile points, engraving tools, knife blades, and drilling and <b>piercing</b> <b>tools.</b> These new stone-tool types {{have been described as}} being distinctly differentiated from each other; each tool had a specific purpose. The invaders, commonly referred to as the Cro-Magnons, left many sophisticated stone tools, carved and engraved pieces on bone, ivory and antler, cave paintings and Venus figurines.|$|R
50|$|The tool {{is used in}} the {{installation}} of all public utilities electricity, gas, phone, and cable television these are referred to as product. It is also used to install home sprinkle systems and auxiliary home power lines. The tool is utilized in instances when it is difficult or cost prohibitive to plow or trench the product into the ground, some of these instances are under driveways, roads, sidewalks, and landscaping. Pneumatic <b>piercing</b> <b>tools</b> are a lower cost alternative to directional boring.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{produced}} when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth. [...] Obsidian is commonly {{found within the}} margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows, where the chemical composition (high silica content) induces a high viscosity and polymerization degree of the lava. The inhibition of atomic diffusion through this highly viscous and polymerized lava explains the lack of crystal growth. Obsidian is hard and brittle; it therefore fractures with very sharp edges, which {{were used in the}} past in cutting and <b>piercing</b> <b>tools,</b> and it has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades.|$|R
25|$|About 50,000 years ago, {{there was}} a marked {{increase}} in the diversity of artifacts. For {{the first time in}} Africa, bone artifacts and the first art appear in the archaeological record. The first evidence of human fishing is also noted, from artifacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa. Firstly among the artifacts of Africa, archaeologists found they could differentiate and classify those of less than 50,000 years into many different categories, such as projectile points, engraving tools, knife blades, and drilling and <b>piercing</b> <b>tools.</b> The new technology generated a population explosion of modern humans which is believed to have led to the extinction of the Neanderthals.|$|R
50|$|Findings from paleolithic {{archaeology}} sites {{suggest that}} prehistoric people used carving and <b>piercing</b> <b>tools</b> to create instruments. Archeologists have found Paleolithic flutes carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The Divje Babe flute, carved from a cave bear femur, {{is thought to}} be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of stringed instruments, such as the Ravanahatha, have been recovered from the Indus Valley Civilization archaeological sites. India has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world—references to Indian classical music (marga) are found in the Vedas, ancient scriptures of the Hindu tradition. The earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments was found in China and dates back to between 7000 and 6600 BC.|$|R
50|$|Since the '90s Tash {{has been}} {{consulted}} as {{an authority on}} body piercing and modifications in various publications such as the New York Times, Vogue, The Village Voice and The Daily News; and on television programmes including The Today Show, and the Tyra Banks Show (where she carried out a piercing live on an audience member). When consulted, Tash often speaks out against unsafe piercing practises, and emphasises the importance of hygiene, such as using autoclaves for sterilising <b>piercing</b> <b>tools.</b> She also insists that clients should be fully informed about procedures before having them done. She also appeared {{in a series of}} three video clips for the Haute Mama online magazine where she explained the impact that pregnancy can have upon body piercings. She also argues that traditional Asian, American and African body modifications reflect ancient concepts of beauty, and that their continued use should be viewed as a homage to indigenous civilizations and their cultures which colonialism attempted to suppress.|$|R
40|$|Sliding wear {{behaviors}} of <b>piercing</b> plug <b>tool</b> steels were investigated at 900 °C against low Cr ferritic steels containing 2 %Cr and 9 %Cr using a pin-on-disc CETR tribometer under condition of applied normal load of 20 N in air. Formation of glaze layers consisting of porous Fe-oxides wear debris with rapid growth on worn surface of <b>piercing</b> plug <b>tool</b> and smooth surface of steels containing 2 % Cr resulted in decreased friction coefficient at an initial period followed by exhibited constant value of about 0. 3 during the elevated temperature wear tests. It {{was found on}} the cross-section underneath the worn surface of the tool steels against the steels containing 2 %Cr that coarse ferrite with equiaxed grains by phase transformation and dynamic recrystallization was formed showing the decrease in hardness. On the other hand, formation of the glaze layers consisting of compact Cr-rich Fe-oxide wear debris on the worn surface of the tool steels at slow rates of materials transfer from the steels containing 9 %Cr resulted in the fluctuated friction coefficient ranging from about 1. 0 ∼ 1. 1 to 0. 4 followed by exhibited almost constant value of 0. 2 ∼ 0. 3. It was also found on cross-section underneath worn surface of tool steels against the steels containing 9 %Cr that severely deformed microstructures by cyclic applied loading was formed below compact and continuous oxide layers. The results showed that the elevated temperature sliding wear of the <b>piercing</b> plug <b>tool</b> steels was dominated by oxidation, materials transfer and subsurface degradation such as dynamic recrystallization softening or severe deformation...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The ESN 50 Self <b>Piercing</b> Rivet <b>Tool</b> is a {{wonderful}} replacement for 'drill and rivet' fastening, spot-welding and other means of fastening two sections of metal together. The main goal was to improve upon an existing design that is currently offered by the Textron Corporation. Textron is seeking an alternative energy source and an overall mild redesign of the ESN 50 device. The two most prominent faults are the ESN 50 's heavy design and a very slow cycle time. When this group was set up it was agreed upon that I would be the group leader and this would recreate the setting of a project manager in a real world situation. This paper covers topics about the changes required on this tool and additional topics such as project management, design theories and advice to future students that wish tackle a general design problem such as this one.

50|$|Redness, swelling, itching, pain, and/or {{tenderness}} are {{all signs}} of possible infection. The risk of an ear piercing becoming infected {{is the highest}} during warm weather and shortly after the piercing has taken place. Case studies show that normal ear piercing infections may develop into serious infections caused by Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, which are reported at rates of 10-30%. Although rare, {{there is also a}} theoretical risk of viral infection with hepatitis B, C, and HIV, if ears are <b>pierced</b> by contaminated <b>tools.</b> Furthermore, infected deep soft tissue and abscess at the site of infection have to be surgically drained or it can lead to ear deformities.|$|R
