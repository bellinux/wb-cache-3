5000|$|<b>Star</b> <b>thistle</b> is a {{valuable}} source of pollen, thus nectar for pollinators. Yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle,</b> a noted pest plant, is a major nectar source for many central valley and foothill butterflies. <b>Star</b> <b>Thistle</b> populates ground that has been abused: dry, compacted, or scraped clean. A plant with a tap root system, it has {{a crucial role in}} restoring the soil by bringing up vital micronutrients. Similar to many plants classified as 'weeds', they [...] "quickly establish in, protect, and restore soil that has been left exposed by natural and human-caused disturbances".|$|R

5|$|Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), {{common mullein}} (Verbascum thapsus), and Klamath weed (Hypericum perforatum) have been {{identified}} as noxious pests in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis), sweet clover (Melilot spp.), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), cut-leaved blackberry (Rubus laciniatus) and large periwinkle (Vinca major).|$|R
50|$|Other {{restoration}} {{work has}} been the removal of invasive plant species including <b>star</b> <b>thistle,</b> scotch broom and Himalayan blackberry. Non-native plants can displace the native species, which may decrease biodiversity and cause a loss of habitat that provide nest sites and food sources. The riparian or streamside plant areas along Butte Creek are the most vulnerable to invasive non-native plants.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{species of}} Synchytrium infect wild plants and rarely affect human affairs. However, there are exceptions. The most {{well-known}} species is Synchytrium endobioticum, a parasite of Solanaceae; {{it is the}} causal agent of black wart in potatoes. Synchytrium anemones can cause harm to anemone and thalictrum flowers. Synchytrium aureum infects many agricultural and horticultural plants. Synchytrium vaccinii creates galls on cranberry, azalea, chamaedaphne, gaultheira, and ledum. Synchytrium fragariae infects strawberry plants. Synchytrium trichosanthidis parasitizes an Indian curcubit, and S. sesamicola is responsible for losses in Indian crops of sesame (Sesamum indicum). [...] Synchytrium psophocarpi {{is one of the}} major diseases affecting winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus), which is important high protein crop. Synchytrium pogostemonis is the casual agent of budok (which translates as wart in a local Indonesian language), a disease of Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin). Synchytrium solstitiale parasitizes the yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis), an important weed in the United States. For this reason, S. solstitiale is being considered as a biological control of the yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> in the United States. Another species being considered for biological control use is Synchytrium minutum, which occasionally parasitizes kudzu. However, S. minutum parasitizes cultivated kudzu patches more often wild patches and has also been reported from agricultural crops.|$|R
