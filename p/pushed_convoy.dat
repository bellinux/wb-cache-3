40|$|Movement of ship or <b>pushed</b> <b>convoy</b> is {{realized}} {{under the influence}} of the propelling force, which is created by propeller or other types of propelling devices. After the change of work regime of the propelling engine the speed of ship (or <b>pushed</b> <b>convoy)</b> changes according to certain rules, while at the same time ship (<b>pushed</b> <b>convoy)</b> obtains irregular movement. Traveled distance and time lapsed of a certain maneuver, which take time during this irregular movement are called inertial characteristics of ship (or <b>pushed</b> <b>convoy).</b> These characteristics mostly depend on the type of maneuver, influence of external conditions, depth of waterway, as well as the amount of loaded cargo. In this paper the method for calculation of stopping distance and time will be presented for pushed convoys while navigating on a waterway both wide and deep enough. This paper is based on research done on the following projects: • Models of integration of transport system, number 36024 for the period 2011 ÷ 2014 year, by the Ministry of education, sciences and technical development of the Republic of Serbia; • Models of sustainable development of traffic in Vojvodina, for the period 2011 ÷ 2014 year, by the Secretariat of sciences and technical development of the Government of Vojvodina...|$|E
40|$|Exploitation and {{technical}} parameters {{of a ship}} are very important qualitative characteristics which determine {{the efficiency of the}} use of any kind of transportation vessels both for pushboats and for pushed convoys as a whole. Some of the most important exploitation {{and technical}} parameters are: parameter of transport efficiency, tonnage quality parameter, and thrust output of propeller. The complexity of these parameters {{can be seen from the}} fact that they present the values of achieved payload-distance during transportation of cargo in the unit of time per unit of installed (or effective) power of propelling engines of ships. The most reliable means for determining the transport efficiency is the method of testing in actual navigating conditions, which is conducted in order to determine exact technical characteristics of propelling engines of pushboats, and to determine drawbacks in their work and to increase their thrust and speed characteristics. This paper will present the process of choosing the size, shape, and number of barges in the convoy based on experiments conducted on a pushboat whose propelling engines have installed power 3 × 809. 6 kW (3 × 1, 100 HP). Obtained results are based on presumption that the total resistance of a <b>pushed</b> <b>convoy</b> is equal to the total thrust achieved by the ship’s propelling complex. ...|$|E

50|$|In 1922 a fully modernised canal {{was opened}} to navigation. Now the canal in the Rupel {{led by a}} new lock at Wintham. The locks at Vilvoorde and Humbeek were {{replaced}} by the Kapelle-op-den-Bos lock. A new upgrade was initiated in 1965, the canal being widened to 55 m (25 m for the locks) and the draught adapted. The construction of two new locks (205 x 25 m) at Zemst (opened in 1975) and Hingene (opened in 1997) allowed the canal to lead directly into the Scheldt. The Port of Brussels is now accessible to ships of 4500 tons and <b>pushed</b> <b>convoys</b> of 9000 tons.|$|R
50|$|The port of Brussels is an inland harbour, {{which is}} {{accessible}} for ships up to 4,500 tons and <b>push</b> towing <b>convoys</b> up to 9,000 tonnes. Via the Brussels-Scheldt Maritime Canal even sea-going vessels (fluviomaritime and coasters) {{can reach the}} outer port, and through the Brussels-Charleroi Canal the transit to the Walloon region is assured.|$|R
5|$|In June the {{battalion}} {{was placed in}} reserve as a ready-reinforcement unit and consequently saw little combat. From July to September, 3rd Battalion operated all throughout the I Corps area of operations, moving its command post to ten different locations. Hundreds of Marines were also affected by cellulitis. Following President Johnson's halt of the US bombing campaign on 1 November, 3rd Battalion Marines had to watch as the PAVN brazenly <b>pushed</b> large <b>convoys</b> of men and munitions south along the Ben Hai River. In one instance it took three days for {{the battalion}} to get approval for a single airstrike on a North Vietnamese convoy.|$|R
25|$|With {{traffic of}} over 20 million tonnes and 26 {{kilometres}} of quays, the autonomous port of Liège (PAL) {{is the third}} largest inland port in Europe. It carries out the management of 31 ports along the Meuse and the Albert Canal. It is accessible to sea and river transporters weighing up to 2,500 tonnes, and to <b>push</b> two-barge <b>convoys</b> (4,500 tonnes, soon to be raised to 9,000 tonnes). Even if Wallonia does not have {{direct access to the}} sea, it is very well connected to the major ports thanks to an extensive network of navigable waterways that pervades Belgium, and it has effective river connections to Antwerp, Rotterdam and Dunkirk.|$|R

60|$|Sir Colin Campbell had {{intended}} to allow a halt of seven days at the Alumbagh, but on the 27th of May a continuous firing was heard {{in the direction of}} Cawnpore. Fearful for the safety of that all-important post, the commander determined to <b>push</b> forward his <b>convoy</b> at once. On the morning of the 28th they started. Dick had come soon after daybreak to the tents where the Hargreaves were, with many others, sleeping.|$|R
50|$|Standing out of San Francisco Bay on 11 May 1943, Whipple sailed for the Caribbean with {{a convoy}} routed through the Panama Canal for Santa Anna Bay, Curaçao, Netherlands West Indies. After the cargo ships loaded a {{petroleum}} cargo, the <b>convoy</b> <b>pushed</b> on for Cuba {{and arrived at}} Guantanamo Bay on 29 May. From Guantanamo, the destroyer escorted a convoy to Trinidad but returned to the Cuban base on 19 June before heading north to the New York Navy Yard for voyage repairs.|$|R
40|$|A growing {{imbalance}} between {{demand for}} freight mobility (in terms of ton and tkm) and {{the supply of}} transport (in terms of lanes of infrastructure) in and around seaports is jeopardising the sustainability of its future development. Given the ever growing globalisation of the maritime industry any shortage in (trans-port) capacity is negative. In addition to cost-effective pricing and management application of technological improvements {{in the field of}} transport and transhipment will make port development more sustainable. New (underground) modes of transport could help, the more because transport capacity extensions on the earth surface are more and more affected by limitations in speed and size as a function of density of population and the existence of biotopes, especially around (port) towns. Moreover improved surface transport systems such as lash, <b>pushing</b> <b>convoys</b> and double-stack trains are not applicable everywhere in the BNL. Of course expansion of trans-port capacity can be realised in various ways: by using bigger vehicles, by re-organising transportation spatially and timely, etc., but by creating new 9 ̆ 3 ways 9 ̆ 4 or modes of transportation a much greater extension in capacity will be achieved. The feasibility of any new transport mode however depends upon cost recovering. An in-depth study of the situation in Antwerp and Rotterdam has been performed in order to acquire correct understanding of technical, economical and commercial consequences. It includes travel time and reliability analyses and a cost analysis. UCM (Underground Container Movers) as a pilot project demonstrates that 9 ̆ 3 Underground Tubular Transport 9 ̆ 4 contains interesting features to avoid congestion and to increase the efficiency of terminal operations in seaports confronted with congestion due to constant growing truck volumes. The volume to be transported through the UCM-system must be high enough to cover all costs (more than 2 million TEU in the business case). Application in due time of the UCM-system in the port of Antwerp might also alleviate the congestion on certain hinterland connections, especially on high ways, which together with lifecycle considerations increases the degree of sustainability of this new way of transportation...|$|R

5000|$|In October 1942, Exmoor {{supported}} {{military operations}} ashore in Operation Lightfoot, {{part of the}} prelude to the decisive Second Battle of El Alamein, and on 20 October 1942 escorted a force which made a diversionary landing at Ras-el-Kanais. In November 1942 she returned to patrol and convoy escort duty in the eastern Mediterranean. On 17 November 1942 she, Aldenham, Beaufort, the escort destroyer , and the Greek destroyer [...] joined Convoy MW 13 as its close escort in Operation Stone Age, the first attempt to run a westbound convoy to Malta since Operation Vigorous. Despite Axis air attacks on 18 November 1942 that disabled the light cruiser , the <b>convoy</b> <b>pushed</b> through to Malta, arriving on 20 November 1942. Exmoor and the other ships of the close escort departed Malta on 21 November 1942 and steamed back to Alexandria.|$|R

500|$|On 10 January 1941, during Operation Excess, the Italian torpedo boats Circe and Vega {{attempted}} {{an attack}} on the Allied convoy off Pantellaria. Right after the engagement, in which Vega was sunk, Gallant struck a mine that detonated her forward magazine, because the Italian action <b>pushed</b> the British <b>convoy</b> too much south of their pre-established route. The explosion blew the bow off the ship, killing 65 and injuring 15 more of her crew. Her sister Griffin rescued most of the survivors and the destroyer [...] towed her stern-first to Malta. The ship was slowly repaired and in October 1941 it was estimated that they would be completed in June 1942. However, on 5 April 1942, she was extensively damaged by bomb splinters by an air raid on Valletta and had to be beached at Pinto's Wharf to prevent her from sinking. She was judged to be a constructive total loss and any usable equipment was stripped from her hulk. Gallant was expended as a blockship at St Paul's Island in September 1943, with the wreck being broken up in 1953.|$|R
