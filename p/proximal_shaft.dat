5000|$|Stress {{fractures}} {{can occur}} at many {{sites in the}} body; [...] "march fracture" [...] simply refers to a stress fracture specifically of the metatarsals, so named because the injury is sometimes sustained by soldiers during sustained periods of marching. Although march fractures can occur to the 5th metatarsal, fractures of this bone {{are more likely to}} be trauma-related fractures to the diaphysis, termed Jones fractures. In runners, march fracture occurs most often in the metatarsal neck, while in dancers it occurs in the <b>proximal</b> <b>shaft.</b> In ballet dancers, fracture mostly occurs at the base of the second metatarsal and at Lisfranc joints. This fracture always occurs following a prolonged stress or weight bearing, and the history of direct trauma is very rare. Consideration should always be given to osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Cavus feet are a risk factor for march fracture.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{clinical}} observation that dogs with a steep tibial plateau slope had variable tibial morphology, {{we hypothesized that}} these dogs could be further characterized using measurements developed by examining computer generated models of specific proximal tibial malformations. A 3 D tibial model was created from a normal canine tibia. The model was manipulated to reproduce two specific proximal tibial anomalies repre-senting deformities originating from the tibial plateau or the proximal tibial shaft. Data from these models were used to create specific measurements that would characterize the shape of these anomalies. These measurements included the diaphyseal tibial axis (DTA) /proximal tibial axis (PTA) angle, which defined {{the orientation of the}} proximal portion of the shaft in relation to the tibial mid-shaft. These measurements were then made on radiographs of dogs with and without cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture. Models with tibial plateau and <b>proximal</b> <b>shaft</b> deformities had a steep tibial plateau slope (TPS). Models with <b>proximal</b> <b>shaft</b> deformity had a markedly increased DTA/PTA angle. The model with a 101 <b>proximal</b> <b>shaft</b> deformity had a DTA/PTA angle of 11. 231. Six dogs (9. 0 %) had a DTA/PTA angle larger than 11. 231 (range, 11. 4 – 13. 91). Dogs in this group had ruptured CCL and a steep TPS. Dogs with CCL rupture had higher TPS (mean, 31. 8 ! 4. 11) and DTA/ PTA angle (mean, 6. 0 ! 3. 31) than dogs without CCL rupture (means, 23. 6 ! 3. 41 and 4. 1 ! 2. 21, respec-tively). Dogs with <b>proximal</b> <b>shaft</b> deformity represented a distinct group, which could not be identified using the magnitude of the TPS alone. Characterizing more precisely the shape of the proximal portion of the tibia in dogs contributes {{to our understanding of the}} pathogenesis of steep TPS and may facilitate the optimization of the surgical management of dogs with CCL rupture.

40|$|Abstract】The {{combination}} of ipsilateral humeral fractures at three different levels namely <b>proximal,</b> <b>shaft</b> and supracondyle has been rarely {{defined in the}} literature. We present a case report on such a complex injury in a 10 -year-old child after falling down from {{the second floor of}} his house while playing. To the best of our knowledge, no such case report exists in the English literature. We define it as “double floating arm” injury. Firstly, shaft of humerus was open reduced and fixed with 4. 5 mm narrow dynamic compression plate. Then closed reduction and pinning of the supracondylar humerus under an image intensifier was obtained. Open reduction using deltopectoral approach to the proximal humerus was done and the fracture was fixed with three K-wires. Ipsilateral multiple fractures in children often result from high energy trauma. Immediate reduction and fixation is required. Usually surgeons need to treat simple fractures firstly, which makes the subsequent treatment of complex fractures easier. Key words: Humeral fractures; Arm injuries; Terminolog...|$|E

LCP for distal fibular fractures is generally applied after open reduction, but may involve complications to the surgical wound, as reported in the literature 12 - 14, especially in elderly patients with critical soft tissue condition, because at this level the bone is not covered with muscle and soft tissue coverage is thin.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Osteosynthesis of the femur {{using an}} {{interlocking}} nail is {{the gold standard}} for treating diaphyseal fractures of the femur. There are two established entry points for the antegrade interlocking nails which is the piriformis fossa or the greater trochanter. It has been reported that varus malalignment was frequently seen in proximal femur fracture which were treated with interlocking nail utilizing the greater trochanter entry point. The study was done {{to find out if the}} problem was of significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study which included 179 patients with femur fractures which were treated from January 2013 till September 2015 in one Hospital. They were treated with interlocking nail either by utilizing the piriformis fossa (PF) or the greater trochanter (GT) entry points. Post-operative radiographs of the femur were used to measure the varus deformity. RESULTS: Out of 179 patients, there were 5 patients who were reported to have unacceptable varus malalignment (2. 79 %). These 5 patients were out of the 88 (5. 68 %) patients utilizing the greater trochanter as the entry point.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of primary clear cell sarcoma {{occurring}} in the humerus. A 20 year old girl was referred to our hospital two years ago with painless swelling of the soft tissue surrounding the proximal right humerus. The conventional radiographic image showed an ill-defined, aggressive, osteolytic lesion associated with a partial cortical defect of the proximal right humerus. Magnetic resonance imaging found an irregularly shaped extraosseous mass extending from the <b>proximal</b> <b>shaft</b> of the right humerus, penetrating through the destroyed bone and invading the biceps brachii. After preoperative chemotherapy, a total tumor resection, internal fixation and bone cement implantation were performed. Histological studies of the resected tumor found that fibrous septa divided into well-defined nests and polygonal and fusiform cells with clear cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated strong positive cytoplasmic staining with S- 100 and scattered positivity with HMB- 45. These findings led to a final, definitive diagnosis of clear cell sarcoma of the humerus. After routine postoperative chemotherapy, a 2 -year follow-up showed no metastasis.

40|$|Objective To review our {{experience}} of using the tubularized incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty (useful {{in the treatment of}} distal hypospadias) to treat proximal hypospadias. Materials and methods From March 1997 to March 2000 primary repairs were carried out on 40 boys (mean age 4. 5 years) with proximal hypospadias. After degloving the penile skin the meatus was at the mid-shaft in 10 boys, at the proximal penile shaft in 11, at the penoscrotal junction in 16, at the scrotum in two and at the perineum in one. The 21 patients with a mid or <b>proximal</b> <b>shaft</b> meatus were categorized as having mid-shaft and the other 19 as having posterior hypospadias. Tunica albuginea plication (TAP) was used to correct residual ventral curvature. The method of urethroplasty was adapted from that described by Snodgrass. The key step of the TIP repair is a midline incision of the urethral plate; a subcutaneous tissue flap dissected from the inner prepuce is used to cover the neourethra. An 8 or 10 F nasogastric tube is used as a urethral stent and removed 7 or 8 days after surgery. Follow-up endoscopy and urethral sounding were carried out in 17 of the patients aged = 3 D  8 F and in 13 was >= 3 D  10 F.

There was 1 delayed union which remained asymptomatic and eventually healed at 8 months with acceptable Constant-Murley score. There were 3 cases of shoulder impingement syndrome diagnosed at 3 months post-operatively. After implant removal, they all achieved an acceptable Constant-Murley score. According to Constant-Murley scoring system, there were 11 excellent, 10 good and 5 acceptable results. The excellent or good rate was 80. 8 %. CONCLUSION: MIPO technique using LCP is an effective method to treat <b>proximal</b> humeral <b>shaft</b> fractures, which facilitates functional recovery of the shoulder joint. During the surgery, it is important to achieve a good fracture reduction and to avoid complications. 目的總結採用微創接骨板固定(minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis,MIPO) 技術植入鎖定加壓鋼板(locking compression plate,LCP) 治療肱骨幹近端骨折的臨床效果。方法 2004 年 7 月- 2008 年 4 月,採用MIPO技術植入LCP治療 26 例肱骨幹近端 1 / 3 移位骨折患者。其中男 8 例,女 18 例;年齡 34 ～ 82 歲,平均 66 歲。骨折按AO分型,A 1 型 4 例,A 2 型 2 例,B 1 型 8 例,B 2 型 4 例,B 3 型 2 例,C 1 型 4 例,C 2 型 2 例。合併骨質疏鬆 8 例。受傷至手術時間 1 ～ 5 d,平均 2 d。結果術後患者切口均Ⅰ期癒合,無感染等並發癥發生。 3 例術後合併橈神經功能性麻痺,分別於術後 4 、 6 、 8 個月自行恢復。 26 例均獲隨訪,隨訪時間 6 ～ 24 個月,平均 14. 1 個月。 X線片示 25 例於術後 6 個月內骨折達骨性癒合; 1 例因內固定松動發生延遲癒合,但無臨床癥狀,於術後 8 個月骨折癒合,功能恢復至可。術後 3 個月 3 例發生肩關節撞擊徵,取出內固定行功能鍛煉後功能恢復至可。採用Constant-Murley評分方法評定療效,優 11 例,良 10 例,可 5 例,優良率 80. 8 %。結論採用MIPO技術植入LCP治療肱骨近端骨折是一種合理可行的方法,有利於肩關節早期功能恢復,術中應重視骨折復位和避免並發癥的發生。link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Ophryotrocha labronica, as {{typical for}} Eunicida, has a complex jaw {{apparatus}} consisting of ventral mandibles and dorsal maxillae. Mandibles are not replaced but are retained throughout life. Larval mandibles have adult-sized cutting plates but their <b>proximal</b> <b>shafts</b> lengthen and enlarge as the worm grows. The maxillary apparatus of O. labronica undergoes three moults or replacements. The initial, or larval maxillae, {{consisting of two}} paired basal plates and two paired free denticles, develop in the unreleased larvae. They are replaced in the 5 -setiger juvenile by the P 1 -maxillae consisting of falcate forceps and six denticles. The second moult occurs in the 8 - to 9 -setiger juveniles and results in the P 2 -maxillae with bidentate forceps and seven denticles, and {{the third and final}} moult results in the K-maxillae and seven denticles. The K-maxillae develop in 9 - to 12 -setiger males and 13 - to 15 -setiger females and are not replaced but enlarge proximally. Thus the K-forceps can be traced back through the P 2 -forceps, P 1 -forceps, to the larval basal plates, indicating the apomorphic state of the K-forceps. Three pulp cavities, separated by darker fusion lines are visible in weakly sclerotised young K-forceps suggesting the fusion of three separate elements. It is concluded that the Ophryotrocha forceps are homologous to the superior and probably inferior basal plates of other dorvilleids. The internal structure of the Ophryotrocha forceps demonstrates that they are not homologous to the labidognath maxilla I as has been suggested. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Eighteen {{patients}} with <b>proximal</b> tibial <b>shaft</b> non-union and shortening were treated. In each patient, the non-union area was débrided, realigned and stabilised with an Ilizarov lengthening frame. The tibia was gradually lengthened by 1 – 1. 5  mm per day. After achieving the desired length, external fixation was converted to an angled blade plate and packed with cancellous bone graft. Follow-up of 16 patients for {{a median of}} 2. 4 (1. 2 – 4. 5) years revealed satisfactory outcomes in all. No wound infections were noted. The described technique has a high success rate, a short treatment course and reduces patient discomfort.
