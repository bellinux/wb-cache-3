Today, they are known to be a large and diverse group of organisms that are widely distributed in nature and are common in all habitats. This new appreciation of the importance and ubiquity of archaea came from using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect prokaryotes from environmental samples (such as water or soil) by multiplying their ribosomal genes.

40|$|International audienceThe complex {{refractive}} {{indices of}} tholins, simulating aerosols {{in the atmosphere}} of Titan and the primitive earth, have been measured over a wide spectral range, including the soft X-ray, vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV), and UV-Visible. The soft X-ray and VUV spectral ranges are in particular relevant to radiative transfer models of solar irradiation of <b>primitive</b> <b>atmospheres</b> (Lammer et al. 2008) and may elucidate the (anti-) greenhouse potential of photochemical aerosols. Thin films were grown using the PAMPRE capacitively coupled plasma setup (Szopa et al. 2006; Carrasco et al. 2009). Gas mixtures consisting of CH 4 /N 2 with 5 : 95 ratios were used to simulate Titan's atmospheric composition. For the primitive Earth, gas mixtures of N 2 /CO 2 /H 2 and N 2 /CO 2 /CH 4 were used as described in Fleury et al. (2014). State-of-the-art laboratory techniques {{were used to determine}} the refractive indices of such tholin films. These include VUV ellipsometry (performed in collaboration with the Metrology Light Source in Berlin) and synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy (performed at the SEXTANTS beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron). While VUV spectroscopy reveals new electronic transitions due to plasmon resonances in tholins, X-ray spectra reveal the C and O absorption edges of these solids. The refractive indices are compared to results from Khare et al. (1984).

2500|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation (BNF, {{performed by the}} organisms called diazotrophs) is a very old process that probably originated in the Archean eon when the <b>primitive</b> <b>atmosphere</b> lacked oxygen. [...] It is only carried out by Euryarchaeota and just 6 {{of the more than}} 50 phyla of bacteria. Some of these lineages co-evolved together with the flowering plants establishing the molecular basis of a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. BNF is carried out in nodules that are mainly located in the root cortex, although they are occasionally located in the stem as in Sesbania rostrata. The spermatophytes that co-evolved with actinorhizal diazotrophs (Frankia) or with rhizobia to establish their symbiotic relationship belong to 11 families contained within the Rosidae clade (as established by the gene molecular phylogeny of rbcL, a gene coding for part of the RuBisCO enzyme in the chloroplast). This grouping indicates that the predisposition for forming nodules probably only arose once in flowering plants and that it can be considered as an ancestral characteristic that has been conserved or lost in certain lineages. However, such a wide distribution of families and genera within this lineage indicates that nodulation had multiple origins. Of the 10 families within the Rosidae, 8 have nodules formed by actinomyces (Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Coriariaceae, Datiscaceae, Elaeagnaceae, Myricaceae, Rhamnaceae and Rosaceae), and the two remaining families, Ulmaceae and Fabaceae have nodules formed by rhizobia.|$|E

In support, a number of independent researchers also confirmed the range of chemical syntheses. With the most recent revelation that, unlike the original Miller's experimental hypothesis of strongly reducing condition, the <b>primitive</b> <b>atmosphere</b> could be quite neutral containing other gases in different proportions, Miller's last works, posthumously published in 2008, still succeeded in synthesising an array of organic compounds using such condition.|$|E
40|$|The {{earliest}} atmospheres of {{the terrestrial}} planets {{are thought to}} have been hotter, have stronger winds and rotate faster than atmospheres of today. Since these <b>primitive</b> <b>atmospheres</b> were weakly bound, they evolved rapidly because atmospheric escape was very strong, often referred to as "blowoff. " Such escape has been treated as hydrodynamic, transonic flow; similar to solar wind flow dynamics. However, in many cases, although the outward flow is hydrodynamic at low altitudes, it becomes collisionless at higher altitudes, before sonic speeds are ever attained. Recent models dealing with the transition from fluid to kinetic flow have applied the Jeans escape flux at the exobase. This approach leads to escape rates that are too low, because thermospheric winds and planetary rotation are known to increase the escape flux above the corresponding Jeans flux. In particular, for a given density and temperature at the exobase, the escape flux increases as the wind speed and/or the rotation rate increase. Also, for a given wind speed and rotation rate, the escape flux enhancement over the Jeans flux increases as the mass of an escaping constituent increases, an important factor in isotope fractionation, especially the enrichment of deuterium on Mars. Accounting for a range of possible temperatures, thermospheric wind speeds and planetary rotation rates in the <b>primitive</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of the terrestrial planets, estimates are made of light constituent escape flux increases over the corresponding Jeans fluxes...|$|R

40|$|Assuming {{that the}} <b>primitive</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of Mars and earth were similar and that present {{differences}} in atmospheres {{of earth and}} Mars {{are a result of}} their different distances from the sun and their different masses, the atmospheres of the early earth and early Mars were analyzed. A one-dimensional radiative-convective model derived from that of Kasting et al. (1984) and Kasting and Ackerman (1986) was then used to determine if a 1. 3 -bar CO 2 partial pressure on Mars (which is equivalent to about 9 bars on earth) is consistent with the climatic conditions thought to have existed on earth four billion years ago. Results indicate that a dense CO 2 atmosphere on early Mars at perihelion is consistent with conditions expected to have existed four billion years ago on earth.

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that amino acid synthesis could have occurred deep in the Earth's crust and that these amino acids were subsequently shot up along with hydrothermal fluids into cooler waters, where lower temperatures {{and the presence of}} clay minerals would have fostered the formation of peptides and protocells. This is an attractive hypothesis because of the abundance of CH4 (methane) and NH3 (ammonia) present in hydrothermal vent regions, a condition that was not provided by the Earth's <b>primitive</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> A major limitation to this hypothesis is the lack of stability of organic molecules at high temperatures, but some have suggested that life would have originated outside of the zones of highest temperature. [...] There are numerous species of extremophiles and other organisms currently living immediately around deep-sea vents, suggesting that this is indeed a possible scenario.|$|E

40|$|The {{prebiotic}} {{synthesis of}} amino acids, HCN, H 2 CO, and NH 3 using a spark discharge on various simulated <b>primitive</b> earth <b>atmospheres</b> at 25 C is investigated. Various mixtures of CH 4, CO, CO 2, N 2, NH 3, H 2 O, and H 2 were utilized in different experiments. The yields of amino acids (1. 2 - 4. 7 percent {{based on the}} carbon) {{are found to be}} approximately independent of the H 2 /CH 4 ratio and the presence of NH 3, and a wide variety of amino acids are obtained. Glycine is found to be almost the only amino acid produced from CO and CO 2 model atmospheres, with the maximum yield being about the same for the three carbon sources at high H 2 /carbon ratios,whereas CH 4 is superior at low H 2 /carbon ratios. In addition, it is found that the directly synthesized NH 3 together with the NH 3 obtained from the hydrolysis of HCN, nitriles, and urea could have been a major source of ammonia in the atmosphere and oceans of the primitive earth. It is determined that prebiotic syntheses from HCN and H 2 CO to give products such as purines and sugars and some amino acids could have occurred in <b>primitive</b> <b>atmospheres</b> containing CO and CO 2 provided the H 2 /CO and H 2 /CO 2 ratios were greater than about 1. 0...|$|R

Rather than employ the cloud-free atmosphere approach of earlier studies, we include an interactive water vapor transport and cloud formation scheme in the model.

40|$|Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) {{lying in}} the Galactic Centre 8 kpc from Earth, hosts the closest supermassive black hole known to us. It is now inactive, but there is {{evidence}} indicating that about six million years ago it underwent a powerful outburst where the luminosity could have approached the Eddington limit. Motivated {{by the fact that}} in extragalaxies the supermassive black holes with similar masses and near-Eddington luminosities are usually strong X-ray emitters, we calculate here the X-ray luminosity of SgrA*. For that, we assume that the outburst was due to accretion of gas or the tidal disruption of a star. We show that these cases could precipitate on Earth a hard X-ray (i. e. hν> 2 keV) flux comparable to that from the current quiescent sun. The flux in harder energy band 20 keV<hν< 100 keV, however, surpasses that from an X-class solar flare, and the irradiation timescale is also much longer, ranging from weeks to 10 ^ 5 years depending on the outburst scenario. In the solar system gas giants will suffer the biggest impact in their atmospheres. Lower-mass planets such as Earth receive a level of radiation that might {{have played a role in}} the evolution of their <b>primitive</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> so that a detailed study of the consequences deserves further investigation.

We plan to model the chemistry of the Earth atmosphere during its evolution, using observed UV flux distributions of early solar analogs as boundary conditions in photochemical models of the Earth's atmosphere. The study has four distinct but interlinked parts: (1) Establishing the radiation of the early Sun; (2) Determining the photochemistry of the early Earth's atmosphere; (3) Estimating the rates of H 2 loss from the atmosphere; and (4) Ascertaining how sensitive is the photochemistry to the metallicity of the Sun. We are currently using STIS and EUVE to obtain high-quality far-UV and extreme-UV observations of three early-solar analogs. We will perform a detailed non-LTE study of each stars, and construct theoretical model photosphere, and an empirical model chromospheres, which can be used to extrapolate the continuum to the Lyman continuum region. Given a realistic flux distribution of the early Sun, we will perform photochemical modeling of weakly reducing <b>primitive</b> <b>atmospheres</b> to determine the lifetime and photochemistry of CH 4. In particular, we will make estimates of the amount of CH 4 present in the prebiotic atmosphere, and estimate the atmospheric CH 4 concentration during the Late Archean (2. 5 - 3. 0 b. y. ago) and determine whether it would have been sufficiently abundant to help offset reduced solar luminosity at that time.
