5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a <b>prothorax,</b> a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the <b>prothorax,</b> which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The <b>prothorax</b> is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|Thorax: The <b>prothorax</b> {{is usually}} reduced.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the <b>prothorax,</b> the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the <b>prothorax</b> has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely <b>prothorax,</b> metathorax and mesothorax. The organs of insect locomotion – the legs and wings – are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the <b>prothorax,</b> the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. In some cases, the wings are vestigial.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is a tagma {{composed}} of three sections, the <b>prothorax,</b> mesothorax and the metathorax. The anterior segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the <b>prothorax,</b> with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the <b>prothorax</b> is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, {{as well as the}} mesosternum and metasternum, are used.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper and}} lower parts of the thorax (terga and sterna respectively) are {{composed}} of segmental and intrasegmental sclerites which display secondary sclerotisation and considerable modification in the Lepidoptera. The <b>prothorax</b> is the simplest and smallest of the three segments while the mesothorax is the most developed.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments, {{some of which}} may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the <b>prothorax)</b> or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the abdomen, and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E
5|$|The thorax bears {{three pairs}} of legs, one pair on each segment. The <b>prothorax</b> (T1) has a {{functional}} spiracle which is actually derived from the mesothorax (T2) while the metathorax has a reduced spiracle which is not externally open and lies beneath the cuticle. The thoracic legs consist of coxa, trochanter, femur, tarsus and claw and are constant in form throughout the order. However they are reduced {{in the case of}} certain leaf-miners and elongated in certain Notodontidae. In Micropterigidae, the legs are three-segmented, as the coxa, trochanter and femur are fused.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas {{are large}} insects made {{conspicuous}} by the courtship calls of the males. They are characterised by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and {{three to six}} segments, including a seta at the tip. The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on {{the rear of the}} forewing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hindwing. Cicadas lack the ability to jump as exhibited by other members of the Auchenorrhyncha. Another defining characteristic is the adaptations of the forelimbs of nymphs for underground life. The relict family Tettigarctidae differ from the Cicadidae in having the <b>prothorax</b> extending as far as the scutellum, and by lacking the tympanal apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the <b>prothorax,</b> mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are easy}} to {{identify}} due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and <b>prothorax</b> were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is {{segmented}} {{into the}} two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the <b>prothorax.</b> When viewed from below, the thorax {{is that part}} from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax. When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The mesosoma is half {{as broad}} than the head when viewed dorsally. The {{junction}} of the mesoscutellum (middle {{part of the}} scutellum) and the propdeums dorsal surface are indistinct; on two Z. ferox specimens, these body parts are slightly angled. The propodeal dorsums posterior margin is concave. The propleuron (the lateral exoskeletal plate of the <b>prothorax)</b> is well developed and the mesopleuron (the lateral exoskeleton plate of the mesothorax) is separated {{from the rest of}} the mesosoma by distinct sulci (deep grooves of the head). The propodeum is high and the propodeal spiracles (external openings) are slit-like and located around the mid-regions of the propodeal sides. The opening of the metapleural gland is semicircular and the metapleural bulla (the reservoirs) is developed. On the legs, the femora and tibiae are flattened and tibiae with anterior and posterior margins are bordered by a carina. The trochantellus (proximal end of the femur) is found on all legs, and the forelegs have patches of dense and elongated setae. The protibia has three spurs; the large spur ("calcar") is curved and the other two spurs are just as long as the calcar. Pretarsal claws are present with a subapical tooth.|$|E
25|$|The <b>prothorax</b> on this conehead is {{shielded}} {{by a large}} pronotum {{that extends}} from over the cervix (neck) on the anterior side to cover the mesothorax {{and most of the}} metathorax on the posterior side, as well as covering the pleura on the <b>prothorax.</b> The pronotum of the <b>prothorax</b> may be simple in structure and small in comparison with the other nota, but in beetles, mantids, many bugs, and some Orthoptera, the pronotum is expanded, and in cockroaches, it forms a shield that covers part of the head and mesothorax.|$|E
25|$|Swallowtails have {{a number}} of {{distinctive}} features; for example, the papilionid caterpillar bears a repugnatorial organ called the osmeterium on its <b>prothorax.</b> The osmeterium normally remains hidden, but when threatened, the larva turns it outward through a transverse dorsal groove by inflating it with fluid.|$|E
25|$|The ventral view or sternum {{follows the}} same convention, with the {{prosternum}} under the <b>prothorax,</b> the mesosternum under the mesothorax and the metasternum under the metathorax. The notum, pleura, and sternum of each segment {{have a variety}} of different sclerites and sutures, varying greatly from order to order, and they will not be discussed in detail in this section.|$|E
25|$|The insect thorax {{has three}} segments: the <b>prothorax,</b> mesothorax, and metathorax. The {{anterior}} segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the prothorax; its major features are the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax; its major features are the second pair of legs and the anterior wings, if any. The third, the posterior, thoracic segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which bears the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron), and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the <b>prothorax</b> is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, {{there is also the}} mesopleura and metapleura, as well as the mesosternum and metasternum.|$|E
25|$|On the {{underside}} of the males, the ground colour and markings is similar, but the red subterminal spots on the hindwing much brighter; it is not irrorated with black scales, better defined, the anterior four subquadrate, the next two crescent shaped, sometimes quadrate also, the spot in interspace one triangular and pointed. Antennae, thorax and abdomen above up to the pre-anal segment black; the head, sides of <b>prothorax</b> above, and of the whole of the thorax and abdomen beneath vermilion red; anal segment vermilion red.|$|E
25|$|The head of tessaratomids is {{generally}} small and triangular, with the antennae having 4 to 5 segments (though some of them, for example Siphnus, have relatively large heads). The scutellum (Latin for 'little shield', the hard {{extension of the}} thorax covering the abdomen in hemipterans) is triangular and does not cover the leathery middle section of the forewing but is often partially covered by the <b>prothorax.</b> The tarsi (the final segments of the legs) have 2 to 3 segments. They are most reliably distinguished from pentatomids by having six exposed abdominal spiracles instead of five.|$|E
25|$|The species Lucilia cuprina, {{formerly}} named Phaenicia cuprina, is {{more commonly}} known as the Australian sheep blowfly. It belongs to the blow-fly family Calliphoridae, and while some authorities combine the blow flies (Calliphoridae) and the flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) together into the Metopiidae family, distinguishable characteristics allow for the separation. Lucilia cuprina {{is a member of the}} order Diptera, has a pair of short but very strong membranous wings and a pair of hindwings reduced and modified to clublike balancers known as halteres. This adaptation distinguishes the true flies (Diptera) from the other orders with “fly” in their name, and serves as a sensory aid that acts as tiny gyroscopes or inertial navigation system. The mesothorax is much enlarged while the <b>prothorax</b> and metathorax are reduced. Blow flies are about the size of a house fly or a little larger, and though considered to be nuisances indoors are essential agents in the breakdown of organic matter. Most are metallic blue or green, and often have black gena, mostly white calypteres and orange yellow anterior thoracic spiracles.|$|E
500|$|Dragonflies are predators, both {{in their}} aquatic larval stage, when they are known as nymphs or naiads, and as adults. Several years of their lives are spent as nymphs living in fresh water; the adults {{may be on the}} wing for just a few days or weeks. They are fast, agile fliers, {{sometimes}} migrating across oceans, and are often found near water. They have a uniquely complex mode of reproduction involving indirect insemination, delayed fertilization, and sperm competition. During mating, the male grasps the female {{at the back of the}} head or on the <b>prothorax,</b> and the female curls her abdomen under her body to pick up sperm from the male's secondary genitalia at the front of his abdomen, forming the [...] "heart" [...] or [...] "wheel" [...] posture.|$|E
500|$|The antlion larva has {{a robust}} [...] body, a very plump abdomen, and a thorax bearing {{three pairs of}} walking legs. The <b>prothorax</b> forms a slender mobile [...] "neck" [...] for the large, square, {{flattened}} head, which bears an enormous pair of sickle-like jaws with several sharp, hollow projections. The jaws are formed by the maxillae and mandibles; the mandibles each contain a deep groove over which the maxilla fits neatly, forming an enclosed canal for injecting venom to immobilise the victim, and enzymes to digest its soft parts. The larva is clad in forward-pointing bristles which help it to anchor itself and exert greater traction, enabling it to subdue prey considerably larger than itself. Antlion larvae are unusual among insects in lacking an anus. All the metabolic waste generated during the larval stage is stored; some is used to spin the silk for the cocoon {{and the rest is}} eventually voided as meconium {{at the end of its}} pupal stage.|$|E
500|$|Mole crickets vary in {{size and}} appearance, {{but most of them}} are of {{moderate}} size for an insect, typically between [...] long as adults. They are adapted for underground life and are cylindrical in shape and covered with fine, dense hairs. The head, forelimbs, and <b>prothorax</b> are heavily sclerotinised but the abdomen is rather soft. The head bears two threadlike antennae and a pair of beady eyes. The two pairs of wings are folded flat over the abdomen; in most species, the fore wings are short and rounded and the hind wings are membranous and reach or exceed the tip of the abdomen; however, in some species the hind wings are reduced {{in size and}} the insect is unable to fly. The fore legs are flattened for digging but the hind legs are shaped somewhat like the legs of a true cricket; however, these limbs are more adapted for pushing soil, rather than leaping, which they do rarely and poorly. The nymphs resemble the adults apart from the absence of wings and genitalia; the wingpads become larger after each successive moult.|$|E
500|$|The thorax {{consists}} of three segments as in all insects. The <b>prothorax</b> is small and is flattened dorsally into a shield-like disc which has two transverse ridges. The mesothorax and metathorax are fused into a rigid, box-like structure with internal bracing, and provides a robust attachment for the powerful wing muscles inside it. The thorax bears two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. The wings are long, veined, and membranous, narrower at the tip and wider at the base. The hindwings are broader than the forewings and the venation is different at the base. The veins carry haemolymph, which is analogous to blood in vertebrates and carries out many similar functions, but which also serves a hydraulic function to expand the body between nymphal stages (instars) and to expand and stiffen the wings after the adult emerges from the final nymphal stage. The leading edge of each wing has a node where other veins join the marginal vein, and the wing is able to flex at this point. In most large species of dragonflies, the wings of females are shorter and broader than those of males. The legs are rarely used for walking, but are used to catch and hold prey, for perching, and for climbing on plants. Each has two short basal joints, two long joints, and a three-jointed foot, armed {{with a pair of}} claws. The long leg joints bear rows of spines, and in males, one row of spines on each front leg is modified to form an [...] "eyebrush", for cleaning the surface of the compound eye.|$|E
500|$|There are short, white {{pubescent}} hairs sporadically distributed {{along the}} lateral and posterior {{aspects of the}} mesosoma. [...] They are more densely arranged along the upper surface of the <b>prothorax.</b> [...] Hairs on the mesoscutum are short and infrequent. [...] The hairs on the scutellum are longer and stiffer. [...] Deep, ragged puncture marks are spaced closely together across the mesoscutum. [...] The spaces between each punctate marking are less than the diameters of the marks. [...] They are less closely associated on the scutellem. [...] At the axilla, the markings are less ragged in appearance and are spaced very close together. [...] The pleural surfaces are shiny, with puncture marks along the lower aspects being deep and ragged. [...] Higher up, these markings are less ragged and less sparsely distributed. [...] The lateral aspects of the propodeum are generally of a smoother texture, although there are crisp and shallow markings closely spaced. [...] The spine along the anterior coxal aspect is nearly obliterated. [...] The coxa are covered in dense white hairs. [...] The anterior tarsus is dark. [...] There are long brown hairs on the fronts {{of the first three}} tarsomeres. [...] The more typical fringe of hairs along the posterior aspect is absent. There is a robust mid-tibial spur. [...] The slim middle and posterior tarsi show yellow spurs. [...] There are tiny puncture marks closely spaced together on the tegula. [...] The black veined wings are slightly cloudy at the apices and glassier at the bases.|$|E
2500|$|The body of Xeris {{spectrum}} is cylindrical. The head is broadest behind the eyes, and antennae are thread-shaped. Both sexes are equal in length, between [...] The body is black or dark brown and shiny with white spots behind {{the eyes and}} {{on the sides of}} the <b>prothorax.</b> Xeris spectrums legs are orange-red. Males have brown rings around the leg.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} insects, the body {{consists}} of a head, thorax, and abdomen. [...] The thorax is divided into the <b>prothorax,</b> mesothorax and metathorax; the dorsal side of the <b>prothorax</b> is a sclerotized shield, the pronotum. [...] The Hister beetle has an exoskeleton made of chitin which gives protection to the internal organs. [...] The elytra and forewings are normally well developed in beetles, but in Histerdiae the elytra are shortened and rectangular. [...] The shortened elytra expose the final two of the seven tergites. Attached to the body are three pairs of jointed legs and two pairs of wings. [...] The head has compound eyes, a mandible mouthpart, and shortened antennae. [...] The eyes do not move; each takes {{a little piece of}} the picture to make a complete picture. [...] The Hister's mouthpart grasps and grinds the food with two teeth. [...] Lastly, the antennae work as sensory organs. [...] A distinctive characteristic is that the antennae are elbowed and contain three antennomeres that form a club at the end.|$|E
2500|$|The Hister beetles {{are easily}} {{identified}} by their shiny elytra which is typically shiny black or metallic green. The two main shapes for this family are oval and flat. The elytra is {{shorter than the}} thorax with typically two of the seven tergites exposed. Hister beetles have specialized heads that can retract into their <b>prothorax</b> and two elbowed antennae with clubbed ends. As predatory feeders, the Hister beetles commonly feed on the Egg, larval, and adult stages of other insects. [...] Certain species are also used to control livestock pests that infest dung or to control house flies. Histeridae are most active at night and they will play dead if they feel threatened.|$|E
50|$|Lagria cuprina {{can reach}} {{a length of}} about 9 mm. Body is oblong, <b>prothorax</b> is almost square, thorax and <b>prothorax</b> are densely punctuated. Elytra are reddish or coppery.|$|E
50|$|Emuelloidae {{are a small}} {{superfamily}} of trilobites, a {{group of}} extinct marine arthropods, that lived during the late Lower Cambrian (late Botomian) of the East Gondwana supercontinent, in what are today South-Australia and Antarctica. Emuelloidea can be recognized by having a <b>prothorax</b> consisting of 3 or 6 segments, the most backward {{one of which is}} carrying very large trailing spines. Behind it is the so-called opistothorax. There are two families, the Emuellidae (with a <b>prothorax</b> of six segments) and the Megapharanaspididae (with a <b>prothorax</b> of three segments).|$|E
50|$|The cryptic mantis (Sibylla pretiosa) is {{a species}} of mantis found in {{southern}} Africa. They grow to about 45 mm in length, and have a long and thin <b>prothorax.</b> The distinctively ornamented species has projections on the head, <b>prothorax</b> and four femurs. They live on tree bark in woodlands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>prothorax</b> on this conehead is {{shielded}} {{by a large}} pronotum {{that extends}} from over the cervix (neck) on the anterior side to cover the mesothorax {{and most of the}} metathorax on the posterior side, as well as covering the pleura on the <b>prothorax.</b> The pronotum of the <b>prothorax</b> may be simple in structure and small in comparison with the other nota, but in beetles, mantids, many bugs, and some Orthoptera, the pronotum is expanded, and in cockroaches, it forms a shield that covers part of the head and mesothorax.|$|E
50|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the <b>prothorax,</b> the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the <b>prothorax</b> has smaller plates.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} rather similar to Dinoptera collaris, but G. virginea is bright blue with strong {{metallic}} reflections while D. collaris is bright black without metallic reflections. Moreover the first species shows an obtuse tooth {{on the sides}} of the <b>prothorax,</b> while in the second the sides of the <b>prothorax</b> are rounded.|$|E
50|$|The orange-yellowish <b>prothorax</b> is {{the best}} way to {{identify}} the species.|$|E
50|$|Monachidium lunum {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 70 - 110 mm. These locusts show an {{astonishing}} aposematic pattern. Head and <b>prothorax</b> are yellow tan, <b>prothorax</b> has a high fairing, elytra are blackish green opaque, with trasversal yellow bands. Wings are dark blue, sometimes metallic violet. The abdomen is red and black. Antennae are yellow. Legs and tarsi are red.|$|E
