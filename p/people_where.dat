5|$|The Finnish {{historian}} T. I. Itkonen {{mentions that}} A.muscaria was once used among the Sami people: sorcerers in Inari would consume fly agarics with seven spots. In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and Hartmut Geerken {{published an article}} in which they claim to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a Parachi-speaking group in Afghanistan. There are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of A.muscaria among two Subarctic Native American tribes. Ojibwa ethnobotanist Keewaydinoquay Peschel reported its use among her <b>people,</b> <b>where</b> it {{was known as the}} miskwedo. This information was enthusiastically received by Wasson, although evidence from other sources was lacking. There is also one account of a Euro-American who claims to have been initiated into traditional Tlicho use of Amanita muscaria.|$|E

5|$|While {{the other}} three grand pre-Columbian civilisations—the Maya, Aztec and Inca—are known for their grand {{architecture}} {{in the form of}} pyramids, stelae, stone cities and temples, the modest Muisca architecture has left very little traces in the present. The houses (called bohíos or malokas) and temples of the <b>people,</b> <b>where</b> spiritual gatherings took place honouring the gods and sacrificing tunjos, emeralds and children, were made of degradable materials such as wood, clay and reed. The circular structures were built on top of slightly elevated platforms to prevent them from flooding on the frequently inundated plains; small settlements of ten to one hundred houses were surrounded by wooden poles forming an enclosure, called ca in Muysccubun. Two or more gates gave entrance to the villages. The houses and temples themselves were built around a central pole of wood attached to the roof; the temples were constructed using the wood of Guaiacum officinale tree, giving high quality construction. The floors of the open spaced houses were covered with straw or, for the caciques, with ceramic floors. Cloths were attached to the roof and painted with red and black colours. The houses and sacred places were adorned with tunjos and emeralds, and in some cases with the remains of human sacrifices.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{influences}} on Structural Marxism, {{primarily from the}} British Marxist historical tradition, included E.P. Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm and Raymond Williams. They criticized the functionalist emphasis in Structural Marxism, that neglected individuals in favour of the structural elements of their model. The British school {{was more interested in}} class, culture and politics, and placed human subjects at the centre of analysis. Where mode of production analysis was abstract, they focused on <b>people.</b> <b>Where</b> world-systems theory had little to say about the local, the Cultural Materialists began and ended there. Others connected with this school of thought concentrated on issues such as ethnic formation, labor migration, remittances, household formation, food production and the processes of colonialism.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Uruk period (c. 4100–2900 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of {{southern}} Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities (with populations of over 10,000 <b>people)</b> <b>where</b> centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area—from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as central Iran.|$|E
