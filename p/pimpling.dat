60|$|These loiterers are a true {{character}} of the scene. Some shrewd Scotch workmen may have paused {{on their way to}} a job, debating Church affairs and politics with their tools upon their arm. But the most part are of a different order--skulking jail-birds; unkempt, barefoot children; big-mouthed, robust women, in a sort of uniform of striped flannel petticoat and short tartan shawl: among these, a few supervising constables and a dismal sprinkling of mutineers and broken men from higher ranks in society, with some mark of better days upon them, like a brand. In a place no larger than Edinburgh, and where the traffic is mostly centred in five or six chief streets, the same face comes often under the notice of an idle stroller. In fact, from this point of view, Edinburgh is not so much a small city as the largest of small towns. It is scarce possible to avoid observing your neighbours; and I never yet heard of any one who tried. It has been my fortune, in this anonymous accidental way, to watch more than one of these downward travellers for some stages on the road to ruin. One man must have been upwards of sixty before I first observed him, and he made then a decent, personable figure in broadcloth of the best. For three years he kept falling--grease coming and buttons going from the square-skirted coat, the face puffing and <b>pimpling,</b> the shoulders growing bowed, the hair falling scant and grey upon his head; and the last that ever I saw of him, he was standing at the mouth of an entry with several men in moleskin, three parts drunk, and his old black raiment daubed with mud. I fancy that I still can hear him laugh. There was something heart-breaking in this gradual declension at so advanced an age; you would have thought a man of sixty out of the reach of these calamities; you would have thought that he was niched by that time into a safe place in life, whence he could pass quietly and honourably into the grave.|$|E

40|$|Cells of Candida albicans WO- 1 switch {{frequently}} and reversibly between two colony-forming phenotypes, white and opaque. In the white form, budding cells appear {{similar to those}} of most other strains of C. albicans, but in the opaque form, budding cells are larger, are bean shaped, and possess <b>pimples</b> on the wall. These <b>pimples</b> exhibit a unique and complex morphology. With scanning electron microscopy, a central pit can be discerned, and in many cases, a bleb can be observed emerging from the <b>pimple</b> center. With transmission electron microscopy, channels are evident in some <b>pimples</b> and vesicles are apparent under the <b>pimple</b> in the cytoplasm, in the actual wall of the <b>pimple,</b> or emerging from the tip of the <b>pimple.</b> A large vacuole predominates in the opaque-cell cytoplasm. This vacuole is usually filled with spaghettilike membranous material and in a minority of cases is filled with vesicles, many of which exhibit a relatively uniform size. An antiserum to opaque cells recognizes three opaque-cell-specific antigens with molecular masses of approximately 14. 5, 21, and 31 kilodaltons (kDa). Absorption with nonpermeabilized opaque cells demonstrated that only the 14. 5 -kDa antigen is on the cell surface; indirect immunogold labeling demonstrated that it is localized in or on the <b>pimple.</b> The possibility is suggested that the vacuole of opaque cells is the origin of membrane-bound vesicles which traverse the wall through specialized <b>pimple</b> structures and emerge from the <b>pimple</b> with an intact outer double membrane, a unique phenomenon in yeast cells. The opaque-cell-specific 14. 5 -kDa antigen either is in the <b>pimple</b> channel or is a component of the emerging vesicle. The functions of the unique opaque-cell <b>pimple</b> and emerging vesicle are not known...|$|R

A finite element model is developed to quantify the deformation field with the expansion of follicle, and then the mechanical stimulus is related to the sensation of pain during the development of <b>pimple.</b> Through these models, parametric studies show the dependence of mechanical stimulus and pain level on the pimple-surrounded structures, follicle depth and mechanical properties of the epidermis.

5000|$|In 1912, Fred and Joe Evans {{began working}} at the Ec-Ko studios in Teddington, and {{set up their own}} {{production}} company, Folly Films. [...] Unable to use the Charley Smiler character because of legal threats from Cricks and Martin, Evans devised a new character, <b>Pimple,</b> an accident-prone clown with a tight jacket, baggy pants, big boots, cricket cap, and lank strands of hair around a central parting. The films were scripted by Joe Evans. Early films were often chases; in <b>Pimple</b> and the Snake (1912), <b>Pimple</b> tries to retrieve a snake that has escaped from the zoo, but instead chases a lady's feather boa, causing chaos. By 1913, the comedies were increasingly spoofs of popular films, plays and novels. For example, a series of Lieutenant <b>Pimple</b> films poked fun at the screen exploits of the swashbuckling Lieutenant Daring, hero of more serious melodramas. <b>Pimple's</b> Battle of Waterloo (1913) was a merciless parody of the recent epic film The Battle of Waterloo, which had been characterised by location filming and (for the period) lavish production values. <b>Pimple's</b> version made a virtue of its low-budget filming in the backyard of their premises at Eel Pie Island to ridicule the earlier production. In <b>Pimple</b> in The Whip (1917), another parody, the Evans brothers used pantomime horses and a man wearing a horse head and carrying a stick in each hand to represent the front legs, to re-enact the original movie's thrilling race scenes. [...] The films also made use of jokey and punning intertitles.|$|R

50|$|Another major theory {{concerning}} {{the origin of}} <b>pimple</b> and prairie mounds argues that they are either coppice dunes or nebkhas formed by the accumulation of wind-blown sediments around clumps of vegetation. For example, based on grain-size data of and optically stimulated luminescence ages obtained from <b>pimple</b> mounds in the south-central United States, Seifert and others concluded that these mounds consisted of wind blown sediments that accumulated during prolonged late Holocene droughts. They suggest that although they superficially resemble the mima mounds of the northwestern United States, the <b>pimple</b> mounds of south-central United States have a greatly different origin from them.|$|R
