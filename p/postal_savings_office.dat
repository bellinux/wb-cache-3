5000|$|The first {{headquarters}} of the [...] "k.k. Postsparcassen-Amt" [...] (Imperial-Royal <b>Postal</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Office)</b> was opened on 12 January 1883 in the former Dominican Monastery building on Wollzeile street in the first Viennese district Innere Stadt. About 4,000 post office branches located throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire began offering their postal savings service to customers. The idea behind offering financial services at post offices was to promote public awareness and encourage saving. The added benefit of the system was to make important funds available {{to the state and}} to guarantee the security of the deposits with government liability.|$|E
50|$|Virtually all banking {{services}} were concentrated in urban areas. The newly independent government immediately designated the Dhaka {{branch of the}} State Bank of Pakistan as the central bank and renamed it the Bangladesh Bank. The bank was responsible for regulating currency, controlling credit and monetary policy, and administering exchange control and the official foreign exchange reserves. The Bangladesh government initially nationalised the entire domestic banking system and proceeded to reorganise and rename the various banks. Foreign-owned banks were permitted to continue doing business in Bangladesh. The insurance business was also nationalised and became a source of potential investment funds. Cooperative credit systems and <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> <b>offices</b> handled service to small individual and rural accounts. The new banking system succeeded in establishing reasonably efficient procedures for managing credit and foreign exchange. The primary function of the credit system throughout the 1970s was to finance trade and the public sector, which together absorbed 75 percent of total advances.|$|R

40|$|The former Minister Shizuka Kamei, who was {{appointed}} as the Minister for Financial Services during the premiership of Yukio Hatoyama, pushed reforms to change the previous goal of completely privatizing the postal services. The basic policy is that participation {{by the government in}} the businesses of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> will be practically maintained and the ceiling of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> will be raised from 10, 000, 000 yen to 20, 000, 000 yen. Therefore, in the present study we analyzed whether credit associations in a region whose share of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> is larger are being pressured to set higher deposit interest rates due to the presence of <b>postal</b> <b>savings.</b> The results showed that the presence of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> in a region does not pressure credit associations to set higher deposit interest rates, at least under the present conditions. It can thus be concluded that if a set of reforms is carried out which maintains the participation of the government in the Japan Post Bank, the ceiling of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> should be frozen at the present level. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the experience of}} the United States <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> system, and (in less detail) that of Japan, with a view to assessing the past and potential future role of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> in Japan. The immense size of Japan’s <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> system – accounting for one-third of household savings deposits and comprising the largest “bank ” in the world – means that the question of their disposition is central to any discussion of the future of Japan’s financial system as a whole. This study found that demand for <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> deposits is explained, in both countries, mainly by two variables: price (interestdifferentials) and confidence in private banks. Geographical accessibility in rural areas is of less, and diminishing, importance. It is argued that postal banking should be viewed as an alternative to publicly sponsored deposit insurance, as a means to assure households’ access to safe and convenient savings and payment services. This implies that reform discussion should focus on the possibility of restructuring <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> as a “narrow bank”, in such as way as to ensure that services are priced to fully reflect costs and risks incurred...|$|R
