This {{is due to the}} increaslingly stringent emission norms and the ambitious performance in terms of fuel consumption and <b>power</b> <b>request.</b> This, in turn, increases the demand and complexity of in-vehicle driving tests and diagnostic functionalities. As a consequence, along engine control systems development, each new software release results from a sequence of many others, each one introducing new functions seeking to satisfy, time after time, the demands. In this context, non-Regression testing is useful to verify that the performance and robustness of each software release does not decrease in relation with the previous one, or, in other terms, does not introduce regression.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an approach}} for driver-aware vehicle control based on stochastic model predictive control with learning (SMPCL). The framework combines the on-board learning of a Markov chain {{that represents the}} driver behavior, a scenario-based approach for stochastic optimization, and quadratic programming. By using quadratic programming, SMPCL can handle, in general, larger state dimension models than stochastic dynamic programming, and can reconfigure in real-time for accommodating changes in driver behavior. The SMPCL approach is demonstrated in the energy management of a series hybrid electrical vehicle, aimed at improving fuel efficiency while enforcing constraints on {{battery state of charge}} and power. The SMPCL controller allocates the power from the battery and the engine to meet the driver <b>power</b> <b>request.</b> A Markov chain that models the <b>power</b> <b>request</b> dynamics is learned in real-time to improve the prediction capabilities of model predictive control (MPC). Because of exploiting the learned pattern of the driver behavior, the proposed approach outperforms conventional model predictive control and shows performance close to MPC with full knowledge of future driver <b>power</b> <b>request</b> in standard and real-world driving cycles...|$|E
40|$|Smart grid is {{considered}} to be the next generation power system. Integrating information and communication technology, power electronics, and power system technologies, smart grid reduces excess power generation by better matching power generation with customer demands, and facilitates renewable power generation by closely monitoring renewable energy source status. Such a large-scale network may be subject to various attacks. In particular, authentication and user privacy preservation are considered two major security concerns. In this article, we first highlight the importance of smart grid security. Next we introduce a new <b>power</b> <b>request</b> paradigm in which a customer is allowed to submit a power usage plan in advance.

40|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} {{require a}} supervisory algorithm, {{often referred to}} as Energy Management Strategy (EMS), which governs the drivetrain components. In general the EMS objective is to minimize the fuel consumption subject to constraints on the components, vehicle performance and driver comfort. Typically, {{we have to deal with}} two difficulties in the design of EMS. First, the nonlinear behavior of the components results in a nonconvex cost function, complicating the use of optimization methods. In this paper, different approaches to deal with the nonconvexity are discussed. Secondly, the future <b>power</b> <b>request</b> trajectory is unknown. Prediction of the future <b>power</b> <b>request</b> trajectory, based upon either past or predicted vehicle velocity and road grade trajectories, could help in obtaining a solution close to optimal. The benefit of prediction, compared to a heuristic and optimal control strategy that uses only actual vehicle data, is shown with an example of a hybrid truck in a highway trajectory in a hilly environment. Results indicate that prediction has benefit only when the slopes have sufficient grade and length, such that the battery state-of-charge boundaries are reached...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{recent years}} fuel cell {{vehicles}} are rapidly appearing all over the globe. In less than 10 years, {{fuel cell vehicles}} have gone from mere research novelties to operating prototypes and demonstration models. At the same time, government and industry in development countries have teamed up to invest {{billions of dollars in}} partnerships intended to commercialize fuel cell vehicles within {{the early years of the}} 21 st century. The purpose of this study is evaluation of model and performance of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle in different drive cycles. A fuel cell system model developed in this work is a semi-experimental model that allows users to use the theory and experimental relationships in a fuel cell system. The model can be used as part of a complex fuel cell vehicle model in advanced vehicle simulator (ADVI-SOR). This work reveals that the fuel consumption and energy efficiency vary in different drive cycles. Arising acceleration and speed in a drive cycle leads to Fuel consumption increase. In addition, energy losses in drive cycle relates to fuel cell system <b>power</b> <b>request.</b> Parasitic power in different parts of fuel cell system will increase when <b>power</b> <b>request</b> increases.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{theoretical}} approach on energy-efficient scheduling problems arising in demand response {{management in the}} modern electrical smart grid. Consumers send in power requests with flexible feasible timeslots during which their requests can be served. The grid controller, upon receiving power requests, schedules each request within the specified interval. The electricity cost is measured by a convex function of the load in each timeslot. The objective is to schedule all requests with the minimum total electricity cost. We study the smart grid scheduling problem in different models. For the offline model, we prove the problem is NP-hard for the general case. We propose a polynomial time algorithm for special input where jobs have unit <b>power</b> <b>request</b> and unit time duration. By adapting the polynomial time algorithm for unit-size jobs, we propose an approximation algorithm for more general input. On the other hand, we also present an exact algorithm to find the optimal schedule for the problem with general input. For the online model, we propose an online algorithm for jobs with jobs with arbitrary <b>power</b> <b>request,</b> arbitrary time duration, and arbitrary contiguous feasible intervals. We also show a lower bound of the competitive ratio for the smart grid scheduling problem with unit height and arbitrary width. For special cases, we design different online algorithms with better competitive ratios. Finally, we look at other optimization problems and show how to solve them by adapting our techniques. We prove that our online algorithm can solve the machine minimization problem with an asymptotically optimal competitive ratio. We also show that our exact algorithm {{can be adapted to}} solve other demand response management problems...|$|E

The problem can be decoupled into a static optimization problem and a dynamic programming problem for a discrete time stochastic hybrid system.

The i-Energy concept is best characterized by a novel energy control method named “Energy on Demand (EoD). ” The novelties of EoD rest in (1) the explicit demand-based power supply control, (2) the best-effort power distribution based on appliance priorities, and (3) the ceiling control of power consumption. With EoD, people can attain the guaranteed reduction of energy consumption without damaging their quality of lives. Moreover, when utility companies are allowed to set and modify ceiling values based on contracts with consumers, EoD systems work as smart demand response systems.
