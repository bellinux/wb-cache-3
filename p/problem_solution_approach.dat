This coating protects ferritic steels from both steam and fireside corrosion on new coal-fired power plants operating under super-supercritical steam parameters. The computer model of the diffusion and oxidation based on a numerical solving of the differential equations of diffusion was developed, and its unknown parameters, namely the concentration-dependent aluminum diffusion coefficient, were identified from relatively short-term experimental tests up to 8000 h using the inverse <b>problem</b> <b>solution</b> <b>approach.</b> The model was then used for coating lifetime estimation and furthermore for obtaining the dependency of the lifetime on the initial coating thickness and on the critical beneath-surface aluminum content defined for the estimation...|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} three projects conducted by undergraduate students from Worcester Polytechnical Institute at the NASA's Lewis Research Center under a NASA Award NCC 3 - 312. The students involved in these projects spent part of the summer of 1993 at the Lewis Research Center (LeRC). The Principal Investigator at Worcester Polytechnic Institute was Professor Vahid Motevalli. Professor Motevalli served as the principal project advisor {{for two of the}} three projects which were in Mechanical Engineering. The third project was advised by Professor Duckworth of Electrical and Computer Engineering, while Professor Motevalli acted as the co-advisor. These projects provided an excellent opportunity for the students to participate in the cutting edge research and engineering design, interact with NASA engineers and gain valuable exposure to a real working environment. This report has been divided to three sections, representing the outcome of each of the separate projects.

40|$|Inverse problem {{solution}} {{methods have}} been widely used for nondestructive material characterization problems in a variety of fields, including structural engineering, material science, aerospace engineering and medicine. A traditional inverse <b>problem</b> <b>solution</b> <b>approach</b> for material characterization is to create a numerical representation of the system, such as a finite element model, combined with nonlinear optimization techniques to minimize the difference between the experimental response and the numerical representation. Unfortunately, due to the high computational cost of analyzing the numerical representation of many systems, it can often be impractical to solve a given inverse problem by this traditional method. A strategy for using reduced-order modeling, in particular the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) model reduction approach in inverse material characterization problems is presented in this work. POD is used to derive a low-dimensional basis from a finite set of full-order numerical analyses of the system. The governing equations of the system are projected onto the obtained POD basis to construct a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM is then used to replace the full-order modeling to reduce the high computational cost, while still keeping the accuracy of the response close to that of the full-order model. After that, the ROM is combined with a global optimization algorithm to identify an estimation of the material properties in the system. A case study of a damaged aluminum plate, which is subjected to a time-dependent harmonic sinusoidal excitation, is chosen to demonstrate that the ROM strategy is capable of accurately identifying material parameters of a system with minimal computational cost...|$|E

40|$|Multilevel Security {{describes}} {{the capability of}} a computer system or network to process information with different sensitivities. Sensitivities are in this context different security levels and needs-to-know- properties. The multilevel security computer system permits simultaneous access by users with different security clearances and needs-to-know properties. It also prevents users from obtaining access to information for which they lack authorization. Unfortunately, multilevel security computer systems have to fulfill many security restrictions. That leads directly to a decreased usability of the computer system. Therefore, this presentation offers solution ideas for increasing usability of multilevel security computer system. For this, we describe a label based model of multilevel security computer system by using of existing approaches and present the security restrictions of the system. After this, we show the negative influence of these restrictions to the usability of the system by modeling this multilevel security system with a special use case. This use case is the transfer of sensitive data to an unsecured network and the workflow of users with different security levels and needs-to-know properties. We show usability problems and present <b>problem</b> <b>solution</b> <b>approaches</b> to avoid or bypass these usability probelm (e. g. high level security gateways etc.) and we show how these <b>problem</b> <b>solution</b> <b>approaches</b> can be realized e. g. by use of methods from text classification...|$|R

Clearly parallel processing becomes mandatory to deal with such <b>problems.</b> <b>Solution</b> <b>approaches</b> for these <b>problems</b> include nested Decomposition and Interior Point Methods. The latter class in particular is appealing due to its flexibility with regard to model formulation and its amenability to parallelisation on massively parallel architectures.

There are some off-the-shelf tools to support grid planners in locating and sizing a given number of Distributed Generators (DGs), but they approach the problem using a single set of the variables (either location, size or number of DGs). This paper reviews the problem and provides a new pathway for supporting grid planning with an integrated view; hence, a new planning problem is formulated to jointly determine how many new DGs are needed, of which type, their location and size, while attempting to maximise the profit of the generators, minimise the system losses and improve the voltage profile.
