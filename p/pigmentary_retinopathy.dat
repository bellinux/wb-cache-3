40|$|Ocular {{morphology}} is speci cally {{directed at}} facilitating the transmittance of visible {{light to the}} retina {{for the purposes of}} pho-toreceptor absorption and phototransduction, thereby initiating the process of vision. By absorbing excess radiation, melanin sig-ni cantly enhances this process. It can also act as a photoprotec-tor by quenching reactive oxygen species and other radicals pro-duced {{as a result of the}} high oxygen dependency of the retina for its metabolism. However, melanin also binds numerous pharma-ceuticals, a process that can result in ocular toxicity. Although our understanding of this binding remains somewhat limited, melanin chemistry, its distribution, and other factors in uencing binding appear to play a signi cant role in predisposing ocular tissues, such as the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium, to toxicologi-cal insult. Many of the drugs that have been identi ed as causing these effects are known photosensitizers in which radiation plays a signi cant role in eliciting the pathologies. The phototoxic effects range from minor histological/chemical changes, which do not im-pact the quality of vision, to <b>pigmentary</b> <b>retinopathies,</b> which could potentially involve the loss of sight. Such effects, resulting from photosensitizer-drug binding to melanin, are to be separated from toxic effects, such as some ganglion cell abnormalities, that result from pharmaceuticals affecting ocular tissues directly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cone rod dystrophies (CRDs) (prevalence 1 / 40, 000) are {{inherited}} retinal dystrophies {{that belong}} {{to the group of}} <b>pigmentary</b> <b>retinopathies.</b> CRDs are characterized by retinal pigment deposits visible on fundus examination, predominantly localized to the macular region. In contrast to typical retinitis pigmentosa (RP), also called the rod cone dystrophies (RCDs) resulting from the primary loss in rod photoreceptors and later followed by the secondary loss in cone photoreceptors, CRDs reflect the opposite sequence of events. CRD is characterized by primary cone involvement, or, sometimes, by concomitant loss of both cones and rods that explains the predominant symptoms of CRDs: decreased visual acuity, color vision defects, photoaversion and decreased sensitivity in the central visual field, later followed by progressive loss in peripheral vision and night blindness. The clinical course of CRDs is generally more severe and rapid than that of RCDs, leading to earlier legal blindness and disability. At end stage, however, CRDs do not differ from RCDs. CRDs are most frequently non syndromic, but they may also be part of several syndromes, such as Bardet Biedl syndrome and Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7 (SCA 7). Non syndromic CRDs are genetically heterogeneous (ten cloned genes and three loci have been identified so far). The four major causative genes involved in the pathogenesis of CRDs are ABCA 4 (which causes Stargardt disease and also 30 to 60 % of autosomal recessive CRDs), CRX and GUCY 2 D (which are responsible for many reported cases of autosomal dominant CRDs), and RPGR (which causes about 2 / 3 of X-linked RP and also an undetermined percentage of X-linked CRDs). It is likely that highly deleterious mutations in genes that otherwise cause RP or macular dystrophy may also lead to CRDs. The diagnosis of CRDs is based on clinical history, fundus examination and electroretinogram. Molecular diagnosis can be made for some genes, genetic counseling is always advised. Currently, there is no therapy that stops the evolution of the disease or restores the vision, and the visual prognosis is poor. Management aims at slowing down the degenerative process, treating the complications and helping patients to cope with the social and psychological impact of blindness. </p...|$|R

50|$|Kearns-Sayre {{syndrome}} (KSS) is a {{mitochondrial myopathy}} with a typical onset before 20 years of age. KSS {{is a more}} severe syndromic variant of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (abbreviated CPEO), a syndrome that is characterized by isolated involvement of the muscles controlling movement of the eyelid (levator palpebrae, orbicularis oculi) and eye (extra-ocular muscles). This results in ptosis and ophthalmoplegia respectively. KSS involves {{a combination of the}} already described CPEO as well as <b>pigmentary</b> <b>retinopathy</b> in both eyes and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Other symptoms may include cerebellar ataxia, proximal muscle weakness, deafness, diabetes mellitus, growth hormone deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and other endocrinopathies. In both of these diseases, muscle involvement may begin unilaterally but always develops into a bilateral deficit, and the course is progressive. This discussion is limited specifically to the more severe and systemically involved variant.|$|E
5000|$|The triad of CPEO, {{bilateral}} <b>pigmentary</b> <b>retinopathy,</b> and cardiac conduction abnormalities {{was first}} {{described in a}} case report of two patients in 1958 by Thomas P. Kearns (1922-2011), MD., and George Pomeroy Sayre (1911-1992), MD. A second case was published in 1960 by Jager and co-authors reporting these symptoms in a 13-year-old boy. Previous cases of patients with CPEO dying suddenly had been published, occasionally documented as from a cardiac dysrhythmia. Other cases had noted a peculiar pigmentation of the retina, {{but none of these}} publications had documented these three pathologies occurring together as a genetic syndrome. [...] Kearns published a defining case in 1965 describing 9 unrelated cases with this triad. In 1988, the first connection was made between KSS and large-scale deletions of muscle mitochondrial DNA (abbreviated mtDNA) [...] Since this discovery, numerous deletions in mitochondrial DNA have been linked to the development of KSS.|$|E

40|$|Cohen {{syndrome}} (CS) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder with {{variability in the}} clinical manifestations, characterised by mental retardation, postnatal microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, <b>pigmentary</b> <b>retinopathy,</b> myopia, and intermittent neutropenia. Mutations in the gene COH 1 {{have been found in}} an ethnically diverse series of patients. Brief clinical descriptions of 24 patients with CS are provided. The patients were from 16 families of different ethnic backgrounds and between 2. 5 and 60 â€…years of age at assessment. DNA samples from all patients were analysed for mutations in COH 1 by direct sequencing. Splice site mutations were characterised using reverse transcriptase PCR analysis from total RNA samples. In this series, we detected 25 different COH 1 mutations; 19 of these were novel, including 9 nonsense mutations, 8 frameshift mutations, 4 verified splice site mutations, 3 larger in frame deletions, and 1 missense mutation. We observed marked variability of developmental and growth parameters. The typical facial gestalt was seen in 23 / 24 patients. Early onset progressive myopia was present in all the patients older than 5 â€…years. Widespread <b>pigmentary</b> <b>retinopathy</b> was found in 12 / 14 patients assessed over 5 â€…years of age. We present evidence for extended allelic heterogeneity of CS, with the vast majority of mutations leading to premature termination codons in COH 1.
