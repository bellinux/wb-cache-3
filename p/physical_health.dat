40|$|Background: Health {{scholars}} purport that park proximity {{and social}} support promotes <b>physical</b> activity and <b>health.</b> However, few studies examine the combined contributions of these constructs in shaping <b>physical</b> activity and <b>health.</b> Purpose: In this study, the contributions of environmental and social characteristics in shaping park use, <b>physical</b> activity, and <b>health</b> are examined. Methods: A survey was distributed to 1515 older adults in Cleveland, Ohio. Results: Path analysis indicated that social support was directly related to health. Perceived park walking proximity was related to <b>physical</b> activity and <b>health</b> through park use frequency. Park proximity was directly related to park use duration. Conclusions: Results suggest that environmental and social characteristics contribute to <b>physical</b> activity and <b>health,</b> but perceptions {{may also be a}} prerequisite to park use, daily <b>physical</b> activity, and <b>health...</b>|$|R

5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} and <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition. India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E

A literature review on why <b>physical</b> and mental <b>health</b> are separated and why these two areas need to be integrated was conducted. A conceptual framework for how to integrate <b>physical</b> and mental <b>health</b> promotion strategies was developed and applied to The Obesity Reduction Strategy for British Columbia.

5|$|An ala or hala (plural: ale or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. Ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely voracious, ale particularly like to eat children, though their gluttony is not limited to Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring the Sun or the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would mean {{the end of the world}} should they succeed. When people encounter an ala, their mental or <b>physical</b> <b>health,</b> or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in a good relationship with an ala is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived <b>physical</b> <b>health.</b> Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
