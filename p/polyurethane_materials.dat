So in this study flexibility, abrasion resistance and needle pressure stability are investigated by changing the hardness of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>materials.</b> In the experiment materials, named as Elastollan-C 60 A and Elastollan-C 70 A, are used as dust boots. During physical tests to be applied to the dust boot are as followed; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesive resistance, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter. During the aging tests, following steps are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test. Finally those <b>polyurethane</b> <b>materials,</b> used as dust boots, are applied according to the criteria of ASTM, and DIN in order to preserve tie rod ends from outer factors for a long time.

40|$|Abstract. The buffer {{made with}} {{polyurethane}} {{is widely used}} in light industry, automotive industry and mechanical industry especially in the electric cylinder of small and medium sizes because of its compact structure, economics and process ability convenient. Firstly, the properties of nonlinear material and the constitutive relation of the polyurethane were analyzed, above on which the compression and shear tests of the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>material</b> were conducted to determine its physics parameters. Then the mechanical tests of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>material</b> were simulated in the finite element simulation software ABAQUS by input the parameters obtained from the mechanical tests.

During the simulation, this paper researched the maximum deceleration of the mass block in models with different sizes of polyurethane buffers. Lastly, the size of the buffer with minimum volume which is agreed with the request of the maximum deceleration of the mass block is obtained by data handling, above on which a database was built...|$|R

In this study, 5 % by weight of the thermoplastic polyurethane material, aluminium tri hydroxide (ATH, (Al 2 O 3 3 H 2 O)) and magnesium hydroxide (MgOH, (Mg(OH) 2)) were added. Ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as an intumescent flame retardant with inorganic flame retardants were added to increase the flame resistance of produced composite structure. Tensile test, tear test, hardness and Izod impact tests were made and compared of those produced composites. As a result of experiments the addition of ATH has lowered the tensile strength and tear strength contrast to this the addition of MgOH has improved those properties.

40|$|Several shock {{studies have}} been made on <b>polyurethane</b> <b>materials,</b> both fully dense and {{distended}} {{in the form of}} foams. However, {{there is a lack of}} shock data between the densities of 0. 321 and 1. 264 g/cm 3 (fully dense). We present here data obtained from two different types of shock experiments at densities of 0. 35, 0. 5, 0. 68, 0. 78, and 0. 9 g/cm 3 in order to fill in the density deficiencies and make it easier to develop an unreacted equation of state (EOS) for polyurethane as a function of density. A thermodynamically consistent EOS was developed, based on the Helmholtz free energy, and was used to predict the shock properties of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>materials</b> at densities from 1. 264 to 0. 348 g/cm 3. These estimates are compared to the available data. The data match quite close to the predictions and provide a basis for calculating polyurethane foam shock processes. Chemical reaction has been observed at relatively high pressure (21. 7 GPa) in fully dense polyurethane in an earlier study, and the equation of state presented here is representative of the unreacted polyurethane foam. Lowering the density is expected to drop the shock pressure for chemical reaction, yet there is not enough data to address the low density shock reaction thresholds in this study...|$|E
