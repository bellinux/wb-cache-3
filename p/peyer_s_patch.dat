40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research presented here were twofold: to study the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) in cattle {{and to develop a}} strategy for intranasal immunization that would induce a strong mucosal and systemic immune response to a soluble antigen. ^ The NALT of cattle was compared with Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patches</b> and with parotid lymph node in terms of lymphocyte populations and expression of adhesion molecules by flow cytometry, the expression of vascular addressins using immunofluorescence, and the expression of cytokine mRNA by a semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The NALT was found to be structurally more similar to Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patches</b> than parotid lymph node, having similar numbers of B cells, T cell subsets, and activated and memory CD 4 + cells. However, in regard to expression of homing receptors (L-selectin and α 4 β 7 integrin) and vascular addressins (PNAd and MAdCAM- 1), NALT CD 4 + cells were more similar to parotid lymph node than to Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patches.</b> The results indicate that NALT and Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patches,</b> both part of the common mucosal immune system, probably utilize different homing receptors and vascular addressins in lymphocyte migration to these mucosal sites. NALT CD 4 + cells expressed a broader range of homing receptors {{and are more likely to}} migrate to a greater variety of tissues. In terms of cytokine mRNA expression, no differences in interleukin (IL) 4, IL- 10, and interferon gamma expression were observed in the NALT, Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patches,</b> and parotid lymph node. These cytokines were also expressed in freshly isolated cells from these tissues, indicated a lack of polarization towards a T helper 1 (Th 1) or Th 2 cytokines. ^ The results of three intranasal immunization studies in cattle indicate that it is possible to induce strong mucosal and systemic immune responses by intranasal administration of soluble antigens in cattle. The best results were obtained with antigen incorporated into alginate microparticies, with high levels of IgG 1 in the serum, nasal secretions, and to a lesser extent in saliva. The fact that most microparticles were less than 5 μm in diameter, which facilitated their uptake in the NALT, and the inherent adjuvanticity of the alginate may have contributed to the development of a strong humoral immune response. However, a vaccine formulation consisting of antigen adsorbed to 1 μm latex microspheres did not induce an immune response. Cholera toxin was used as an adjuvant in two studies where it was either admixed with or chemically conjugated to the antigen. In these studies, an immune response was observed, but results were not significant and in one study long periods and three immunizations were required before an immune response was detected. With optimization of factors such as the volume and dose of antigen, number and frequency of doses, presence of adjuvants, and technique of intranasal administration, it may be possible to induce strong mucosal and systemic immune response to soluble antigens by intranasal vaccinations. ...|$|R

While it has been demonstrated that the transepithelial transport of GPs is mediated by Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patch</b> M cells, the fate of the GPs once within gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is not known. Here we report that fluorescently labeled GPs administered to mice by gavage accumulate in CD 11 c+ DCs situated in Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patch</b> sub-epithelial dome (SED) regions. GPs appeared in DCs within minutes after gavage and remained within the SED for days afterwards. The co-administration or sequential administration of GPs with differentially labeled GPs or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles demonstrated that the SED DC subpopulation in question was capable of internalizing particles of different sizes and material compositions. Phenotypic analysis identified the GP-containing DCs as being CD 8 alpha- and CD 11 blo/-, suggesting they are the so-called myeloid and/or double negative (DN) subset(s) of PP DCs. A survey of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) known to be expressed by leukocytes within the intestinal mucosa revealed that GP-containing SED DCs were positive for Langerin (CD 207), a CLR with specificity for beta-D-glucan and that has been shown to mediate the internalization {{of a wide range of}} microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and fungi. The presence of Langerin+ DCs in the SED as determined by immunofluorescence was confirmed using Langerin E-GFP transgenic mice. In summary, our results demonstrate that following M cell-mediated transepithelial transport, GPs (and other micro/nanoparticles) are sampled by a population of SED DCs distinguished from other Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patch</b> DC subsets by their expression of Langerin.

40|$|The {{success of}} an oral vaccine {{depends upon the}} ability of the antigen to target the Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Patches</b> of the small intestine, uptake and {{presentation}} of the antigen to local immune effector cells, and the antigenicity of the antigen. Most proteins are poor mucosal immunogens and therefore have been coupled to a carrier molecule to target the Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Patches.</b> However, the carrier molecule must be immunologically inert so that it may be used for successive immunizations. Additionally many pathogenic bacteria are coated with carbohydrates and lipids which are weak immunogens. Therefore it is of value to develop vaccine strategies which employ proteins which mimic these antigens. These experiments investigated poly-D,L-glutamic acid for use as a delivery vehicle for oral immunization with protein antigens, and attempted to induce an idiotypic specific immune response at mucosal surfaces using idiotypic antibodies. ^ Tetanus toxoid mimicking anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced in a horse by immunizing it with anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies isolated from immune guinea pig sera. The anti-idiotypic antibodies were affinity purified using horse anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies. These anti-idiotypic antibodies specifically inhibited the binding of labelled tetanus toxoid to immobilized horse anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies. ^ Poly-D,L-glutamic acid produced by Bacillus licheniformis was isolated by ethanol precipitation and coupled with idiotypic antibodies for both parental and oral immunization. Horse antibodies coupled to the polymer retained antigen binding specificity as determined by binding to labelled antigen, and induced the same anti-xenotypic response as carrier free horse antibodies when injected into guinea pigs and rabbits. ^ Idiotypic antibody-polymer complexes were packaged in enteric coated gelatin capsules, tablets or suspended in NaHCO 3 and used to orally immunize primates, guinea pigs and mice respectively. No anti-xenotypic or anti-idiotypic antibodies were detected in the serum or secretion samples collected. These studies demonstrate that poly-D,L-glutamic acid does not optimize nonspecific uptake of protein antigen by Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Patches</b> but do not rule out the use of anti-idiotypic antibodies to induce immunity at mucosal surfaces. ...|$|R

Patch pipette solutions contained either 140 or 280 mM NaCl, and cells were bathed in a solution of 150 mM KCl to bring their resting potential close to zero.

The frequency of the low conductance openings varied in different patches from zero to 22 % of total openings.

40|$|Intraepithelial {{lymphocytes}} (IELs) play critical {{roles in}} gut immunity. In mice, gammadelta T cells {{are a large}} component of the IEL population. In the rat, gammadelta IELs are reportedly much less common, but technical issues suggest that previous analyses should be interpreted cautiously. The study of IELs in rats has been impeded by isolation procedures that are lengthy and complex, leading to small cell yields. For this reason, {{it is possible that}} rat IELs analyzed in previous studies have not been representative of the entire IEL compartment. We report a new method for the isolation of rat IELs that is based on the selective removal of intestinal epithelial cells under conditions that leave the basement membrane undisturbed. The method is rapid and requires neither enzymatic digestion, nor surgical removal of Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patches,</b> nor vigorous mechanical manipulation of the intestine. The yield of rat IELs using this method is 5 - to 10 -fold greater than that reported for other methods.

This paper is the second in a trilogy concerning the Grant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Patch</b> area of the Eastern Goldfields. The recent development of the VPmg potential field inversion program in conjunction with the acquisition of high-resolution gravity data over an area with extensive drilling provided an opportunity to evaluate three-dimensional gravity inversion as a bedrock and regolith mapping tool. An apparent density model of the study area was constructed, with the ground represented as adjoining 200 m by 200 m vertical rectangular prisms. During inversion VPmg incrementally adjusted the density of each prism until the free-air gravity response of the model replicated the observed data. For the Grant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Patch</b> study area, this image of the apparent density values proved easier to interpret than the Bouguer gravity image. A regolith layer was introduced into the model and realistic fresh-rock densities assigned to each basement prism according to its interpreted lithology. With the basement and regolith densities fixed, the VPmg inversion algorithm adjusted the depth to fresh basement until the misfit between the calculated and observed gravity response was minimised. The resulting geometry of the bedrock/regolith contact largely replicated the base of weathering indicated by drilling with predicted depth of weathering values from gravity inversion typically within 15...|$|R

Macrofaunal abundance in <b>S.</b> anglica <b>patches</b> was also lower than in native marsh (by 60 %), but not different from mudflat. There were no differences in biomass among habitats.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that swept-frequency {{backscatter}} ionograms covering {{a range of}} azimuths {{can be used to}} study the dynamics of sporadic-E clouds. A simple technique based on analytic ray tracing can be used to simulate the observed narrow traces associated with E <b>s</b> <b>patches.</b> This enables the location and extent of the sporadic-E clouds to be determined. The motion of clouds can then be determined from a time sequence of records. In order to demonstrate the method, results are presented from an initial study of 5 days of backscatter ionograms from the Jindalee Stage B data base obtained during March-April 1990. Usually 2 – 3 clouds were observed each day, mainly during the evening and up to midnight. The clouds lasted from 1 – 4 h and extended between 30 °– 80 ° in azimuth and 150 - 800 km in range. The clouds were mostly stationary or drifted generally westward with velocities of up to 80 m s – 1. Only one cloud was observed moving eastward...|$|R
40|$|Fcα/μR (CD 351) is an Fc {{receptor}} {{for both}} IgA and IgM, which is abundantly {{expressed in the}} small intestine. However, the role of Fcα/μR in the intestinal tissue is largely unknown. Here, we found that Fcα/μR is highly expressed on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patches</b> (PP) in the small intestine. Fcα/μR-deficient mice on the (129 x C 57 BL/ 6) F 1 background showed increased serum, but not fecal, IgA level in response to gut-oriented antigens. IgA+ B cells were increased in PP, {{but not in the}} lamina propria, of Fcα/μR-deficient mice, which was attenuated after reduction of commensal microbiota by oral treatment with antibiotics. Analyses of bone marrow chimeric mice, in which either FDCs or blood cells or both lack the expression of Fcα/μR, suggested that FDCs, but not blood cells, were responsible for the increased serum IgA concentration in Fcα/μR-deficient mice. Moreover, Fcα/μR-deficient mice showed enhanced germinal center formation against commensal microbiota in PP. Thus, serum IgA production against gut-oriented antigens is negatively regulated by Fcα/μR on FDCs in the F 1 mice...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the role of CD 4 and CD 8 cells on specific antibody production by murine Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patch</b> (PP) cells after oral immunization with Actinomyces viscosus in mice. Female DBA/ 2 mice were orally immunized with three low doses of heat-killed A. viscosus. Sham-immunized mice served as a control group. Mice were depleted of CD 4 or CD 8 cells by intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD 4 or anti-CD 8 antibodies daily for 3 days before oral immunization. One week after the last oral immunization, PPs were removed and cell suspensions were cultured with A. viscosus. Specific antibody production in the culture supernatants was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that oral immunization with A. viscosus induced a predominant specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) response by PP cells and, to a lesser extent, IgM antibodies. Depletion of CD 4 but not CD 8 cells suppressed the production of specific antibodies. These results suggest that oral immunization with low doses of A. viscosus may induce the production of specific antibodies by murine PP cells in a CD 4 -cell-dependent fashion...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{recovery}} of pioneer shrub and forest patch cover can reduce soil erosion, nutrient runoff and degradation of stream habitats, and promote small mammal and avian biodiversity following stand-replacing wildfires. Landsat imagery {{from the past}} 25 + years was analyzed to understand patterns and rates of vegetation recovery, focusing on high burn severity (HBS) patches, within wildfire areas dating from the late 1940 s in the Sierra-Nevada region of California. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) levels indicative of recovered woody cover within HBS areas were analyzed starting in 1985 to quantify regrowth of patch dynamics. Analysis of landscape me-trics showed {{that the percentage of}} total HBS area comprised by the largest patch of recovered woody cover was relatively small in all fires that occurred since 1995, but increased rapidly with time since fire. Patch complexity of recovered woody cover decreased notably after more than 50 years of regrowth, but was not readily associated with time for fires that occurred since the mid 1990 <b>s.</b> <b>Patch</b> complexity of dense woody cover was consistently high in fires after 1995 and in-creased with the elevation of HBS areas. The aggregation level of patches with {{recovery of}} woody cover increased steadily with time since fire. The study approach using satellite remote sensin...|$|R
40|$|Developing efficacious {{vaccines}} against enteric diseases is {{a global}} challenge that requires {{a better understanding of}} cellular recruitment dynamics at the mucosal surfaces. The current paradigm of T cell homing to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract involves the induction of ? 4 ? 7 and CCR 9 by Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patch</b> and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) dendritic cells (DCs) in a retinoic acid-dependent manner. This paradigm, however, cannot be reconciled with reports of GI T cell responses after intranasal (i. n.) delivery of antigens that do not directly target the GI lymphoid tissue. To explore alternative pathways of cellular migration, we have investigated the ability of DCs from mucosal and nonmucosal tissues to recruit lymphocytes to the GI tract. Unexpectedly, we found that lung DCs, like CD 103 (+) MLN DCs, up-regulate the gut-homing integrin ? 4 ? 7 in vitro and in vivo, and induce T cell migration to the GI tract in vivo. Consistent with a role for this pathway in generating mucosal immune responses, lung DC targeting by i. n. immunization induced protective immunity against enteric challenge with a highly pathogenic strain of Salmonella. The present report demonstrates novel functional evidence of mucosal cross talk mediated by DCs, which has the potential to inform the design of novel vaccines against mucosal pathogens...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the changes of land uses and landscape {{patterns in the}} Ganspoel Catchment, central Belgium, using aerial photography interpretation (photographs taken in 1947, 1969 and 1986). The comparison of land cover areal changes and a transition matrix {{were used to assess}} land-use changes in time and space. The size, fractal dimension and elongation index of patches were quantified for landscape pattern analysis. Grassland increased and farmland decreased in the study area from the 1940 s to the 1980 s. Forest increased from 1947 to 1969 and decreased from 1969 to 1986. About 49 per cent of the study area experienced changes of land use between 1947 and 1969, and about 36 per cent between 1969 and 1986. The landscape of the study area is more fragmented {{than it was in the}} 1940 <b>s.</b> <b>Patches</b> have generally increased in number and decreased in size, although the landscape was most fragmented in 1969; fractal dimension of patches are lower, indicating less complex shapes. From 1969 to 1986, 59 per cent of the area of change was on 0 - 3 degree slopes, and from 1969 to 1986 6. 7 per cent was on > 8 degree slopes. Changing land uses and landscape patterns may have important ecological implications...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium {{possesses}} a multi-copper-ion oxidase (multicopper oxidase), CueO (also known as CuiD), a periplasmic enzyme {{known to be}} required for resistance to copper ions. CueO from S. Typhimurium was expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein exhibited a high cuprous oxidase activity. We have characterized an S. Typhimurium cueO mutant and confirmed {{that it is more}} sensitive to copper ions. Using a murine model of infection, it was observed that the cueO mutant was significantly attenuated, as indicated by reduced recovery of bacteria from liver and spleen, although {{there was no significant difference}} in recovery from Peyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>patches</b> and mesenteric lymph nodes. However, the intracellular survival of the cueO mutant in unprimed or gamma-interferon-primed murine macrophages was not statistically different from that of wild-type Salmonella, suggesting that additional host factors are involved in clearance of the cueO mutant. Unlike a cueO mutant from E. coli, the S. Typhimurium cueO mutant did not show greater sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and its sensitivity to copper ions was not affected by siderophores. Similarly, the S. Typhimurium cueO mutant was not rescued from copper ion toxicity by addition of the branched-chain amino acids and leucine...|$|R
40|$|We used {{quantitative}} confocal microscopy {{to measure}} the numbers of 16 proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins during assembly and disassembly of endocytic actin patches in fission yeast. The peak numbers of each molecule that accumulate in patches varied < 30 – 50 % between individual patches. The pathway begins with accumulation of 30 – 40 clathrin molecules, sufficient to build a hemisphere {{at the tip of}} a plasma membrane invagination. Thereafter precisely timed waves of proteins reach characteristic peak numbers: endocytic adaptor proteins (120 End 4 p and 230 Pan 1 p), activators of Arp 2 / 3 complex (200 Wsp 1 p and 340 Myo 1 p) and 300 Arp 2 / 3 complexes just ahead of a burst of actin assembly into short, capped and highly cross-linked filaments (7000 actins, 200 capping proteins, and 900 fimbrins). Coronin arrives last as all other components disperse upon patch internalization and movement over 10 <b>s.</b> <b>Patch</b> internalization occurs without recruitment of dynamins. Mathematical modeling, described in the accompanying paper (Berro et al., 2010, MBoC 21 : 2803 – 2813), shows that the dendritic nucleation hypothesis can account for the time course of actin assembly into a branched network of several hundred filaments 100 – 200 nm long and that patch disassembly requires actin filament fragmentation in addition to depolymerization from the ends...|$|R
