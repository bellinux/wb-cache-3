Results indicate that when the subsidy is tied to the factor as a <b>per-unit</b> <b>subsidy,</b> regardless of full or asymmetric knowledge for market participants, subsidized factor buyers distribute nearly 22 percent of the subsidy to factor sellers. When the subsidy is fully decoupled from the factor, as is the case with the annual payment, payment incidence is mitigated and prices are not statistically different from the no-policy treatment. laboratory market experiments, agricultural subsidies, subsidy incidence, land market, ex ante policy analysis, Agricultural and Food Policy, Institutional and Behavioral Economics, Q 18, D 03, C 92,...|$|E
40|$|A {{calibrated}} {{model is}} {{used to determine the}} welfare impacts of various regulatory instruments for improving health. The results of a lab experiment are integrated in a partial equilibrium model representing demands for two kinds of fish, one with higher nutritional benefits (canned sardines) and one with higher contamination risks (canned tuna) in France. In the laboratory, information about health effects leads to a statistically significant decrease (increase) in the willingness to pay for tuna (sardines). Simulations with the laboratory results show that, for most cases, a per-unit tax on tuna and a <b>per-unit</b> <b>subsidy</b> on sardines without any information revealed to consumers lead to the highest welfare, because both the tax and subsidy directly internalize health characteristics. The information policy combined with a per-unit tax on tuna and a <b>per-unit</b> <b>subsidy</b> on sardines is socially profitable only if a large proportion of consumers (greater than 95 %) receives health information. health, information, regulation, taxation. ...|$|E

If the policies consist of only per-unit tax/subsidies either on the final goods or on the inputs, it is optimal for the governments to impose taxes. However, if the governments can impose profit taxes on input production and per-unit tax/subsidies either on the final goods or on the inputs, it is optimal to impose <b>per-unit</b> <b>subsidies</b> along with a positive profit tax on the inputs. We find that the per-unit tax/subsidies on the final goods are perfect substitutes to per-unit tax/subsidies on the inputs. These results hold whether the input suppliers are the same firms or different firms. Foreign input supplier, Non-tradable input, Per-unit tax/subsidy, Profit tax, Strategic policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to measure individuals’ fairness expectations and relate them to their market behavior in a private-negotiation institution. By doing this, we may inform model parameterization of field data and increase understanding of payment incidence causation. We hypothesize agents will change both their market and UG behavior when the tenant/proposer receives a subsidy following a successful negotiation. We also hypothesize that agents’ market behavior does relate to their fairness expectations in the UG. Two economic experiments were developed to test our hypotheses, a market and an ultimatum bargaining game experiment. We recruited 106 undergraduate students and conducted the experiments in an experimental laboratory using a computer based market mechanism. Our findings suggest fairness expectations need to be considered as a possible constraint on agents’ profit maximization behavior in land markets. The experimental evidence indicates market sellers or landlords demand higher land rental prices when tenants receive <b>per-unit</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Their ability to obtain a higher price appears to be more formidable in markets with limited matching opportunities. We conclude fairness expectations may constrain individuals’ profit-maximization behavior in the land market and, in turn, affect payment incidence in this market.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a duopoly competing in quantity, where firms can invest in R&D {{to control their}} emissions. We distinguish between efforts carried out to acquire first-hand knowledge (inventive R&D) and efforts made to develop an absorptive capacity {{to be able to}} capture part of the knowledge developed by the rival. There are also free R&D spillovers between firms. We show that a regulator can reach the first best by using three regulatory instruments, which are a per-unit emissions tax, a per-unit inventive-research subsidy and a per-unit absorptive-research subsidy. The socially optimal R&D level for inventive research is higher than the one for absorptive capacity, even when the investment-cost parameters for inventive and absorptive research are equal and when there is both very little free spillover and a very high learning parameter. Interestingly, when the free spillover is high enough, the regulator gives a greater <b>per-unit</b> <b>subsidy</b> to inventive research, and when it is low enough and the marginal damage cost of pollution is sufficiently high, he supports absorptive research to strengthen R&D spillovers. Moreover, inventive research is actually taxed when the free spillover is low and the marginal damage cost of pollution is high. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a non-cooperative three-stage game played by two regulator-firm hierarchies. We suppose that raising public funds is socially costly and that market sizes are large enough.

However, we think that these results might change if the market sizes are not too large or if we introduce asymmetric information.

These firms compete on the same market where they offer the same homogeneous good, and can invest in R&D to lower their emission/output ratio. By means of a tax per-unit of pollution and a <b>subsidy</b> <b>per-unit</b> of R&D level, the regulator can induce the first best outcome, when the marginal cost of production is increasing.

40|$|The authors {{consider}} a symmetric model {{composed of two}} countries and a firm in each country. Firms produce the same good {{by means of a}} polluting technology which uses fossil energy. However, these firms can adopt a clean technology which uses a renewable energy having a lower unit cost. Surprisingly, opening markets to international competition increases the per-unit emission-tax and decreases the <b>per-unit</b> production <b>subsidy.</b> Interestingly, the socially optimal adoption date under a common market better internalizes transboundary pollution than that under autarky. It also better internalizes transboundary pollution compared with the optimal adoption dates for firms. In autarky (resp. a common market), firms adopt the clean technology earlier (resp. later) than what is socially optimal and, therefore, regulators can induce clean technology adoption at the socially optimal adoption date by giving firms postpone (resp. speed up) adoption subsidies. Opening markets to international trade, speeds up socially optimal adoption dates and delays optimal adoption dates for firms. Consequently, with market opening, speed up adoption subsidies are needed to reduce the global flow of pollution...|$|R
40|$|Many {{firms and}} {{organizations}} compete for customers {{while at the}} same time receiving substantial funding from outside sources, such as government subsidies. In this paper, we study the effects of two commonly observed, alternative subsidy systems on the behavior of price-competing firms. Specifically, we compare an open-ended <b>per-unit</b> price <b>subsidy</b> with a closed-ended subsidy, allocated according to the firms’ market shares. We find that, holding the total subsidy budget constant, the open-ended subsidy results in fiercer price competition, lower prices, higher output, and lower profits than the closed-ended, market-share based alternative. Second, the open system yields higher overall welfare for relatively modest subsidies and limited substitutability between goods; the closed system performs better at relatively high subsidy levels and when goods are closer substitutes. Third, a market-share based subsidy makes collusive behavior between firms much harder. Our results, therefore, suggest a potential trade-off between short-run and long-run objectives: subsidies designed to widen participation may stimulate collusive behavior. These findings may have important policy implications for the design of subsidy systems in, among many others, education and the arts.

40|$|Research Question: What are {{the impacts}} of the {{regulatory}} framework on various business model designs in the Swedish solar energy industry? Background & Problem: The Swedish solar energy sector remains in its infancy as business models find their bearings. With significant capital requirements and complex transactions required to deliver solar energy solutions to a customer segment, the sector welcomes the a regulatory framework that promotes industry and market growth. Meanwhile, such a framework effectively propels the government’s ambitions to dislodge the nation from being overly dependent on fossil fuels. As would befit the above rationale, there are subsidies in place to promote {{the growth of the}} solar energy sector in Sweden. However, in mid- 2016, the government implemented an indirect, per-kw tax on any producer of solar energy with an aggregate production capacity above 255 kw. Economic rationale holds that this effect would erode the desired effect of the subsidy and keep firms’ deal sizes within the austere confinements of 255 kw. The surprising implementation of the policy begs to ask how effective government policies are at doing what they intend and whether these policies have the intended effect on all business model designs in the solar energy industry. Methodology: This report entails a multiple-case study whereby data has been gathered from three firms in the Swedish solar energy industry. The data gathering process has employed a qualitative approach whereby the firms have been represented by individuals with elevated positions at each firm. An analysis has tied together the empirical data with a theoretical framework that builds on economic theory, business model design and supporting elements in order to make inferences that may befit an answer to the research question. Results & Conclusion: Results indicate that one regulatory framework may have different impacts to the performance, goals and ambitions of various business model designs. Those designs who target a customer segment that is also the end user are also most exposed to both the solar energy tax and the investment subsidy. However, depending on the interlinkages between the various elements of such business models, the effects of these policies may be coordinated. One company is positioned further with behind in the supply chain and {{takes the form of a}} retailer of products. The company in question is to a greater extent immunized from the solar energy tax, however, evidence suggests that the firm in question is also cut off from the benefits of the subsidy. The results also indicate that <b>per-unit</b> <b>subsidies,</b> as advocated for by the retailer, would have drastically different benefits for the companies. Conclusion remarks posit that the frequent changes to the regulatory framework, the conflict policies and the narrow scopes that their intent projects cause disturbances in the young industry. By nature, business models should be dynamic and iterative, however, when an exogenous force as provocative as the government is highly volatile, they are given few incentives to spread wings and fly towards the sun.

40|$|Where {{there is}} a fixed stock of a depletable resource, Pareto {{optimality}} requires {{that the difference between}} price and marginal cost of extraction rise at the interest rate. In competitive equilibrium, this condition is ful-filled. A monopolist, however, supplies the resource {{in such a way that}} the difference between marginal revenue and marginal extraction cost rises at the 1 / rate of interest. - As a result, a monopolist will not in general supply the resource efficiently. Depending on the nature of demand, he may supply either more or less rapidly than is required for Pareto optimality. Here we address the question of how a goverment might specify in advance a time path of <b>per-unit</b> tax or <b>subsidy</b> rates on quantities supplied so as to induce the monopolist to supply the resource efficiently over time. - The principle employed is simple.
