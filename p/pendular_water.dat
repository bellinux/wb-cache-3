40|$|Evaluation of solute {{diffusion}} in unsaturated porous gravel is {{very important}} for investigations of contaminant transport and remediation, risk assessment, and waste disposal (for example, the potential high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada). For a porous aggregate medium such as granular tuff, the total water content is comprised of surface water and interior water. The surface water component (water film around grains and <b>pendular</b> <b>water</b> between the grain contacts) could serve as a predominant diffusion pathway. To investigate the extent to which surface water films and contact points affect solute diffusion in unsaturated gravel, we examined the configuration of water using x-ray computed tomography in partially saturated gravel, and made quantitative measurements of diffusion at multiple water contents using two different techniques. In the first, diffusion coefficients of potassium chloride in 2 - 4 mm granular tuff at multiple water contents were calculated from electrical conductivity measurements using the Nernst-Einstein equation. In the second, we used laser ablation with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to perform micro-scale mapping, allowing the measurement of diffusion coefficients for a mixture of chemical tracers for tuff cubes and tetrahedrons having two contact geometries (cube-cube and cube-tetrahedron). The x-ray computed tomography images show limited contact between grains, and this could hinder the pathways for diffusive transport. Experimental results show the critical role of surface water in controlling transport pathways and hence the magnitude of diffusion. Even with a bulk volumetric water content of 1. 5 %, the measured solute diffusion coefficient is as low as 1. 5 x 10 {sup - 14 } m{sup 2 }/s for tuff gravel. Currently used diffusion models relating diffusion coefficients to total volumetric water content inadequately describe unsaturated diffusion behavior in porous gravel at very low water contents...|$|E
40|$|Understanding hillslope runoff {{response}} to intense rainfall {{is an important}} topic in hydrology, and is key to correct prediction of extreme stream flow, erosion and landslides. Although {{it is known that}} preferential flow processes activated by macropores are an important phenomena in understanding runoff processes inside a hillslope, hydrological models have generally not embraced the concept of an extra parameter that represents ‘macropores’ because of the complexity of the phenomenon. Therefore, it is relevant to investigate the influence of macropores on runoff processes in an experimental small artificial hillslope. Here, we report on a controlled experiment where we could isolate the influence of macropores without the need for assumptions regarding their characteristics. Two identical hillslopes were designed, of which one was filled with artificial macropores. Twelve artificial rainfall events were applied to the two hillslopes and results of drainage and soil moisture were investigated. After the experiments, it could be concluded that the influence of macropores on runoff processes was minimal. The S 90 sand used for this research caused runoff to respond fast to rainfall, leading to little or no development of saturation near the macropores. In addition, soil moisture data showed a large amount of <b>pendular</b> <b>water</b> in the hillslopes, which implies that the soil has a low air entry value, and, in combination with the lack of vertical flow, could have caused the pressure difference between the matrix and the macropores to vanish sooner and result in equilibrium being reached in a relatively short time. Nevertheless, a better outline is given to determine a correct sand type for these types of experiments and, by using drainage recession analysis to investigate the influences of macropores on runoff, heterogeneity in rainfall intensity can be overcome. This study is a good point of reference to start future experiments from concerning macropores and hillslope hydrology...|$|E
40|$|Microwave radiometric {{measurements}} of a wet snowpack require precise {{understanding of the}} absorption of liquid water in the snowpack. It is known that <b>pendular</b> rings of <b>water</b> naturally form in a wet snowpack at low liquid saturation levels, and therefore {{it is important to}} characterize the absorption of these rings. In this paper we derive the absorption, extinction and total scattering cross sections of a pendular ring in terms of the electric polarizability tensor of the ring. We then compare these cross sections of pendular rings to that of spheres of the same volume. Results show that the absorption cross section of a pendular ring is consistently greater than that of a sphere. As the volume of the particle decreases, these differences become more substantial...|$|R
40|$|The micro-mechanism of the {{capillary}} strengthening {{effect is}} studied {{in this paper}} {{with the aid of}} Discrete Element Methods (DEM) and the Stress-Force-Fabric (SFF) relationship. For an unsaturated granular material in <b>pendular</b> regime, pore <b>water</b> is discontinuously distributed at contact points in the form of capillary bridges, leading to the capillary force being the sum of the force component induced by air-water pressure difference on the section of the bridge neck and the force component induced by surface tension. Such a formulated contact model has been implemented in the DEM simulations. Directional statistical theory has been applied to study the statistical features of the contact interactions, the water bridges and the capillary forces. The impact of water bridges on the strength of unsaturated granular material has been interpreted through the SFF relationship to explain the capillary strengthening effect. Specimens with more uniform water distributions were found of higher shear strength, suggesting the impact for water distributions, a topic for more research...|$|R
40|$|The radiobrightness of a snowpack is {{strongly}} {{linked to the}} snow moisture content profile, {{to the point that}} the only operational inversion algorithms require dry snow. Forward dynamic models do not include the effects of freezing and thawing of the soil beneath the snowpack and the effect of vegetation within the snow or above the snow. To get a more realistic description of the evolution of the snowpack, we reported an addition to the Snow-Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere- Transfer (SSVAT) model, wherein we coupled soil processes of the Land Surface Process (LSP) model with the snow model SNTHERM. In the near future we will be adding a radiobrightness prediction based on the modeled moisture, temperature and snow grain size profiles. The initial investigations with this SSVAT for a late winter and early spring snow pack indicate that soil processes warm the snowpack and the soil. Vapor diffusion needs to be considered whenever the ground is thawed. In the early spring, heat flow from the ground into a snow and a strong temperature gradient across the snow lead to thermal convection. The buried vegetation can be ignored for a late winter snow pack. The warmer surface snow temperature will affect radiobrightness since it is most sensitive to snow surface characteristics. Comparison to data shows that SSVAT provides a more realistic representation of the temperature and moisture profiles in the snowpack and its underlying soil than SNTHERM. The radiobrightness module will be optimized for the prediction of brightness when the snow is moist. The liquid water content of snow causes considerable absorption compared to dry snow, and so longer wavelengths are likely to be most revealing as to the state of a moist snowpack. For volumetric moisture contents below about 7 % (the <b>pendular</b> regime), the <b>water</b> forms rings around the contact points between snow grains. Electrostatic modeling of these pendular rings shows that the absorption of these rings is significantly higher than a sphere of the same volume. The first implementation of the radiobrightness module will therefore be a simple radiative transfer model without scattering...|$|R
40|$|A {{geological}} medium that exhibits two distinct types of flow {{is known as}} dual-permeability medium. Unconsolidated deposits composed of coarse (3 ̆e 2 mm diameter) clasts (gravel, talus, rockslide debris), engineered systems (heap leach piles, capillary barriers, rock fill), and mine/construction waste fall into this category. The large inter-clast pores that are characteristic {{of this type of}} media will drain at near zero matric potentials constraining flow to the interiors of porous clasts and/or the clast surfaces. In either case, water must pass through hydraulic bridges (porous contacts and/or <b>pendular</b> <b>water)</b> that form physical connections between neighboring clasts. Therefore, properties of hydraulic connections place a primary control on flow structure. This dissertation presents three projects designed to study the influence of hydraulic connections on unsaturated flow in dual-permeability media. A numerical experiment performed to examine how the cross-sectional area and hydraulic conductivity of a bridge influence steady-state flow through a spherical clast is presented in the second chapter of the dissertation. The cross-sectional area of the bridges relative to that of the clast (Ar) was varied across six orders of magnitude between simulations. The ratio of hydraulic conductivity between bridges and clasts (Kb/Kc) was varied across 12 orders of magnitude to consider resistive, neutral, and conductive bridges. Results show a non-linear dependency of volumetric flow through the clast on both Ar and Kb/Kc. The intra-clast flow distribution shifts outwards as Ar increases. Conductive bridges promote this process and resistive bridges impede it. The third chapter presents a series of bench-scale experiments performed to evaluate the geometry of a pendular bridge under different flow rates through it and at different inclinations. Results show that bridge size increases in a nonlinear fashion with flow rate and decreases with inclination from vertical. The vertical profile of the bridge closely resembled a parabola in all experiments, in contrast to the profile of a static bridge that resembles the arc of a circle. Bridge geometry was independent of flow history. Flow is active through the entire volume of the bridge and exhibits non-laminar characteristics. The fourth chapter describes a series of bench-scale experiments designed to explore the influence of matrix-to-matrix hydraulic connections on two-dimensional transient wetting of a porous matrix. Cross-sectional area of the connection (Ar) relative to that of the matrix block and location of the connection relative to edges of the block were varied between trials. Results show that the rate of imbibition into the porous block nonlinearly increases with Ar. Moving the connection towards an edge of the block significantly decreases the imbibition rate. Saturation increase of the matrix block before the wetting front reaches all edges remains consistent independent of the connection. The last chapter summarizes results of the research and discusses about future research on this topic...|$|E
40|$|Forming {{representative}} gas hydrate-bearing laboratory samples {{is important}} {{so that the}} properties of these materials may be measured, while controlling the composition and other variables. Natural samples are rare, and have often experienced pressure and temperature changes that may affect the property to be measured [Waite et al., 2008]. Forming methane hydrate samples in the laboratory has been done a number of ways, each having advantages and disadvantages. The ice-to-hydrate method [Stern et al., 1996], contacts melting ice with methane at the appropriate pressure to form hydrate. The hydrate can then be crushed and mixed with mineral grains under controlled conditions, and then compacted to create laboratory samples of methane hydrate in a mineral medium. The hydrate in these samples {{will be part of}} the load-bearing frame of the medium. In the excess gas method [Handa and Stupin, 1992], water is distributed throughout a mineral medium (e. g. packed moist sand, drained sand, moistened silica gel, other porous media) and the mixture is brought to hydrate-stable conditions (chilled and pressurized with gas), allowing hydrate to form. This method typically produces grain-cementing hydrate from <b>pendular</b> <b>water</b> in sand [Waite et al., 2004]. In the dissolved gas method [Tohidi et al., 2002], water with sufficient dissolved guest molecules is brought to hydrate-stable conditions where hydrate forms. In the laboratory, this is can be done by pre-dissolving the gas of interest in water and then introducing it to the sample under the appropriate conditions. With this method, it is easier to form hydrate from more soluble gases such as carbon dioxide. It is thought that this method more closely simulates the way most natural gas hydrate has formed. Laboratory implementation, however, is difficult, and sample formation is prohibitively time consuming [Minagawa et al., 2005; Spangenberg and Kulenkampff, 2005]. In another version of this technique, a specified quantity of gas is placed in a sample, then the sample is flooded with water and cooled [Priest et al., 2009]. We have performed a number of tests in which hydrate was formed and the uniformity of the hydrate formation was examined. These tests have primarily used a variety of modifications of the excess gas method to make the hydrate, although we have also used a version of the excess water technique. Early on, we found difficulties in creating uniform samples with a particular sand/ initial water saturation combination (F- 110 Sand, {approx} 35 % initial water saturation). In many of our tests we selected this combination intentionally to determine whether we could use a method to make the samples uniform. The following methods were examined: Excess gas, Freeze/thaw/form, Freeze/pressurize/thaw, Excess gas followed by water saturation, Excess water, Sand and kaolinite, Use of a nucleation enhancer (SnoMax), and Use of salt in the water. Below, each method, the underlying hypothesis, and our results are briefly presented, followed by a brief conclusion. Many of the hypotheses investigated are not our own, but were presented to us. Much of the data presented is from x-ray CT scanning our samples. The x-ray CT scanner provides a three-dimensional density map of our samples. From this map and the physics that is occurring in our samples, we are able to gain an understanding of the spatial nature of the processes that occur, and attribute them to the locations where they occur...|$|E
