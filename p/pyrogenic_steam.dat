30|$|A wet {{oxidation}} process using <b>pyrogenic</b> <b>steam</b> at 800  °C {{has been applied}} on 250  μm thick boron-doped (0.5  Ω cm) high-quality float zone (FZ) silicon to study its suitability for rear side passivation at Fraunhofer ISE [50, 51]. In the long-wavelength region of incident photons, this wet oxidized rear passivation has high internal reflectance which leads to an absolute gain of 6  % in both Jsc and Voc compared with Al-back surface field (BSF) cells though there is about 3  % absolute loss in FF due to increase in series resistance for point-contacts [52].|$|E
3000|$|Usage of thinner wafers and an {{effective}} reduction of surface recombination losses are increasingly important for low-cost highly efficient silicon solar cells. Hence the recent trend in silicon-wafer-based PV industries is toward thinner wafers (< 200  μm). But {{the use of}} thinner wafers increases the rear surface recombination [12] and consequently necessitates a well-passivated rear surface to keep the rear surface recombination loss in acceptable minimum. Moreover, the increasing demands for optical quality require a higher internal reflection as well. Therefore, all designs for high-efficiency silicon solar cells today use a dielectric passivation layer on the rear {{to meet the requirements}} of passivation quality and optical properties. Keeping in mind the above attributes a good number of rear surface passivation techniques were developed over the years; among them atomic layer deposition (ALD)-assisted Al 2 O 3, wet oxidation process using <b>pyrogenic</b> <b>steam,</b> passivation by stack of a-Si:H/SiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 /SiN x [...] and passivation by phosphorus-doped a-SiC x N y :H(n) alloys are the most notable rear side passivation techniques for crystalline silicon solar cells. Recent research results on these rear surface passivation techniques are aggregated below.|$|E
40|$|The {{interface}} between silicon dioxide (SiO 2) and silicon carbide (SiC) {{is at the}} heart of the SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect (MOSFET) transistor. The technology to produce a high quality SiO 2 /SiC interface does not exist today, hampering further development of the SiC MOSFET. This work focuses on studying electron and hole traps at the SiO 2 /SiC interface and reports on our progress in reducing their numbers. We examine the SiO 2 /SiC interface traps by studying metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors made in 4 H-SiC and 6 H-SiC. The measurement techniques used include thermally stimulated current (TSC), capacitance-voltage, constant-capacitance deep level transient spectroscopy (CCDLTS), along with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both the TSC and CCDLTS methods give information about majority carrier emission from interface traps close to the semiconductor majority carrier band-edge, and they show the interface traps from an alternativ perspective, compared to traditional C-V measurements. Using TSC, we compared the native SiO 2 /SiC interface, i. e. the one formed using wet or dry thermal oxidation in quartz environment, on both Si-face and (1120) -face n -type 4 H-SiC material and we found them to be similar. In two other experiments we compared the native SiO 2 /SiC interface made on Si-face 4 H-SiC, and 6 H-SiC. Positron annihilation spectroscopy showed that there are open-volume defects at these interfaces. TEM and nanochemical analysis demonstrated that there are no extended carbon clusters at the SiO 2 /SiC interface in samples which were annealed at 950 °C in <b>pyrogenic</b> <b>steam</b> for 3 h. By incorporating impurities into the oxide during thermal oxidation of off-axis Si-face 4 H-SiC we found that it is possible to reduce the interface state density near the SiC conduction band-edge by two orders of magnitude. The impurity source used was sintered alumina and presently we do not know which impurity species is responsible for the reduction of interface traps. The impurities have several effects: (a) The oxidation rate is increased, (b) there is mobile charge present in the oxide in the form of sodium, (c) the trap density at the interface is phenomenally low, but (d) the interface state density can increase during rapid thermal annealing. We fabricated lateral MOSFET transistors in off-axis Si-face 4 H-SiC material. MOSFETs made with a gate oxide that includes impurities, and have not received an RTP anneal, show very high peak-mobility values of about 150 cm 2 /Vs, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than the one obtained from MOSFETs employing the conventional thermal gate oxide. We find that the field-effect mobility is correlated with the reduction in the interface trap density...|$|E
