5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial <b>pole</b> <b>cells</b> very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
25|$|After {{fertilization}} of the oocyte, {{the early}} embryo (or syncytial embryo) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By {{the end of}} the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the <b>pole</b> <b>cells</b> form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, gastrulation starts.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the mitochondrial large rRNA {{is involved in the}} restoration of the pole cell-forming ability in Drosophila embryos is still unknown. We identified a 15 -ribonucleotide sequence which is conserved from the protobacterium Wolbachia to the higher eukaryotes in domain V of the mitochondrial large rRNA. This short sequence is sufficient to restore <b>pole</b> <b>cell</b> determination in UV-irradiated Drosophila embryos. Here, we provide evidence that the conserved 15 -base sequence is sufficient to restore luciferase activity in vitro. Moreover, we show that the internal GAGA sequence is involved in protein binding and that mutations in this tetranucleotide affect the sequence's ability to restore luciferase activity. The obtained results lead us to propose that mtlrRNA may be involved either in damaged protein reactivation or in protein biosynthesis during <b>pole</b> <b>cell</b> determination...|$|R
40|$|The FMR {{family of}} KH domain RNA-binding {{proteins}} is conserved from invertebrates to humans. In humans, inactivation of the X-linked FMR gene fragile X {{is the most}} common cause of mental retardation and leads to defects in neuronal architecture. While there are three FMR family members in humans, there is only a single gene, dfmr 1, in flies. As in humans, inactivation of dfmr 1 causes defects in neuronal architecture and in behavior. dfmr 1 has other functions in the fly in addition to neurogenesis. Here we have analyzed its role during early embryonic development. We found that dfmr 1 embryos display defects in the rapid nuclear division cycles that precede gastrulation in nuclear migration and in <b>pole</b> <b>cell</b> formation. While the aberrations in nuclear division are correlated with a defect in the assembly of centromeric/centric heterochromatin, the defects in <b>pole</b> <b>cell</b> formation are associated with alterations in the actinâ€“myosin cytoskeleton...|$|R

2500|$|The main {{component}} of the male reproductive system is the testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. The more primitive apterygote insects have a single testis, and in some lepidopterans the two maturing testes are secondarily fused into one structure during the later stages of larval development, although the ducts leading from them remain separate. However, most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside.

40|$|Second {{messengers}} {{control a}} wide range of important cellular functions in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Here we show that cyclic di-GMP, a global bacterial second messenger, promotes cell cycle progression in Caulobacter crescentus by mediating the specific degradation of the replication initiation inhibitor CtrA. During the G 1 -to-S-phase transition, both CtrA and its cognate protease ClpXP dynamically localize to the old <b>cell</b> <b>pole,</b> where CtrA is rapidly degraded. Sequestration of CtrA to the <b>cell</b> <b>pole</b> depends on PopA, a newly identified cyclic di-GMP effector protein. PopA itself localizes to the <b>cell</b> <b>pole</b> and directs CtrA to this subcellular site via the direct interaction with a mediator protein, RcdA. We present evidence that c-di-GMP regulates CtrA degradation during the cell cycle by controlling the dynamic sequestration of the PopA recruitment factor to the <b>cell</b> <b>pole.</b> Furthermore, we show that cell cycle timing of CtrA degradation relies on converging pathways responsible for substrate and protease localization to the old <b>cell</b> <b>pole.</b> This is the first report that links cyclic di-GMP to protein dynamics and cell cycle control in bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Signaling hubs at {{bacterial}} <b>cell</b> <b>poles</b> establish <b>cell</b> polarity in {{the absence}} of membrane-bound compartments. In the asymmetrically dividing bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, cell polarity stems from the cell cycle-regulated localization and turnover of signaling protein complexes in these hubs, and yet the mechanisms that establish the identity of the two <b>cell</b> <b>poles</b> have not been established. Here, we recapitulate the tripartite assembly of a cell fate signaling complex that forms during the G 1 -S transition. Using in vivo and in vitro analyses of dynamic polar protein complex formation, we show that a polymeric cell polarity protein, SpmX, serves as a direct bridge between the PopZ polymeric network and the cell fate-directing DivJ histidine kinase. We demonstrate the direct binding between these three proteins and show that a polar microdomain spontaneously assembles when the three proteins are coexpressed heterologously in an Escherichia coli test system. The relative copy numbers of these proteins are essential for complex formation, as overexpression of SpmX in Caulobacter reorganizes the polarity of the cell, generating ectopic <b>cell</b> <b>poles</b> containing PopZ and DivJ. Hierarchical formation of higher-order SpmX oligomers nucleates new PopZ microdomain assemblies at the incipient lateral <b>cell</b> <b>poles,</b> driving localized outgrowth. By comparison to self-assembling protein networks and polar cell growth mechanisms in other bacterial species, we suggest that the cooligomeric PopZ-SpmX protein complex in Caulobacter illustrates a paradigm for coupling cell cycle progression to the controlled geometry of <b>cell</b> <b>pole</b> establishment...|$|R
50|$|Like other triploblastic metazoa, {{gastrulation}} {{leads to}} the formation of three germ layers: the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm.

50|$|Pole plasm is {{organized}} by and contains the proteins and mRNA of the posterior group genes (such as oskar, nanos gene, Tudor, vasa, and Valois). These genes {{play a role}} in germ line development to localize nanos mRNA to the posterior and localize germ cell determinants. Drosophila progeny with mutations in these genes fail to produce <b>pole</b> <b>cells</b> and are thus sterile, giving these mutations the name 'grandchildless'. The genes Oskar, nanos and germ cell-less (gcl) have important roles. Oskar is sufficient to recruit the other genes to form functional germ plasm. Nanos is required to prevent mitosis and somatic differentiation and for the <b>pole</b> <b>cells</b> to migrate to function as PGCs (see next section). Gcl is necessary (but not sufficient) for pole cell formation. In addition to these genes, Pgc polar granule component blocks phosphorylation and consequently activation of RNA polymerase II and shuts down transcription.|$|E
50|$|In early Drosophila development, {{the first}} 13 passes through mitosis are nuclear {{divisions}} (karyokinesis) without cytokinesis, {{resulting in a}} multinucleate cell (generally {{referred to as a}} syncytium, but strictly a coenocyte).

40|$|Using the {{monoclonal}} antibody MA- 01, a new 210 -kDa microtubule-interacting protein was identified in Leishmania promastigotes by immunoblotting and by immunoprecipitation. The protein was thermostable and was located on microtubules prepared by taxol-driven polymerization in vitro. On fixed cells the antibody gave specific staining of flagellum, flagellar pocket, and mitotic spindle. Subpellicular microtubules were basically not decorated but posterior <b>poles</b> of the <b>cells</b> were labeled in a cell-cycle-dependent manner.

40|$|Division site {{selection}} in rod-shaped bacteria depends on nucleoid occlusion, which prevents division over the chromosome and MinCD, which prevent {{division at the}} poles. MinD is thought to localize MinC to the <b>cell</b> <b>poles</b> where it prevents FtsZ assembly. Time-lapse microscopy demonstrates that in Bacillus subtilis transient polar FtsZ rings assemble adjacent to recently completed septa and that in minCD strains these persist and are used for division, producing a minicell. This suggests that MinC acts when division proteins are released from newly completed septa to prevent their immediate reassembly at new <b>cell</b> <b>poles.</b> The minCD mutant appears to uncouple FtsZ ring assembly from cell division and thus shows a variable interdivisional time and a rapid loss of cell cycle synchrony. Functional MinC-GFP expressed from the chromosome minCD locus is dynamic. It is recruited to active division sites before septal biogenesis, rotates around the septum, and moves away from completed septa. Thus high concentrations of MinC are found primarily at the septum and, more transiently, at the new <b>cell</b> <b>pole.</b> DivIVA and MinD recruit MinC to division sites, rather than mediating the stable polar localization previously thought to restrict MinC activity to the pole. Together, our results suggest that B. subtilis MinC does not inhibit FtsZ assembly at the <b>cell</b> <b>poles,</b> but rather prevents polar FtsZ rings adjacent to new <b>cell</b> <b>poles</b> from supporting <b>cell</b> division...|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for protein localization in Mycoplasma pneumoniae by immunofluorescence micros-copy. The P 1 adhesin protein was revealed to be located at least at one <b>cell</b> <b>pole</b> in all adhesive cells, as has been observed by immunoelectron microscopy. Cell images were classified according to P 1 localization and assigned by DNA content. Cells with a single P 1 focus at one <b>cell</b> <b>pole</b> had a lower DNA content than cells with two foci, {{at least one of}} which was positioned at a <b>cell</b> <b>pole.</b> Those with one focus at each <b>cell</b> <b>pole</b> had the highest DNA content, suggesting that the nascent attachment organelle is formed next to the old one and migrates to the opposite <b>cell</b> <b>pole</b> before <b>cell</b> division. Double staining revealed that the accessory proteins for cytadherenceâ€” HMW 1, HMW 3, P 30, P 90, P 40, and P 65 â€”colocalized with the P 1 adhesin in all cells. The localization of cytad-herence proteins was also examined in cytadherence-deficient mutant cells with a branched morphology. In M 5 mutant cells, which lack the P 90 and P 40 proteins, HMW 1, HMW 3, P 1, and P 30 were focused at the <b>cell</b> <b>poles</b> of short branches, and P 65 showed no signal. In M 7 mutant cells, which produce a truncated P 30 protein, HMW 1, HMW 3, P 1, P 90, and P 40 were focused, and P 65 showed no signal. In M 6 mutant cells, which express no HMW 1 and a truncated P 30 protein, the P 1 adhesin was distributed throughout the entire cell body, and no signal was detected for the other proteins. These results suggest that the cytadherence proteins are sequen-tially assembled to the attachment organelle with HMW 1 first, HMW 3, P 1, P 30, P 90, and P 40 next, and P 65 last...|$|R
