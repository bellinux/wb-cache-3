5|$|In the marginalia that El Greco {{inscribed in}} his copy of Daniele Barbaro's {{translation}} of Vitruvius' , he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical <b>proportions,</b> perspective and mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting <b>proportions</b> {{in order to}} compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to {{the very idea of}} rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The <b>proportions</b> appear spacious because {{the view from the}} west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. The <b>proportions</b> are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E

5|$|The <b>proportions</b> {{were chosen}} {{arbitrarily}} {{in all but}} the last four pieces in the cycle: sonatas XIII and XVI use symmetrical <b>proportions,</b> and sonatas XIV and XV share the 2, 2, 3, 3 proportion. This symmetry, and the adherence of all four sonatas to the ten-bar unit, were explained by Cage as an expression of tranquility. The complexity of <b>proportions</b> prompted Cage to use asymmetric musical phrases and somewhat frequent changes of time signature to achieve both microscopic and macroscopic correlation. For example, unit length of 8½ in the first section of Sonata III is achieved by using six bars in 2/2 time and two in 5/4 (rather than eight bars in 2/2 and one in 1/2). In many sonatas the microstructure—how the melodic lines are constructed—deviates slightly from the pre-defined proportion.|$|E

Nevertheless, whereas in 1990 the <b>proportion</b> of individuals in secondary and higher educational groups was similar for both return migrants and stayers, by 2010 the <b>proportion</b> of stayers in high school and college had become larger than the <b>proportion</b> of return migrants in high school and college.|$|R
5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen.
