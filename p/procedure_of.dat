40|$|Abstract. Economic Law {{indicates}} {{a kind of}} law that confirms and regulates government to reasonably intervene in economy. And the question <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> in economic law {{has always been a}} problem that is easily ignored by researchers. It’s a good research approach to probe into relevant problems of economic law through a perspective <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> economic law. Strengthening and perfecting <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> economic law is one of the focuses of economic legislation in China. This paper elaborated main characteristics <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> economic law and emphasized the logical analysis on <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> economic law...|$|R

40|$|In {{graduation}} thesis {{are described}} and mutually compared most important physical <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> thickening and dehydration {{of sewage sludge}} which is occurring on municipal wastewater treatment plants. All processes of treatment of sewage sludge and difference between processes of thickening and dehydration of sewage sludge {{are listed in the}} preface. Main part of graduation thesis is divided into two assembles. Most frequent physical <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> thickening of sewage sludge (gravitation, flotation, centrifugal thickening, thickening with gravitational belts and thickening with rotational drums) are assigned in first assembly. Most frequent physical <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> dehydration of sewage sludge (dehydration with belt filter presses, centrifuges, filter presses and dehydration with vacuum filtering) are assigned in second assembly. In every assembly are procedures first introduced theoretically and then mutually compared on concrete case. <b>Procedures</b> <b>of</b> thickening of sewage sludge are compared on base of theoretical data of gained with empirical equations for case of municipal wastewater treatment plant with 200. 000 PE. Most frequent physical <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> dehydration of sewage sludge are mutually compared based on real data concerning production and to treatment of sewage sludge on municipal wastewater treatment plant Domţale – Kamnik in year 2007...|$|R

5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a mirror in creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E

5|$|Like other volcanoes in the NCVP, Level Mountain is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the GSC to ascertain how active its magma system is. The Canadian National Seismograph Network {{has been established}} to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, {{but it is too}} far away to provide an accurate indication of activity under the mountain. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if Level Mountain becomes highly restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption; the system might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting. If Level Mountain were to erupt, mechanisms exist to orchestrate relief efforts. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan was created to outline the notification <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> some of the main agencies that would respond to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption that would affect Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{is divided}} into {{departments}} known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries. Each covers a specific policy area such as Agriculture or Justice and citizens' rights or internal services such as Human Resources and Translation and is headed by Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner. A Commissioner's portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs, they prepare proposals for them and if approved {{by a majority of}} Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration. The Commission's civil service is headed by a Secretary General, currently Alexander Italianer. The rules of <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> the European Commission set out the Commission's operation and organisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust. The standard <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E

5|$|The {{system of}} pre-defining the {{indicator}} {{setting for the}} day for all Enigma operators on a given network, on which the method of characteristics depended, was changed on 15 September 1938.

Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> sending the enciphered message key twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited.
