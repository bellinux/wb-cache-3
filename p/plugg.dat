5|$|Well Dunn {{continued}} {{to face the}} top teams in the WWF, including The Smoking Gunns, The Headshrinkers, and the newly formed team of Sparky <b>Plugg</b> and the 1-2-3 Kid. When The Smoking Gunns were unable to compete due {{to the birth of}} Billy Gunn's son, Well Dunn competed against The Heavenly Bodies instead; these matches were unusual, as they pitted heel tag teams against each other. As in 1993, Well Dunn lost more matches than they won in each series, but they had occasional victories against established tag teams and were often booked to defeat jobber tag teams.|$|E
5|$|A ten-man tag team {{match was}} {{supposed}} to take place next, but it was canceled due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team (Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett) could not agree on who would be the team's captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky <b>Plugg,</b> Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly ("Sparky Plugg"), stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him, and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1995 Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Well Dunn {{was entered}} in a tournament for the vacant WWF Tag Team Championship. They were {{scheduled}} to face The Smoking Gunns, but Bob Holly (formerly Sparky <b>Plugg)</b> and the 1-2-3 Kid took the Gunns' place; Holly and the 1-2-3 Kid won the match {{and went on to}} win the tournament. Eliminated from the tournament, Well and Dunn competed individually in the Royal Rumble match, a battle royal. Well was eliminated by Davey Boy Smith, and Dunn was eliminated by Aldo Montoya. After The Smoking Gunns regained the championship, Well Dunn challenged for the belts in a series of matches but was unable to win the title.|$|E

500|$|Holly {{returned}} to the WWF on January 11, 1994. His initial gimmick {{was that of a}} NASCAR driver turned wrestler called Thurman [...] "Sparky" [...] <b>Plugg,</b> which was quietly changed to Bob [...] "Spark Plug" [...] Holly.

500|$|Robert William Howard (born January 29, 1963) is a semi-retired American {{professional}} wrestler and actor. He is {{best known}} for his 16-year career with the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/E) under the ring names Thurman [...] "Sparky" [...] <b>Plugg,</b> Bob [...] "Spark Plug" [...] Holly, Bombastic Bob and Hardcore Holly.|$|E
500|$|Before the Royal Rumble match began, {{commentator}} Vince McMahon {{announced that}} WWF President Jack Tunney had shortened {{the interval between}} entrances from the traditional two minutes to 90 seconds due to time constraints. Kamala was supposed {{to compete in the}} match, but he was replaced by Virgil. Ludvig Borga could not compete due to his ankle injury and was replaced by Kwang, a newcomer to the WWF. In addition, the 1-2-3 Kid was replaced by Sparky <b>Plugg,</b> who was also making his debut. Bastion Booger was scheduled to be the twenty-fifth participant, but he did not appear for unknown reasons; Vince McMahon stated that he did not appear because he did not [...] "feel good".|$|E
500|$|Kwang and Adam Bomb {{were both}} managed by Harvey Wippleman. On May 28, 1994, a King of the Ring {{qualifying}} match between Bomb and the 1–2–3 Kid was televised on WWF Superstars. The angle saw The Kid win after Kwang attempted to interfere on Bomb's behalf. Kwang accidentally spat green mist in Bomb's face, allowing the Kid {{to get the}} victory. Wippleman had Bomb and Kwang work as a tag team, but problems continued to develop between the two. The pair split after an argument cost them the match when they faced the team of the 1–2–3 Kid and [...] "Sparky" [...] Thurman <b>Plugg.</b> Bomb and Kwang faced each other on house shows leading up to their dark match at SummerSlam 1994.|$|E
500|$|Participants in {{the tournament}} {{qualified}} in matches televised during WWF programs in the weeks prior to the event. The first qualifying match took place on May 7, 1994. Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.) defeated Scott Steiner in a match televised on WWF Superstars. The next qualifying match {{took place on the}} May 9, 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw, when Razor Ramon defeated Kwang with a Razor's Edge in a qualifying match to enter the tournament. In a match televised on May 14, 1994, Mabel (of Men on a Mission) defeated Pierre (of The Quebecers) to qualify for the tournament. Two days later, the May 16, 1994 edition of Monday Night RAW, Bam Bam Bigelow qualified for the tournament by defeating Thurman [...] "Sparky" [...] <b>Plugg.</b>|$|E
500|$|After debuting in 1990, Holly {{worked for}} Smoky Mountain Wrestling and other {{independent}} promotions, before joining WWE full-time in 1994. Initially portraying {{the character of}} a NASCAR driver, Thurman [...] "Sparky" [...] <b>Plugg,</b> his name was soon changed to Bob [...] "Spark Plug" [...] Holly. In 1998, he formed a team with Bart Gunn, known as The New Midnight Express. After becoming known simply as [...] "Hardcore Holly" [...] in 1999, he was joined by on-screen cousins, Crash and Molly. In 2002, he suffered a broken neck, which sidelined him for over a year. Upon his return, he engaged in a major feud with Brock Lesnar and minor feuds with wrestlers such as Mr. Kennedy and Rob Van Dam, before forming a tag team with Cody Rhodes in 2007. Holly departed WWE in 2009, wrestling intermittently on the independent circuit. He published his autobiography, The Hardcore Truth: The Bob Holly Story, in 2013.|$|E
500|$|King of the Ring 1994 {{was held}} at the Baltimore Arena in Baltimore on June 19, 1994. Before the {{pay-per-view}} broadcast began, Thurman [...] "Sparky" [...] <b>Plugg</b> beat Kwang in a dark match. As the event began, it was revealed that retired football player Art Donovan {{would be one of the}} commentators for the evening. Donovan's appearance would become infamous among wrestling fans for being seemingly uninformed about the product as well as generally befuddled behavior such as repeatedly asking how much certain wrestlers weighed. He was joined by Gorilla Monsoon on play-by-play, who inadvertently referred to Donovan several times as [...] "Art O'Donnell", and Randy Savage. Monsoon, who had not called a pay-per-view since 1993's Royal Rumble after being phased out in favor of Jim Ross and later Vince McMahon, served as McMahon's replacement due to McMahon's preparation for his upcoming trial for steroid distribution. To cover up his absence, it was announced that McMahon could not appear because he was recovering from neck surgery.|$|E
500|$|The final {{match of}} the night and main event was the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between Yokozuna and Bret Hart. The guest referee for the match was [...] "Rowdy" [...] Roddy Piper, while the guest ring {{announcer}} was Burt Reynolds and the guest timekeeper was Jennie Garth. Yokozuna attacked Hart before the bell, and Hart attempted a couple of comebacks in vain. Eventually, Yokozuna made a mistake and allowed Hart to knock him to the mat. Cornette tried to distract Piper, but Piper punched him and knocked him off the ring apron. Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Hart but then missed an Avalanche attempt. Bret maintained the advantage for a little while, but Yokozuna came back with a belly to belly suplex. When Yokozuna attempted the Banzai drop, however, he lost his balance and fell to the mat. Hart quickly pinned Yokozuna to win the title. He celebrated in the ring with several of the face wrestlers including Lex Luger, [...] "Rowdy" [...] Roddy Piper, Razor Ramon, Tatanka, The 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky <b>Plugg</b> and [...] "Macho Man" [...] Randy Savage. Others who joined in the celebration included Burt Reynolds, Rhonda Shear, Donnie Wahlberg, and WWF commentators Gorilla Monsoon and Vince McMahon. Owen Hart stood in the aisle, glaring at Bret, then quickly left.|$|E
