In {{the field of}} justice, a reform of the Right of self-defense Act was introduced to please the Lega Nord. The 2002 Bossi-Fini Act represented a restrictive approach to immigration, while the 2006 Fini -Giovanardi Act strengthened the prohibitionary approach to drug policy. A <b>point-system</b> driver's licence was introduced in 2003, and compulsory conscription {{was replaced by a}} professional army since 2005. A constitutional reform including federalization and strengthened executive powers, passed in the Parliament, was rejected by a confirmation referendum in 2006.|$|E

5000|$|Three-way coin flips {{are also}} possible, by a {{different}} process - {{this can be done}} either to choose two out of three, or to choose one out of three. To choose two out of three, three coins are flipped, and if two coins come up the same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players. To choose one out of three, either reverse this (the odd coin out is the winner), or add a regular two-way coin flip between the remaining players as a second step. Note that the three-way flip is 75% likely to work each time it is tried (if all coins are heads or all are tails, which occurs 1/4 of the time, the flip is repeated until the results differ), and does not require that [...] "heads" [...] or [...] "tails" [...] be called.A famous example of such a three-way coin flip (choose two out of three) is dramatized in Friday Night Lights (originally a book, subsequently film and TV series), where three high school football teams with identical records use a three-way coin flip - at a truck stop - to determine which two will advance to the playoffs.A legacy of this coin flip was to reduce the use of coin flips to break ties in Texas sports, instead using <b>point-systems</b> to reduce the frequency of ties.|$|R
50|$|Strong Cup is {{the annual}} <b>point-system</b> senior house {{competition}} for boys at Dauntsey's School, so Farmer, Fitzmaurice, Hemens and Mercers {{are the only}} houses that are involved. Farmer won it recently in 2011, and again in 2013. Hemens won the cup most recently in 2014. The points are awarded from inter-house events throughout the academic year. Such events include athletics, swimming, rugby, cricket, tennis, hockey, football, general knowledge quiz, tiddlywinks, basketball, water polo, music and a minor sports festival which includes badminton, squash, skittles, chess and table tennis.|$|E
50|$|The {{criteria}} for judging varies year-on-year. In 2008, the criteria were {{changed to a}} more cheerleading-focused <b>point-system,</b> giving a maximum score for each element of cheerleading and/or dancing. For 2013 edition, the criteria were divided into two: cheerleading and dance criteria. Cheerleading criteria were sub-divided into four elements (tumbling, stunt, tosses, and pyramid) with a maximum of 100 points for each element, while the dance criteria, which had a maximum of 100 points per number of judges for dance, were subdivided into four sub-criteria (over-all effectiveness, choreography, technique and execution).|$|E
5000|$|The Greens {{started their}} pre-election {{campaign}} in May 2006 with {{the presentation of}} two [...] "Black Books". The [...] "Black Book black" [...] concentrated on their criticism of the People's Party government, the [...] "Black Book red" [...] criticized the opposition performance of the Social Democratic Party. The Greens accused both parties of violations of human rights, with their main criticism being the 2005 reform of the asylum and foreigner's rights laws, to which the Social Democratic Party had agreed.Central to their campaign were promotion of alternative energy, improving the situation of working women, introduction of a demand orientated basic social security (Grundsicherung), an education reform and introduction of a <b>point-system</b> for immigration, favouring highly qualified immigrants.|$|E
40|$|Austrian {{migration}} policy {{changed from a}} demand driven guest worker model be-tween the 1960 s and 1980 s to chain migration, family reunion and refugee migration in the 1990 s. Membership to the EU in 1995 was accompanied by economic migra-tion from other EU-member states due to faster-than-average economic growth in Austria. Population ageing and insufficient investment in further education and train-ing led to labour scarcities and {{migration policy}} reforms in 2011 and gave employer demand {{a key role in}} selecting immigrants under a <b>point-system</b> adapted from the Canadian and Australian models. While many elements of the Austrian system are highly developed, there is insufficient coordination among federal agencies.

3000|$|The Immigration Amendment Act 1991 {{represented}} {{a fundamental shift}} in selection policy, replacing the OPL with a <b>point-system</b> (the General Skills Category). Applicants were granted points for employability, age and settlement factors and had to meet certain character and health requirements. Those with the highest scores were selected {{with the aim of}} meeting an annual numerical migration target. The policy was maintained until 2003, with modifications to put more weight on English language ability (in 1995 and 2002), on having a job offer (1995) and on having a job offer relevant to the applicant’s qualifications and experience (2002). In 2003, the policy was replaced by the ‘Skilled Migrant Category’ policy, also based on the awarding of points for job offers, work experience, qualifications and age, with additional recognition of partners’ employment and experience, NZ qualifications and employment outside Auckland. In 2007, the point schedule was modified to award points for employment, qualifications and experience in specified areas of anticipated future growth, for study in New Zealand and for partners’ skills and experience. 6 [...]...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we {{analysed}} {{energy savings}} in five retirement homes in Slovenia which were renovated in 2012 and 2013. These {{took part in}} public tender for a complete energy renovation and were {{selected on the basis}} of <b>point-system</b> for measures from an extended residential energy consumption survey (RECS). The basis for comparison are the calculations for the estimated consumption in RECS, which were prepared through joint venture withgGenera-Proplussby the Ministry for labour, family and social affairs in 2009. Retirement homes chosen for the analysis have a simpler architectual plan and were willing to share the data on consumption of energy for study purposes. The thesis enables more detailed insight in the procedure composition and the content scope of extended RECS, with emphasis on the used methods for calculating building physics and authorial analysis brefore and after renovation. Savings for analysis were calculated wit a simplified method as well as with NovoCAD program tool, which is today considered outdated because of loose criteria and methods of calculation. The mesaure of success is valid agreement of calculated savings with actual savings. For this purpose, we made a control calculation of building physics with a newer program KI Energija and the results were compared with measured savings. With reproduced calculations we proved that the program is a better choice from viewpoint of accuracy. In the end of the analysis we calculated the level of success of the estimation of savings with Chi-squared test and T-test. All used methods proved to be statistically in agreement (even up to 91, 4...|$|E
40|$|The {{concern for}} the {{protection}} of a society's architectural and cultural heritage has long been a discussion among historians, architects, and state leaders; later, planners, preservationists, local neighborhood organizations, and municipal officials. The crux of these concerns is how to preserve the architectural and cultural legacy of a place while modernizing and accommodating growth. Most often, a building is preserved or a building is demolished. However, in some cases, there is a middle ground in which an attempt to satisfy the demands of all stakeholders is made. The physical manifestation of this is what preservationists call "facadism"â€”the action by which the faÃ§ade or facades of a building are retained and preserved {{while the rest of the}} building is demolished in order to construct a new, often larger building behind the retained facade. Facadism is inarguably a compromise between preservationists who seek to preserve the building in its entirety for future generations and developers who seek to maximize the rate of return on investment by maximizing rentable space and providing modern amenities to increase asking rents. The discussion becomes one of economics versus significance. When these discussions end in facadism, it results in the significant loss of integrity and context of a historic building. Many cities and towns have enacted historic preservation ordinances to protect historic resources against development pressures. If there are strong ordinances in place to protect local landmarks, why have historic and eligible landmarks faced, and continue to face, facadism? Using Washington, D. C. as a case study, this thesis is an exploration into the history of compromise between developer and preservationist in urban development that resulted in facadism. Drawing from lawsuits, projects, policies, and regulations, this thesis analyzes and explains the conditions under which this phenomenon emerged in DC. Further, the thesis provides a new typology and vocabulary that redefines the discussion of facadism and interventions into historic structures, as well as a new <b>point-system</b> method by which to assess the successes and failures of these projects. These new tools can be applied and used in other cities to assess the successes and failures of compromised architecture and expand the dialogue on how to best balance the goals of preservation and development in the future...|$|E
