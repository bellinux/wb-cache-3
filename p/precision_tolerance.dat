The proposed method can also measure the diameter and depth of the hole with one exposure using a single digital camera. It is {{the aim of this}} paper to develop a new camera positioning control device which utilizes the forementioned {{measuring method}} to reduce expenses and process time during the measurement. We designed the apparatus according to an established frame of digital camera measurement parameters (height of optic position and width of horizontal view angle). The effectiveness of the proposed approach in measuring the diameter and depth of the through hole has been validated by using gray scale chromatic aberration of the image contour regions. This measurement system not only increases the accuracy of the measuring results but is also applicable with any kinds of digital cameras.

I-LAMM is a two-stage algorithmic {{implementation of the}} local linear approximation to a family of folded concave penalized quasi-likelihood. The first stage solves a convex program with a crude <b>precision</b> <b>tolerance</b> to obtain a coarse initial estimator, which is further refined in the second stage by iteratively solving a sequence of convex programs with smaller precision tolerances. Theoretically, we establish a phase transition: the first stage has a sublinear iteration complexity, while the second stage achieves an improved linear rate of convergence. Though this framework is completely algorithmic, it provides solutions with optimal statistical performances and controlled algorithmic complexity for a large family of nonconvex optimization problems. The iteration effects on statistical errors are clearly demonstrated via a contraction property.

The priority 1 includes the front-rear door and headlamp-hood interfaces. The priority 2 includes the A pillar to roof and front wind shield interfaces. The priority 3 includes door to rocker moulding and hood to grille interfaces. Here the importance is given to the customer's view perspective. For example, in a side closures (car door assembly), the front-rear door interfaces which lies between the B pillar and the rear door region is given importance since it has the high priority as seen by the customer (Priority 1). Whereas the door to rocker moulding interfaces which lies on the bottom surface of the car is given low priority (Priority 3). Based on these priorities the gap and flushness effectively achieved through the tolerance management.

PMVs were generated from washed and thrombin activated platelets. Activated platelets from every donor were used to compare the PMV proteome. Enzymatic digestion of protein lysate was carried out using Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method with trypsin as a proteolytic enzyme. Tryptic peptides derived from PMVs and activated platelets were analysed using nano-LC coupled off-line mode with a MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS.

The <b>precision</b> <b>tolerance</b> was 100 ppm for peptide masses and 0. 7 Da for fragment ion masses. Individual peptide matches with a score above 28 were considered statistically significant.

Cellular component analysis of identified proteins revealed that PMVs contained relatively more extracellular proteins than activated platelets (9. 6 vs. 6. 0 %) and unique synaptic proteins (0. 3 %).

The Sensor Web provides a wider access to sensors and observations via common protocols and specifications. Observations typically go through several levels of quality control, and aggregation before they are made available to end-users. Raw data are usually inspected, and related quality flags are assigned. Data are gap-filled, and errors are removed. New data series may also be derived from one or more corrected data sets. Until now, it is unclear how these kinds of information can be captured in the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework. Apart from the quality measures (e. g., accuracy, <b>precision,</b> <b>tolerance,</b> or confidence), the levels of observational series, the changes applied, and the methods involved must be specified. It is important that this kind of quality control information is well described and communicated to end-users to allow for a better usage and interpretation of data products.

The accuracy (between the known distance and distance traced) was determined by 3 different evaluators twice consecutive, by videoing a course of 10 meters in the enriched environment together with further analysis of the displacement of the midpoint marked on an apparatus. To calculate reliability (accuracy of the measurement system) and reproducibility (precision of the evaluators) to obtain the ratio of <b>precision</b> to <b>tolerance</b> (P/T), eight animals were filmed for 10 minutes in the enriched environment and analysis of distance covered by one of the animals by three different reviewers thrice consecutive.

When flown aboard stratospheric balloons, these high-resolution reflective mirrors focus hard x-rays (10 - 70 keV) emitted from cosmic {{sources such as}} supernovae, neutron stars, and quasars onto imaging focal plane detectors. Focused hard x-ray images allow scientists to determine the elemental compositions, temperatures, magnetic fields, velocities, and gravitational fields of these celestial bodies. The fabrication process involves generating super-polished mandrels, mandrel metrology, mirror shell nickel electroforming, and mirror testing. Each mandrel is a cylinder consisting of two conical segments; each segment is approximately 305 -mm long. Through precision grinding these mandrels before super polishing, we have achieved 30 arc seconds, half power diameter replicated mirrors. During a May 2001 high atmosphere balloon flight, these mirrors focused high energy x-rays from three different celestial sources.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a concept for ultra-lightweight deformable mirrors {{based on a}} thin substrate of optical surface quality coated with continuous active piezopolymer layers that provide modes of actuation and shape correction. This concept eliminates any kind of stiff backing structure for the mirror surface and exploits micro-fabrication technologies to provide a tight integration of the active materials into the mirror structure, to avoid actuator print-through effects. Proof-of-concept, 10 -cm-diameter mirrors with a low areal density of about 0. 5 kg/m&# 178; have been designed, built and tested to measure their shape-correction performance and verify the models used for design. The low cost manufacturing scheme uses replication techniques, and strives for minimizing residual stresses that deviate the optical figure from the master mandrel. It does not require <b>precision</b> <b>tolerancing,</b> is lightweight, and is therefore potentially scalable to larger diameters for use in large, modular space telescopes. Other potential applications for such a laminate could include ground-based mirrors for solar energy collection, adaptive optics for atmospheric turbulence, laser communications, and other shape control applications. The immediate application for these mirrors is for the Autonomous Assembly and Reconfiguration of a Space Telescope (AAReST) mission, which is a university mission under development by Caltech, the University of Surrey, and JPL.

Further to this end, the synthetic techniques and materials are opening up avenues for designers to investigate a range of fibers and fabrics that radically transform light and color renditions, and texture. Investigations in the realm of traditional materials such as stone, wood, and concrete continue to evolve, as do their associated methods of making.
