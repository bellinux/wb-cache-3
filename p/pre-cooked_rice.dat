50|$|Chahan is a Japanese fried rice {{dish that}} is {{typically}} fried, {{and can be}} cooked by stir frying it in a wok. Rice {{is used as a}} primary ingredient, and myriad additional ingredients can be used, such as vegetables, onion, garlic, edible mushrooms such as shiitake, tofu, pork, pork belly, seafoods such as crab meat, roe, salmon, shrimp and octopus, scrambled egg, ground beef and chicken broth, among others. <b>Pre-cooked</b> <b>rice</b> is typically used, and leftover rice is sometimes used. Oils such as canola oil, sesame oil and sunflower oil are used to fry the dish. The dish can be seasoned with soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, salt, pepper and katsuobushi, a dried and flaked tuna product. Shiso, an Asian culinary herb, may also be used to flavor chahan. Nori, a dried edible seaweed product, {{can be used as a}} garnish.|$|E
5000|$|Nasi goreng, {{literally}} meaning [...] "fried rice" [...] in Indonesian and Malay, {{can refer}} simply to fried <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>rice,</b> a meal including stir fried rice {{in a small}} amount of cooking oil or margarine, typically spiced with kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), shallot, garlic, ground shrimp paste, tamarind and chilli and accompanied by other ingredients, particularly egg, chicken and prawns. There is also another kind of nasi goreng which is made with ikan asin (salted dried fish) which is also popular across Indonesia. Nasi goreng is sometimes described as Indonesian stir-fried rice, although it is also popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Beyond the Malay Archipelago, it has gained popularity through Indonesian influence in Sri Lanka and via Indonesian immigrant communities in Suriname and the Netherlands. It is distinguished from other Asian fried rice recipes by its aromatic, earthy and smoky flavor, owed to generous amount of caramelized sweet soy sauce and powdered shrimp paste, and the taste is stronger and spicier compared to Chinese fried rice.|$|E
40|$|Pre-treatment {{can include}} marination of raw meat with antimicrobiological berry juices. Lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), found in Eurasia and North America, contain various acids, {{flavonoids}} and other antimicrobiologial compounds. The content of benzoic acid in juices of Finnish lingonberries was 0. 72 g/l (1). The concentration of juices and contact {{time in the}} marinade must be balanced against effects on taste, drip loss and colour stability during storage. Abstract — The aim {{of the study was}} to achieve a microbiological shelf life of at least 10 days at 4 ºC for a fresh ready-to-cook chicken meal. The meal consisted of raw chicken breast fillets, a mixture of raw cut vegetables of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>rice</b> and pasteurized sauce. Meals with marinated and non-marinated chicken meat were compared. Before packaging, the chicken meat was marinated i...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus cereus is a {{ubiquitous}} organism and {{a potential}} foodborne pathogen that can cause two types of gastrointestinal diseases: emesis and diarrhea. The emetic syndrome {{is caused by a}} heat and acid stable peptide toxin that is pre-formed in food, while the diarrheal syndrome is associated to two 3 -protein, heat labile enterotoxin complexes that are formed in the intestine after ingestion of the organism. There are many reports on the isolation and characterization of Bacillus cereus from various foods, however there are no studies on the levels, toxigenicity and physical characteristics of B. cereus isolated from U. S. retail spices. A huge part of spices sold in the U. S. are imported from developing nations. Developing nations lack hygienic practices during processing and packaging of spices, due to which there is a high chance of imported spices being contaminated with B. cereus. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis work was to characterize B. cereus spores from U. S. retail spices. Levels of aerobic spores and B. cereus spores were determined. B. cereus spores were further analyzed for their enterotoxigenic ability, growth characteristics and physical spore characteristics. In the 247 spice samples analyzed 77 were found to contain B. cereus, while 11 were positive for B. thuringiensis. Eighty four of the 88 spices tested possessed either one of the enterotoxin genes. None of the isolates tested positive for the emetic toxin (ces) gene. Seventy five of the B. cereus isolates grew at 12 °C, although only two isolates grew well at 9 °C. Seven selected diarrheal B. cereus spore strains had D 95 -values ranging from 0. 64 - 3. 53 min while the two emetic strains had D 95 -values of 7. 04 min and 6. 64 min. B. cereus grew well in <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>rice.</b> After 48 h, counts of 1. 26 X 107 and 3. 8 X 107 B. cereus/ 10 g were obtained in <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>rice</b> maintained at 17 °C and 20 °C respectively. At 12 °C, counts did not reach 104 CFU/ 10 g even after 48 h of incubation. The aerobic mesophilic bacterial population and B. cereus population of 0. 1 % crushed pepper in <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>rice</b> over a period of 48 h at temperature 20 °C and 17 °C were also analyzed. Counts of B. cereus in pepper rice samples reached a maximum of 1600 MPN/ 10 g and 1100 MPN/ 10 g at 20 °C and 17 °C respectively while the aerobic mesophilic counts per 10 g were 2. 4 X 108 and 4. 4 X 106 at these temperatures. The low B. cereus counts and high aerobic mesophilic population indicates competition of nutrients in cooked rice by background flora other than B. cereus. The physical spore characteristics of five B. cereus and 3 B. thuringiensis strains were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Tubular, whip-like appendages were present in four B. cereus and two B. thuringiensis, while all seven isolates possessed exosporia...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} and shelf life of high-iron, dried, <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>rice</b> porridge with ferrous sulphate and other high-iron materials was studied. Broken brown rice was soaked {{in water and}} ferrous sulphate was added at 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 15 % of the dried brown rice. The mixture was steamed for 20 min and dried in a double drum dryer. Green shallot, young ginger and cooked chicken fillet were dried in an electric cabinet dryer. Chicken blood and edible fern were dried in a double drum dryer and vacuum freezer respectively. The optimum ferrous sulphate added to the rice was 0. 05 % and the developed formulation of dried porridge consisted of ferrous sulphate rice (67. 80 %), chicken fillet (20 %), chicken blood (3 %), green shallot (0. 7 %), young ginger (1 %), edible fern (0. 5 %), pepper powder (0. 5 %), sucrose (3 %), salt (3 %) and monosodium glutamate (0. 5 %). The dried porridge had a high iron content of 10. 18 mg/ 50 g and the shelf life was three months at room temperature when stored in either aluminum foil laminated bag or metalite bag...|$|E
40|$|Reviewed {{are all the}} {{published}} clinical trials of glycine-based oral rehydration salts (ORS), L-alanine-based ORS, L-glutamine-based ORS, maltodextrin-based ORS, and rice-based ORS, {{as well as the}} results of several recently completed, but unpublished, studies of these formulations that were supported by WHO. All experimental ORS formulations contained the same concentrations of salts as citrate-based WHO-ORS; all trials were randomized comparisons with WHO-ORS, and all except those with rice-based ORS were double-blind studies. The rate of stool loss and, less frequently, the duration of diarrhoea were used as indicators of clinical performance to compare ORS formulations. The following conclusions were reached concerning the efficacy and use of modified ORS formulations. Rice-based ORS (50 g/l) is superior to WHO-ORS for patients with cholera, and for such patients it can be recommended in any situation where its preparation and use are practical. Rice-based (50 g/l) and WHO-ORS solutions are equally effective for treating children with acute non-cholera diarrhoea, when feeding is resumed promptly following initial rehydration, as has been consistently recommended by WHO. Since rice-based ORS is not superior to WHO-ORS for such children, there is no apparent reason to advise a change from glucose to <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>rice</b> in the recommended formulation for WHO-ORS. Maltodextrin-based ORS formulations (50 g/l) and WHO-ORS appear to be equally effective for treating children with acute non-cholera diarrhoea; {{there is no reason to}} advise a change from glucose to maltodextrin in the recommended formulation for WHO-ORS. Amino-acid-containing ORS formulations are not recommended for either non-cholera or cholera diarrhoea, since they are more costly and have no clinical advantage over WHO-ORS for children with acute non-cholera diarrhoea or over rice-based ORS for persons with cholera...|$|E
