In the days before telephones, this was the only way firefighters would know the location of a fire. The coded blasts were usually repeated several times. This technology was also applied to many steam whistles as well. Some fire sirens are fitted with brakes and dampers, enabling them to sound out codes as well. These units tended to be unreliable, and are now uncommon.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how Turkish-speaking adults and children encode caused motion events in speech and gesture. Participants did three tasks. First, they watched 3 practice videoclips, and 35 videoclips depicting various caused motion events. After watching each clip, adult participants described them to another person and child participants described them to another person who was holding a puppet. In the second task task, participants were prompted to watch certain clips again and describe them using a verb provided by the experimenter. The last task was the narration of 2 Maus & Elephant movies which also depicted caused motion events. Each movie was divided into smaller parts - 4 parts for the first movie, 3 parts for the second one - which the participants watched one by one and then narrated. The caused motion videos are: vignette #: vignette description p_ 1 : tear piece of cloth in two p_ 2 : open jar p_ 3 : eat a cookie 1 : bring cake to the table 2 : spin ball out of room 3 : make toy run to the car 4 : kick garbage bin down 5 : pour water into pot 6 : <b>pull</b> <b>box</b> up 7 : roll ball down 8 : drag toy into room 9 : make toy jump over 10 : slide toy down 11 : take cake to the table 12 : knock down boxes 13 : push box into building 14 : put box on shelf 15 : sweep rubbish into rubbish bin 16 : lay toy down 17 : bounce ball into room 18 : pour water onto grass 19 : throw rubbish out the window 20 : spin ball down 21 : lift suitcase up 22 : kick garbage bin out of room 23 : take cucumber out of pouch 24 : <b>pull</b> <b>box</b> out of room 25 : make toy ride horse 26 : bring cake into the room 27 : bounce ball down 28 : drag scarf up 29 : roll ball into box 30 : put suitcase out of room 31 : push box to car 32 : sweep rubbish down 33 : throw box at wall 34 : put celery into pouch 35 : take tray of glasses into roo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Agent motion {{planning}} {{is a common}} task in artificial intelligence. One of the simplest scenarios considers the delivery of boxes to storage locations on a regular grid with obstacles. When the agent can only push boxes, we obtain the well-known, PSPACE-hard Sokoban puzzle [Culberson 1997]. In this paper we propose an exact solver for the scenario where the agent can push and <b>pull</b> <b>boxes,</b> called Pukoban. The solver {{is based on the}} A * search algorithm with several problem-specific improvements. We evaluate its efficiency on 100 instances from the literature. Our algorithm is able to solve 30 instances exactly. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Mount Morris Park tower {{went into}} service in 1857 in {{response}} to Harlem residents’ demand. The towers gave volunteers a perch from which to watch for fires that were common in the wooden structures that then made up much of New York City, and the watchers then spread the word via bell ringing. Later, electric telegraphs were installed but the bell provided local alarms. When <b>pull</b> <b>boxes</b> and other technological advances rendered the fire watchtowers obsolete, the system was discontinued and the other towers eventually were destroyed. Harlem’s, protected {{in the middle of}} a park, endured.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} solutions or alternatives for workers or employees that exert some manual handling activities (lifting, lowering, carrying, pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>boxes</b> or a whole of boxes) with big possibilities of injury in their workplace. The lot sizing, the optimum number of boxes, {{the frequency of}} activity or ergonomics aspects will be important factors to determine the maximum load or weight per day that could be supported for a worker or stocker. By researching of articles and laws it has been possible to give solutions for them. Firstly, {{it can be seen}} some methods to evaluate the movements and postures requested by worker so in order to know the level risk of activity. Secondly, it shows the systems applied by companies or enterprises so as to improve the work conditions for manual handling activities related to lifting, lowering, carrying, pushing or <b>pulling</b> of <b>boxes</b> in a typical warehouse taking account some factors such as the number of boxes, the lot sizing, space and time of working. It is possible to observe different ways or options so as to help the health of worker during a workday. Thirdly, it is commented the difficulties to integrate ergonomic aspects into production system development and purchasing problems between departments. The final point is my conclusions about this work and the future studies that must be made by researchers in this area in the next years...|$|R

40|$|Children (aged five-to-six and nine-to-ten years) {{and adults}} rated the {{acceptability}} of well-formed sentences and argument-structure overgeneralization errors involving the prepositional-object and double-object dative constructions (e. g. Marge <b>pulled</b> the <b>box</b> to Homer/*Marge <b>pulled</b> Homer the <b>box).</b> In support of the entrenchment hypothesis, a negative correlation was observed between verb frequency and {{the acceptability of}} errors, across all age groups. Adults additionally displayed sensitivity to narrow-range semantic constraints on the alternation, rejecting double-object dative uses of novel verbs consistent with prepositional-dative-only classes and vice versa. Adults also provided evidence for the psychological validity of a proposed morphophonological constraint prohibiting Latinate verbs from appearing in the double-object dative. These findings are interpreted {{in the light of}} a recent account of argument-structure acquisition, under which children retreat from error by incrementally learning the semantic, phonological, and pragmatic properties associated with particular verbs and particular construction slots. ...|$|R
