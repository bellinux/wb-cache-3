5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception and birth of children. Extra-marital and premarital sex are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet separation during pregnancy or {{during the early years}} of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E

25|$|Fire: The fire {{signs are}} Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. A native with mainly fire signs will be energetic, {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic, with {{a need to}} be {{in the center of the}} action making things happen. They can be egotistical, headstrong and sometimes arrogant, but also can be generous, warm-hearted, and spontaneously kind. Fire subjects are independent and <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> control over their own lives, but they can also be sometimes autocratic. A subject lacking fire signs will be fearful or over-cautious, pessimistic and shy, and will lack enthusiasm, confidence and faith in the future. Planets in the 1st, 5th and 9th houses and an emphasis on cardinal signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|Pangasinan, {{which was}} {{historically}} {{part of the}} Central Luzon Region, was made part of the Ilocos Region (Region I) in the gerrymandering of the Philippines by Ferdinand Marcos, {{despite the fact that}} Pangasinan has its distinct primary language, which is Pangasinan. The political classification of Pangasinan as part of the Ilocos Region has generated confusion among some Filipinos that the residents of Pangasinan are Ilocanos, even though Ilocanos only constitute a significant minority in the province. Pangasinan has a distinct primary language, ethnic group and culture, its economy is bigger than the predominantly Ilocano provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and La Union and its population is more than 50 {{percent of the population of}} Region 1. Many Pangasinans <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their own Pangasinan Region or be returned to Central Luzon.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific Coast League {{plays by}} the same rules listed in the Official Baseball Rules {{published}} by Major League Baseball. One exception {{is the use of}} Designated hitter (DH). Whereas the application of the DH rule in Major League Baseball is determined by the identity of the home team, with the rules of the home team's league applying to both teams, PCL pitchers hit when both clubs are National League affiliates and they have agreed to have their pitchers hit. Two National League affiliated clubs may agree to use the DH instead. The {{reason for this is that}} as players move up and get closer to reaching the majors, teams <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the rules follow (as closely as possible) those of the major leagues. The DH is always used when one or both teams are American League affiliates.|$|E

500|$|The premiere, {{originally}} planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th {{because of the}} illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as [...] "a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes..." [...] The audience's appreciation was not reflected {{in the majority of}} the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that [...] "this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be".

500|$|Just {{before the}} Rose set sail, things were {{complicated}} {{again when the}} Crown decided to place a minder on board named John Knepp [...] "to look after the King's interest". Knepp {{seems to have been}} a purser. In the English Navy, the purser acted as a sort of Company Store, tempting sailors far from shore with whiskey, tobacco and other desirables by offering them credit against their wages, (collected through the captain). [...] It was a lucrative post and required an investment to procure, hence it usually went to young Naval clerks and scions who could afford the capital outlay. It seems like a terrible idea to place a purser on a voyage like that of the Rose, on a shoestring budget, with the men receiving no wages and collectively buying and sharing food together. [...] (Knepp brought great quantities of fancy cheese and brandy, with predictable results). But either way, the purser was dependent on good relations with the captain, yet Knepp seems to have looked down on Phips and decided to be forward in introducing himself to the crew of HMS Rose while Phips was absent in London. The reception was rather less than friendly: [...] "... then most of them began to curse the ship and wished she had been afire before they saw her and that they had better have hired a ship of merchants..."The crew were a salty bunch to say the least, a [...] "rum lot" [...] as Peter Earle calls them, and this final last-minute bait-and-switch, after the previous addition of Randolph, seems to have nearly put them over the edge. Everything we know about the crew comes from a detailed journal of the trip to Boston was kept by Knepp and he has rightly been called a [...] "hostile observer" [...] but it is more important to note that he was often ignorant of the complex, dual nature of the voyage, as well as basic colonial politics, if not some important elements of human nature. [...] Distant historians must grope for any available source to shed light on events of the past, and so history tends to be swayed heavily by the writers. Phips was never a writer and so much of his story comes from others, with Knepp's Journal at the top of this pile. Like the rest of us, Knepp does not seem to have understood the role Phips was intended to play, either in support of Randolph, or as a possible decoy and cleanup for the Falcon & Bonetta. In Knepp's first interaction, he says that he is seeking signatures between the crew and the King though the July 13 agreement (see image) would more accurately be portrayed as between Phips and the crew, as the first mate protests. [...] Knepp's job seemed to be to seek additional signatures from the crew, which is easily done when Phips returns to the ship, with Randolph acting as a witness. Next Knepp complained to Phips about the firing of the ships cannons to set the watch. By the time the ship set sail the next day, Phips and Knepp were distinctly at odds, as Knepp records when asked for a cabin or berth and was told he would have to make do sleeping on a trunk. This was an unfortunate turn of events for both of them, as well as the historian who would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Knepp at the Captain's table recording the dinner conversation between Randolph, his brother, and Phips. Class friction surely played a strong role in the conflict between Knepp and Phips. Knepp consistently presents himself as a victim and there are many times he is bullied and badly mistreated, but it also seems that he must have set himself above, and thought of himself as being of a higher class than Phips. The articles of agreement testify to the trust that the king and Narborough placed in Phips, and the crew seemed willing to do as Phips commanded, but Knepp acts as if he is not beholden to Phips. Knepp's journal is addressed to Narborough (and Haddock) and it reads like a sycophant's strong gambit for a future promotion. He presents Phips as the trope of a tarpaulin captain—every sailor his comrade, questionable literacy level—and so it is probably safe to infer that Knepp was of the gentleman class and likely some years younger than Phips, perhaps in his mid-twenties. [...] Knepp is excellent at taking coordinates and seems trained in piloting, but does not exhibit the a breadth of experience or knowledge of the rigging. [...] Though he records every perceived misstep by Phips, his careful plotting of the journey also shows the great ability Phips possessed as a sailor, crossing the Atlantic in half the time of another ship that they meet, and making first landfall at Cape Ann.|$|E
