5|$|The {{most common}} uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim {{to correct a}} <b>pathological</b> <b>condition.</b> However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Some, such as anti-epileptic drugs, alter enzyme {{activity}} by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called enzyme induction and inhibition and are alterations in gene expression, which is unrelated {{to the type of}} enzyme inhibition discussed here. Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as ion channels or membrane receptors.|$|E
5|$|Many Macroolithus {{specimens}} in South China have {{double- or}} multiple-layering of cones {{on the inner}} surface of the eggshell, a <b>pathological</b> <b>condition</b> known as ovum in ovo. It is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, which represents {{the end of the}} Mesozoic Era. This pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Experiments on modern birds have demonstrated that exposure to high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into the eggshell, but the precise mechanism behind the pathological multi-layering is unknown. These abnormalities presumably affected hatchability of the eggs and may {{have played a role in}} the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, the embryonic remains inside three multilayered Macroolithus-like eggs from Ganzhou appear unaffected.|$|E

40|$|Objective: In {{the present}} study {{we are trying to}} find out whether we can {{diagnose}} the various pathology of muscles and muscle injuries by high resolution ultrasonography. Background: Clinical evaluation of many <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions</b> of muscles is often very difficult. With the help of MRI, we can diagnose most of the pathologies of muscles almost accurately; but it is neither cost effective nor widely available. Similarly, CT scan is also not very helpful in this regard. Method: We examined forty patients with various types of unilateral <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions</b> of muscles with the help of high resolution ultrasonography and compared with the normal anatomy of the opposite side. This method is a non-invasive, rapid, less expensive and widely available. Result: We have shown that we can diagnose the different <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions</b> of muscles and muscle injuries with the help of high resolution USG.

25|$|Surgery is {{an ancient}} medical {{specialty}} that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a <b>pathological</b> <b>condition</b> such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including general surgery, ophthalmic surgery, cardiovascular surgery, colorectal surgery, neurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oncologic surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, podiatric surgery, transplant surgery, trauma surgery, urology, vascular surgery, and pediatric surgery. In some centers, anesthesiology {{is part of the}} division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.|$|E
25|$|Expression {{profiling}} experiments often involve {{measuring the}} relative amount of mRNA expressed {{in two or}} more experimental conditions. This is because altered levels of a specific sequence of mRNA suggest a changed need for the protein coded by the mRNA, perhaps indicating a homeostatic response or a <b>pathological</b> <b>condition.</b> For example, higher levels of mRNA coding for alcohol dehydrogenase suggest that the cells or tissues under study are responding to increased levels of ethanol in their environment. Similarly, if breast cancer cells express higher levels of mRNA associated with a particular transmembrane receptor than normal cells do, {{it might be that}} this receptor plays a role in breast cancer. A drug that interferes with this receptor may prevent or treat breast cancer. In developing a drug, one may perform gene expression profiling experiments to help assess the drug's toxicity, perhaps by looking for changing levels in the expression of cytochrome P450 genes, which may be a biomarker of drug metabolism. Gene expression profiling may become an important diagnostic test.|$|E

The paper analyzes <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions</b> and diseases of the kidney in a series of 3100 intravenous urographies (IVU) performed at the Radiology Center, Clinical Center Niš, during the period 2009 - 2012.

This paper presents numerous and various <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions</b> and diseases of the urinary system. Among the valuable radiological examination methods IVU has maintained a leading position.

2500|$|Healthy narcissism {{has to do}} with {{a strong}} feeling of [...] "own love" [...] {{protecting}} the human being against illness. Eventually, however, the individual must love the other, [...] "the object love to not become ill". The individual becomes ill as a result of the frustration created when he is unable to love the object. In pathological narcissism such as the narcissistic personality disorder, the person's libido has been withdrawn from objects in the world and produces megalomania. The clinical theorists Kernberg, Kohut and Millon all see pathological narcissism as a possible outcome in response to unempathic and inconsistent early childhood interactions. They suggested that narcissists try to compensate in adult relationships. The <b>pathological</b> <b>condition</b> of narcissism is, as Freud suggested, a magnified, extreme manifestation of healthy narcissism.|$|E

We assessed {{the usefulness of}} real-time, perendoscopic, gastric juice pH determination in identifying preneoplastic conditions of the stomach, that often escape the mere endoscopic evaluation. Methods: The study included 245 patients (115 M; 130 F; age 47 ± 17). In each of them perendoscopic gastric juice pH was assessed {{by means of an}} innovative device, the Endofaster, and the results were correlated with histological evaluation (H&E, immunohistochemistry, argyrophil stains), and gastric acid secretion (BAO-PAO), and serum gastrin levels. The conditions evaluated were: atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, endocrine cell hyperplasia, hypergastrinemia. Results: A total of 136 <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions</b> were detected and these resulted to be correlated with pH (r= 0. 67; P< 0. 01). The rate of <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions</b> was low in normochlorhydric patients (14. 1 %); most of these conditions were concentrated in patients with hypochlorhydria (85. 9 %) (P< 0. 001). Specifically, the number of patients with one or more <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions</b> increased proportionately with the rise in pH levels. An inverse correlation was detected between gastric juice pH and basal acid output (BAO) (r=- 0. 72; P< 0. 01). Endoscopic feature was normal/mild in most of patients with <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions.</b> Conclusion: Hypochlorhydria is a sensitive indicator of gastric risk conditions. Perendoscopic real-time assessment of pH can improve and extend optical analysis by allowing the detection of <b>pathological</b> <b>conditions</b> (either preneoplastic or not) that often escape diagnosis because not correlated with specific endoscopic pattern...|$|R
