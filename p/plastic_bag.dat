5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in a <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso were found in the same area, also in a <b>plastic</b> <b>bag.</b> Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E

40|$|Since 2007, some {{supermarkets}} in Portugal have voluntarily {{abolished the}} free distribution of <b>plastic</b> <b>bags,</b> implementing a symbolic charge of € 0. 02 each {{at the same}} time that others still offer free <b>plastic</b> <b>bags.</b> This study assesses the influence of this voluntary measure on the reduction of <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> consumption, comparing clients from supermarkets that have adopted it with others who have free distribution. The reutilisation of bags reached 37 % in supermarkets where customers pay a fee and was absent in supermarkets where <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> are free. Even the abstention of using bags, when clients buy only few products, is significantly higher in supermarkets where there are charges for <b>plastic</b> <b>bags.</b> The 2 cents charged has also induced a significant increase in optimal use of <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> since 52 % of clients that pay for <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> use them so they are almost full, but only 17 % do the same when they are free. Taken together, the different effects of charging for <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> represents a potential reduction of 64 %. A mandatory tax on <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> is an important measure to reduce substantially the number of <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> consumed and to improve sustainability through the reduction of environmental, economic and social costs of pollution and waste management. environmental behaviour, <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> fee, reutilisation, taxation, waste prevention,...|$|R

5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a <b>plastic</b> <b>bag,</b> and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E
