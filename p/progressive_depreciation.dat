50|$|The gold {{standard}} was suspended in 1914 and banknotes were declared unconvertible tender. The price of silver rose and its export was embargoed. The exchange rate remained at par (2.055 per US$1) until 1918, when <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> set in. The government established a complete monopoly on foreign bills of exchange. Late in 1922 {{the free market}} rate fell to 5.405 per dollar. The government took draconian measures, requiring exporters to surrender foreign exchange earnings at a rate set by the Exchange Commission (3.60/US$). The government struggled with the foreign exchange problem until the sucre was finally stabilized in 1926 at 5 sucres per US dollar.|$|E
40|$|Background and Problem: The {{question}} of whether or not <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> on buildings in housing cooperative associations (HCAs) should be allowed is something that has been discussed for years. Assuming that the progressive method will not be allowed and hence will be replaced by the straight-line method, the costs will be brought forward. This would entail currently higher costs. Consequently the fee paid by the members of the HCA would probably need to be increased to avoid a negative result. Aim of thesis: This thesis aims to illustrate a situation where it is difficult to unite norms and practice. We will investigate why the norm setters intend to exclude the <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> method on buildings from Swedish GAAP as well as why HCAs have the ambition to apply the method on their buildings. Further we will clarify what the consequences of prohibition of the progressive method of depreciation would be. Methodology: This thesis has investigated the arguments for and against the <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> method on buildings through a case study of an ongoing debate. Structured interviews in combination with collected documents in the form of newspaper and discussion articles have been used to form the empirical chapter. Discussion and conclusion: Eight arguments have been identified for applying <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> on buildings. These are: the deterioration pattern of the building, difficulties in explaining the concept of depreciation to members of the HCA, minimization of present costs, the inflation factor, the fact that the writing in ÅRL does not clearly forbid <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation,</b> the fact that too many negative consequences would occur if the progressive method must not be applied, the fact that the straight-line method could imply that the annual fee probably must be increased in order to avoid a negative result in the income statement, which further would imply large amounts of piled up cash, which is undesirable, and lastly that the characteristics of HCAs, mainly concerning the external fund, imply that the purpose of depreciation is different in HCAs compared to other organizations. Four arguments have been identified against applying <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> on buildings. These are: that the method is not in line with ÅRL, that the method contradicts to the equality principle, that the deterioration does not follow a progressive pattern and finally the fact that the method does not take the matching principle into account. We further have concluded that a change from <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> to straight-line depreciation would entail a greater impact on the net income and counteractions to this are either to make a loss or to increase the fees...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the ban on}} <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> of housing {{associations}} {{in connection with the}} change to K-regulatory frameworks. Bokföringsnämnden (2014) stated that <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> was no longer allowed, and this study explores what kind of implications it had for the housing associations' income statements. Additional problems have been addressed by examining what effects it could have on the perception of that accounting must be based on giving a fair view (Artsberg, 2005), and whether stakeholders can access and interpret this financial information (Burks, 2015). Based on theories that consider that a similar framework is not appropriate for housing associations and non-profit organizations, as for profit driven companies, we have used this criticism on the matter (Burks, 2014; Torres and Pina, 2003). We have also taken into consideration why Bokföringsnämnden decided to prohibit the depreciation method. The empirical study focuses on examining twenty newly constructed housing associations annual reports from 2012 to 2014 to see whether they have had to change their depreciation method, and if this in turn has had an influence on their results, and if this has led to changes in their annual report. The end result of this study is based on a quantitative research which shows that a change has occurred in housing associations' income statements. 95 percent of the sample reported a loss in 2014, while in 2012 only 5 percent showed negative results. In a combined analysis of the use of literature and empirical data, there are clear indications that there is a requirement for new regulatory alternative templates for housing associations to report financial information if they are to present a fair view and enable comparison between associations...|$|E
40|$|It {{appears to}} me, however, that misconceptions {{respecting}} {{the influence of}} an increased supply of gold upon its value and upon general prices {{are by no means}} confined to the class who could be misled by such fallacies, but that even among economists (at least among economists in this country) we may observe the same indisposition to believe in an actual and <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> of this metal. It is not indeed denied ? at least, I presume it is not denied ? by anyone pretending to economic knowledge, that the enlarged production of gold now taking place has a tendency to lower its value; but it seems to be very generally supposed that the same cause ? the increased gold production ? has the effect, through its influence on trade, of calling into operation so many tendencies of a contrary nature, that on the whole, the depreciation must proceed with extreme slowness, the results being dispersed over a period so great as to take from them any practical importance, and that, at all events, up to the present time no sensible effect upon prices has hence arisen...|$|E
30|$|The {{use of an}} {{individual}} measure of technical change is crucial. First, {{we believe that the}} obsolescence of individual skills starts from the very entry of individuals into the labor market. Enduring into a certain industry is the product of pre-entry individual skills like the education level and on-the-job training and learning (which we do not observe). 11 Second, early retirement occurs because the working-life horizon elderly individuals face is short enough to make on-the-job training too costly to bear compared to the potential benefits of remaining in the labor market, net of all demographic, health, and socio-economic characteristics. However, the focus on the last years before retirement {{does not take into account}} the <b>progressive</b> <b>depreciation</b> of individual skills and the role that individual work trajectories play in the decision to retire early. In other words, our measure of working-life technical change allows us to reduce the individual unobserved heterogeneity that is not captured by, e.g., individual fixed effects. Third, {{an individual}} measure generates the necessary heterogeneity in technical change across individuals that belong to the same sector that allows us to distinguish sectoral and time effects from the actual technical change faced by individuals.|$|E
