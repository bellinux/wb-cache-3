The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a drop-out of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored Othello in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing Angelo Francesco Lavagnino's original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which {{were not in the}} original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America.|$|E

After Todd says [...] "hell no" [...] and [...] "damn" [...] at dinner, his father Ned eventually discovers that he learned those words from Homer.

500|$|The soundtrack {{album was}} not well {{received}} by music critics, some of whom went on comment that the title track is the record's highlight. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review, though Noah Robischon from the same magazine complimented the title track, saying that Madonna had [...] "pushed synergy over the borderline." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com said that the songs were not among Madonna's best music. Taraborrelli commented that [...] "the soundtrack was once again the reminder of Madonna's power and status {{as one of the}} most important singers of the 80s, because it was only her songs which gained prominence, albeit not being her best, though 'The Look of Love' is an exotic ballad." [...] Author Mary Cross, in her biography Madonna: A Biography said that [...] "the soundtrack slips up because of the film." [...] Allen Metz and Carol Benson, authors of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that [...] "Who's That Girl has done what it was released for, <b>put</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> Warner's pockets, but [...] nothing in Madonna's catalogue".

But it's just that it has the misfortune of being associated with such an unfortunate movie, that the album actually does not hold up to you well." [...] He added that [...] "The Look of Love" [...] was a hidden gem in Madonna's catalogue. Don Shewey from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "although essentially a Madonna album, the soundtrack does not boast a truly memorable song, rather there is the inclusion of the failed Warner artist songs, like the Coati Mundi song 'El Coco Loco' and Duncan Faure's uncannily Beatles-esque [...] "24 Hours". For most buyers though this album is the new Madonna album." ...|$|E
