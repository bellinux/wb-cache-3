A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, despite setbacks, financially tight {{times and}} the American Civil War, the College {{continued}} to expand. Seton Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) {{during the summer of}} 1893, but this program was ultimately disbanded during the Spanish–American War. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> pivotal events in the history of Seton Hall came in 1897 when Seton Hall's preparatory (high school) and college (undergraduate) divisions were permanently separated. By 1937, Seton Hall established a University College. This marked the first matriculation of women at Seton Hall. Seton Hall became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1948, Seton Hall was given a license by the FCC for WSOU-FM.|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> difficult {{aspects of}} modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching {{for evidence of}} symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors {{that would have been}} used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E

50|$|Azarmina’s style <b>of</b> {{performance}} is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closest {{to that of}} late Master Payvar, yet his interpretation of Persian music is very lean, expressive, and contemporary.|$|R
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{striking}} {{applications of}} systoles {{is in the}} context of the Schottky problem, by P.Buser and P.Sarnak, who distinguished the Jacobians of Riemann surfaces among principally polarized abelian varieties, laying the foundation for systolic arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|The {{granting}} of citizenship to allies and the conquered was a vital {{step in the}} process of Romanization. This step {{was one of the most}} effective political tools and (at that point in history) original political ideas (<b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important reasons for the success of Rome).|$|E
25|$|Monarchs {{share the}} defense of noxious taste with the similar-appearing viceroy {{butterfly}} in what is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> well-known examples of mimicry. Though long purported to {{be an example of}} Batesian mimicry, the viceroy is actually reportedly more unpalatable than the monarch, making this a case of Müllerian mimicry.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther articulated a doctrine of the two kingdoms. According to James Madison, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important modern proponents of {{the separation of church and}} state, Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms marked {{the beginning}} of the modern conception of separation of church and state.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{statistically}} significant contributors to a lasting peace {{is whether or}} not military victory was achieved by one side. According to Fortna's research, civil wars in which one side wins, resulting in a cease-fire or truce, have an approximately 85%-90% lower chance of renewed war. Moreover, peace treaties further reduce the risk by 60%-70%.|$|E
25|$|The most {{impressive}} {{part of the}} holiday is the carnival. Purim in Israel is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> spectacular holidays in the world. Thousands of people take to the streets, showing off their costumes that they made especially for the holiday. Costumes at Purim are a special industry in Israel, and during this period the prices go up, which means Israelis try to buy their costumes in advance.|$|E

25|$|Year collections: Rather {{than being}} {{satisfied}} {{with a single}} specimen of a type, a great many collectors collect type by year; for example, one Memorial Lincoln Cent for every year from 1959 (the year it was first minted) to 2008 (the {{last year it was}} minted). This is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> practical ways to collect a national currency since probably the majority of coin reference books and coin albums catalogue in the same manner.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{striking}} {{features of}} Shad Thames are the walkways which criss-cross the street high overhead. Most {{of them now}} connect the Butlers Wharf building and the Cardamom Building, and were originally used as bridges to roll barrels and the like between warehouses. They are now used as balconies by the adjoining flats. Photographs from the early 20th century show that {{at the peak of}} warehouse usage there were many more of these bridges than survive today.|$|E
25|$|Famous {{players and}} {{football}} figures often give their {{opinion on the}} Maradona and Pelé rivalry, sometimes choosing one over the other. Others prefer not to compare them, as they played in very different times. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> reliable comparisons available is that by the Ballon d'Or winners (elected since 1956 by voters of several countries, and arguably greatest ones to properly appreciate both players). Pelé was elected Best Player of the Century for Ballon d'Or winners and Maradona was the runner-up.|$|E

50|$|Abdolali Changiz is an Iranian {{football}} Forward {{who played}} for Iran in the 1984 Asian Cup. He also played for Esteghlal, Al-Ahli and Al-Arabi. He was <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finest football players of his generation in Iran and Asia.|$|R
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> moving {{artifacts}} at the Elgin Military Museum is the Vimy Poppy, {{picked by}} a soldier from St. Thomas on that famous Ridge {{a few short}} weeks after that momentous battle began on April 9, 1917 in memory of his fallen comrades. One of these comrades was Lance Corporal Ellis Sifton who won the Victoria Cross that day but lost his life. The tiny box in which his effects were posted to his parents {{is part of a}} poignant display in his honour.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} five thousand known genetic diseases, {{and the potential}} to treat these diseases using transgenic animals is, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> promising applications of transgenes. There is a potential to use human gene therapy to replace a mutated gene with an unmutated copy of a transgene in order to treat the genetic disorder. This can be done {{through the use of}} Cre-Lox or knockout. Moreover, genetic disorders are being studied through the use of transgenic mice, pigs, rabbits, and rats. More recently, scientists have also begun using transgenic goats to study genetic disorders related to fertility.|$|E
25|$|Equity {{is highly}} valued in Finland {{and the law}} {{provides}} same rights for all citizens, including in healthcare. There still exists some geographic and socioeconomic disparities. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important reasons for the socioeconomic differences {{in the use of}} services is that the private sector and occupational healthcare, which are less accessible to the low-income population, offer better access to services (e.g. a major difference is waiting times) than the municipal sector. Narrowing health gaps has been the objective of Finnish health policy since the 1980s, however, this objective has not been fully achieved.|$|E

25|$|Sabina Park {{became a}} Test cricket ground in 1930 when it hosted the visiting MCC {{team for the}} fourth and final Test in the West Indies' first home series. This picturesque ground is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{significant}} in Test cricket history recording the first triple century in the game with England's Andy Sandham's 325 versus the West Indies in the 1930 game. The 365 not out by Sir Garfield Sobers which stood as a Test record for over 36 years is more regaled, as was Lawrence Rowe's world record on debut 214 and 100 not out against the visiting New Zealand in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Necho I, {{neither of}} this king's presumed Saite royal predecessors, a certain Nekauba and Tefnakht II, are monumentally attested in Lower Egypt. Hence, {{the latter two}} kings who appear in the records of Manetho's Epitome may well be fictitious. Moreover, it is {{improbable}} that Taharqa, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful Kushite kings of the Nubian 25th dynasty for the first 18 years of his reign, would have tolerated {{the existence of a}} rival line of native Egyptian kings at Sais {{during the first half of}} his reign when he exercised full control over Memphis and the Delta region. After all, the 24th dynasty Saite rulers Tefnakht and Bakenranef had fought Taharqa's father Piye and resisted Shabaka's expansion of Kushite power into the Delta region.|$|E

The {{spotlight}} fell on LeBron James. Despite gaining some momentum in the opening games of the series against the experienced Pistons, key last-second decisions by James led to Cleveland losses in Games 1 and 2 in Detroit, by identical scores, in which Cleveland led {{for most of the}} two games. They faced a 0–2 deficit for the second straight year, but would easily remember from the year before that they could win three straight games {{to get back into the}} series.|$|E
