40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the long-term albedo variability of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) using 25 years of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinder satellite data. Previous {{studies of the}} GrIS have generally limited their spatiotemporal extents to either coarse resolutions or relatively short time spans, or else concentrated on small, dynamic areas. The <b>premise</b> <b>of</b> this <b>thesis</b> is that these limitations may be obscuring larger patterns or changes in the GrIS albedo. Analyzing massive remotely-sensed data sets presents formidable challenges. In response, and concurrent with the albedo analysis, this thesis demonstrates new techniques for managing and analyzing large satellite-derived data sets. Prototype database technology is introduced that enables scalable storage and rapid, random-access to data at high spatiotemporal resolutions. To answer the scientific questions posed, analysis tools are included with the database architecture and applied to the entire data set. This thesis determines the spatial distributions of albedo means, medians and variances, {{as well as any}} long-term trends. The spatial and temporal relationships between synoptic weather forcings and albedo changes are also explored. Where possible, ground-truth data is supplied to support the satellite-based conclusions. In the course of assembling and analyzing the data, the current study reveals several types of previously undetected errors in the data set. This outcome validates the original <b>premise</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thesis</b> and demonstrates additional capabilities of the database and analysis system. The final results show that the AVHRR/Polar Pathfinder data set used herein is of poor quality. However, the analysis methods, quality assurance, and data management techniques used in this thesis demonstrate that the technology now exists to manage massive remotely-sensed data sets within distributed databases. This capability may open new possibilities for rapid data analysis, and prove useful for managing and analyzing large data sets beyond the field of remote sensing...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF version <b>of</b> article. This <b>thesis</b> {{is based}} on a {{critical}} analysis of the problem of representation based on Platonic Idealism. Historically, this problem has been closely tied to the problematic opposition between notions of original and copy. In this study the assumptions behind this binary opposition and the existence of a reality that is accessible other than by its own representations are deconstructed. The notion of simulacrum is introduced to counter the original/copy argument in relation to the contemporary culture of consumerism. Within this theoretical framework the Topkapi Palace Hotel in Antalya is taken as a case study. Representations of Topkapi Palace preceding the hotel are analyzed including Ottoman miniatures, Orientalist paintings/gravures and the Topkapi Palace Museum. The basic <b>premise</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thesis</b> is that the notion of simulation destabilizes the model/copy binary which has significant repercussions in contemporary architectural discourse and practice.

40|$|It is {{sometimes}} claimed that contemporary Western culture has {{at its heart}} a God-shaped hole. It is an accusation more specifically levelled at modern art whenever it makes incursions into the church, especially when {{so many of the}} chosen artists openly admit to being atheists or agnostics. For some, the increasing use of non-confessional artists to produce work for the church is seen as a symptom of this spiritual vacuum; conversely, for others it signifies a repudiation <b>of</b> the <b>premises</b> <b>of</b> this <b>thesis,</b> in that spiritual values are judged to be no less evident just because a conventionally religious sensibility appears to be absent.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} philosophical, {{linguistic}} and textual interplay of absence and presence in Margaret Atwood's novel Cat's Eye. The <b>premise</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thesis</b> {{is that the}} novel posits language as a problematic communicative medium; as such, language conveys that meanings of words are flexible, mutable and transient. It is through frameworks which both establish states of absence and presence as well as destroy binary oppositions between the two that Cat's Eye conveys its positions about language. Thus, textual and extra-textual discourses about the natures of language and linguistic meaning are situated within recurrent thematic and formal attention to relationships between absence and presence. By exploring the roles of absence and presence in various phenomenological and linguistic contexts, this study concludes that absence/presence is a paradigm in Cat's Eye for {{the way in which}} words are (alternately as well as simultaneously) spoken and silent, understood and misunderstood, opposed and united...|$|R

40|$|Advances in the {{miniaturization}} of microelectromechanical components {{have led}} to battery powered and inexpensive sensor nodes, which can be networked in an ad hoc manner to perform distributed sensing and information processing. While sensor net-works can be deployed in inhospitable terrain to provide continuous monitoring and processing capabilities {{for a wide range}} of applications, sensor nodes are severely resource-constrained; they typically run on batteries and have a small amount of memory. Therefore, energy-efficient and lightweight protocols are necessary for dis-tributed information processing in these networks. The data provided by a sensor node is often useful only in the context of the loca-tion of the data source. Thus, sensor networks rely on localization schemes to provide location information to sensor nodes.

This paper analyzes political programs of ČSSD, KDU-ČSL and ODS. The qualitative approach to research of party documents was employed. The conclusion is that the core idea of family policy is the relationship of each party to the term "family" (which social meaning it bears) and to the state. This idea has an influence on setting the themes of family policy in the programmatic and on proposing family policy tools. The relationship between "family" and "state" is the space where the ideas of political parties meet. However, there are some themes in which it is possible to find partial or full parity. We can see in these themes some outside conditions, which have an influence on setting themes and tools. In some cases they can move the core idea of family policy in the programmatic of the chosen political parties...|$|R

This work focuses {{on the state of}} the democratic rule of law in Mexico and Uruguay. The <b>premise</b> <b>of</b> this <b>thesis</b> is that there is a gap in the literature on causes that have historically made Uruguay the country with the strongest democratic rule of law in Latin America and Mexico one with the weakest democratic rule of law. Historical institutionalism is used to see how the evolution of the sequencing of political regimes as well as the evolution of civil-military relations in the two countries may explain the divergent outcomes. Emphasizing path-dependency, this analysis is conducted using a methodology of process-tracing. This research serves to put forward propositions in the form of a testable hypothesis on the causes that have led Mexico and Uruguay down different paths when it comes to the democratic rule of law.

The foremost question that must be asked by anyone studying the tribunal is what is it meant to achieve? In my analysis, I focus on three primary issues: (1) what is the legal basis for the operation of the ICTFY? This involves looking both at the law that empowers the tribunal, as well as the laws that the tribunal will rely on in interpreting and prosecuting genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. (2) Should the ICTFY be regarded as a mechanism aimed at ending the conflict on the ground, and is this, in fact, a role that tribunals, domestic or international, are supposed to play; and (3) if so, is the ICTFY a successful resolution mechanism?

The <b>premise</b> <b>of</b> this <b>thesis</b> is that Business Process Reengineering, using information technology and other enablers of change, may produce quantum performance gains in these processes, particularly in terms of cycle time.

All three processes have tremendous potential to demonstrate dramatic reductions in cycle time, resulting in more efficient, streamlined satellite communications access request procedures at USTRANSCOM. The redesigns are based on delegation of authority, reducing the length of the process, and the introduction of an automated, web-based solution to streamline workflow and increase productivity.
