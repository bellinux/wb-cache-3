40|$|While the water–energy–food nexus {{approach}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important for more efficient resource utilization and economic development, limited quantitative tools are available to incorporate the approach in decision-making. We propose a spatially explicit framework that couples two well-established water and power system models to develop a decision support tool combining multiple nexus objectives in a linear objective function. To demonstrate our framework, we compare eight Nepalese power development scenarios based on five nexus objectives: minimization <b>of</b> <b>power</b> deficit, <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> water availability for irrigation to support food self-sufficiency, reduction in flood risk, <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> environmental flows, and maximization <b>of</b> <b>power</b> export. The deterministic multi-objective optimization model is spatially resolved to enable realistic representation of the nexus linkages and accounts for power transmission constraints using an optimal power flow approach. Basin inflows, hydropower plant specifications, reservoir characteristics, reservoir rules, irrigation water demand, environmental flow requirements, power demand, and transmission line properties are provided as model inputs. The trade-offs and synergies among these objectives were visualized for each scenario under multiple environmental flow and power demand requirements. Spatially disaggregated model outputs allowed for the comparison of scenarios not only based on fulfillment of nexus objectives but also scenario compatibility with existing infrastructure, supporting the identification of projects that enhance overall system efficiency. Though the model {{is applied to the}} Nepalese nexus from a power development perspective here, it can be extended and adapted for other problems...|$|R

40|$|ZigBee {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{potential}} standardized technologies for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Yet, sufficient energy-efficiency for the lowest power WSNs is achieved only in rather static networks. This severely limits the applicability of ZigBee in outdoor and mobile applications, where operation environment is harsh and link failures are common. This paper proposes a network channel beaconing (NCB) algorithm for improving ZigBee performance in dynamic cluster-tree networks. NCB reduces the energy consumption of passive scans by dedicating one frequency channel for network beacon transmissions and by energy optimizing their transmission rate. According to an energy analysis, the <b>power</b> consumption <b>of</b> network <b>maintenance</b> operations reduces by 70 %Ã¢Â€Â“ 76 % in dynamic networks. In static networks, energy overhead is negligible. Moreover, the service time for data routing increases up to 37 %. The performance of NCB is validated by ns- 2 simulations.

Facing the diminishment of economic capital, informants emphasized their cultural distinctiveness from the lower class in order to re-instill fading class boundaries. Simultaneously, the disruption of economic sustainability concurred with a quest for traditionalist stories of national community in which sparse space was made for betwixt and between Bolivian migrants.

Assessment <b>of</b> <b>power</b> transformers is a complex task from both – technical (condition) and economical (benefits and costs) point of view. The traditional economical tool of a cost budget for each individual element of the organisation does not show the effect on the profit that maintenance has.
