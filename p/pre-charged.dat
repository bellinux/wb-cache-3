50|$|The {{functional}} {{requirement of the}} high voltage <b>pre-charge</b> circuit is to minimize the peak current out from the power source by slowing down the dV/dT of the input power voltage such that a new “pre-charge mode” is created. Of course the inductive loads on the distribution system must be switched off during the precharge mode. While <b>pre-charging,</b> the system voltage will rise slowly and controllably with power-up current never exceeding the maximum allowed. As the circuit voltage approaches near steady state, then the <b>pre-charge</b> function is complete. Normal operation of a <b>pre-charge</b> circuit is to terminate <b>pre-charge</b> mode when the circuit voltage is 90% or 95% of the operating voltage. Upon completion of <b>pre-charging,</b> the <b>pre-charge</b> resistance is switched out of the power supply circuit and returns to a low impedance power source for normal mode. The high voltage loads are then powered up sequentially.|$|R
30|$|Our {{proposed}} full-adder {{cells are}} in dynamic logic style. There are two phases in a dynamic logic, <b>pre-charge</b> phase and evaluation phase. The <b>pre-charge</b> phase is accrued when Clock = 0; otherwise, the circuit enters the evaluation phase. A PMOS transistor connects the output nodes to their Vdd, at <b>pre-charge</b> phase. To avoid incorrect functionality and charge sharing problem, all the input values {{should be changed}} at <b>pre-charge</b> phase. In our designs, three capacitors and CNFETs with three different threshold voltages, low threshold, normal threshold, and high threshold, are used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pre-charging</b> is {{commonly}} used in battery electric vehicle applications. The current to the motor is regulated by a controller that employs large capacitors in its input circuit. Such systems typically have contactors (a high-current relay) to disable the system during inactive periods and {{to act as an}} emergency disconnect should the motor current regulator fail in an active state. Without <b>pre-charge</b> the high voltage across the contactors and inrush current can cause a brief arc which will cause pitting of the contacts. <b>Pre-charging</b> the controller input capacitors (typically to 90 to 95 percent of applied battery voltage) eliminates the pitting problem. The current to maintain the charge is so low that some systems apply the <b>pre-charge</b> at all times other than when charging batteries, while more complex systems apply <b>pre-charge</b> as part of the starting sequence and will defer main contactor closure until the <b>pre-charge</b> voltage level is detected as sufficiently high.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we analyze the power {{consumption}} of SRAM memories and {{demonstrate that the}} full functional <b>pre-charge</b> activity is not necessary during test because of the predictable addressing sequence. We exploit this observation {{in order to minimize}} power dissipation during test by eliminating the unnecessary power consumption associated with the <b>pre-charge</b> activity. This is achieved through a modified <b>pre-charge</b> control circuitry, exploiting the first degree of freedom of March tests, which permits to choose a specific addressing sequence. Further, the modified <b>pre-charge</b> logic allows also the switching between the normal functional mode and the low power test mode. We demonstrate that the modified <b>pre-charge</b> control circuitry has little or no effect on the memory performance. We analyze the sources of power consumption in functional and low power test mode, and we show how the power dissipation is computed for bit and word-oriented SRAMs. The efficiency of the proposed solution is validated through extensive Spice simulations for both bit-oriented and word-oriented SRAM.

40|$|Safe {{start-up}} procedure {{is critical for}} reliable operation of power converters. The challenges in start-up schemes of high-frequency (HF) transformer link inverters involve <b>pre-charge</b> of the capacitors without significant inrush currents and over-voltages. The <b>pre-charge</b> is normally followed by enabling of the closed-loop control. The over-voltage or inrush current problems in conventional start-up schemes available in literature are identified in this paper. A new start-up scheme is proposed which achieves the objectives of limiting inrush current and start-up over-voltages. This method does not require any additional dedicated <b>pre-charge</b> circuitry. The proposed scheme is validated using simulation and experimental results which agree with the theoretical prediction...|$|R
50|$|There are {{additional}} benefits: <b>pre-charging</b> reduces the electrical hazards which may {{occur when the}} system integrity is compromised due to hardware damage or failure. Activating the high voltage DC system into a short circuit or a ground fault or into unsuspecting personnel and their equipment can have undesired effects. Arc flash will be minimized if a <b>pre-charge</b> function slows down the activation time of a high voltage power-up. A slow <b>pre-charge</b> will also reduce the voltage into a faulty circuit which builds up while the system diagnostics come on-line. This allows a diagnostic shut down before the fault is fully realized in worst case proportions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new high performance dynamic hybrid flip-flop (DHFF) for pipeline stages and a new implanted logic module (DHFF-ILM). These proposed designs satisfy the low power and reduced pipeline overhead requirements. The DHFF presents less power dissipation since the node at the output which drives the output transistors is splits by which the <b>pre-charge</b> capacitance gets reduce. The major factor for power dissipation in flip-flops is <b>pre-charge</b> capacitance. So by reducing the <b>pre-charge</b> capacitance power dissipation is reduced in DHFF.
