50|$|An eight-strand rope {{consists}} of two left-twisting and two right-twisting pairs. Make sure the left-twisting strands are fed below left-twisting strands, and right-twisting strands below the right-twisting ones. Work systematically with different tape coulours {{to keep from getting}} lost in the mess of strands. An eight-strand square <b>plaited</b> <b>rope</b> can be used as mooring line or anchor rode.|$|E

50|$|This {{helped to}} cushion {{and support the}} {{carriage}} of the coolamon; the same purpose as those used by women in India and Africa to carry vessels on their heads. The Pintupi of the Western Desert would attach a double strand of <b>plaited</b> <b>rope</b> (ngalyibi) made of hair or plant fibre to sling the coolamon over their shoulders. They also wore smaller coolamons as hats, with the twine around the chin.|$|E

To make a cat o' nine tails, a rope is unravelled into three small ropes, each of which is unravelled again.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In the 1890 s {{and early}} 1900 s H. Compton Trew {{developed}} the bronco method of handling cattle for branding and other treatment. His innovation led to new {{words in the}} Australian lexicon, alterations in harness and stockyard design, the construction of special ‘bronco panels’, and the adoption of twisted greenhide ropes which largely replaced the <b>plaited</b> <b>ropes</b> {{that had previously been}} used. Production of a first‐class bronco rope required considerable skill. Their manufacture became a source of pride amongst outback cattlemen and they developed many variations in the treatment of the raw material, the way it was prepared, and the techniques used. Australian outback cattle stations, ‘broncoing’, cattle‐handling technology, greenhide rope,...|$|R

50|$|<b>Plaited</b> <b>rope</b> {{is made by}} {{braiding}} twisted strands, and is {{also called}} square braid. It is not as round as twisted rope and coarser to the touch. It is less prone to kinking than twisted rope and, depending on the material, very flexible and therefore easy to handle and knot. This construction exposes all fibres as well, with the same drawbacks as described above. Brait rope {{is a combination of}} braided and plaited, a non-rotating alternative to laid three-strand ropes. Due to its excellent energy-absorption characteristics, it is often used by arborists. It is also a popular rope for anchoring and can be used as mooring warps. This type of construction was pioneered by Yale Cordage.|$|E

6000|$|Ropes.--We have endeavoured to {{ascertain}} what ropes will best stand the sharp jerk {{which would be}} caused by a man falling suddenly into a crevasse, or down an ice-slope: and on this subject we lay before the Club the result of nearly a hundred experiments, made with various kinds of rope purchased of the best London makers. We considered that the least weight with which it was practically useful to test ropes, was twelve stone, as representing the average weight of a light man with his whole Alpine equipment. In the preliminary experiments, therefore, all ropes were rejected which did not support the strain produced by twelve stone falling five feet. Under this trial, all those <b>plaited</b> <b>ropes</b> which are generally supposed to be so strong, and many most carefully-made twisted ropes, gave way in such a manner as was very startling to some of our number, {{who had been in the}} habit of using these treacherous cords with perfect and most unfounded confidence. Only four ropes passed successfully through this trial; these were all made by Messrs. Buckingham and Sons, of 33, Broad-street, Bloomsbury, and can be procured only of them. We confined our further experiments to these ropes, one of which failed under severer tests, while the remaining three, made respectively of Manilla hemp, Italian hemp, and flax, proved so nearly equal in strength that it may fairly be doubted which is on the whole to be preferred. Each of these three ropes will bear twelve stone falling ten feet, and fourteen stone falling eight feet; and it may be useful to say that the strain upon a rope loaded with a weight of fourteen stone, and suddenly checked after a fall of eight feet, is nearly equal to that which is caused by a dead weight of two tons. None of these ropes, however, will bear a weight of fourteen stone falling ten feet; and the result of our experiments is, that no rope can be made, whether of hemp, flax, or silk, which is strong enough to bear that strain, and yet light enough to be portable. We believe that these ropes, which weigh about three-quarters of an ounce to the foot, are the heaviest which can be conveniently carried about in the Alps. We append a statement of the respective merits of the three kinds, all of which are now made by Messrs. Buckingham, expressly for the Club, and marked by a red worsted thread twisted in the strands:-- ...|$|R

The ropes made here traditionally by hand are mostly used for tethering animals whilst grazing. They get wet in dew and rain which soon makes them soft and rots them. Any chemical treatment here would have to be harmless to the skins of goats and cattle. The equipment needed is first for decorticating, or rather removing the soft cells from the fibre. This is currently done by pulling it between the person s heel and a metal edge such as a hoe. Secondly the fibres are rubbed between hand and leg to twist them into strings; these are then <b>plaited</b> into <b>rope.</b> In our workshop we are making a range of tools for carpenters, blacksmiths and farmers. Our aim is to teach blacksmiths to make tools to extend their rural business. If you can help me find plans or descriptions for the above tools, we could make some prototypes.

50|$|The fale is lashed {{and tied}} {{together}} with a <b>plaited</b> sennit <b>rope</b> called afa, handmade from dried coconut fibre. The afa is woven tight in complex patterns around the wooden frame, and binds the entire construction together. Afa is made from the husk of certain varieties of coconuts with long fibres, particularly the niu'afa (afa palm). The husks are soaked in fresh water to soften the interfibrous portion. The husks from mature nuts must be soaked from four to five weeks, or perhaps even longer, and very mature fibre is best soaked in salt water, but the green husk from a special variety of coconut is ready in four or five days.Soaking is considered {{to improve the quality}} of the fibre. Old men or women then beat the husk with a mallet on a wooden anvil to separate the fibres, which, after a further washing to remove interfibrous material, are tied together in bundles and dried in the sun. When this stage is completed, the fibres are manufactured into sennit by plaiting, a task usually done by elderly men or matai, and performed at their leisure. This usually involves them seated on the ground rolling the dried fibre strands against their bare thigh by hand, until heavier strands are formed. These long, thin strands are then woven together into a three-ply plait, often in long lengths, that is the finished sennit. The sennit is then coiled in bundles or wound tightly in very neat cylindrical rolls.|$|R
60|$|This {{was indeed}} too true. The {{top of the}} wall was faintly visible like a black line across the dark sky, and when Ben mounted on Bill's shoulders, it was found that he could only reach to within three feet of the bristling iron spikes with which it was surmounted. For half-an-hour they groped about, and made the {{discovery}} that they were in a small enclosure with bare walls of fifteen feet in height around them, and not a projection of any kind large enough for a mouse to lay hold of! In these circumstances many men would have given way to despair; but that was a condition of mind which neither of our tars ever thought of falling into. In the course of their explorations they came against each other, and immediately began an animated conversation in whispers, the result of which was that they groped for the umbrella, and, having found it, cut off all the cords about it, with which they proceeded to <b>plait</b> a <b>rope</b> strong enough to bear their weight. They sat down in silence to the work, leaning against the prison wall, and wrought for a full hour with the diligence of men whose freedom depends on their efforts. When finished, the rope was found to be about a yard too short for their purpose; but this defect was remedied by means of the canvas of their parachute, which they tore up into strips, twisted into an additional piece of rope, and spliced it to the other. A large loop was made on the end of it. Going once more to the wall, Ben mounted on Bill's shoulders, and threw the loop over the {{top of the wall}}; it caught, as had been expected, on one of the iron spikes. Ben then easily hauled himself up, hand over hand, and, getting hold of two spikes, raised himself so that he could see over the wall. Immediately after he descended.|$|R
