5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>MS.</b> The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>MS,</b> the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
5|$|Relapsing-remitting MS is {{characterized}} by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease. This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS. When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is {{sometimes referred to as}} benign MS, although people will still build up some degree of disability in the long term. On the other hand, the term malignant multiple sclerosis is used to describe <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>MS</b> having reached significant level of disability in a short period. The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis. 30 to 70% of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS.|$|E

HIV and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: overlapping epidemics To the Editor: <b>People</b> infected <b>with</b> Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV are much more likely to develop active tuberculosis (TB) than <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> tuberculosis but without HIV [1]. Patients infected with multidrug-resistant (MDR) -TB (defined as resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most powerful anti-TB drugs) require longer, more expensive treatment regimens than drug-susceptible TB, with poorer treatment success [2, 3]. Therefore, MDR-TB poses a major challenge to the control of TB, with an estimated global disease incidence in 2012 of, 450 000 cases (95 % CI 300 000 – 600 000) [4].

40|$|The Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) {{describes}} {{a condition of}} recurrent complex visual hallucinations in patients with visual impairment. This condition is related {{to higher levels of}} loneliness, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Research shows that the CBS does also occur in an auditory form, yet little research on this form is available. This study opposes to find a difference in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> hearing impairment with (aCBS) and without (controls) hallucinations with regard to loneliness, anxiety and depressive symptoms. This study compared the levels of loneliness, anxiety and depressive symptoms in 21 <b>people</b> <b>with</b> aCBS and in 11 controls. The presence or absence of hallucinations was established using the Questionnaire Psychotic Symptoms (QPE). And the levels of loneliness, anxiety and depressive symptoms were obtained using (respectively) De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale (DJGL), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). With regard to the level of loneliness no difference was found between <b>people</b> <b>with</b> aCBS (median = 2. 5) and controls (median = 1. 0) (p =. 601). <b>People</b> <b>with</b> aCBS (<b>M</b> = 9. 71) did also not differ from controls (M = 6. 36) on the level of anxiety (p =. 260). Finally, no difference was found between <b>people</b> <b>with</b> aCBS (<b>M</b> = 8. 86) and controls (M = 6. 82) with regard to the level of depressive symptoms (p =. 719). <b>People</b> <b>with</b> hearing impairment with hallucinations (aCBS) scored higher on the levels of loneliness, anxiety and depressive symptoms than <b>people</b> <b>with</b> hearing impairment without hallucinations (controls), but this difference did not reach statistical significance.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) {{plays an}} essential role in the immunologic maintenance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Although an increased rate of tuberculosis has been reported in humans treated with anti-TNF biological agents, disparate rates of disease have been observed between those treated with infliximab, an anti-TNF antibody, and etanercept, a TNF-neutralizing TNF receptor (TNFR) fusion molecule. We compared the effects of anti-TNF antibody and soluble TNFR fusion molecule in the murine model of tuberculosis. Systemic TNF neutralization was equivalent between these molecules, and both resulted in rapid morbidity at the initiation of infection. During chronic infection, administration of the receptor fusion molecule allowed the control of infection, whereas antibody treatment caused mice to die within a month. We provide evidence of decreased penetration into the granulomas by the receptor fusion molecule, compared with antibody. These findings begin to clarify the mechanistic difference between anti-TNF agents and their role in the exacerbation of tuberculosis.
