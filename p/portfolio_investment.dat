25|$|So far, the Tedpix index {{has been}} driven by {{domestic}} investors, including wealthy Iranians, public sector pension funds and the investment arms of state-owned banks. For the index to prosper in the long run, more foreign investors need to make significant share purchases. As at 2009, foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> accounts for only about 2 percent of the stock market in Iran. Foreign investors find it difficult to invest directly or indirectly, since banks cannot transfer funds, and there are no custodian banks because of sanctions.|$|E
25|$|President Zedillo (1994–2000) and President Fox (2000–06), of the National Action Party (Mexico), {{the first}} {{opposition}} party candidate {{to win a}} presidential election since {{the founding of the}} precursor of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1929, continued with trade liberalization. During Fox's administrations several FTAs were signed with Latin American and European countries, Japan and Israel, and both strove to maintain macroeconomic stability. Thus, Mexico {{became one of the most}} open countries in the world to trade, and the economy base shifted accordingly. Total trade with the United States and Canada tripled, and total exports and imports almost quadrupled between 1991 and 2003. The nature of foreign investment also changed with a greater share of foreign-direct investment (FDI) over <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Joe Flaherty, {{senior vice}} {{president}} at MFS Investment Management, [...] "the idea of risk parity goes back to the 1990s". In 1996, Bridgewater Associates launched a risk parity fund called the All Weather asset allocation strategy. [...] Although Bridgewater Associates was the first to bring a risk parity product to market, they did not coin the term. Instead the term [...] "risk parity" [...] was first used by Edward Qian, of PanAgora Asset Management, when he authored a white paper in 2005. In 2008 the name Risk Parity (short for Risk Premia Parity) was given to this <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> category by Andrew Zaytsev at the investment consulting firm Alan Biller and Associates. Soon, the term was adopted by the asset management industry. In time, other firms such as Aquila Capital (2004), Northwater, Wellington, Invesco, First Quadrant, Putnam Investments, ATP (2006), PanAgora Asset Management (2006), BlackRock (2009 - formerly Barclays Global Investors), 1741 Asset Management (2009), Neuberger Berman (2009), AllianceBernstein (2010), AQR Capital Management (2010), Clifton Group (2011), Salient Partners (2012), Schroders (2012), Natixis Asset Management (2013) and Allianz Global Investors (2015) began establishing risk parity funds.|$|E
40|$|Investors {{significantly}} overweight domestic {{assets in}} their portfolios. This behavior which is commonly called “home bias” contradicts the prescriptions of portfolio theory. This thesis explores potential {{reasons for the}} “home bias” by examining {{the characteristics of the}} investing and the target countries and features of the interaction between them. A common theme of the four essays is a focus on the importance of information about foreign markets in explaining the share of these markets in investors’ portfolios. The results indicate that the size of the equity ownership in another country strongly relates to the distance to the financial capital of that country, and to trade in goods with and direct investments (FDI) to that country. The first essay empirically investigates the relationship between trade in real goods and <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> Overall, the evidence indicates a substantial role for trade in reducing the information cost relating to <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> The second essay examines the implications of the launch of the European Monetary Union (EMU) on international <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> The evidence on the allocation of Finnish international <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments</b> is more consistent with an information-based than a diversification motive explanation. The third essay employs new data for a large number of countries and further explores the role of trade on international <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> The results indicate that trade provides important information especially on firms in countries in which the corporate governance structure and the information environment of firms generate less reliable information. The fourth essay examines the relationship between direct <b>investments</b> (FDI) and <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> In contrast to the predications of portfolio theory, it provides evidence that FDI is a complement rather than a substitute for <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} foreign direct investments (FDI) and foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> FDI is characterized by hands-on management style that enables the owner to obtain relatively refined information about the productivity of the firm. This superiority, relative to <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments,</b> comes with a cost: a firm owned by the relatively well-informed FDI investor has a low resale price because of ‘lemons’ type asymmetric information between the owner and potential buyers. Consequently, investors who have a higher (lower) probability of getting a liquidity shock that forces them to sell early will invest in <b>portfolio</b> (direct) <b>investments.</b> This result can explain the greater volatility of <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments</b> relative to direct investments. Motivated by empirical evidence, we show that this pattern may be weaker in developed economies that {{have higher levels of}} transparency in the capital market and better corporate governance. We also study welfare implications of the model. ...|$|R
