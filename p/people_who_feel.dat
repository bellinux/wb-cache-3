500|$|According to Shinkai's {{announcement}} of the film early during its production, The Garden of Words was his first attempt at making a love story using the traditional Japanese meaning of [...] "love". During {{the era of the}} Man'yōshū, the native Japanese words today known as [...] were starting to be written using kanji, and the word for [...] "love", koi (today written 恋) was written as 孤悲, or [...] "lonely sadness". As noted by Shinkai, a more modern concept of [...] "romance", represented by , came about by Western influence. The Garden of Words emphasizes the original meaning of koi—a [...] "longing for someone in solitude"—but in a modern setting. Loneliness is the central element of the film, according to Shinkai. In an interview, he said he created the film with the hope of cheering up <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> lonely or incomplete in their social relations. [...] However, he made a point that [...] "this movie doesn't treat loneliness as something that must be fixed." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>People</b> <b>who</b> {{prefer to}} <b>feel</b> useful emotions, {{even when they}} are {{unpleasant}} to experience, must understand emotions and seek to regulate them in strategic ways. Such people, therefore, may be more emotionally intelligent compared with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer to <b>feel</b> emotions that may not be useful for the context at hand, even if those emotions are pleasant to experience. We tested this hypothesis by measuring emotional intelligence and preferences to feel pleasant and unpleasant emotions in contexts in which {{they are likely to be}} useful or not. We found significant positive associations between emotional intelligence and preferences for useful emotions, even when controlling for trait emotional experiences and cognitive intelligence. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> prefer to <b>feel</b> anger when confronting others tend to be higher in emotional intelligence, whereas <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer to <b>feel</b> happiness in such contexts tend to be lower in emotional intelligence. Such findings are consistent with the idea that wanting to feel bad may be good at times, and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|Is it {{adaptive}} to seek pleasant {{emotions and}} avoid unpleasant emotions {{all the time}} or seek pleasant and unpleasant emotions at the right time? Participants reported on their preferences for anger and happiness in general and in contexts in which they might be useful or not (i. e., confrontations and collaborations, respectively). <b>People</b> <b>who</b> generally wanted to feel more happiness and less anger experienced greater well-being. However, when emotional preferences were examined in context, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> wanted to <b>feel</b> more anger or more happiness when they were useful, and <b>people</b> <b>who</b> wanted to <b>feel</b> less of those emotions {{when they were not}} useful, experienced greater well-being. Such patterns could not be explained by differences in the perceived usefulness of emotions, intelligence, perceived regulatory skills, emotional acceptance, social desirability, or general emotional preferences. These findings demonstrate that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> want to <b>feel</b> unpleasant emotions when they are useful may be happier overall...|$|R
500|$|He ceased most {{literary}} activities {{later in}} the year, and confessed in his diary: [...] "My spiritual state is probably {{the same as that}} of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> their final hour nearing and lose all hope". The writer was probably planning to move out of the city and into Fundulea, breaking all connections with his peers. Despite this abrupt change, Caragiale had not entirely abandoned his writing career. In 1931, the Oradea-based cultural magazine Cele Trei Crișuri published his memoir, titled Vechi impresii de spectator ("Old Impressions of a Spectator"). In it, Caragiale stated having reached [...] "a serene maturity", and indicated: [...] "I now placidly begin the rhythm of a new life." [...] He was planning to write a biography of Albrecht Joseph Reichsgraf von Hoditz, an extravagant Silesian nobleman of the 18th century, who is briefly mentioned in [...] "Cele trei hagialâcuri", and was also interested in the works of two French classics, Antoine Furetière and Honoré de Balzac. He was preoccupied with death, which he feared greatly. In early 1935, soon after reading Stefan Zweig's texts on faith healing, he recorded the effect it had on his life as [...] "the revelation of my intellectual superiority, my intuition and my power of reflection, as well as the latent forces that I feel at the foundation of my being." [...] He also made a point of renouncing his hectic lifestyle, giving up alcohol and coffee.|$|E

In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess there are some <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Warner Bros., {{feeling the}} film had become {{relevant}} again {{due to the}} Iraq War, decided to re-release it in theaters and on DVD. Having no additional footage to add, Russell instead shot Soldiers Pay, a short documentary about the Iraq War, to accompany the film. Taking its name from William Faulkner's first novel {{of the same name}} about an airman's return home in World War I's aftermath, Russell said the documentary examined [...] "both sides of the war, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> good about the war, who believe in the mission, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|POS is {{also related}} to {{employee}} commitment, which can be negatively affected {{by a sense of}} helplessness in the event of change.

2500|$|<b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> that Quebec {{nationalism}} is still ethnic have often expressed their {{opinion that the}} sentiments of Quebec's nationalists are insular and parochial and concerned with preserving a [...] "pure laine" [...] population of white francophones within the province. These accusations have always been vigorously denounced by Quebec nationalists of all sides, and such sentiments are generally considered as unrepresentative of the intellectual and mainstream political movements in favour of a wider independence for Quebec, seeing the movement as a multi-ethnic cause.|$|E
2500|$|American Archbishop Blase Cupich said he {{believed}} that the Synod would benefit from hearing from [...] "the actual voices of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> marginalized, rather than having them filtered through the voices of other representatives or the bishops." [...] He specifically cited [...] "the elderly, or the divorced and remarried, gay and lesbian individuals, also couples." [...] American bishop George V. Murry said the assembly would have benefited from [...] "presentations by theologians, biblical scholars, canonists or cultural historians, to get a broader view" [...] of the issues facing them.

By 1997 the 13-member Calcutta congregation had grown to more than 4,000 sisters who managed orphanages, AIDS hospices and charity centres worldwide, caring for refugees, the blind, disabled, aged, alcoholics, the poor and homeless and victims of floods, epidemics and famine.|$|E

2500|$|The Rasta message {{resonates with}} many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> marginalised and alienated by {{the values and}} {{institutions}} of their society. In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora {{by allowing them to}} psychologically reject their social stigmatisation. It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance. Cashmore expressed the view that [...] "whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance." [...] According to sociologist of religion Peter B. Clarke, Rastafari [...] "helped to provide many people of African descent with a deeper sense of their African identity".|$|E
2500|$|Out of the {{conviction}} {{of the need to}} educate children to take an interest in community, [...] "bringing them the awareness of being living, active members of the People of God" [...] and because of the fascination which Saint Francis of Assisi can exercise on them, the formation of groups of children should be encouraged. With the help of a pedagogy and an organization suitable to their age, these children should be initiated into a knowledge and love of the Franciscan life. National statutes will give an appropriate orientation for the organization of these groups and their relationship to the fraternity and to the groups of Franciscan youth. The Franciscan Youth is formed by those young <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> called by the Holy Spirit to share the experience of the Christian life in fraternity, {{in the light of the}} message of Francis, deepening their own vocation within the context of the Secular Franciscan Order.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{networking}} {{can also}} affect {{the extent to}} which a person feels lonely. In a Newsweek article, Johannah Cornblatt explains [...] "Social-networking sites like Facebook and MySpace may provide people with a false sense of connection that ultimately increases loneliness in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> alone." [...] John T. Cacioppo, a neuroscientist at the University of Chicago, claims that social networking can foster feelings of sensitivity to disconnection, which can lead to loneliness. Fabio Sabatini and Francesco Sarracino found that if an individual tends to (a) trust people and (b) have a significant number of face-to-face interactions, the individual is likely to assess their own well-being as relatively high. The researchers found that online social networking plays a positive role in subjective well-being when the networking is used to facilitate physical interactions, but networking activities that do not facilitate face-to-face interactions tend to erode trust, and this erosion can then negatively affect subjective well-being (independent of the online social interaction itself). Sabatini and Sarracino conclude that [...] "The overall effect of networking on individual welfare is significantly negative." [...] However, some scholars have expressed that concerns about social networking are often exaggerated and poorly researched.|$|E
2500|$|These {{last two}} {{examples}} highlight a phenomenon commonly seen in witch hunts, what historians call [...] "refusal guilt syndrome".
