We explore the impact of monetary <b>policy</b> shocks <b>on</b> real <b>house</b> prices and housing investment, using US state-level data. To this end we estimate VAR models for the period 1988 - 2009, to assess the differential effect - if any - of a common monetary <b>policy</b> shock <b>on</b> <b>house</b> prices and investment. Our VAR models also allow us to explore the macroeconomic effect of wealth shocks that originate in the housing market (housing prices). Our empirical models include key macroeconomic variables, namely personal income, prices and the federal funds rate, as well as housing market variables, e. g. real house prices, given by the FHFA house price index, and housing investment, proxied by the number of housing starts. Our baseline estimates suggest that transmission of monetary policy is heterogeneous across US states. Moreover, our VAR models indicate the presence of a wealth effect across most US states, as a positive housing price innovation leads to a strong, negative response of personal income.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} assess the impact of {{monetary}} <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> <b>house</b> price inflation for the nine census divisions of the US economy. Design/methodology/approach – A factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) model is estimated using a large data set comprising of 126 quarterly series over the period 1976 : 01 to 2005 : 02. Findings – Overall, the results of this investigation show that house price inflation responds negatively to a positive monetary policy shock, suggesting that the framework does not experience the widely observed price puzzle encountered while analyzing monetary policy shocks with standard sized VARs. Research limitations/implications – The paper only considers house price inflation and ignores other housing market variables. Moreover, given the recent economy-wide decline in the house price growth rates, it would be worthwhile to update the data set to a more recent period, to capture the possible breakdown in the relationship of house prices with fundamentals driving the market. Practical implications – The results based on the impulse response functions indicate that, in general, house price inflation responds negatively to monetary policy shock, but the responses are heterogeneous across the census divisions. In addition, the findings suggest, in particular, the importance of South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain and the Pacific divisions in shaping the dynamics of US house price inflation. Originality/value – To the best of one's knowledge, this is the first paper to analyze the effect of monetary <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> <b>house</b> price inflation in the nine census divisions of the US economy using a FAVAR model.

40|$|In {{addition}} to providing utility, and possibly capital gains, housing facilitates credit transactions when home equity serves as collateral. We document big increases in home-equity loans coinciding with the US house-price boom, and suggest a connection. When it is used as collateral, housing bears a liquidity premium. Since liquidity is endogenous, and depends to some extent on beleifs, even when fundamentals are deterministic and time invariant equilibrium house prices can display complicated patterns, including cyclic, chaotic and stochastic trajectories. Some equilibrium price paths {{look a lot like}} bubbles. The framework is tractable, yet captures several salient features of housing markets qualitatively, and to some extent quantitatively. We examine various mechanisms for determining the terms of trade, and different ways of specifying credit restrictions.

The housing market can influence monetary transmission through three channels, namely, the nature of the interest burden of mortgage loans, asset (house) prices, and the credit channel. The study first summarises the experiences of developed countries, paying special attention to issues arising from the monetary union. It then examines the developments in the Hungarian housing and mortgage markets in the last 15 years, as well as the expected developments and changes attendant to the adoption of the euro.

Therefore, renter dominated central cities provide public goods inefficiently and have high taxes and high debt. Since house prices are lower in the central city, few houses are built and households migrate to the suburbs as houses depreciate.
