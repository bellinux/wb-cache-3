60|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{assumes that}} they were parallel from the unknown beginning and will be to the unknown end. The second hypothesis assumes that the apparent parallelism is not real and complete, at least aboriginally, but approximate or temporary; that we should find the lines convergent in the past, if we could trace them far enough; that some of them, if produced back, would fall into certain fragments of lines, which have left traces in the past, lying not exactly in the same direction, and these farther back into others {{to which they are}} equally unparallel. It will also claim that the present lines, whether on the whole really or only approximately parallel, sometimes fork or send off branches on one side or the other, producing new lines (varieties), which run for a while, and for aught we know indefinitely when not interfered with, near and approximately parallel to the <b>parent</b> <b>line.</b> This claim it can establish; and it may also show that these close subsidiary lines may branch or vary again, and that those branches or varieties which are best adapted to the existing conditions may be continued, while others stop or die out. And so we may have the basis of a real theory of the diversification of species and here indeed, there is a real, though a narrow, established ground to build upon But as systems of organic Nature, both doctrines are equally hypotheses, are suppositions of what there is no proof of from experience, assumed in order to account for the observed phenomena, and supported by such indirect evidence as can be had.|$|E

We define eight morphological characteristics that comprise the mature tomato leaf and describe loci that affect each of these characters. We found 30 QTL that contribute one or more of these characters. Of these 30 QTL, 22 primarily affect leaf dissection and 8 primarily affect leaf size.

Environmental means for grain yield ranged from 584 to 47 g m- 2. In all environments, hybrids outyielded their <b>parent</b> <b>lines,</b> with a mean relative hybrid superiority of 54 %. Blending effects were non-significant. Combined analyses of variance were computed with logarithmically transformed data. Entry x environment interaction effects were more important than genetic effects. Lines in pure stand contributed most to the total entry x environment interaction variance. Wide ranges were found within all four groups for stability parameters derived from regression analysis. On average, hybrids in pure stand had most favorable values. Pattern analysis (classification and ordination techniques) {{was applied to the}} environment-standardized matrix of entry means from the individual environments. A one-way classification clearly distinguished homozygous from heterozygous entries. Heterogeneous entries were not consistently grouped together. Performance plots for different entry groups showed various patterns of adaptation and illustrated the superiority of heterozygous entries. The biplot from ordination underlined the importance of entry x type-of-drought-stress interaction.

Whereas there was a generally good correlation between the degree of resistance {{and the amount of}} P-glycoprotein, no relationship between resistance and CP 22 expression was seen. At 3. 3 microM verapamil, the sensitisation of the MDR cell lines was no greater than that of the <b>parent</b> <b>line.</b> At 6. 6 microM verapamil, however, sensitisation of the MDR lines generally exceeded that of the <b>parent</b> <b>line,</b> although the line CR 2. 0, expressing very high levels of P-glycoprotein was an exception. Little sensitisation to etoposide was seen in any of the lines. When cyclosporin A was used as the sensitiser at either 2. 1 or 4. 2 microM, there was a greater effect in lines expressing moderate to high levels of P-glycoprotein than in the <b>parent</b> <b>line,</b> although this tendency was less for adriamycin than for the other cytotoxics.
