The term [...] "bridge" [...] originally {{referred to a}} group of telephone company test lines that were bridged together giving the effect of a party-line.

5000|$|Prior to 1990, {{people who}} {{manipulated}} telecommunication systems, known as <b>phreakers,</b> were generally not prosecuted within the United States. The majority of <b>phreakers</b> used software to obtain calling card numbers and built simple tone devices {{in order to}} make free telephone calls. A small elite, highly technical segment of <b>phreakers</b> were more interested in information about {{the inner workings of the}} telecommunication system than in making free phone calls. Phone companies complained of financial losses from phreaking activities. The switch from analog to digital equipment began to expose more of the inner workings of telephone companies as hackers began to explore the inner workings, switches and trunks. Due to a lack of laws and expertise on the part of American law enforcement, few cases against hackers were prosecuted until Operation Sundevil.|$|R

Looking {{on local}} records for inordinately long calls to directory service or other hints that <b>phreakers</b> were using a particular switch, filters could then be installed to block efforts at that end office. Many <b>phreakers</b> were forced to use pay telephones as the telephone company technicians regularly tracked long-distance toll free calls in an elaborate cat-and-mouse game. AT&T instead turned to the law for help, {{and a number of}} phreaks were caught by the government.|$|R

" Well, LOA stands for Legion Of the Apocalypse, which is a group of elite hackers and <b>phreakers</b> in my area. The current members of LOA are: Revelation, Phreaked Out, Hack Attack, Electric Jaguar, and Phreak Show I started LOA when I discovered that there were many good hackers and <b>phreakers</b> in my area. I thought that an organized group of hackers and <b>phreakers</b> would accomplish much more than an individual could by himself.

50|$|Into {{the turn}} of the 21st century, phreaks began to focus on the {{exploration}} and playing with the network, and the concept of toll fraud became widely frowned on among serious <b>phreakers,</b> primarily {{under the influence of the}} website Phone Trips, put up by second generation phreaks Mark Bernay and Evan Doorbell.|$|R
50|$|Publicly {{accessible}} reverse telephone directories may {{be provided}} {{as part of}} the standard directory services from the telecommunications carrier in some countries. In other countries these directories are often created by phone <b>phreakers</b> by collecting the information available via the publicly accessible directories and then providing a search function which allows users to search by the telephone service details.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of the Internet in the mid-1990s, along with the better awareness of voice mail by business and cell phone owners, made the practice of stealing voice mailboxes less popular. To this day bridges are still very popular with <b>phreakers</b> yet, {{with the advent of}} VoIP, the use of telephone company owned bridges has decreased slightly in favor of phreaker-owned conferences.|$|R
50|$|The term first {{referred}} to groups who had reverse engineered {{the system of}} tones used to route long-distance calls. By re-creating these tones, phreaks could switch calls from the phone handset, allowing free calls to be made around the world. To ease the creation of these tones, electronic tone generators known as blue boxes became {{a staple of the}} <b>phreaker</b> community, including future Apple Inc. cofounders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.|$|E
5000|$|Lamer is a jargon or slang name {{originally}} {{applied in}} cracker and <b>phreaker</b> culture {{to someone who}} did not really understand what they were doing.

5000|$|During {{its first}} 10 years of publication, Phrack {{has been largely}} {{associated}} with the telecommunications fraud, providing material for <b>phreakers</b> and informing about arrests in this community through the Phrack World News feature articles. Along {{with the release of}} articles such as [...] "Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit" [...] and the editorship of daemon9/route in 1996, Phrack became more computer security oriented and closer to the current definition of hacking.|$|R
50|$|As {{knowledge}} of phreaking spread, a minor culture {{emerged from the}} increasing number of phone phreaks. Sympathetic (or easily social-engineered) telephone company employees were persuaded to reveal the various routing codes to use international satellites and trunk lines. At the time it was felt that there was nothing Bell could do to stop this. Their entire network was based on this system, so changing the system in order to stop the <b>phreakers</b> would require a massive infrastructure upgrade.|$|R
50|$|Phreaking is a slang term coined to {{describe}} the activity of a culture of people who study, experiment with, or explore telecommunication systems, such as equipment and systems connected to public telephone networks. The term phreak is a sensational spelling of the word freak with the ph- from phone, and may also refer {{to the use of}} various audio frequencies to manipulate a phone system. Phreak, <b>phreaker,</b> or phone phreak are names used for and by individuals who participate in phreaking.|$|E
5000|$|The magazine's {{name comes}} from the <b>phreaker</b> {{discovery}} in the 1960s that the transmission of a 2600 hertz tone (which could be produced perfectly with a plastic toy whistle given away free with Cap'n Crunch cereal - discovered by friends of John Draper) over a long-distance trunk connection gained access to [...] "operator mode" [...] and allowed the user to explore aspects of the telephone system that were not otherwise accessible. The magazine was given its name by David Ruderman, who co-founded the magazine with his college friend, Eric Corley. Ruderman ended his direct involvement with the magazine three years later.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{contrary}} to numerous stories, before finding {{the articles in}} the Bell System Technical Journal it was discovered by many, some very unintentionally and to their annoyance, that a 2600 Hz tone, used by AT&T Corporation as a steady signal to mark currently unused long-distance telephone lines, or [...] "trunk lines", would reset those lines. Joe Engressia (known as Joybubbles) accidentally discovered it {{at the age of}} 7 by whistling (with his mouth). He and other famous phone phreaks, such as [...] "Bill from New York" [...] and [...] "The Glitch", trained themselves to whistle 2600 Hz to reset a trunk line. They also learned how to route phone calls by [...] At one point in the 1960s, packets of the Cap'n Crunch breakfast cereal included a free gift: a small whistle that (by coincidence) generated a 2600 Hz tone when one of the whistle's two holes was covered.

5000|$|... 1971 {{also saw}} the {{beginnings}} of YIPL (Youth International Party Line), a publication started by Abbie Hoffman and Al Bell to provide information to Yippies on how to [...] "beat the man," [...] mostly involving telephones. In {{the first issue of}} YIPL, writers included a [...] "shout-out" [...] to all of the <b>phreakers</b> who provided technological information for the newsletter: [...] "We at YIPL would like to offer thanks to all you phreaks out there." [...] At the end of the issue, YIPL stated: ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>phreakers</b> {{informed}} Draper that a toy whistle that was, at the time, {{packaged in}} boxes of Cap'n Crunch cereal could emit a tone at precisely 2600 hertz—the same frequency {{that was used}} by AT&T long lines to indicate that a trunk line was ready and available to route a new call. [...] This would effectively disconnect {{one end of the}} trunk, allowing the still connected side to enter an operator mode. Experimenting with this whistle inspired Draper to build blue boxes: electronic devices capable of reproducing other tones used by the phone company.|$|R
50|$|According to this philosophy, hackers, crackers, and <b>phreakers</b> are liberators of {{information}} {{which is being}} held hostage by agents demanding money for its release. Other participants in this network include cypherpunks who educate people to use public-key cryptography to protect {{the privacy of their}} messages from corporate or governmental snooping and programmers who write free software and open source code. Still others create Free-Nets allowing users to gain access to computer resources for which they would otherwise need an account. They might also break copyright law by swapping music, movies, or other copyrighted materials over the Internet.|$|R
