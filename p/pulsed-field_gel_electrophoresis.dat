Chromosomal DNA fragmentation was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis was required for DNA fragmentation. Phosphonoacetic acid, an inhibitor of EBV DNA polymerase, did not inhibit fragmentation of chromosomal DNA. These findings suggest that EBV-specific early proteins participate in fragmentation of chromosomal DNA. Chromosomal DNA of P 3 HR- 1 cells was also fragmented by treatment with n-butyrate plus 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), which induced activation of latent EBV genome following viral replication.

The gene's sequence confirms its identity and indicates that it is less conserved evolutionarily than the trypanosome 5 S rRNA gene previously described by our laboratory (6).

Trypanosomes were propagated in Schneider's Drosophila medium and characterized by isoenzyme analysis and molecular karyotyping.

One hundred seventeen clinical isolates from 40 patients were evaluated. CHEF and REA were performed on each of the isolates, and the results of the two procedures were compared. The REA procedure revealed 8 different types of Candida lusitaniae, 20 of Torulopsis glabrata, 5 of Candida tropicalis, 3 of Candida parapsilosis, and 7 of Candida kefr, whereas the CHEF method revealed 14 different types of C. lusitaniae, 16 of T. glabrata, 10 of C. tropicalis, 10 of C. parapsilosis, and 7 of C. kefyr.
