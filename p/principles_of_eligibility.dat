25|$|It was {{impossible}} to achieve both these aims, as the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> less <b>eligibility</b> made people search for work in towns and cities.

Workhouse construction and the amalgamation of unions was slow. Outdoor relief did continue after the PLAA was introduced.|$|R
50|$|Any Keal Cotes {{homeless}} poor were {{housed in}} the Spilsby Poor Law Union Workhouse at nearby Hundleby. The workhouse was recorded in 1870 as having 280 residents. Inmates were free to enter and leave as they liked and would receive free food and accommodation. However, the concern was that too liberal a regime would lead to many people who could easily work taking it easy in the workhouse. This would lead not only to an excessive charge on charitable funds but a dilution of the work ethic. To counter this the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> less <b>eligibility</b> was developed. Workhouse life was deliberately made as harsh and degrading as possible so that only the truly destitute would apply. Attempts were also made to provide moral guidance, training and education to the poor {{but it would be}} fair to say that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> less <b>eligibility</b> combined with the ever-present desire to save money scuppered any real chance of success in this area. The workhouse was later converted into Spilsby's Gables Hospital that was demolished in 2004 to provide land for the building of new private housing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Medical {{research}} {{would benefit from}} automatic methods that support eligibility evaluation for patient enrollment in clinical trials and design <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> criteria. In this study we addressed the problem <b>of</b> formalizing <b>eligibility</b> criteria. By analyzing a large set of breast cancer clinical trials we derived a set of patterns, that capture typical structure of conditions, pertaining to syntax and semantics. We qualitatively analyzed their expressivity and evaluated coverage using regular expressions, running experiments on a few thousands of clinical trials also related to other diseases. Based on an early evaluation we conclude that derived patterns cover the language <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> criteria {{to a large extent}} and may serve as a semi-formal representation. We expect that extending the presented method for pattern recognition with recognition of ontology concepts will facilitate generating computable queries and automated reasoning for various applications. Key words: <b>eligibility</b> criteria, patterns <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> criteria, regular expressions for <b>eligibility</b> criteria, formalization <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> criteria...|$|R
