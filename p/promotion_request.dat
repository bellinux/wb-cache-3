50|$|Despite {{the earlier}} controversy, Whiting was {{elevated}} to division command in early 1862, though Johnston's <b>promotion</b> <b>request</b> was denied. He led his strong division, {{consisting of the}} brigades of Hood, Hampton, Law, Pettigrew and Hatton, in the Battle of Seven Pines. Stationed {{in the center of}} the Confederate line he led his force into the flanks of Keyes's IV Corps, but was repulsed due to Union reinforcements in form of Sedgwick's division. Despite the repulse and heavy losses (including 3 of his brigade commanders) Whiting was praised by General Joe Johnston. Whiting rapidly redeployed with 11 regiments to support Stonewall Jackson in his second Valley Campaign. Afterwards he returned southward by rail to arrive in time for the Peninsula Campaign, leading his division in the battles at Gaines' Mill and Malvern Hill. Whiting's division having suffered over 1000 casualties during the Seven Days Battles without any significant success General Robert E. Lee was not satisfied with Whiting's performance and replaced him with Brigadier General Hood.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the contrastive analysis of authentic persuasive business correspondence written in English by Thai speakers and native English speakers in the Thai business context. Three types of persuasive correspondence - sales <b>promotion,</b> <b>request,</b> and invitation - were analysed from contrastive text linguistic and pragmatic perspectives. The purpose was to examine, compare and contrast their rhetorical structures, functions and linguistic realisations as well as persuasive and politeness strategies, and to compare these features {{to those found in}} textbook samples of persuasive letters in order to investigate the extent to which those samples represent the authentic, real-life correspondence. The findings report on cross-cultural variations which differentiate the persuasive writing patterns and strategies of Thais and native English speakers. Despite some shared writing conventions, the findings reveal diversity in some rhetorical moves, linguistic realisations, rhetorical appeals and politeness strategies. The diversity includes some cultural-bound discourse patterns and cultural-specific textual features, many of which can be traced to interference from the Thai language and culture. An exploration of the nature of sales <b>promotion,</b> <b>request,</b> and invitation letters presented in one American and two Thai textbooks on Business English writing reveals that their letter samples reflect the characteristics of the authentic corpus in the business contexts to which they belong. The implications of this research are twofold. First, it has implications for the teaching of English business letter writing especially in the Thai context and the innovation of more advanced materials and methods for this pedagogical purpose. Second, it raises an awareness of differences in persuasive writing across languages and cultures, worth noting for developing cross-cultural understanding and communication strategies for effective intercultural business interactions in the dynamic business environment of the 21 st century...|$|E

To overcome this problem, we make use of Social network analysis to identify young researchers most likely to become successful. We assume that the co-authorship graph reveals a great deal of information about the potential of young researchers. We built a Social network of 62, 886 researchers using the data available in CiteSeerx. We then designed and trained SVM and Naïve Bayes classifiers to learn how to identify emerging authors based on the personal and Social aspects of a set of 3, 200 young researchers, who had an h-index of less than or equal to four in 2005. We concluded that the success of young researchers largely depends on the number of their early citations, the number of their collaborators, and the impact and recent research activity of their collaborators...|$|R
50|$|Momyer {{has been}} subject to criticisms for his {{relationship}} to subordinates and insistence on implementation of his own views. Brigadier General Chuck Yeager, in his autobiography, related that in early 1968 he had been assigned as prospective commander of the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing, a unit at Phan Rang Air Base in Vietnam. While he was awaiting orders, Yeager was advised that Momyer had rejected him because as Seventh Air Force commander, he was entitled to select his own wing commanders and had not been consulted about the assignment. This resulted in Yeager being forced on Momyer by General John D. Ryan, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) commander and a Yeager admirer. Although Momyer prevailed in the subsequent political tug of war, the controversy resulted in Momyer's lasting enmity towards Yeager, whom he had never met, for reasons that Yeager was unable to discern. Later that year Momyer became commander of TAC, in which Yeager was now a wing commander, culminating in early 1969 in a showdown in which Momyer purportedly threatened to terminate Yeager's command and possibly career. Yeager instead was promoted to brigadier general when the <b>promotion</b> board <b>requested</b> that Yeager be added to its selection choices after Momyer did not include {{him as one of}} his TAC recommendations.|$|R

Between the years 1890 - 1929, the United States became increasingly urban and industrial and the frontier experience as a reality receded further into the past while the myth of the frontier, with the work of Fredrick Jackson Turner, and others became an ever-growing part of the American psyche. In examining the regional characteristics of western Kansas during this period, {{a better understanding of the}} process of identity and image formation in the western United States emerges. Also the knowledge base of the sub-regions of the Great Plains is expanded and enhanced. Specific information about community organizations, promotion, and politics is added to the historical record.

Dredd's hatred for the administrative side of the job was well known (he personally turned down the chief judge's chair many times to avoid it), but he went to work in his usual style.

40|$|WILLIAMSBURG [...] The Marshall-Wythe School of Law at the College of William and Mary {{is facing}} several {{accreditation}} problems {{in addition to}} the much publicized inadequacy of physical facilities. Dr. Thomas A. Graves Jr., college president, held a press conference Sept. 24 to state that representatives of the American Bar Association 2 ̆ 7 s Council on Accrediting had warned William and Mary that it faced a possible loss of accreditation because the law school building is 2 ̆ 2 the most inadequate physical plant of any ABA-approved law school in the country. 2 ̆ 2 But reports given newsmen, Tuesday indicated that Graves had made public only a part of the problems threatening the nation 2 ̆ 7 s oldest law school. William and Mary officials have received reports from the ABA indicating that the law school should move toward much more independence {{from the rest of the}} college. Decline to Discuss It A school spokesperson declined to discuss the report Tuesday, which he said 2 ̆ 2 pertained strictly to internal matters and the relationship of the law school with the rest of the college. 2 ̆ 2 The ABA communication also indicated that the William and Mary administration should not have veto power over law school faculty appointments and promotions. It is known that on July 31 William and Mary received a letter from the ABA citing six specific areas that posed accreditation problems. William and Mary made public four of the areas [...] a need for more books in the law library, inadequate physical facilities, inadequate faculty salaries and inadequate professional staffing for the law library [...] but the other two areas were not made public. Those dealt directly with the administrative status of the law school in relation with the other schools at the college and with the top administrative structure itself, or the manner in which the college administration controls promotions and appointments to the law faculty. Control of Appointments The control over faculty appointments has been obvious since the Saad el-Amin (Jeroyd X Greene) incident last year when the law school faculty voted to offer a position to the then-Richmond lawyer and Graves recommended to the board of visitors that the position not be granted. The board supported his decision. It is also known that the law school has been striving for a number of years to separate itself from the other faculties at the college [...] business, education, and arts and sciences [...] in order to gain a better promotion scale and better salary scale for its professors. College administrators only granted a few of the <b>promotion</b> <b>requests</b> that came from the law school last year. A college spokesperson said that the internal matters in the ABA report were not made public because they were, in fact, college affairs. 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 7 re working on solving them, 2 ̆ 2 the spokesman said. Not Involved 2 ̆ 2 They don 2 ̆ 7 t involve any requirement to have the governor or the General Assembly act. 2 ̆ 2 The governor and the assembly would have to act to enable William and Mary to secure the nearly 5. 6 million required to construct a law school building, which would solve the item of poor facilities mentioned in the ABA report. James P. White of Indiana University, a consultant to the ABA council, arrived in Williamsburg late Tuesday for his third visit to the school this year. He is scheduled to meet Wednesday morning from 9 to 11 a. m. with Graves and Acting Law School Dean Emeric Fischer and for an hour at 11 a. m. with the law school faculty...|$|R
40|$|As a {{major source}} for {{information}} on virtually any topic, Wikipedia serves {{an important role in}} public dissemination and consumption of knowledge. As a result, it presents tremendous potential for people to promulgate their own points of view; such efforts may be more subtle than typical vandalism. In this paper, we introduce new behavioral metrics to quantify the level of controversy associated with a particular user: a Controversy Score (C-Score) based on the amount of attention the user focuses on controversial pages, and a Clustered Controversy Score (CC-Score) that also takes into account topical clustering. We show that both these measures are useful for identifying people who try to "push" their points of view, by showing that they are good predictors of which editors get blocked. The metrics can be used to triage potential POV pushers. We apply this idea to a dataset of users who <b>requested</b> <b>promotion</b> to administrator status and easily identify some editors who significantly changed their behavior upon becoming administrators. At the same time, such behavior is not rampant. Those who are promoted to administrator status tend to have more stable behavior than comparable groups of prolific editors. This suggests that the Adminship process works well, and that the Wikipedia community is not overwhelmed by users who become administrators to promote their own points of view...|$|R
40|$|Getting a {{promotion}} {{or a new}} position are important parts of the scientific career process. Ironically, a committee whose membership has limited ability to truly judge your scholarly standing is often charged with making these decisions.

The rules focus on what might be added to a CV, research statement, personal statement, or cover letter, depending on {{the format of the}} <b>requested</b> <b>promotion</b> materials. In part, the rules suggest that you educate the commit-tee members, who have a range of expertise, on what they should find impor-tant in the promotion application provided by a computational biologist. Further, while some rules are generally applicable, the focus here is on promotion in an academic setting. Having said that, in such a setting teaching and community service are obviously important, but barely touched upon here. Rather, the focus is on how to maximize the appreciation of your research-related activities. As a final thought before we get started on the rules, this is not just about you, but an opportu-nity to educate a broad committee on what is important in our field. Use that oppor-tunity well, for it will serve future genera-tions of computational biologists...|$|R
50|$|Meredith and his Hoosiers fought {{their first}} {{engagement}} during the Northern Virginia Campaign at Brawner's Farm, where his horse was shot from under him, crushing him and breaking several ribs. During the Maryland Campaign, Meredith {{took part in}} the Battle of South Mountain, but then abruptly reported himself unfit for duty due to the lingering effects of his injuries at Brawner's Farm and fatigue resulting from to the long march up from Virginia. He went to Washington to rest and recuperate while his replacement, Lt. Col. Alois O. Bachman, was killed while leading a charge near the Cornfield at Antietam. As far as Brig. Gen.John Gibbon was concerned, he deserved to be stripped of his command for this. A month later, Gibbon was promoted to Maj. Gen. and given the 2nd Division, I Corps to command, then recommending either Colonel Lysander Cutler of the 6th Wisconsin or Colonel Lucius Fairchild of the 2nd Wisconsin to take over the Iron Brigade. However, Major General Joseph Hooker (who had commanded the I Corps at Antietam and was recovering from a wound sustained in that battle) was visited by Meredith <b>requesting</b> <b>promotion</b> to brigadier general. Regardless of the Antietam fiasco and Gibbon's disdain for him, he had powerful political connections in the form of Indiana Governor Oliver Morton. This was enough to convince Hooker, who submitted his request to Washington. In November, Meredith thus took the field wearing the stars of a brigadier general while John Gibbon fumed and cursed Hooker as a man who had sacrificed his principles for political gain. Meredith led the brigade in combat {{for the first time at}} Fredericksburg, where he drew the ire of division commander Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday, who temporarily replaced Meredith with Col. Lysander Cutler.|$|R
