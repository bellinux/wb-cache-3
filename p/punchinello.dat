500|$|Mona Sax is {{a mysterious}} {{professional}} assassin, {{living in a}} derelict theme park on Coney Island that she set up as her base. She is introduced in the first Max Payne game as the [...] "evil twin" [...] of her younger sister Lisa, the abused wife of the Mafia boss Angelo <b>Punchinello.</b> Mona is captured by Punchinello's assassins before she could kill him, but manages to escape. It is revealed that she was employed by Nicole Horne, the renegade member of the secret society calling themselves the Inner Circle who has left the organization and manages the Aesir Industries, a mysterious corporation that is behind the drug Valkyr. Horne ordered to murder <b>Punchinello</b> since he wanted to act independent {{and out of her}} orders, a job Mona took because it was personal to her. By {{the end of the first}} game, Mona disappears in the Aesir headquarters elevator after being shot in the head by mercenaries for refusing an order to kill Max.|$|E
500|$|Mallow accompanies Mario as {{they travel}} through the Kero Sewers to Tadpole Pond, in which they must defeat Belome, a dog-like creature, along the way. There they meet Mallow's grandfather, who reveals that Mallow isn't really a tadpole and claims that his real parents are {{waiting for him to}} return home. The duo travel to Rose Town where they meet a star spirit who has taken control of a doll named Geno. After battling the bow-like creature, Bowyer, who is immobilizing {{residents}} of Rose Town with his arrows, they retrieve another Star Piece and Geno joins Mario and tells him that the Star Piece {{is a part of the}} shattered Star Road, where he resides. A surviving Aero, who is one of Bowyer's minions, runs off to warn Smitty. Geno has been tasked with repairing Star Road and defeating Smithy, so that the world's wishes may again be heard, and he must find the seven pieces held by members of the Smithy gang. The three head to the Mole Mountains where they fight Croco again, rescue two trapped mole children, and retrieve the third Star Piece from <b>Punchinello</b> before heading to Booster Tower (the home of the eccentric amusement-venue owner, Booster) where they encounter Bowser, whose minions have all bailed out on him.|$|E

60|$|All rushed at {{once and}} beheld an opera in full blast, heartily enjoying the unusual {{advantages}} of their position; for not only could they hear the warblers, but see them when the curtain was down. What a thing it was to see Donna Anna do up her black hair, Don Giovanni dance a jig, and stately Ottavio imbibe refreshment out of a black bottle, and the ghostly Commander prance like a <b>Punchinello</b> as they got him into position.|$|E

Everything was dignified, and he felt himself like <b>Punchinello</b> in the king's chambers. Verily in the present case Glanville was not a man to stick at trifles any more than his illustrious prototype; and on the servant {{bringing}} a message that his lordship would see him at once, Louis marched boldly in.|$|E
50|$|Jack Lupino - <b>Punchinello's</b> underboss, and {{the target}} of an {{extensive}} investigation by the NYPD and the DEA in the first game, {{believed to be a}} source of Valkyr. However, he is just a minor player, and only resells the drug. He is also a constant user of the drug, which has driven him insane, and a cult leader, signing a deal with the Devil. He operates from his shady nightclub, the Ragna Rok, which is bought by Vladimir Lem soon after. He is killed by Payne in the club's inner sanctum.|$|R
5000|$|While {{searching for}} Lupino in [...] "businesses" [...] owned by him, Max busts a Valkyr drug deal and discovers that the Russian mobster Vladimir Lem {{is engaged in}} a fierce turf war against <b>Punchinello's</b> men. Max {{eventually}} finds Vinnie Gognitti, Lupino's right-hand man; he wounds and chases Gognitti through the city and finally learns the location of Lupino's hideout, a nightclub named Ragna Rock. After gunning down the insane Lupino, Payne meets Mona Sax, a contract assassin, who pours him a drink which turns out to be laced with a sedative. In this state Max is found by the Mafia and is dragged away to be tortured.|$|R
5000|$|Mundig was unraced as a two-year-old, but his {{performances}} in home exercise gallops and private trial races {{made him a}} fancy for the Derby. He {{was the subject of}} heavy betting by the Scott family and by Bowes, although a great deal of secrecy surrounded his form, making him a very [...] "dark horse". [...] In April, Scott discovered that one of his stable lads had been passing information to bookmakers. Rather than expose and dismiss the lad, Scott fed him false information, to the effect that the colt would not run at Epsom. Mundig's odds lengthened and his connections were able to back him at 50/1.Ridden by Bill Scott, the brother of his trainer, Mundig started at odds of 6/1 in a field of fourteen runners for the Derby on 3 June. Confusingly, there were two horses in the race called “Ibrahim”, one of whom, a colt owned by Lord Jersey, started 7/4 favourite. Heavy rain had made the ground soft and muddy, but did not deter the usual huge crowds who were entertained between races by “conjurors, learned donkies, posture masters, <b>Punchinellos</b> &c”. Several false starts saw the race beginning half an hour late, at a few minutes after three o’clock. Although the early pace was fast, almost all the leading contenders were still in contention as the field turned into the straight, and spread out across the width of the course. The closing stages saw four horses enter the final furlong almost level: Ascot and Lord Jersey’s Ibrahim raced along the inside rail, while Mundig and the 100/1 outsider Pelops ran up the stands side. In an extremely close finish, Mundig was declared the winner by a neck from Ascot. The race was described as “one of the closest and best contested Derbys ever run”. In addition to the winners prize of £3,550, Bowes and his associates were reported to have taken up to £20,000 in winning bets. Much credit for the win was given to Bill Scott, who rode a very strong finish, making extensive use of his whip and spurs. He had backed the colt heavily and was reported to have said {{on the eve of the}} race that he would win the Derby even if he had to “cut Mundig to pieces”. [...] According to the Court Journal, Mundig’s win was greeted with great celebrations by his Northern supporters who waved impromptu flags and left the course crying “Yorkshire for ever! Mundig for ever!” Mail coaches passing through Yorkshire blew horns and flew flags in John Bowes black racing colour to mark Mundig’s victory, leading one vicar to believe that the King must have died.|$|R
60|$|THE COUNT. [smiling as he recovers {{from his}} alarm] I understand. She {{has taken the}} costumes into her own hands. She {{is an expert in}} {{beautiful}} costumes. I venture to promise you, Mr Savoyard, that what you are about to see will be like a Louis Quatorze ballet painted by Watteau. The heroine will be an exquisite Columbine, her lover a dainty Harlequin, her father a picturesque Pantaloon, and the valet who hoodwinks the father and brings about the happiness of the lovers a grotesque but perfectly tasteful <b>Punchinello</b> or Mascarille or Sganarelle.|$|E
60|$|Musing, therefore, {{upon the}} purely <b>Punchinello</b> {{aspect of the}} human figure thus beheld, it had {{indirectly}} occurred to Bannadonna to devise some metallic agent, which should strike the hour with its mechanic hand, with even greater precision than the vital one. And, moreover, as the vital watchman on the roof, sallying from his retreat at the given periods, walked to the bell with uplifted mace, to smite it, Bannadonna had resolved that his invention should likewise possess the power of locomotion, and, along with that, the appearance, at least, of intelligence and will.|$|E
60|$|Both {{bench and}} {{audience}} seemed considerably {{surprised at the}} juvenile appearance {{of the young man}} who appeared in the room of Dumtoustie, for the purpose of opening this complicated and long depending process, and the common herd were disappointed at the absence of Peter the client, the <b>Punchinello</b> of the expected entertainment. The judges looked with a very favourable countenance on our friend Alan, most of them being acquainted, more or less, with so old a practitioner as his father, and all, or almost all, affording, from civility, the same fair play to the first pleading of a counsel, which the House of Commons yields to the maiden speech of one of its members.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Twas in {{a tavern}} that with old age stooped And leaned rheumatic rafters o'er his head-- A blowzed, prodigious man, which talked, and stared, And rolled, {{as if with}} purpose, a small eye Like a sweet Cupid in a cask of wine. I could not view his fatness for his soul, Which peeped like {{harmless}} lightnings and was gone; As haps to voyagers of the summer air. And when he laughed, Time trickled down those beams, As in a glass; and when in self-defence He puffed that paunch, and wagged that huge, Greek head, Nosed like a <b>Punchinello,</b> then it seemed An hundred widows swept in his small voice, Now tenor, and now bass of drummy war. He smiled, compact of loam, this orchard man; Mused like a midnight, webbed with moonbeam snares Of flitting Love; woke--and a King he stood, Whom all the world hath in sheer jest refused For helpless laughter's sake. And then, forfend! Bacchus and Jove reared vast Olympus there; And Pan leaned leering from Promethean eyes. [...] "Lord!" [...] sighed his aspect, weeping o'er the jest, [...] "What simple mouse brought such a mountain forth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} {{familiar}} human combinations {{in the world is}} that of unemployed daughter and widowed mother. A thousand times you have seen the jobless daughter devoting all of her curiosity, all of her youth, to a widowed mother of small pleasantries, a small income, and a shabby security. Thirty comes, and thirty-five. The daughter ages steadily. At forty she is as old as her unwithering mother. Sweet she is, and pathetically hopeful of being a pianist or a nurse; never quite reconciled to spinsterhood, though she often laughs about it; often, by her insistence that she is an [...] "old maid," [...] she makes the thought of her barren age embarrassing to others. The mother is sweet, too, and [...] "wants {{to keep in touch with}} her daughter's interests," [...] only, her daughter has no interests. Had the daughter revolted at eighteen, had she stubbornly insisted that mother either accompany her to parties or be content to stay alone, had she acquired [...] "interests," [...] she might have meant something in the new generation; but the time for revolt passes, however much the daughter may long to seem young among younger women. The mother is usually unconscious of her selfishness; she would be unspeakably horrified if some brutal soul told her that she was a vampire. Chance, chance and waste, rule them both, and the world passes by while the mother has her games of cards with daughter, and deems herself unselfish because now and then she lets daughter join a party (only to hasten back to mother), and even [...] "wonders why daughter doesn't take an interest in girls her own age." [...] That ugly couple on the porch of the apple-sauce and wash-pitcher boarding-house--the mother a mute, dwarfish <b>punchinello,</b> and the daughter a drab woman of forty with a mole, a wart, a silence. That charming mother of white hair and real lace with the well-groomed daughter. That comfortable mother at home and daughter in an office, but with no suitors, no ambition beyond the one at home. They are all examples of the mother-and-daughter phenomenon, that most touching, most destructive example of selfless unselfishness, which robs all the generations to come, because mother has never been trained to endure the long, long thoughts of solitude; because she sees nothing by herself, and within herself hears no diverting voice....|$|E

5000|$|Jimmy Tock {{writes the}} book, a loose {{autobiography}} of personal experience, reminisces, and second- or even third-hand accounts of events, transcribing {{it from a}} series of tapes {{on the eve of his}} fifth and final terrible day. The narrative is given in an often self-deprecating, comically understated manner. However, certain experiences stand out starkly, most noticeably blundering into a harrowing, yet almost surreal, bank robbery by a trio of plastique-wielding crazed history buff clowns led by none other than <b>Punchinello</b> Beezo—in which Jimmy gradually realizes he's falling for a comely fellow hostage and a dangerous game of chicken with a severely disturbed stalker on an icy road the night his wife Lorrie, the former fellow hostage is about to deliver their first child (on the second predicted date). The man after the Tocks is none other than Konrad Beezo himself, looking for retribution for his imprisoned, and accidentally-gelded son. His mad obsession with the family frames both this terrible day and the next predicted day for Beezo desires a male Tock child as his prize, a new son to raise in the fine clown tradition. The lunatic will do whatever he must to collect what he believes due him, including numerous facial reconstructive surgeries to assume new identities and escape the grasp of the law. Jimmy believes that everyone in the world is tenebrously yet inexorably connected to one another, just as his toes were at birth. This phenomenon is often called [...] "Six degrees of separation". <b>Punchinello,</b> who is currently imprisoned, is asked by Jimmy and Lorrie, who aided in his conviction and sentencing, to donate one of his kidneys to help save the life of Annie Tock, the daughter of Jimmy and Lorrie. <b>Punchinello</b> only agrees to the donation in return for multiple favors that are frivolous by comparison to the precious kidney.
