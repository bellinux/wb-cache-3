5|$|In 1695 the French command {{found that}} the {{inhabitants}} of the areas occupied by the French army were reluctant to pay war contributions and started to oppose an organized and growingly successful resistance.

French troops were also harassed by Catalan militia forces, the miquelets, who laid ambushes to Noailles' forces from woods and heights. One of the most effective leaders of the miquelets was Captain Ramon de Sala i Saçala, the veguer of Vic, who achieved two victories over the French during the winter: on late December he overran a convoy on way to Hostalric, killing 25 French soldiers and taking 25 <b>prisoners,</b> <b>and</b> on 24 February he defeated a company of French dragoons at Navata, killing 7 of them and taking 28 <b>prisoners</b> <b>and</b> 32 horses.|$|E
