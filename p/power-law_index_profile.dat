40|$|An {{immersed}} boundary-lattice Boltzmann {{method is}} developed for fluid-structure interactions involving non-Newtonian fluids (e. g., power-law fluid). In this method, the flexible structure (e. g., capsule) dynamics and the fluid dynamics are coupled {{by using the}} immersed boundary method. The incompressible viscous power-law fluid motion is obtained by solving the lattice Boltzmann equation. The non-Newtonian rheology is achieved by using a shear rate-dependant relaxation time in the lattice Boltzmann method. The non-Newtonian flow solver is then validated by considering a power-law flow in a straight channel {{which is one of}} the benchmark problems to validate an in-house solver. The numerical results present a good agreement with the analytical solutions for various values of <b>power-law</b> <b>index.</b> Finally, we apply this method to study the deformation of a capsule in a power-law shear flow by varying the Reynolds number from 0. 025 to 0. 1, dimensionless shear rate from 0. 004 to 0. 1, and <b>power-law</b> <b>index</b> from 0. 2 to 1. 8. It is found that the deformation of the capsule increases with the <b>power-law</b> <b>index</b> for different Reynolds numbers and nondimensional shear rates.

We aim to constrain in detail the spectral properties of GRB prompt emission on a time-resolved basis and to discuss the theoretical implications of the fitting results in the context of various prompt emission models. We perform time-resolved spectral analysis using a variable temporal binning technique according to optimal S/N criteria, resulting in a total of 299 time-resolved spectra. We fit the Band function to all spectra and obtain the distributions for the low-energy <b>power-law</b> <b>index</b> α, the high-energy <b>power-law</b> <b>index</b> β, the peak energy in the observed ν F_ν spectrum E_p, and the difference between the low- and high-energy <b>power-law</b> <b>indices</b> Δ s=α-β. Using the distributions of Δ s and β, the electron population index p is found to be consistent with the "moderately fast" scenario which fast- and slow-cooling scenarios cannot be distinguished. We also apply a physically motivated synchrotron model, which is a triple power-law with constrained <b>power-law</b> <b>indices</b> and a blackbody component, to test for consistency with a synchrotron origin for the prompt emission and obtain the distributions for the two break energies E_b, 1 and E_b, 2, the middle segment <b>power-law</b> <b>index</b> β, and the Planck function temperature kT. A synchrotron model is found consistent with the majority of time-resolved spectra for these eight energetic Fermi GBM bursts with good high-energy photon statistics, as long as both the cooling and injection break are included and the leftmost spectral slope is lifted either by inclusion of a thermal component or when an evolving magnetic field is accounted for.

40|$|We have {{performed}} power spectral analysis of surface temperatures, velocities, and magnetic fields, using spectro-polarimetric data {{taken with the}} Hinode Solar Optical Telescope. When we make power spectra in a field-of-view covering the super-granular scale, kinetic and thermal power spectra have a prominent peak at the granular scale while the magnetic power spectra have a broadly distributed power over various spatial scales with weak peaks at both the granular and supergranular scales. To study the power spectra separately in internetwork and network regions, power spectra are derived in small sub-regions extracted from the field-of-view. We examine slopes of the power spectra using <b>power-law</b> <b>indices,</b> and compare them with the unsigned magnetic flux density averaged in the sub-regions. The thermal and kinetic spectra are steeper than the magnetic ones at the sub-granular scale in the internetwork regions, and the <b>power-law</b> <b>indices</b> differ by about 2. The <b>power-law</b> <b>indices</b> of the magnetic power spectra are close to or smaller than - 1 at that scale, which suggests the total magnetic energy mainly comes from either the granular scale magnetic structures or both the granular scale and smaller ones contributing evenly.

40|$|In this paper, natural {{convection}} and entropy generation of non-Newtonian nanofluid, using the Buongiorno's mathematical model in a cavity {{in the presence}} of a uniform magnetic field has been analyzed by Finite Difference Lattice Boltzmann method (FDLBM). The cavity is filled with nanofluid which the mixture shows shear-thinning behavior. This study has been performed for the certain pertinent parameters of Rayleigh number (Ra = 10 (4) and 10 (5)), Hartmann number (Ha = 0, 15, 30), buoyancy ratio number (N-r = 0. 1, 1, and 4), <b>power-law</b> <b>index</b> (n = 0. 4 - 1), Lewis number (Le = 1, 5, and 10), Thermophoresis parameter (N-t = 0. 1, 0. 5, 1), and Brownian motion parameter (N-b = 0. 1, 1, 5). The Prandtl number is fixed at Pr = 1. The Results indicate that the augmentation of Hartmann number causes heat and mass transfer to drop. The increase in Rayleigh number enhances heat and mass transfer for various <b>power-law</b> <b>indexes.</b> The alteration of the <b>power-law</b> <b>index</b> changes heat and mass transfer. In addition, the rise of Hartmann number declines the shear-thinning behavior. The increase in the Lewis number augments mass transfer while it causes heat transfer to drop. The rise of the Thermophoresis and Brownian motion parameters ameliorate mass transfer and declines heat transfer significantly. The augmentation of buoyancy ratio number enhances heat and mass transfer. The augmentation of the <b>power-law</b> <b>index</b> declines various entropy generations in different Rayleigh numbers and Hartmann numbers. The increase in Hartmann number declines total entropy generation in different Rayleigh numbers. In addition, the rise of Rayleigh number and Hartmann number causes Bejan number to drop in various <b>power-law</b> <b>indexes.</b> The enhancement of the Lewis number provokes the total irreversibility to rise. Further, the total entropy generation increases as the buoyancy ratio number augments. It was shown that the increase in the Brownian motion and Thermophoresis parameters enhance the total irreversibility.

40|$|We {{present a}} test of the {{emission}} statistics of active galactic nuclei (AGN), probing the connection between red-noise temporal power spectra and multi-modal flux distributions known from observations. We simulate AGN lightcurves under the assumption of uniform stochastic emission processes for different <b>power-law</b> <b>indices</b> of their power spectra. For sufficiently shallow slopes (<b>power-law</b> <b>indices</b> beta 1), the flux distributions become multi-modal.
