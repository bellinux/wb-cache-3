2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Suppression</b> <b>Pools</b> ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment.

Importance of individual containment failure mechanisms depends on plant features and in some cases on modeling assumptions; however the following mechanisms were found important: drywell shell melt-through caused by direct contact with core debris and drywell failure caused by rapid pressure/temperature pulses at time of vessel melt-through. Drywell failure caused by gradual pressure/temperature buildup due to gases and steam released during core/concrete interactions is important in some IPEs. In other IPEs vent was an important contributor. However, accidents that bypass containment (eg interfacing systems LOCA) or involve containment isolation failure were not important contributors to the CDF in any of the IPEs for Mark I plants. These accidents are also not important to risk (even though they can involve large fission product release) because their frequencies of occurrence are so much lower than frequencies of early structural failure caused by other accidents that dominate the CDF...|$|R

40|$|Steam venting and {{condensation}} in a {{large pool}} of water can lead to either thermal stratification or thermal mixing. In a <b>pressure</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>pool</b> (PSP) of a boiling water reactor (BWR), consistent thermal mixing maximizes {{the capacity of the}} pool while the development of thermal stratification can reduce the steam condensation capacity of the pool which in turn can lead to pressure increase in the containment and thereafter the consequences can be severe.

The time- and space-dependent gas distribution in the system is calculated using the verified three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics code GASFLOW. A new extended version of GASFLOW has been developed to model the ITER-FEAT specific phenomena in adequate detail. During the accident sequence, hydrogen initially appears only in the vacuum vessel due to the steam/beryllium reaction. After failure of the burst membranes, steam and hydrogen flow from the vacuum vessel through the connecting lines to the suppression pool and the drain tank. Because of the ongoing steam condensation occurring in the suppression pool, the pressure there remains permanently at a lower level {{compared to the other}} components, resulting in a continuous flow of steam and noncondensable gases into this volume. Since no steam condensation is modeled in the drain tank, almost all H_ 2 and N_ 2 accumulate in the suppression pool cover gas volume. After 10, 500 s of steam flow, also air starts entering the vacuum vessel, with the basic mechanisms remaining the same. Consequently, an accumulation of N_ 2 and O_ 2 takes place in the suppression pool cover gas. Combustible and explosive H_ 2 -O_ 2 -N_ 2 mixtures exist after 13, 600 s, and at 21, 000 s a stoichiometric H_ 2 /O_ 2 ratio has formed, involving 14 kg of hydrogen. Contrary to the situation in the suppression pool with its significant hydrogen risk, only inert, steam dominated mixtures without hazard potential develop in the vacuum vessel and the drain tank. Various passive mitigation measures could be considered to reduce or completely remove the hydrogen risk in the suppression pool. (orig.)

40|$|Steam venting and {{condensation}} in a {{large pool}} of water creates both a source of heat {{and a source of}} momentum. Complex interplay between these two sources leads to either thermal stratification or mixing. If heat source dominates, development of thermal stratification in a <b>Pressure</b> <b>Suppression</b> <b>Pool</b> (PSP) of a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) increases temperature of the free surface which reduces the steam condensation capacity of the pool and can lead to significant pressure increase in the containment. If mixing is dominant {{it is important to know}} how fast a stratified pool can be mixed to restore the steam condensation capacity and reduce containment pressure. Advanced modeling and simulation of direct contact condensation in large systems remains a challenge as evident in commercial and research codes mainly due to long transients and small time-steps to resolve direct contact condensation on the free surface of steam-water interface. In this work, effective models, namely, the Effective Heat Source (EHS) and Effective Momentum Source (EMS) models are proposed to model and simulate thermal stratification and mixing during a steam injection into a large pool of water. The EHS/EMS models are developed for steam injection through a vertical pipe submerged in a pool under two condensation regimes: complete condensation inside the pipe and chugging. These models are (i) computationally efficient, since small scale phenomena of steam injection and direct contact condensation are not resolved explicitly, and (ii) sufficiently accurate, since the integral effect of these phenomena on the large scale flow structure and temperature distribution in the pool is taken into account. These effective models are implemented in GOTHIC® software and validated against POOLEX and PPOOLEX tests. Excellent agreement in averaged pool temperature and water level in the pool between the experiment and simulation has been achieved. The development of thermal stratification and mixing of the pool are also well captured in the simulation.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityIn any conceptual reactor design under postulated accidental conditions, one parameter that is considered as being highly ranked in determining the thermal-hydraulic conditions of the reactor safety components is the system pressure. To obtain a satisfactory prediction of steam partial pressure, within reasonable uncertainty in the gas space of a confined SP (suppression pool) bounded to the steam source of the break flow, one must establish {{a means by which}} local phenomena associated with steam direct contact condensation in the subcooled water pool can be fully addressed to predict the global component thermal response. For this purpose a scaled down, reduced <b>pressure,</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>pool</b> was designed and built to study condensation and mixing phenomena. The scaled test facility represented an idealized trapezoidal cross section, 1 / 10 sector of the SP with scaled height ratio of 1 / 4. 5 and volume ratio of 1 / 400. The design and test conditions were based on a hierarchical scaling principle that preserves the transfer of mass, momentum, energy and condensation phenomena. Distributed thermocouples within the pool provided a means to quantify the pool thermal response. The test loop was not only instrumented with thermocouples for monitoring pool stratification but also with high speed photography for flow visualization from which to build a comprehensive database to identify the regions of the pool that were thermally stratified or mixed. Data were obtained for different pool initial subcooling and steam/air mixture flow rates. Dimensionless boundary maps were plotted from several experimental runs of pure steam injection to determine conditions when the pool transits from being homogeneously mixed to being thermally stratified. Steam-air mixture injection cases for single horizontal venting indicated that above a pool temperature of 40 ºC with air mass flow rates below 0. 1 g/s the pool can attain thermal stratification. Models of a single phase liquid-into-liquid buoyant jet and a two-phase vapor-into-liquid turbulent jet plume injected in horizontal orientation were developed from the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations in the cylindrical system for steady axisymmetric flow and incorporated the integral plume theory.

The phenomena due to such a high direct contact condensation (DCC) rate turn out to be very challenging to be analysed either with experiments or numerical simulations. In this thesis, the suppression pool experiments carried out in the POOLEX facility of Lappeenranta University of Technology were simulated. Two different condensation modes were modelled by using the 2 -phase CFD codes NEPTUNE CFD and TransAT. The DCC models applied were the typical ones to be used for separated flows in channels, and their applicability to the rapidly condensing flow in the condensation pool context had not been tested earlier. A low Reynolds number case was the first to be simulated. The POOLEX experiment STB- 31 was operated near the conditions between the ’quasi-steady oscillatory interface condensation’ mode and the ’condensation within the blowdown pipe’ mode. The condensation models of Lakehal et al. and Coste & Lavi´eville predicted the {{condensation rate}} quite accurately, while the other tested ones overestimated it. It was possible to get the direct phase change solution to settle near to the measured values, but a very high resolution of calculation grid was needed. Secondly, a high Reynolds number case corresponding to the ’chugging’ mode was simulated. The POOLEX experiment STB- 28 was chosen, because various standard and highspeed video samples of bubbles were recorded during it. In order to extract numerical information from the video material, a pattern recognition procedure was programmed. The bubble size distributions and the frequencies of chugging were calculated with this procedure. With the statistical data of the bubble sizes and temporal data of the bubble/jet appearance, it was possible to compare the condensation rates between the experiment and the CFD simulations. In the chugging simulations, a spherically curvilinear calculation grid at the blowdown pipe exit improved the convergence and decreased the required cell count. The compressible flow solver with complete steam-tables was beneficial for the numerical success of the simulations. The Hughes-Duffey model and, to some extent, the Coste & Lavi´eville model produced realistic chugging behavior. The initial level of the steam/water interface was an important factor to determine the initiation of the chugging. If the interface was initialized with a water level high enough inside the blowdown pipe, the vigorous penetration of a water plug into the pool created a turbulent wake which invoked the chugging that was self-sustaining. A 3 D simulation with a suitable DCC model produced qualitatively very realistic shapes of the chugging bubbles and jets. The comparative FFT analysis of the bubble size data and the pool bottom pressure data gave useful information to distinguish the eigenmodes of chugging, bubbling, and pool structure oscillations...|$|E

This thesis presents the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of steam condensation phenomena appearing in a <b>pressure</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>pool</b> (PSP) of a boiling water reactor (BWR) and in a low-pressure (LP) steam turbine. The PSP {{is one of the}} key systems which provide a large pressure and heat sink by condensing steam into a denser volume of water. In this thesis, two direct contact condensation (DCC) modes appearing during steam blowdown in BWR PSP are investigated. 2 D and 3 D simulations of a PSP test facility were conducted by using the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid approach. For this purpose, two CFD codes, OpenFOAM and NEPTUNE CFD were used. The interfacial heat transfer between steam and water was modelled by using different DCC models. The open pool test facility (POOLEX) and the pressurizing drywell-wetwell suppression pool facility (PPOOLEX) tests of Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) were used as references. Various issues namely performance of DCC models, significance of reference bubble diameter, and sensitivity of subcooling rate on DCC phenomena were studied. The results confirmed that the surface divergence model by Lakehal et al. (2008) predicts the mildly sheared interfacial DCC case well. The incompressible solver was not able to predict rapid pressure variation in chugging simulations. The compressible two-phase solver of OpenFOAM was stable enough and able to invoke the chugging phenomenon of POOLEX steam blowdown tests. The surface renewal model of by Hughes and Duffey (1991) and the DCC model of Coste (2004) achieved good predictions of the chugging simulations of the POOLEX test. The influence of grid refinement on the DCC phenomena was assessed employing a grid convergence index for POOLEX simulations. Results indicate that an adequate grid density is essential to resolve the flow details and to acquire the correct rates of DCC. In the PPOOLEX chugging simulations, different issues namely the performance of different DCC models, the influence of turbulence modeling, interfacial momentum transfer, geometry and interface initialization were briefly analyzed. The significance of interfacial area modelling on the chugging DCC was examined by employing the Rayleigh-Taylor Interfacial area model by Pellegrini et al. (2015). The results showed that interfacial area modeling and turbulence modelling were the dominant factors for the chugging DCC modelling in the PPOOLEX simulations. Steam turbines are vital for power generation, and therefore, the studies aiming to the efficiency improvement of steam turbines are crucial for efficient power plants. As the exhaust pressure of steam turbines is designed to be low to achieve the maximum energy output, the steam temperature drops due to rapid expansion in the last stages of the LP steam turbine. Steam condenses and, as a result, additional losses appear. The presence of moisture in the LP turbine decreases the overall efficiency. This thesis was partially aimed to study the non-equilibrium condensing steam flow in LP turbine by using the ANSYS CFD codes. In all simulations, the mixture of vapour and liquid phases was solved by employing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations based on the Eulerian- Eulerian approach. The classical nucleation theory was adopted to model nucleation process. Droplet growth models were used to calculate the droplet growth rate. Throughout this work, condensing steam flows were modelled with various computational domains including convergent-divergent nozzles, a stationary cascade of turbine and 3 D statorrotor stage. The influence of local geometrical details of steam turbine blades including blade trailing edge shapes, dimple inclusion and blade surface tapering on the flow expansion, condensation phenomena and corresponding loss generation was studied. The study demonstrated that the shape and size of the blades have a significant impact on the entire condensing flow field and the loss generation in the LP turbine. The results revealed that the elliptic trailing edge shape resulted in minimum losses. After including dimple profiles, the Wilson point was altered and the location of condensation disturbance was changed. Overall 8 % reduction was noted in total loss with 100 μm dimple profile compared to the base profile without dimple. The influence of turbulence modelling studies revealed that the accurate turbulence modelling is required for precise condensing steam flow prediction.

The differential pressure across the operating deck for a spectrum of loss-of-coolant accidents including break size and location (Mark II containments only). 3. <b>Suppression</b> <b>pool</b> dynamic effects during a loss-of-coolant accident or following the actuation {{of one or more}} reactor coolant system safety/relief valves, including vent clearing, vent interactions, pool swell, pool strati-fication, and dynamic symmetrical and asymmetrical loads on <b>suppression</b> <b>pool</b> and other containment structures. 4. The consequences of a loss-of-coolant accident occurring within the containment (wetwell); i. e., outside the drywell (Mark III containments only) 5. The capability of the containment to withstand the effects of steam bypassing the <b>suppression</b> <b>pool.</b> 6. The external pressure capability of the drywell and wetwell, and systems that may be provided to limit external pressures...|$|R
2500|$|The RHR {{systems were}} first {{activated}} {{to cool down}} the <b>suppression</b> <b>pools</b> (torus) and drywells to operable status, and water injections {{were made to the}} reactors using the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) mode as needed.|$|R
2500|$|The MUWC and {{the makeup}} water {{purification}} and filtering (MUPF) systems {{were also used}} to try to cool the <b>suppression</b> <b>pool</b> and drywell in addition to the reactor to prevent the drywell pressure from getting too high.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD thesis is to study the Direct Contact Condensation (DCC) of steam in water at very small pressures near vacuum. These conditions are realized in safety systems of nuclear fusion reactors, in particular in the Vacuum Vessel <b>Pressure</b> <b>Suppression</b> System (VVPSS) of ITER. The Vacuum Vessel <b>Pressure</b> <b>Suppression</b> System (VVPSS) is a key system of the ITER plant. It is {{designed to protect the}} Vacuum Vessel (VV) and the related components from over pressure conditions {{in the case of an}} Ingress of Coolant Event (ICE). This event could occur during the normal operating conditions as well as during accidental conditions. The ITER <b>Pressure</b> <b>Suppression</b> System has thermal-hydraulic operating conditions which are not the standard conditions of fission nuclear power systems, whose <b>pressure</b> <b>suppression</b> systems are characterized by steam condensed at pressures near the atmospheric pressure and using sub-cooled water. For this reason, this research is original in the nuclear field. In other words, the direct contact condensation in the thermal-hydraulic conditions of ITER has not been ever studied in detail. The PhD research has investigated experimentally the steam direct contact condensation at the ITER prototypical conditions...|$|R
