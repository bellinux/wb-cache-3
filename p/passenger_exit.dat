50|$|To further {{expedite}} boarding in the tunnel, both {{buses and}} trackless trolleys allow free entry for certain routes, not collecting fares until later <b>passenger</b> <b>exit</b> from the vehicle. For security reasons, often during weekends or other low-volume periods, the lower bus tunnel {{is shut down}} and passengers must board using the upper bus tunnel, or outside the station proper. In addition, certain bus routes are not normally routed through the Harvard Bus Tunnel at any time.|$|E
50|$|Civil air {{regulation}} amendments became {{effective on}} August 6, 1964, that required that doors separating the passenger cabin from the crew compartment on all scheduled air carrier and commercial aircraft {{must be kept}} locked in flight. An {{exception to the rule}} remains during takeoff and landing on certain aircraft, such as the Fairchild F-27, where the cockpit door leads to an emergency <b>passenger</b> <b>exit.</b> The amendments were passed by the Federal Aviation Administration prior to the crash of Flight 773, but had not yet become effective. Julie Clark, one of three daughters of the murdered captain, orphaned at the age of 15 by her father's death, grew up to become a commercial airline pilot for Northwest Airlines, and performs aerobatic displays at airshows.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} hours of 28 March 2016, Leung Chung-yan, the {{daughter}} of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, became embroiled in a controversy at Hong Kong International Airport. Leung Chung-yan had reportedly left her hand baggage in the departure hall after she had passed through the security checkpoint to board a flight for San Francisco. According to Apple Daily, witnesses alleged that his wife Regina Tong, who accompanied her daughter to the airport, engaged in a lengthy argument with airport staff to have staff reunite her daughter with her missing bag. Staff insisted on upholding procedure, which required that the <b>passenger</b> <b>exit</b> the secured zone to recover the missing item and pass through security again. Leung Chung-yan reportedly telephoned her father to seek help in resolving the impasse. The phone was given to airline staff, who brought Leung her bag, making clear that they had made an exception to procedure. Leung boarded her flight minutes later. Leung Chun-ying denied that he had abused his power by ordering airline staff to retrieve Chung-yan's bag in violation of security guidelines. Following the news of the incident, the Airport Authority Hong Kong issued a statement stating that it was not against existing procedure for someone other than the passenger to retrieve any missing baggage from airport security and bring it into the restricted area after a security check.|$|E

5000|$|When {{it first}} opened, {{ridership}} was 50% below the projected 6,500 <b>passenger</b> <b>exits</b> per day. [...] During its {{first decade of}} service, ridership remained well below initial projections, but has nearly doubled between 2003 and 2015.|$|R
50|$|In 1911, the {{railroad}} raised its tracks to eliminate grade crossings. The station was awkwardly modified, with <b>passengers</b> <b>exiting</b> {{the second story}} onto an elevated platform. In 1930, service moved to the larger Union Station and the station was abandoned.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} work undertaken for the European Commission funded study GMA 2 / 2000 / 32039 Very Large Transport Aircraft (VLTA) Emergency Requirements Research Evacuation Study (VERRES). A particular focus of VERRES was on evacuation issues and several large-scale evacuation trials {{were conducted in}} the CRANFIELD simulator. This paper addresses part of the research undertaken for Work Package 3 by the University of Greenwich {{with a focus on}} the analysis of the data concerning passenger use of stairs and <b>passenger</b> <b>exit</b> hesitation time analysis for upper deck slides...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{was developed to}} assess passenger survival during the post-crash evacuation of a transport category aircraft when fire is a major threat. The computer code, FIREVAC, computes individual <b>passenger</b> <b>exit</b> paths and times to exit, taking into account delays and congestion caused by the interaction among the passengers and changing cabin conditions. Simple models for the physiological effects of the toxic cabin atmosphere are included with provision for including more sophisticated models as they become available. Both wide-body and standard-body aircraft may be simulated. Passenger characteristics are assigned stochastically from experimentally derived distributions. Results of simulations of evacuation trials and hypothetical evacuations under fire conditions are presented...|$|E
40|$|The exits which {{passengers}} select in evacuation {{situations and}} the exits {{which are available}} post-crash is {{of great interest to}} aviation safety regulators who make rulings defining exit separation and aircraft evacuation certification, aircraft designers who develop the interior layout of aircraft cabins and position exits within the fuselage, cabin safety specialists who develop procedures for managing aircraft evacuation and cabin crew who must control aircraft evacuations. In this paper we examine issues associated with <b>passenger</b> <b>exit</b> selection behaviour and exit configurations frequently experienced during survivable crashes. This work makes use of the latest version of the Aircraft Accident Statistics and Knowledge database AASK V 4. 0, which contains information from 105 survivable crashes and over 2, 000 survivors...|$|E

50|$|Huddersfield {{station is}} the most used station managed by TransPennine Express with 4.9 million <b>passengers</b> <b>exiting</b> and {{entering}} the station between 2014/15 beating Manchester Airport by over a {{million in the same}} year. It is also the second most busiest station in West Yorkshire with Leeds being the first.|$|R
40|$|Computer based {{mathematical}} models {{describing the}} aircraft evacuation process have {{a vital role}} to play in aviation safety. However such models have a heavy dependency on real evacuation data in order to (a) identify the key processes and factors associated with evacuation, (b) quantify variables and parameters associated with the identified factors/processes and finally (c) validate the models. The Fire Safety Engineering Group of the University of Greenwich is undertaking a large data extraction exercise from three major data sources in order to address these issues. This paper describes the extraction and application of data from one of these sources - aviation accident reports. To aid in the storage and analysis of the raw data, a computer database known as AASK (aircraft accident statistics and knowledge) is under development. AASK is being developed to store human observational and anecdotal data contained in accident reports and interview transcripts. AASK comprises four component sub-databases. These consist of the ACCIDENT (crash details), FLIGHT ATTENDANT (observations and actions of the flight attendants), FATALS (details concerning passenger fatalities) and PAX (observations and accounts from individual passengers) databases. AASK currently contains information from 25 survivable aviation accidents covering the period 4 April 1977 to 6 August 1995, involving some 2415 passengers, 2210 survivors, 205 fatalities and accounts from 669 people. In addition to aiding the development of aircraft evacuation models, AASK is also being used to challenge some of the myths which proliferate in the aviation safety industry such as, <b>passenger</b> <b>exit</b> selection during evacuation, nature and frequency of seat jumping, speed of passenger response and group dynamics. AASK {{can also be used to}} aid in the development of a more comprehensive approach to conducting post accident interviews, and will eventually be used to store the data directly...|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} an {{underground}} connection between the paid areas of the East West Line and the North East Line parts of the station, there is no connection between their unpaid areas. Therefore, a <b>passenger</b> <b>exiting</b> from an East-West Line train going to a North East Line exit should use the paid area connection {{to go to the}} North East Line concourse and exit the fare gates there. Alternatively, the <b>passenger</b> can <b>exit</b> from the East West Line exit and walk to his desired destination, crossing the traffic junction where necessary.|$|R
50|$|The station {{currently}} has three foot-over-bridges (FOBs). However the southern-most FOB serves <b>passengers</b> <b>exiting</b> the {{station on the}} western side only. The middle FOB is connected {{on the western side}} to a skywalk that leads to Swami Vivekanand Road. On either side of the station BEST has a bus station.|$|R
50|$|On May 31, 1996, a park {{employee}} was hit {{and killed}} instantly {{while attempting to}} cross the tracks in the boarding station as a train was returning. The investigation determined she slipped and fell into a 4 ft pit below, crossing from the side where <b>passengers</b> <b>exit</b> over to the opposite side.|$|R
50|$|As Train T195 derailed, {{it turned}} 90 degrees on its side. As {{most people were}} asleep {{during the time of}} the derailment, some only became aware after the {{incident}} had occurred. As <b>passengers</b> <b>exited,</b> many around the area were making frantic calls on their mobile telephones, temporarily causing the malfunction of the local telephone network.|$|R
5000|$|The 2008 energy {{shortages}} stimulated {{renewed interest}} in Green vehicle proposals such as SkyTran. The [...] "Maglev SkyTran" [...] topic quoted a number of SkyTran and Personal Rapid Transit ideas, such as <b>passengers</b> <b>exiting</b> and boarding at off-line elevated [...] "portal" [...] stops while high-speed traffic continues to speed by on its main line.|$|R
50|$|Upon disembarkation, the <b>{{passengers}}</b> <b>exit</b> {{the plane}} via the air-bridge and then proceed {{downstairs to the}} baggage carousel. For those passengers arriving on an international flight, immigration and customs are located adjacent to the baggage carousel. The exit of the airport {{is also on the}} ground floor. Counters for car rental companies are also located here.|$|R

50|$|In {{the area}} of the station there are no {{services}} apart from ticket machines. The railway line, which runs approximately east-west, has a pedestrian tunnel under it, but the connection to the platform is provided by a separate tunnel, which, however, connects only towards the centre of the town, which is to the north, so rail <b>passengers</b> <b>exiting</b> to the south must cross the tracks and climb steps twice.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has also}} been {{used to refer to}} {{interactions}} with citizens during police stops and immigration enforcement. Arizona's controversial SB 1070 law requiring people to carry identification was dubbed the [...] "Papers, Please" [...] law. The phrase {{has also been}} used by the press in relation to a February 2017 incident in which U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents searching for a suspect demanded identification from <b>passengers</b> <b>exiting</b> a domestic flight.|$|R
50|$|All APS take {{advantage}} of a common concept to decrease the area of parking spaces - removing the driver and passengers from the car before it is parked. With either fully automated or semi-automated APS, the car is driven up to an entry point to the APS and the driver and <b>passengers</b> <b>exit</b> the car. The car is then moved automatically or semi-automatically (with some attendant action required) to its parking space.|$|R
50|$|There were {{no serious}} {{injuries}} among the 61 passengers {{or the people}} on the ground. A minor fire in the nose area was extinguished by racers and course workers armed with fire extinguishers. As the aircraft's nose had collapsed onto the ground, its tail was elevated and there were some minor injuries when <b>passengers</b> <b>exited</b> the aircraft via the rear slides, which were not long enough to sufficiently accommodate the increased height.|$|R
