30|$|We {{may also}} compare {{the total number}} of <b>propagations</b> {{necessary}} to obtain the optimized pulse, included in Table  2 together with measures of success: concurrence error, loss of population from the logical subspace, and gate error. Each iteration using Krotov’s method requires two <b>propagations.</b> For the hybrid optimization schemes (‘pre-opt s.m.’, ‘pre-opt hol.’), the number of <b>propagations</b> includes simplex as well as the additional <b>propagations</b> due to Krotov’s method. The gate error is measured with respect to the exact target gate when using the square-modulus functional, and with respect to the closest geometric phase gate to the optimized dynamics in all other cases. In terms of numerical efficiency, the hybrid schemes outperform the direct optimization by nearly two orders of magnitude while resulting in a significantly better gate fidelity.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOceanic Kelvin {{waves from}} the equator to the West African coast are {{investigated}} {{in the framework}} of tropical Atlantic intraseasonal variability. In order to better highlight the wave <b>propagations,</b> a 25 - 95 day band-pass filter was applied to the sea surface height (SSH) product derived from the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter and an ocean general circulation model simulation for the 1993 - 2000 period. In addition to equatorial eastward <b>propagations,</b> our analysis reveals recurrent and continuous <b>propagations</b> distinguishable over thousands of kilometers poleward along the coasts as far as about 10 °- 15 ° latitude, a novel result with altimeter data. The variance of the filtered SSH signal goes from 1 cm at the equator to 2 cm at the African coast. Estimates of the phase speed range from 1. 5 to 2. 1 m/s along the equator and the West African coastline. Such values are very close to those of equatorial Kelvin wave <b>propagations,</b> likely dominated by the first two baroclinic modes, supporting the fact that the coastal <b>propagations</b> are coastally trapped Kelvin waves. In order to simplify the description of these Kelvin waves, we present an intraseasonal climatology which reveals regular boreal autumn-winter equator to coast <b>propagations.</b> An improved description is achieved thanks to the computation of an extended empirical orthogonal function for the boreal autumn-winter <b>propagations.</b> Lag correlation of SSH signals allows for a twofold quantification: the phase speed and the importance of remote forcing along the coast. The remote forcing effect of intraseasonal Kelvin waves is clearly evidenced over coastal upwelling regions as far as 10 °- 15 ° latitude. The physical mechanism associated with the forcing of the Kelvin waves and its impacts will be investigated in a future paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High-performance and {{low-power}} VLIW DSP processors {{are increasingly}} deployed on embedded devices to process video and mul-timedia applications. For reducing power and cost in designs of VLIW DSP processors, distributed register files and multi-bank register archi-tectures are being adopted {{to eliminate the}} amount of read/write ports in register files. This presents new challenges for devising compiler op-timization schemes for such architectures. In our research work, we ad-dress the compiler optimization issues for PAC architecture, which is a 5 -way issue DSP processor with distributed register files. We show how to support an important class of compiler optimization problems, known as copy <b>propagations,</b> for such architecture. We illustrate that a naive deployment of copy <b>propagations</b> in embedded VLIW DSP processors with distributed register files might result in performance anomaly. In our proposed scheme, we derive a communication cost model by clus-ter distance, register port pressures, and the movement type of register sets. This cost model is used to guide the data flow analysis for sup-porting copy <b>propagations</b> over PAC architecture. Experimental results show that our schemes are effective to prevent performance anomaly with copy <b>propagations</b> over embedded VLIW DSP processors with dis-tributed files. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} to use continuous Morlet {{wavelet transform}} over {{space and time}} has been developed.

This is applied to study the spatial and temporal scales associated with the poleward <b>propagations</b> of the ITCZ (InterTropical Convergence Zone) over the Indian and West Pacific longitudes. The method has an added advantage that we can obtain the predominant spatial scales over a particular region, the temporal scales associated with them and their time of occurrence. We find that poleward <b>propagations</b> of ITCZ have a predominant spatial scale of about 30 degrees. However the predominant temporal scale varies from year to year. Other regions which do not have significant poleward <b>propagations</b> do not show these (spatial and temporal) characteristics...|$|R

The path integral needs regulation at the mass shell p^ 2 =m^ 2. If we regulate the two <b>propagations</b> independently we get the Feynman propagator in the vacuum, and its complex conjugate. But if the regulation mixes the two <b>propagations</b> then we get the matrix propagator appropriate to perturbation theory in a particle flux. This formalism unifies the special cases of thermal fluxes in flat space and the fluxes `created' by Cosmological expansion, and also gives covariance under change of particle definition in curved space. We comment briefly on the proposed application to closed strings, where we argue that coherent fields and `exponential of quadratic' particle fluxes must both be used to define the background for perturbation theory.
