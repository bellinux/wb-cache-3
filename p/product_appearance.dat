50|$|The table above {{presents}} {{the waste stream}} for several processes that are commonly use in different industries. The example given for chemical industry is the powdered detergent production where gyratory screener is used to filter out the oversized granules found in end product to improve <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> and dissolve rate. Citrus juice production is the example of food industry. Gyratory screener available in multi-layered planes eliminates all the wastes in several stages. Juice sacs are the desirable element to produce citrus juice. Screening in food industry significantly increases the product quality. Among the ore processing, gyratory screener is used after crushing to filter out the oversized ore particles. These unfavourable particles {{can be regarded as}} waste or recycle back to the process. Similarly, in pharmaceutical industry, gyratory screener removes undissolved particles from liquid pharmaceuticals or fine powder that stick on the capsule surface to ease the capsule stamp. As for wastewater treatment, removal of coarse solid wastes from the wastewater stream is exclusively to protect the downstream equipment from damages. Fine solid waste removal acts as pre-treatment for the process, more specifically a primary clarification. The overall screening process enhances system performance, minimize the cost and reduce the need for cleaning of the filter in other equipment.|$|E

However, in post-mortem consumer research, the Spot Vac was highly successful with women, who borrowed it from their husband's workbench in the basement to clean up minor spills {{in the kitchen and}} upstairs. This inspired the design of a new household product specifically for use upstairs by women. The <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> was completely re-designed by Gantz's design patent, the first design patent ever filed by B&D, renamed the Dustbuster, and introduced in January 1979 as a household product, not a power tool. Gantz was Manager of the Black & Decker United States Consumer Power Tool Division's Industrial Design Department at the time. Over a million Dustbusters were sold in its first year, four times that of the traditional handheld vacuum market and its success enabled B&D to establish a new Household Products Division, which in 1983, acquired and merged with General Electric Housewares Operations in Bridgeport, CT. By 1985, B&D had the lion's share of cordless vacuum cleaner market and the Dustbuster sold 7 million units annually. [...] It also came in 110 volts with an attachable hose and tools. The device used suction power to pick up fine dirt and debris including pet hair.|$|E

5000|$|Mike Markkula, {{a retired}} Intel {{marketing}} manager, provided the early critical funding for Apple Computer. From 1977 to 1981, Apple used the Regis McKenna agency for its advertisements and marketing. In 1981, Chiat-Day acquired Regis McKenna's advertising operations and Apple used Chiat-Day. At Regis McKenna Advertising, the team assigned {{to launch the}} Apple II consisted of Rob Janoff, art director, Chip Schafer, copywriter and Bill Kelley, account executive. Janoff {{came up with the}} Apple logo with a bite out of it. The design was originally an olive green with matching company logotype all in lower case. Steve Jobs insisted on promoting the color capability of the Apple II by putting rainbow stripes on the Apple logo. In its letterhead and business card implementation, the rounded [...] "a" [...] of the logotype echoed the [...] "bite" [...] in the logo. This logo was developed simultaneously with an advertisement and a brochure; the latter being produced for distribution initially at the first West Coast Computer Faire. Ever since the original Apple II, Apple has paid high attention to its quality of packaging, partly because of Steve Jobs' personal preferences and opinions on packaging and final <b>product</b> <b>appearance.</b> All of Apple's packaging for the Apple II series looked similar, featuring lots of clean white space and showing the Apple rainbow logo prominently. For several years up until the late 1980s, Apple used the Motter Tektura font for packaging, until changing to the Apple Garamond font.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, it is {{investigated}} how {{the current}} knowledge that people possess about a certain product category influences perception and aesthetic appraisal of product appearances within this product category. Through the reoccurring exposure to product appearances {{in everyday life}} people form Internalized Product Appearances (IPA) of different product categories. The IPA forms the benchmark to which a new <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> is compared. This comparison process influences perception and aesthetic appraisal of product appearances. The IPA is product category dependent, which implies that the relationships of physical properties (e. g., shape, color) with perceived typicality, product attributes (e. g., modernity) and aesthetic appraisal are not generalizable over product categories. For example, a <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> from a product category with an angular prototype shape (e. g., a toaster), is perceived as modern when made curved, while a <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> from a product category with a curved prototype shape is perceived as modern when made angular. Deviating a <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> from the IPA of a product category can {{have a positive effect}} on aesthetic appraisal of product appearances, but only up to a certain optimum level after which a <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> deviates too much from the IPA to be aesthetically pleasing. The IPA is not the only comparison standard provided to consumers in daily life. A context (e. g., an advertisement) also influences the perceived typicality of a product category and may thus influence aesthetic appraisal of product appearances. Based on this dissertation, we encourage designers to specifically look at the current design-style within the product category that they are working with. Then, designers and marketers can make a more market-oriented decision on how to design a <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> that communicates the intended product attributes and that is aesthetically pleasing.

40|$|Consumers {{often have}} {{difficulty}} understanding the really new functions of product innovations. This study explores the potential role of <b>product</b> <b>appearance,</b> {{and more specifically}} visual complexity, to improve consumers’ comprehension of product innovations. Because visual complexity is directly determined by designers, {{it is essential to}} equip designers with the knowledge of how visual complexity influences consumers’ comprehension. We propose that a visually complex <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> will result in a state of congruity with really new functions of the product innovation. Our results reveal that due to this congruity for really new products, a visually complex <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> can improve consumers’ comprehension of the product innovation in comparison to a visually simple product. For an incremental new product, no effects for visual complexity were found. Product Innovatie ManagementIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{successful}} RNPs {{can bring}} competitive advantages for companies. However, {{the success rate}} of RNPs are relatively low because consumers often feel resistant to adopt them. One reason for consumers’ resistance is their lack of comprehension of RNPs. To facilitate consumers’ comprehension, this paper conceptually discusses the opportunities related to designing the appearances of RNPs. More specifically, to facilitate consumers’ internal and external learning, this paper explores four underlying mechanisms: 1) <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> as a visual cue to trigger category-based knowledge transfer, 2) to trigger analogy-based knowledge transfer, 3) <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> as an information carrier to communicate innovative functionality directly, and 4) <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> {{as a way to}} trigger congruity with innovative functionality of RNPs. The rationales for each underlying mechanism are conceptually discussed, supported with relevant empirical evidence and examples found in the markets. Marketing and Consumer Researc...|$|E

40|$|People use the {{appearance}} of products as a cue for evaluating functional attributes at purchase. This research provides an understanding of this form-function interdependency by investigating {{the effect of a}} business-like personality in <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> on the perceived performance quality of the product. A business-like personality is associated with competence, professionalism, and rustworthiness. As a result of these associations, people infer from a <b>product</b> <b>appearance</b> with a business-like personality that the product has greater performance quality. Two studies using stimuli from five product categories support this hypothesis. These findings indicate that product personality is another cue that people use to evaluate a product’s functional attributes, along with the What is beautiful is good principle.
