Among them, 4 were type 1, 5 were type 2 and 1 was type 3 VWD. Six of the 10 patients had a positive family history of bleeding tendencies. A variety of bleeding manifestations were observed in these patients while mucocutaneous bleeds {{in the form of}} frequent epistaxis and easy bruising were the commonest presenting features. Severe bleeding in the form of intracranial haemorrhage occurred in 2 patients.

40|$|Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} inherited bleeding disorder affecting about 1 % of the population (1). Data on the management of patients with vWD undergoing surgery are limited (2). Desmopressin (DDAVP), which acts by stimulating release of stored von Willebrand factor (vWF) from endothelial cells, is useful for minor surgical procedures in patients with type 1 vWD but is unsuitable for most patients with type 2 and 3 vWD (1, 3). The phenomenon of tachyphylaxis associated with repeated doses of DDAVP (4) limits its utility even in patients with type 1 disease undergoing major surgery or trauma since in these settings, higher levels of vWF need to be maintained for several days. In such situations, vWF is replaced by the infusion of blood derivatives such as cryoprecipitated human plasma or intermediate purity plasma-derived coagulation factor VIII concentrates (2). The latter are preferred as they undergo steps to remove and/or inactivate transfusion-transmitted pathogens during production (2). This brief report describes our experience {{with the use of}} an intermediate <b>purity</b> <b>factor</b> VIII concentrate containing vWF (Koate®DVI, Bayer Corporation, Berkeley, CA) for hemostasis in patients with vWD undergoing surgery.

However, tight junctions were discontinuous, TER was less than 300 Ω·cm 2, and permeability was high. In contrast, chief cells incubated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were confluent in 3 days and had a TER greater than 2, 000 Ω·cm 2, continuous tight junctions, and low permeability.

The focus of this dissertation is first on a binary system consisting of poly[2, 6 -(4, 4 -bis-(2 -ethylhexyl) - 4 H-cyclopenta[2, 1 -b; 3, 4 -b’]-dithiophene) -alt- 4, 7 -(2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole) ] (PCPDTBT) and [6, 6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (Chapter 2). Then composition of the active layer was extended to a more complicated ternary system containing poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT), PCPDTBT and PCBM (from Chapter 3 to 5). Multiple characterization methods were used, including x-ray/neutron scattering or reflectivity techniques in combination with transmission electron microscopy and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy.

On August 24, 1922, in Bastrop, Louisiana, two men were kidnapped by a group of masked members of the Ku Klux Klan and were subsequently never seen again. Months later, two bodies were discovered in LaFourche Lake near Bastrop, Louisiana. While government officials were convinced that these were the bodies of the two men, many Klan members and non-Klan members alike believed that the bodies had been planted as part of a government conspiracy to uproot the Ku Klux Klan. Their murders sparked both an extensive investigation of Klan activities in Louisiana as well as a more general debate on the role that the "invisible empire" should play in American civil and social life. The Ku Klux Klan first organized in the north-central part of Louisiana in 1921, but the Klan's national membership had significantly grown during the previous decade. As is evidenced by the nation-wide correspondence of Louisiana's then-governor, John Parker, people throughout the United States were also forming ideas on the Klan and its pursuit of "responsible, wholesome government. " The Klan attempted to legitimate its ideology by infusing principles of patriotism with religious and racial purity. In my research I have attempted to reconstruct the circumstances that existed in this town of approximately five hundred people in the years surrounding the incident. I describe the origins of a Klan network in the area as well as the particular circumstances that brought about the murder of two anti-Klan community members. Most of the resources available are primary documents, including newspaper reports, letters of correspondence between concerned citizens and government officials, and investigation reports. My research indicates that no work at all has been done on this incident, insofar as it relates to a larger narrative of Klan activity in the United States. I go on to argue that the Klan's use of the moralistic language of patriotism and <b>purity</b> were major <b>factors</b> {{in the way in which}} the nation perceived the events...|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} practice, {{there is}} a demand for a reference standard for viscosity that is established for a readily available fluid to simplify the calibration of industrial viscometers for moderately high viscosities [(50 to 125) mPa · s]. Diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP) has been suggested as that reference fluid, {{and a number of}} studies of its properties have been carried out in several laboratories throughout the world, within the auspices of a project coordinated by the International Association for Transport Properties. That project has now progressed {{to the point where it}} is possible to collate the results of studies of the viscosity of the fluid by a number of different techniques, so as to lead to a proposed standard reference value which will be included in the paper. To support this recommended value, the various measurements conducted have been critically reviewed, and the sample <b>purity</b> and other <b>factors</b> affecting the viscosity have been studied. Density and surface tension measurements have also been performed. This paper does not describe the individual viscosity determinations carried out in independent laboratories because these are the subject of individual publications, but it does describe the ancillary studies conducted and their relevance to the viscosity standard. In addition, the paper contains recommended values for the viscosity of liquid DIDP. The samples of DIDP to which the recommended values refer are isomeric mixtures available commercially from certain suppliers, with a minimum purity by gas chromatography of 99. 8 %. The recommended values result from a critical examination of all the measurements conducted to date and are supported by careful arguments dealing with the likely effects of the isomeric content of the sample as well as of other impurities. The proposed reference standard is intended particularly to serve an industrial need for a readily available calibration material with a viscosity close to that required in practical situations. To that end, the recommended value has an overall relative uncertainty of approximately 1 %. It is therefore not intended to supersede for the reference value for the viscosity of water at 20 °C, which is known much more accurately, but rather to complement it...|$|R
40|$|Whey is a {{by-product}} of cheese manufacture, containing a mixture of proteins of commercial value, each having unique attributes for nutritional, biological and food ingredient applications. A tremendous amount of whey, normally treated as a waste product, is produced worldwide each year. This work describes the cation-exchange adsorption {{of the two major}} whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin (ALA) and beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) with the purpose of optimising a process for isolating them from whey. Adsorption of pure BLG and ALA was studied onto SP Sepharose FF using 0. 1 M acetate buffer. Batch experiments were carried out at various pH values for ALA and BLG, and the relevant Langmuir isotherm parameters, dissociation constant, Kd, and maximum binding capacity, qm, were determined. The optimum pH for separation was chosen to be pH 3. 7. At pH 3. 7, both Kd and qm pertaining to ALA were found to have higher numerical values than those of BLG, implying different characteristics of adsorption of the two proteins on this adsorbent. The Kd for the former protein was almost four times larger than the latter, while qm was 1. 3 times higher. Packed-bed column adsorption was performed using a 1 -ml column at pH 3. 7, flow rate 1 ml/min and initial concentration of 3 mg/ml for BLG and 1. 5 mg/ml for ALA both in 0. 1 M sodium acetate buffer. The t 1 / 2 for the resulting ALA breakthrough was 75 % longer than its BLG counterpart. The above results suggest the possibility of the occurrence of competitive adsorption between the proteins when adsorbed simultaneously. In traditional batch uptake experiments, the kinetic rate constants of ALA and BLG in both the single- and two-component systems were determined using the simple kinetic model. The values so obtained implied that BLG was adsorbed faster than ALA. In the confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments, the different behaviour of ALA and BLG in the single-component system with regard to their penetration within the adsorbent beads suggested that the two proteins have different transport mechanisms governing their adsorption. The two-component system results showed that ALA was able to displace BLG in spite of the lower affinity of the former protein to the adsorbent. The packed-bed adsorption and elution of a mixture of ALA and BLG were then investigated under the above conditions but using a 5 -ml column. BLG breakthrough occurred first, and its concentration in the outlet exceeded its feed value by 1. 6 fold before declining to the feed value, followed by the breakthrough of ALA. ALA displaced and eluted all the BLG from the column in a pure form. Pure ALA could then be eluted with good recovery. The single- and two-component breakthrough curves for ALA and BLG were simulated by the simple kinetic model using the isotherm parameters, but the overshoot phenomenon could only be predicted after correcting these parameters. The evidence of the competitive nature of adsorption observed in binary mixtures was used to develop a facile separation procedure for the two proteins from aqueous solutions of whey concentrate powders. A novel consecutive two-stage separation process was developed to separate ALA and BLG from whey concentrate mixtures. Almost all the BLG in the feed was recovered, with 78 % being recovered at 95 % purity and a further 20 % at 86 % purity. In addition, 67 % of ALA was recovered, 48 % at 54 % purity and 19 % at 60 % <b>purity.</b> The correction <b>factors</b> employed for the pure binary mixture were used to simulate the breakthrough curves of the two proteins in experiments conducted with whey concentrate in each of the two stages of the novel separation process, and there was agreement between the experimental and theoretical results.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{labeling}} of the monoclonal antibody anti-CEA and of the polyclonal human immunoglobulin Sandoglobuline with the radioisotope 153 Sm has been investigated. Samarium- 153 (t 1 / 2 = 46. 75 h) is mainly a beta emitter (Eβ = 227 keV), {{which can be used}} for therapeutic purposes, while its γ-ray (Eγ = 103 keV, 28 %) facilitates scintigraphic imaging. Thus, monoclonal antibodies labeled with 153 Sm can be used for combined radioimmunoscintigraphy and radioimmunotherapy. Labeling can be achieved using the bicyclic anhydride of DTPA (cDTPAa) as the bifunctional chelating agent, which, when conjugated to antibody molecules, can bind 153 Sm. Labeling was performed with the addition of 153 Sm, in the form of 153 SmCl 3 solution, to the Ab-DTPA immunoconjugate solution, at a pH range of 5. 0 - 5. 5. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature and free 153 Sm was eliminated by gel filtration, in a Bio Gel P 30 column. The labeling control was performed using a combination of radiochemical techniques (gel filtration, HPLC, ITLC-SG and SDS-PAGE). The factors, which possibly affect the labeling yield, have been investigated, in order to find out those which lead to a final product, obtainable in high yield and with high radiochemical <b>purity.</b> Optimization of <b>factors</b> (pH, Ab, Ab-DTPA concentration etc) leads to a labeling yield > 90 %. The final product was obtained in radiochemical purity > 98 %, which allows its use for in vivo studies. The anti-CEA-DTPA immunoconjugate was prepared using different concentrations of anti-CEA (3 to 15 mg/ml) and different molar ratios of anti-CEA:cDTPAa (1 : 3. 5 to 1 : 45). The number of DTPA molecules attached per anti-CEA molecule (DTPA/anti-CEA) was determined and the effect of DTPA conjugation on the antibody molecule was studied with HPLC and SDS-PAGE. The number of DTPA/anti-CEA increases by increasing both the anti-CEA:cDTPAa molar ratio and the antibody concentration. It is obvious that this leads to an increase in labeling yield and in higher specific activity of the final product. However as a consequence, polymer formation takes place. The effect of DTPA conjugation on the in vivo distribution of the labeled antibody was evaluated in normal mice, where the differences in biodistribution were obvious, in cases of polymer species existence. The limitary number of DTPA/anti-CEA, in order to avoid polymer formation, is 1. 5 and it corresponds to an anti-CEA concentration of 3 mg/ml and an anti-CEA:cDTPAa molar ratio of 1 : 10. In order to achieve a final product with high specific activity it is preferable to use 153 SmCl 3 solution with high specific activity. In the above maximum tolerated conditions the specific activity of the final product reached a maximum value of 1. 2 mCi/mg, using 153 SmCl 3 solution with specific activity of 763 mCi/mg. The in vivo distribution of [153 Sm]DTPA-anti-CEA was evaluated in nude mice, bearing experimental tumors, with anatomic and imaging techniques. The tumor was developed after local implantation of Colo 205 cancer cells, expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The apparent association constant Ka of [153 Sm]DTPA-anti-CEA for this cell line, as determined by Scatchard analysis, is 2 / 107 M- 1. A comparative to nude mice biodistribution study was also performed in normal mice, in order to evaluate the effect of tumor existence in the antibody distribution. [153 Sm]DTPA-anti-CEA showed slow blood clearance, it was concentrated mainly into the liver, spleen and lungs, while it was excreted through the kidneys. The comparative biodistribution study in normal and nude mice showed no significant differences in the radioactivity concentration levels in healthy tissues, for 4 hours to 2 days post injection. Differences were obvious from 3 - 5 days post injection, where the values in the above tissues where higher in nude mice compared to normal. An increase in radioactivity concentration in bones with time was also observed, where it was at the same level for the two kind of animals. [153 Sm]DTPA-anti-CEA was evaluated in nude mice bearing tumors weighing 0. 5 to 2. 5 g. Focusing on tumor radioactivity concentration, higher concentration was observed in 0. 5 - 0. 8 g tumors compared to those of 1. 5 - 2. 5 g, 24 hours post injection. In nude mice bearing tumors of about the same weight tumor uptake increased with time, reaching a maximum value 2 days post injection. The biodistribution results agreed with scintigraphic studies performed on gamma camera. The tumor can be visualized 4 - 24 hours post injection, but due to the high background, it can be clearly distinguished from the other tissues 2 days post injection. ...|$|R
