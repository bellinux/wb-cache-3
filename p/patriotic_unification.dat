To accomplish this goal I chose to examine a civilian prison camp in Germany where the detainees were mainly comprised of British civilians caught in Germany {{at the onset of}} war. The detainees at the camp comprised of non-German nationals that fell into one of several categories: student, vacationer, businessman, or transplant. I chose to compare theatre in the camp against theatre in England before, during, and after the war to determine how theatre evolves in an open society versus an enclosed society. 	My introductory chapter provides a brief overview of conditions at the camp to illuminate the difficulties detainees faced while exerting enormous amounts of effort and time preparing, rehearsing and presenting productions. Chapter 2 provides a brief introduction to what led to the First World War and the decision to imprison non-German nationals. I also examine the initial formation of the camp and its use prior to becoming a civilian prison. Chapter 3 establishes current trends in theatre in Great Britain and compares their further development against development of theatre in the camp by using camp magazines; Camp Ruhleben and In Ruhleben Camp, to piece together a chronological order of productions, gain insight to detainee reactions to production by analyzing play critiques and production articles, along with original playbills, posters, and photographs. Chapters 4 and 5 delves further into human resources and production resources. For insider information, I used camp detainee Joseph Powell???s book The History of Ruhleben: a record of British organization in a prison camp in Germany, along with Ruhleben camp magazines, to gain information on rehearsal practices, creation of roles, and use of materials for characters and sets: Powell was head of the Captain???s Committee until the close of the camp after the former captain, E. M. Trinks, was released in January 1915 and thus was able to offer valuable insider information on the dialing events in the camp. For progress outside the camp, I used L. J. Collin???s Theatre at War, 1914 - 1918 to monitor wartime rationing and the recruitment of theatre personnel and how theatre managers dealt with having to replace their actors and crews with non-professionals. 	I then conclude that material chosen in the camp not only reflected conditions faced by the prisoners, but also their need to escape from the dreariness of their incarceration. Whereas material chosen outside of the camp during the war reflected the desire for <b>patriotic</b> <b>unification</b> by the British governments and the need to drum up recruits...|$|E

After the revolution, he painted portraits of Romanian revolutionaries in exile such as Gheorghe Magheru, Ştefan Golescu, and, in 1851, that of Nicolae Bălcescu (in three almost identical versions). Romantic nationalist ideals were the inspiration for his allegorical compositions with revolutionary (Romania's rebirth, 1849) and <b>patriotic</b> (The Principalities' <b>Unification,</b> 1857 and [...] February 11 - The Modern Romania, 1866) themes.|$|R
2500|$|In Italy, {{society was}} divided over the war: Italian socialists {{generally}} {{opposed the war}} and supported pacificism, while nationalists militantly supported the war. Long-time nationalists Gabriele D'Annunzio and Luigi Federzoni and an obscure Marxist journalist and new convert to nationalist sentiment, future Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, demanded that Italy join the war. For nationalists, Italy had to maintain its alliance with the Central Powers {{in order to gain}} colonial territories at the expense of France. For the liberals, the war presented Italy a long-awaited opportunity to use an alliance with the Entente to gain certain Italian-populated and other territories from Austria-Hungary, which had long been part of Italian <b>patriotic</b> aims since <b>unification.</b> In 1915, relatives of Italian revolutionary and republican hero Giuseppe Garibaldi died on the battlefield of France, where they had volunteered to fight. Federzoni used the memorial services to declare the importance of Italy joining the war and to warn the monarchy of the consequences of continued disunity in Italy if it did not: ...|$|R

Federzoni used the memorial services to declare the importance of Italy joining the war, and to warn the monarchy of the consequences of continued disunity in Italy if it did not: Italy has awaited this since 1866 her truly national war, in order to feel unified at last, renewed by the unanimous action and identical sacrifice of all her sons. Today, while Italy still wavers before the necessity imposed by history, the name of Garibaldi, resanctified by blood, rises again to warn her that she {{will not be able to}} defeat the revolution save by fighting and winning her national war." [...] Luigi Federzoni, 1915 Mussolini used his new newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and his strong oratorical skills to urge nationalists and patriotic revolutionary leftists to support Italy's entry into the war to gain back Italian populated territories from Austria-Hungary, by saying [...] "enough of Libya, and on to Trento and Trieste". Mussolini claimed that it was in the interests of socialists to join the war to tear down the aristocratic Hohenzollern dynasty of Germany which he claimed was the enemy of all European workers. Mussolini and other nationalists warned the Italian government that Italy must join the war or face revolution and called for violence against pacifists and neutralists. Left-wing nationalism also erupted in southern Italy, socialist and nationalist Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida saw joining the war as essential to relieving southern Italy of the rising cost of bread which had caused riots in the south, and advocated a [...] "war of revolution".|$|R
