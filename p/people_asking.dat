25|$|Marshmallow: A {{marshmallow}} {{who talks}} in a squeaky voice and is always happy. Though having been referred as male in multiple occasions, a running gag has many <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> if Marshmallow {{is a boy}} or a girl. He is often seen with Midget Apple.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{tried to}} get {{surviving}} members of the crew to admit they were in Kentucky only to photograph poor <b>people,</b> <b>asking</b> if they intended to photograph more prosperous parts of the state. The defense also {{wanted to know how}} much money they had been paid from the filming. Ison's lawyer used his closing statement to speak more about the intrusiveness of reporters than his client's actions. Nevertheless, the only legal issue was Ison's sanity. A psychiatrist testifying for the defense identified Ison as a paranoid schizophrenic, but a prosecution psychiatrist contradicted this.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{the column}} was only {{available}} on AOL, and Simmons forwarded the column to his friends. He began receiving e-mails from <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> {{if they could}} be put on his mailing list. For the first 18 months, Simmons would send it to about 100 people, until it became available on the web in November 1998. The website quickly built up a reputation as many of Simmons' friends from high school and college were e-mailing it to each other. In 2001, his website averaged 10,000 readers and 45,000 hits per day.|$|E

25|$|The film Bruce Almighty (2003) {{originally}} {{featured a}} number {{that did not have}} the 555 prefix. In the cinematic release, God (Morgan Freeman) leaves 776-2323 on a pager for Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) to call if he needed God's help. The DVD changes this to a 555 number. According to Universal Studios, which produced the movie, the number it used was picked because it did not exist in Buffalo, New York, where the movie was set. However, the number did exist in other cities, resulting in customers' having that number receiving random calls from <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> for God. While some played along with the gag, others found the calls aggravating.|$|E
25|$|The old {{airport was}} {{located on the}} same {{part of the city}} that today {{corresponds}} to the Kabah Avenue. The tower is 15 meters tall, has a staircase of 45 steps, and has a base dimension of 5 x 5 meters. The memorial was first built in 2002, with the donations of Aerocaribe, a local airline, but the structure was damaged after Hurricane Wilma in 2005. After the claims of the local <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> to rebuild the tower memorial, a new version was built on 2010, which was later abandoned without proper maintenance until Woox Pinturas, another local wood maintenance company, made a donation to restore the structure to its original appearance.|$|E
500|$|According to Ausmus, Hoffman {{wanted his}} teams {{to feel like}} a family. He felt like he let his family down if he did not do his job on a {{particular}} night. Still, he was accessible and held himself accountable on the rare occasions that he failed. Hoffman was more accommodating for interviews after blown saves than he was after successful ones. [...] "The <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> the questions are not responsible for the ball flying out of the park", he explained. Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.|$|E

500|$|On {{the day of}} Shankly's death, {{training}} was cancelled at both Melwood and Bellefield. The Labour Party conference stood in a minute's silence {{for a man who}} had always been a socialist. Sir Matt Busby, the former Manchester United manager, was so upset that he refused to take any telephone calls from <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> him for a reaction. Tributes poured in from the world of football, especially from the former players of all Shankly's clubs. Liverpool chairman John Smith summed them up with a simple but fitting: [...] "In my opinion, he was the most outstanding and dynamic manager of the century".|$|E
500|$|Churchill {{arrived on}} the scene at 11:50am to observe the {{incident}} at first hand; he later reported that he thought the crowd were unwelcoming to him, as he heard <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> [...] "Oo let 'em in?", in reference to the Liberal Party's immigration policy that had allowed the influx from Russia. Churchill's role during the siege is unclear. His biographers, Paul Addison and Roy Jenkins, both consider that he gave no operational commands to the police, but a Metropolitan police history of the event states that the events of Sidney Street were [...] "a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions". In a subsequent letter to The Times, Churchill clarified his role while he was present: ...|$|E
500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's {{very hard for me}} to relate to <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> questions that are not only boring but don't {{have anything to do with}} my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the shootings, all lessons at the college were cancelled {{for the remainder of the}} week, and classes were relocated to a temporary facility the following Monday. The town's other schools remained open. A candlelight vigil was held near the school grounds on the day after the shooting, and Kauhajoki Church held a memorial service on the evening of September 23. A second memorial service, on September 28, the Sunday following the shootings, was held, with the President and students attending. Three members of the congregation lit a further eleven candles (one for each killed, including Saari) at the service. Leading the service was Bishop Simo Peura, who reflected on Finland's treatment of young <b>people,</b> <b>asking</b> the question, [...] "What kind of society are we building?".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} Clive Ruggles {{has argued}} that {{there are problems with}} the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: [...] "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." [...] Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.|$|E
500|$|While {{still under}} the gag order, in an {{interview}} with the Marathi weekly magazine Lok Prabha of the Indian Express group, Raj was quoted as saying: [...] "We will go with folded hands and ask them [...] to leave.

Even when he says he and his party would go with folded hands to <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> them to leave and only raise hands if they refuse, he treads the ground gingerly without naming any community or party per se". On 3 March, at a party function organised by the MNS at Shivaji Park, after the expiry of the gag order, Raj announced, [...] "I have not given up my mission", thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on the migrant issue.|$|E

500|$|In 1947, a young disk jockey in Charlotte, North Carolina {{who worked}} the {{overnight}} shift had recently received some older records which he brought to work with him. He chose one at random {{and put it on}} the turntable. Shortly after the record had finished, the radio station's telephones began ringing with <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> about the song and requesting to hear it again. By afternoon, the city's music stores were calling the radio station, hoping to learn where they could order copies of [...] "Heartaches". [...] Both Victor and Decca went into their vaults to find their masters of the record and began pressing them for southern United States sales. As disk jockeys in other parts of the US began obtaining copies of the record and playing it, the demand for [...] "Heartaches" [...] went from coast to coast. This older recording went to the top of all the main charts in 1947, including sales, juke box play, and airplay.|$|E
500|$|Keyes {{was also}} criticized for {{his views on}} homosexuality. In an {{interview}} with Michelangelo Signorile, a gay radio host, Keyes defined homosexuality as centering {{in the pursuit of}} pleasure, literally [...] "selfish hedonism". When Signorile asked if Mary Cheney, Vice President Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, fit the description and was therefore a [...] "selfish hedonist", Keyes replied, [...] "Of course she is. That goes by definition." [...] Media sources picked up on the exchange, reporting that Keyes had [...] "trashed", [...] "attacked," [...] and [...] "lashed out at" [...] Mary Cheney, and had called her a [...] "sinner"—provoking condemnation of Keyes by LGBT Republicans and several GOP leaders. Keyes noted that it was an interviewer, not he, who brought up Mary Cheney's name in the above incident, and he told reporters, [...] "You have tried to personalize the discussion of an issue that I did not personalize. The <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> me the question did so, and if that's inappropriate, blame the media. Do not blame me." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{included}} Claire {{among the}} characters {{they would like}} to see returning for Resident Evil 6, with Schedeen calling Claire [...] "leagues above that walking bag of useless called Sheva." [...] PlayStation Universe also chose Claire in her original outfit from Resident Evil 2 as one of the five characters they wanted to appear in Resident Evil 6s Mercenaries mode as she [...] "is long overdue a canonical appearance in the series." [...] In 2012, RE6 producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi wrote they have [...] "heard a lot of love for Jill and Claire recently and <b>people</b> <b>asking</b> if they’ll be in the next Resident Evil." [...] Including Claire among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcom's history, GamesRadar staff commented in 2013: [...] "Sadly she's fallen into the background of the series, which makes sense she avoided work as a government zombie hunter, but we hope Capcom has plans for her in the future. Here's a suggestion: a co-op focused RE that teams Claire up with the almost as underused Jill. It's your move Capcom." [...] Reacting to Claire's return in Revelations 2 IGN's Mitch Dyer wrote: [...] "The Resident Evil series places women in prominent, powerful, playable roles. Jill Valentine, Rebecca Chambers, Sheva Alomar, and Ada Wong, to name a few. Still, they're often opposite a male lead. This is the first time a Resident Evil game has revolved around the story of two women. It's fun to get to play as Claire again." [...] According to a CVG preview of Revelations 2, [...] "she's older, calmer and more capable, but she still retains everything that made her compelling in the first place. Where Rachael from the first [...] was part centrefold, part melted-ice cream, Claire feels distinct from many women in the Resi universe in that there's more to her than lady-lumps and lycra. She's the perfect choice for the game's brand of isolated horror." ...|$|E

[...] As Fiala turned around, surprised to see Gravano, Milito came up behind him and shot him in the head. Milito stood over the body and fired a shot into each of Fiala's eyes as Fiala's entourage and the crowd of people on the street dispersed, screaming. Gravano then walked up to Fiala's corpse and urinated on his mouth.|$|E
