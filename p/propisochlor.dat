Available data were also not sufficient to derive a residue definition or an LOQ for enforcement against potential illegal uses...|$|E
40|$|The {{chirality}} of herbicides {{has been}} the focus of research. However, there is little information on the enantioseparation of amide herbicides with different chiral elements. In this study, the need for different chiral stationary phases (CSPs), mobile phases, temperatures and flow rates for the separation of napropamide, acetochlor and <b>propisochlor</b> was discussed in detail and compared to metolachlor. Resolution of C-chiral enantiomers was easier than that of axial-chiral enantiomers. Metolachlor and acetochlor could achieve baseline separation only on AY-H and AS-H columns, respectively. <b>Propisochlor</b> had satisfactory separations on OD-H and AS-H columns. Napropamide was separated on OJ-H, AY-H and AS-H columns. Both the structures of the compounds and CSPs and the interactions between them played significant roles in the enantioseparations. Molecule dockings were also used to elucidate the separation mechanisms. C-chiral enantiomers had perfect symmetry in their optical properties, whereas the axial-chiral enantiomers did not. The elution order for napropamide, acetochlor and <b>propisochlor,</b> with a single chiral location, was R- prior to S-. These results were the first that compare the enantioseparations of four amide herbicides with different chirality, and they provided the absolute configurations for the herbicides. The paper also illustrated certain mechanisms for enantioseparations...|$|E

The concentration of herbicide was changed from 30 to 300 mumol/l. The obtained two-step ad- 	 sorption isotherms cannot be evaluated by using the Freundlich or Langmuir equations. New equation has been derived 	 by making use of the usual mass balance and equilibrium relationships of the adsorption and by considering the 	 possibility of the formation of associates of the hydrophobic solute molecules. The characteristic model parameters of 	 each step of the adsorption isotherm were estimated for the studied systems by a non-linear least square regression. The 	 calculated curves ﬁt well to the experimentally obtained two-step isotherms and the parameters of the model can be 	 used for the characterization of the pesticide–soil interactions and consequently the mobility of the <b>propisochlor</b> in soil/ 	 water systems...|$|E
