50|$|Corneocytes contain small {{molecules}} called natural moisturizing factors, which absorb {{small amounts of}} water into the corneocytes thereby hydrating the skin. The natural moisturizing factor {{is a collection of}} water-soluble compounds produced from the degradation of histidine-rich proteins called filaggrin, which are responsible for aggregating keratin filaments to form keratin bundles that maintain the rigid structure of the cells in stratum corneum. When filaggrin is degraded, urea, <b>pyrrolidone</b> <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> (1,2), glutamic acid and other amino acids are produced. These are collectively referred to as the ‘natural moisturizing factor’ of the skin. The components of the natural moisturizing factor absorb water from the atmosphere to ensure that the superficial layers of the stratum corneum stay hydrated. As they are water-soluble themselves, excessive water contact may leach them and inhibit their normal functions which is why prolonged contact with water makes the skin drier. The intercellular lipid layer helps prevent the loss of natural moisturizing factor by sealing the outside of each corneocyte.|$|E

We therefore evaluated changes in fetal blood flow, using pulsed Doppler, in women submitted to combined magnesium and ritodrine treatment compared to those treated with ritodrine plus placebo. The Mg-treated group showed a decrease in vessel resistance both in the umbilical artery and in the fetal middle cerebral artery, indicating that fetal vasculature is sensitive to exogenous Mg.

40|$|Caspase- 14 is a {{protease}} that {{is mainly}} expressed in suprabasal epidermal layers and activated during keratinocyte cornification. Caspase- 14 -deficient mice display reduced epidermal barrier function and increased sensitivity to UVB radiation. In these mice, profilaggrin, a protein with {{a pivotal role}} in skin barrier function, is processed correctly to its functional filaggrin (FLG) repeat unit, but proteolytic FLG fragments accumulate in the epidermis. In wild-type stratum corneum, FLG is degraded into free amino acids, some of which contribute to generation of the natural moisturizing factors (NMFs) that maintain epidermal hydration. We found that caspase- 14 cleaves the FLG repeat unit and identified two caspase- 14 cleavage sites. These results indicate that accumulation of FLG fragments in caspase- 14 (-/-) mice is due to a defect in the terminal FLG degradation pathway. Consequently, we show that the defective FLG degradation in caspase- 14 -deficient skin results in substantial reduction in the amount of NMFs, such as urocanic acid and <b>pyrrolidone</b> <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid.</b> Taken together, we identified caspase- 14 as a crucial protease in FLG catabolis...|$|E

Loss-offunction mutations in FLG lead to reduced levels of filaggrin degradation products in the SC. It has recently been suggested that expression of filaggrin may additionally be influenced by the atopic inflammatory response. In this study, we investigated the levels of several breakdown products of filaggrin in the SC in healthy controls (CTRL) and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) in relation to FLG null allele status. We examined the relationship between NMF (defined here as the sum of PCA and UCA) and AD severity. METHODS: The SC levels of filaggrin degradation products including PCA, UCA, histidine (HIS) and tyrosine were determined in 24 CTRL and 96 patients with moderate-to-severe AD. All subjects were screened for 11 FLG mutations relevant for the study population. RESULTS: The levels of PCA, UCA and HIS correlated with FLG genotype. Furthermore, these levels were higher in the CTRL when compared to AD patients with no FLG mutations. Multiple regression analysis showed that NMF levels were independently associated with FLG genotype and severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Decreased NMF is a global feature of moderate-to-severe AD; within AD, FLG genotype is the major determinant of NMF, with disease severity as a secondary modifier. NMF components are reliably determined by a noninvasive and relatively inexpensive tape stripping technique...|$|E
