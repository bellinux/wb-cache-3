5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{flanked by}} areas <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> between {{the point where it}} enters Schuylkill County and its mouth. The {{tributary}} Stony Run also flows through some areas <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> and a few areas near Trexler Run are susceptible to flooding as well. Other small areas <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> are scattered throughout the watershed of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Messers Run is {{flanked by}} areas <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> during a 100 year flood {{from the mouth of}} Negro Hollow {{upstream}} to its headwaters. Negro Hollow and its unnamed tributaries are also surrounded by areas <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> during a 100-year flood for much of their length. Both of the unnamed tributaries of Messers Run are surrounded by such areas for the majority of their length.|$|E
5|$|The Plenty Brook now {{passes through}} the town's {{drainage}} system, allowing buildings to be built over the top. The brook has been <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> during heavy rain, especially in inland areas, which regularly causes problems for {{people living in the}} Eddington area in southern Herne Bay.|$|E

5|$|Battersea, {{listed as}} Patricesy (St Peter's Water) in the Domesday Book and first {{mentioned}} in records of 693 AD, {{on the south}} {{bank of the river}} opposite Chelsea, was by contrast low and marshy land, <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> Conditions were ideal for farming asparagus and lavender, and a small market town grew in the area based on the asparagus and lavender industries.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} halted in March 1989, {{for lack of}} funding, after costs had quickly {{escalated}} that January, from £35million to £230million. By this point huge sections of the building's roof had been removed, so that machinery could be taken out. Without a roof, the building's steel framework has been left exposed and its foundations have been <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> The Great Flood of 1968 inundated {{large parts of the}} town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh. After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after World War II was extended.|$|E
50|$|The low-lying {{area has}} been <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> {{including}} the Great Flood of 1951 and the Great Flood of 1993.|$|R

5|$|Like many {{buildings}} in Lower Manhattan, 32 Old Slip was battered with storm waters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In contrast to {{most in the}} region, the building was designed to resist a powerful earthquake, which in part made the structure less <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> Within a year the building's market value declined by 21.6% ($65.7 million). In 2013 a renovation effort began to add improved flood barriers, pumps and piping systems to better ward against future storms.|$|E
5|$|The bay {{serves as}} a nursery for shrimp and as an {{ecosystem}} for diverse species of birds and fish. Shrimp farms have been established inland to circumvent restrictions on the bay. The area close to shore is <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> and can sometimes accumulate large populations of mosquitos. As a consequence, no major settlements have been founded on the bay. However, the small communities of Port Alto and Carancahua have been established on the western and eastern shores, respectively.|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> Instructions on controlling erosion through outreach are also provided by telephone or the internet.|$|E

5000|$|In many countries, rivers are <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> and {{are often}} {{carefully}} managed. Defenses such as levees, bunds, reservoirs, and weirs are used to prevent rivers from bursting their banks.|$|R
50|$|An {{earthquake}} on February 5, 1783, partially {{destroyed the}} town, killing 25 people. The area is <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> and landslides and {{was hit in}} 1848, 1861, 1870, 1908, 1951, 1953, 1958, 1972 and 1973.|$|R
5|$|Located on {{the western}} banks of the north-flowing Red River of the North, in a flat region known as the Red River Valley, the city is <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> The Red River Flood of 1997 devastated the city. Originally called Les Grandes Fourches by French fur traders from Canada, who had long worked and lived in the region, {{steamboat}} captain Alexander Griggs platted a community after being forced to winter there. The Grand Forks post office was established in 1870; and the town was incorporated on February 22, 1881. The city was named for its location at the fork of the Red River and the Red Lake River.|$|E
5|$|Since {{settlement}} it {{has repeatedly}} flooded, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Adelaide's western suburbs were especially <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> {{due to their}} location on the river's alluvial fan. As development of Adelaide progressed the amount of rainfall required for flooding decreased and consequent damage increased. Increased stormwater runoff, modification of the river's banks and other changes all served to exacerbate the problem. Work done by various groups to minimise flooding was often counter productive {{with the creation of}} levees, moving and widening channels and other works simply shifting the flooding elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The China Meteorological Administration {{released}} {{a press release}} after the storm and gave four reasons for the extensive damage. First, the storm decelerated after landfall and maintained its identity for 120hours while moving south of due west. Secondly, the storm was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern semicircle. Also, the storm interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and more <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Amazon basin has a {{high flow}} of water and it is <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>floods.</b> The Parana basin {{represents}} approximately 42% of the total area of Bolivia and it is <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> droughts and desertification. The {{quantity and quality of}} hydrological information is very poor.|$|R
25|$|The Magdalena System, oriental {{valleys and}} Atratoa and Magdalena basins, delta {{waterways}} {{such as the}} Arauca, Grande de Santa Marta, and the Grande de Lorica wetland and the Mojana and Momposina areas are especially <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> and river overflow.|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{research}} on development of evacuation route system is {{being carried out}} to handle the natural disaster occurring due to increasing weather abnormality. This paper deals with a methodology for searching evacuation route and effective traffic oper-ation when roads areas are <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>floods.</b> The methodology is that we made activity based model by using household travel sur-vey data and then modeling it by applying a flooding scenario in traffic demand analysis program, MATSim in Ssinwol-dong, Kangseo-Gu, Seoul. Therefore, analysis of the result shows that travel pattern can be known in worst scenario cases. And {{it will be used}} effectively in decision making for evacuation route or efficient urban road operation when road area is <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flood,</b> o...|$|R
5|$|The coastal {{districts of}} Andhra Pradesh usually {{bear the brunt}} of heavy rains that occur during the {{northeast}} monsoon; with numerous river systems and wetlands, Puducherry and eastern Tamil Nadu are <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> The city of Chennai alone experienced five major floods between 1943 and 2005, with the 1943, 1978 and 2005 floods causing particularly severe damage. In addition, unplanned and often illegal urban development has led to many wetlands and natural sinks being built over; this, along with ageing civic infrastructure and poorly designed drainage systems, has resulted in an increased frequency of severe flooding.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{has been}} <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> due to it {{being in the}} Mississippi River's vicinity. The floods have {{impacted}} the Eagle Bend area, one of the communities on MS 465. In May 2011, the highway was closed in preparation for floods, which were already impacting the region. It re-opened in June, after repairs and cleanups were done to the road. MS 465 was closed again in early January 2016, as waters approached flood levels again. People were told to evacuate Eagle Lake via the northern section of MS 465. After waters receded {{by the end of}} January, the highway was re-opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury's built {{environment}} has developed around {{the areas of}} East Didsbury, West Didsbury, and Didsbury Village, which separates the two. The Albert Park conservation area, covering much of West Didsbury, places planning restrictions on development, alterations to buildings, and pruning of trees. The areas adjacent to the Mersey lie within the river's flood plain, and so have historically been <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> after heavy rainfall. The last major flooding was in the late 1960s. In the 1970s extensive flood mitigation work carried out along the Mersey Valley through Manchester has helped {{to speed up the}} passage of floodwater. Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden also acts as an emergency flood basin, storing floodwater until it can be safely released back into the river.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{the valleys}} of the rivers Curé, Virson, Mignon, and Gères, which were {{much larger than}} today, cut deeply through the region's invading forest. But they had the {{inconvenience}} of being marshy and <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> that turned them into real marshes and bogs, making the region particularly difficult to reach.|$|R

5|$|Where {{it passes}} through Bristol the river was <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> but the Northern Stormwater Interceptor, running from Eastville Sluices to the River Avon {{downstream}} of Clifton Suspension Bridge, has since been constructed to control this. At Wade Street, St Judes, the river enters an underground culvert, emerging at what Bristolians call The Centre (formerly the 'Tramways Centre'), but only {{when there is a}} risk of flooding. The river is otherwise channelled through Mylne's Culvert into the River Avon at a point between Bathurst Basin and Gaol Ferry Bridge. Three further flood relief tunnels- Castle Ditch, Fosseway and Castle Green Tunnel - run under Castle Park in central Bristol to carry excess flows into the Floating Harbour.|$|E
5|$|During Roman times, {{the land}} {{surrounding}} the rivers Ouse and Foss was marshy, making the site easy to defend. The city is <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> from the River Ouse, {{and has an}} extensive (and until 2015 mostly effective) network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a liftable barrier across the River Foss where it joins the Ouse at the 'Blue Bridge'. In October and November 2000 York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years with more than 300 homes flooded. In December 2015 the flooding was more extensive and caused major disruption. The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister David Cameron. Much land {{in and around the}} city is on flood plains too flood-prone for development other than agriculture. The ings are flood meadows along the Ouse, while the strays are open common grassland in various locations around the city.|$|E
5|$|Houston is flat marshy {{area where}} an {{extensive}} drainage {{system has been}} built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from {{the erosion of the}} Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.|$|E
50|$|Muzaffarpur {{district}} {{is served by}} rivers Gandak, Budhi Gandak, Bagmati and Lakhandayee. Also, {{there are lots of}} small streams passing through the district. The area has been <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>floods.</b> The district lies in the fertile region of Gangetic plain. Muzaffarpur district occupies an area of 3175.9 km2, comparatively equivalent to Canada's Mansel Island.|$|R
