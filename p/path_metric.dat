40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the trellis coding where quantum computing (QC) is employed to analyze the coding gain and complexity. According to quantum information theory, quantum bits increase the storage capacity as well as speed. High complex trellis based on partial memory code (PUM) is designed and simulated in digital computers. In order to reduce simulation time for trellis decoding, QC is analyzed with PUM coding. From the theoretical analysis, QC in a quantum computer {{will be the best}} option because quantum bits can be stored simultaneously in a given moment of time. From this theory, trellis states, <b>paths,</b> <b>metric</b> calculations are stored in lesser time and space than conventional storing procedures. Therefore, QC certainly will improve the trellis coder performance. General Terms In this paper, QC is considered as my general term.

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory for deciding, for any routing metric and any network, whether the {{messages}} in this network can be routed along <b>paths</b> whose <b>metric</b> values are maximum. In {{order for the}} messages in a network to be routed along <b>paths</b> whose <b>metric</b> values are maximum, the network {{needs to have a}} rooted spanning tree that is maximal with respect to the routing metric. We identify two important properties of routing metrics: boundedness and monotonicity, and show that these two properties are both necessary and sufficient to ensure that any network has a maximal tree with respect to any (bounded and monotonic) metric. We also discuss how to combine two (or more) routing metrics into a single composite metric such that if the original metrics are bounded and monotonic, then the composite metric is bounded and monotonic. Finally we show that the composite routing metrics used in IGRP (Inter-Gateway Routing Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced IGRP) are bounded but not monotonic. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Kleinberg [17] {{proposed}} in 2000 the first random graph model achieving to reproduce small world navigability, i. e. {{the ability to}} greedily discover polylogarithmic routes between any pair of nodes in a graph, with only a partial knowledge of distances. Following this seminal work, a major challenge was to extend this model to larger classes of graphs than regular meshes, introducing the concept of augmented graphs navigability. In this paper, we propose an original method of augmentation, based on metrics embeddings. Precisely, we prove that, for any ε> 0, any graph G such that its shortest <b>paths</b> <b>metric</b> admits an embedding of distorsion γ into R d can be augmented by one link per node such that greedy routing computes paths of expected length O (1 ε γd log 2 +ε n) between any pair of nodes with the only knowledge of G.

Our empirical results show single-linkage clustering with a true <b>path</b> distance <b>metric</b> provides the best solutions to the multi-robot task allocation problem when used in sequential single-cluster auctions. ...|$|R
