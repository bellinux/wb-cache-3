40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the use of dimenhydrinate was associated with delay in the diagnosis and management of treatable illnesses or with direct adverse effects in children with vomiting presenting to an emergency department. DESIGN: Questionnaire survey and review of drug reaction and telephone inquiry records. SETTING: The emergency department of a tertiary care children's hospital and a provincial <b>poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centre.</b> PATIENTS: The parents of 148 children who presented with vomiting completed the questionnaire. The database at the <b>poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centre</b> included 474 reports of adverse drug reactions over an 8 -year period and 105 reports of telephone inquiries over a 4 -year period. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one (14 %) of 148 children had received dimenhydrinate before arrival at the emergency department.

40|$|Aims: There {{is limited}} {{information}} on safety of angiotensin coverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists in unintentional paediatric ingestions. This {{study was conducted}} with the aim of developing referral guidelines for <b>poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centres.</b> Methods: Calls to the NSW <b>poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centre</b> from January 2002 to July 2004 regarding paediatric ingestion of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists were recruited and prospectively followed up. Information collected included: demographics (age, gender, weight), type of exposure (unintentional, therapeutic error), ingested dose and clinical effects. Dose was reported in defined daily doses (DDD) to compare across and within the two drug classes with respect to the normal adult dose. Results: Nineteen cases of paediatric ingestion of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists were included. The median age was 2 years (Interquartile range (IQR) : 20 – 33 months) and the median dose ingested was 1 DDD (IQR: 1 – 2). There were nine ACE inhibitor ingestions and 10 AII receptor antagonist ingestions. One of nine children (11 %) observed in hospital developed transient hypotension but required no treatment and recovered without complication. This child ingested an ACE inhibitor and ingested > 3 DDD. Conclusion: Unintentional paediatric ingestions of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists resulted in the majority of children remaining asymptomatic.

Method:We retrospectively analyzed adult MPH exposures reported to the Danish <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> from January 2006 to July 2012 and the association with MPH sales and the number of patients prescribed MPH. Results:Of the 394 exposures (57 % males, median age 27 years) reported, MPH status was available in 249 of whom 65. 5 % were prescribed MPH. Exposure was in 54 % motivated by suicidal attempt and in 40 % by recreational use (based on 375 cases).

40|$|Introduction. The soccer World Cup {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{sporting}} events in the world, but data on the effect of sporting events of such a magnitude on the service demand on <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centres</b> (PICs) are limited. Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the 2010 World Cup on the workload of the Tygerberg <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (TPIC). Methods. Data were collected prospectively for three time periods during 2010 : (1) 31 days preceding the World Cup (10 May- 10 June); (2) 31 days during the World Cup (11 June- 11 July); and (3) 31 days after the World Cup (12 July- 11 August). The calls received during 2010 were compared to calls received during corresponding time periods in 2008 and 2009. Collected data included date and time, caller's location and medical background, patient's age and gender, intent of exposure, route of exposure and specific toxin class. Results. During the study, 3888 calls related to human poisoning were received (1162 in 2010, 1412 in 2009 and 996 in 2008). The mean daily call volume between 2010 (12. 49; 95 % CI 11. 57 - 13. 42) and 2009 (13. 23; 95 % CI 12. 30 - 14. 15) did not differ significantly (p = 0. 25). The mean daily call volume during the World Cup was 11. 13 (95 % CI 9. 59 - 12. 67; n = 345) compared to 14. 26 (95 % CI 12. 71 - 15. 80; n = 442) for the similar period in 2009 (p = 0. 08). The mean daily call volume before and after the World Cup was 12. 74 (95 % CI 11. 20 - 14. 29; n = 395) and 13. 61 (95 % CI 12. 07 - 15. 16; n = 422); p = 1. 00 and p = 0. 39, respectively, when compared with the World Cup period. Discussion. An unexpected finding of this study was that the hosting of the 2010 World Cup resulted in fewer calls to the TPIC. This decrease could be attributed to the high visibility of policing, an extended school holiday and the positive attitudes of South Africans towards making the World Cup a success. Conclusion. PICs should be consulted during the planning stages of major sporting events. Contingency plans should still be in place to overcome any unexpected rise in call volume. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc. Articl...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionThe {{burden of}} {{poisoning}} exposures in Africa {{is a significant}} public health concern, yet only ten African countries have <b>poisons</b> <b>information</b> <b>centres.</b> The establishment of poisons centres was subsequently identified as a priority. This article focuses on workshop discussions with international multi-sector stakeholders in Eastern Africa regarding {{the possibility of a}} sub-regional poisons centre serving multiple countries. MethodsThe project was led by an independent consultant under the guidance of an international steering group. Steering group members provided input at international multi-stakeholder meetings and during monthly teleconferences. ResultsParticipants of the stakeholder meetings agreed that the establishment of a sub-regional poisons centre in Eastern Africa was necessary and feasible. Virtual collaboration is possible due to recent technological developments, and the overall suggestion was for countries to establish their own poisons centres and to network and coordinate these centres through a network hub. ConclusionA number of benefits might result from such a poisons centre network hub, including: (1) Improved cooperation between countries on poisoning problems; (2) Harmonisation and strengthening of research and surveillance; (3) Common standards and best practices e. g. regulating chemicals, data management, and staff training; and (4) Greater bargaining power to secure resources.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Poison</b> control <b>centres</b> provide <b>information</b> on the {{management}} of poisoning incidents. The British Columbia (BC) Drug and <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> recently implemented an electronic database system for recording case information, {{making it easier to}} use case data as a potential source of population-based information on health services usage and health status. This descriptive analysis maps poisoning case rates in BC, highlighting differences in patient age, substance type, medical outcome, and caller location. Methods: There were 50, 621 human exposure cases recorded during 2012 and 2013. Postal code or city name was used to assign each case to a Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA). Case rates per 1, 000 person-years were calculated, including crude rates, age-standardized rates, age-specific rates, and rates by substance type, medical outcome, and caller location. Results: The lowest case rate was observed in Richmond, a city where many residents do not speak English as a first language.

40|$|Objective: To {{collect data}} of {{toxicological}} cases for a 10 -year period {{and to develop}} a database for comparing epidemiology of intoxications with data from the national <b>poisoning</b> <b>information</b> <b>centre</b> (NVIC) and national prescription data (GIP). Design: Retrospective database study. Methods: All drug intoxications between 1997 and 2006 were identified from the records of the Clinical Pharmaceutical and Toxicological Laboratory in The Hague, Netherlands. Patient demographics and details of drugs analysed were acquired. These data were compared with data from NVIC and GIP. Results and conclusion: Almost 6000 cases were reviewed. From 1997 to 2006 the number of toxicological cases in The Hague increased from 322 to 826 per year. From 2001 - 2005 > 90 % of toxicological cases comprised analgesics, antidepressants, antipsychotics and hypnotics. These drugs comprised 60 - 70 % of cases reported to the PIC and 10 - 12 % of prescriptions. Most drug intoxications in The Hague involved analgesics and psychopharmacologic drugs. Relative to prescription data, most intoxications occur with tricyclic antidepressants.

40|$|Background: Poisoning {{accounts}} for 30 % of suicides in India and accidental and environmental exposures to poisons are frequent. The most common poisonings in India involve insecticides, rodenticides, snakebites, alcohols, sedative hypnotics, opioids, and pain medication. In India in 2017, a few <b>poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> exist, {{but there is}} no regional integrated <b>poison</b> control and <b>information</b> <b>centre</b> that can be readily accessed by people in the community, where poisonings occur. Here, we describe the implementation of a multispecialty model for an integrated regional poison-control centre in the city of Bangalore, Karnataka. Methods: We developed a model for a poison control centre that includes specialists from emergency medicine, critical care, pharmacology, paediatrics, psychiatry, preventive medicine, and laboratory diagnostics. The centre provides referral and management advice for poisonings, drug information, psychosocial care with suicide prevention, forensic medicine, and poison education for the general public. Patients are initially treated and stabilised at peripheral hospitals and then transferred by paramedics to a toxicology centre of excellence, or hospital, for poisoning consultation, intensive care management, enhanced elimination measures, and antidote therapy. Computerised software treatment modules have been developed for the most common poisonings for use by health-care providers in other hospitals in Bangalore. Findings: In 2016, a toxicology centre of excellence was established at the MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital and Medical College, a major metropolitan hospital in Bangalore, and linked with five peripheral hospitals in Karnataka. The central hospital provides all-hours, low-cost comprehensive <b>poisoning</b> <b>information</b> software and treatment protocols, forensic toxicology testing, reference laboratory analysis, Hazmat decontamination, intensive care management, and an antidote depot for peripheral hospitals. Interpretation: An integrated multispecialty poison control system has been established for the treatment of poisoning in one defined area of a major metropolitan region in India. The project provides <b>poisoning</b> <b>information</b> and a referral system to other surrounding metropolitan hospitals and will soon be rolled out to the entire city of Bangalore (population 10 million people). In response to findings from this pilot phase, we have added more software modules to include treatment of the most commonly encountered poisons. In response to the high rate of intentional poisonings, a suicide prevention and referral centre is being developed and will be located in the same building as the poison control centre. The next phase of the project will include a mobile telecommunications service to the general public in Karnataka (population 65 million). This system of care could be adopted as a model for other states in India to provide affordable, life-saving <b>poison</b> control <b>information,</b> toxicology surveillance, treatment, referral, and poisoning prevention.

Among the latter, the median age was 32 (range, 2 - 95) years and the male-to-female ratio was 1 : 2. 7 (48 : 129). Intentional ingestion constituted the majority (95 %) of cases. The most common symptoms {{were related to the}} local irritative/corrosive effects on the aero-digestive tract, such as gastro-intestinal upset and localised throat pain. Airway intervention was required in 14 (8 %) patients. All interventions were performed within 12 hours of Dettol ingestion and three cases involved re-intubation after extubation. Univariate analysis showed that a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 hours after Dettol ingestion) is unlikely. For those who are intubated, careful assessment of airway adequacy before extubation is strongly recommended to avoid extubation failure and subsequent re-intubation. Patients in coma (Glasgow Coma Scale score of < 8) should prompt airway intervention. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In a {{prospective}} study on 178 cases of accidental home poisoning {{admitted to the}} main children's hospital in Riyadh poisoning was found to account for 5. 6 % of the total annual admissions [...] greater than any other developing country and approaching Western proportions. The commonest ages were between 1 and 5 years. Drugs accounted for 52 % of cases and household products for 46 %. This picture also differs from the pattern of poisoning in developing countries and is more akin to that of industrialised countries. The most important factors in aetiology, besides {{the age of the}} patient and the underprivileged social class, were the abundance of drugs and household chemicals in the Saudi home, none of them in child proof containers; inappropriate storage; and lack of supervision of children. Cultural factors also contributed. The frequency of poisoning in childhood may be decreased in the long run by improved housing, socioeconomic status, and education. The place and methods of health education, also a long term objective, is discussed. For immediate primary prevention two important legislative measures are proposed: (1) provision of childproof containers of drugs and other chemicals used in the home and (2) banning of over the counter sales of drugs. For more accurate epidemiological data collection, and thereby better preventative planning, a national register of accidental poisoning and other accidents is recommended. <b>Poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> are also deemed necessary...|$|R
