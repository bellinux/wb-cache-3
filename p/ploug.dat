50|$|The {{building}} at the corner with Store Kirkestræde (No. 3) is called Warburg's House and was built in 1799 by Aron Leon Warburg, a wealthy merchant and manufacturer of stockings. The neighbouring {{building at}} No. 5 was adapted to a Neo-Renaissance style by Martin Borch in 1897. The two houses flanking Lile Strandstræde (No. 9-11 and 13) and No. 15 are also listed, Neoclassical houses from the late 1790s. Both No. 19 and No. 21 were built by Andreas Hallander, {{one of the most}} active builders of the period.

5000|$|Henrik Ibsen's ancestry {{has been}} a much studied subject, due to his {{perceived}} foreignness (leading his biographer Henrik Jæger to famously state that [...] "the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane") and due {{to the influence of}} his biography and family on his plays. Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them. Hence, both of Ibsen's parents, Knud Ibsen and Marichen Ibsen, served as the models for various characters, a fact admitted by Henrik Ibsen. [...] "Jon Gynt" [...] in Peer Gynt, [...] "Old Ekdahl" [...] in The Wild Duck and Daniel Hejre in The League of Youth are widely considered to be based on Knud Ibsen. Marichen Ibsen is considered the model for [...] "Åse" [...] in Peer Gynt and [...] "Inga of Varteig" [...] in The Pretenders, and she would [...] "echo through her son's work in unremitting portrayals of suffering women." [...] More broadly, Ibsen used his own biography, relatives and ancestors as a background for his plays and characters. The Gynt family's prosperous ancestor, Rasmus Gynt, is probably named for Rasmus Ibsen, the oldest known Ibsen, and modelled after Ibsen's wealthy maternal grandfather, Johan Andreas Altenburg. Ibsen's great-aunt Kristine Cathrine <b>Ploug</b> (née Altenburg), who lived with the Ibsen family, served as the model for characters such as [...] "The Rat-Wife" [...] in Little Eyolf. The character [...] "Hedvig" [...] in The Wild Duck is named for Ibsen's sister Hedvig Ibsen and/or his grandmother Hedevig Paus. Ibsen's plays often take place in bourgeois circles in small towns reminiscent of Skien, resembling the social environment of his childhood.|$|E

To perform the validation of the used mathematical model, the plough mouldboard working surface was sensitized with pressure transducers to evaluate the pressure distribution during the soil workmanship and then the pressure distribution values evaluated on the working surface with the numerical simulations and those experimentally detected in full field were compared. This allowed to determine the mathematical model of the considered soil. Successively by geometry changes of the working surface considered and performing some numerical simulations, it was numerically determined a working surface that required the smaller values of energy expense and draught force.

In the present study we investigate the regulation of human muscle GS activity by glycogen, exercise, and insulin. Using immunocytochemistry we investigate the existence and relevance of GS intracellular compartmentalization during exercise and during glycogen re-synthesis. The results show that GS intrinsic activity is strongly dependent on glycogen levels and that such regulation involves associated dephosphorylation at sites 2 + 2 a, 3 a, and 3 a + 3 b. Furthermore, we report the existence of several glycogen metabolism regulatory mechanisms based on GS intracellular compartmentalization. After exhausting exercise, epinephrine-induced protein kinase A activation leads to GS site 1 b phosphorylation targeting the enzyme to intramyofibrillar glycogen particles, which are preferentially used during muscle contraction. On the other hand, when phosphorylated at sites 2 + 2 a, GS is preferentially associated with subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar glycogen particles. Finally, we verify the existence in human vastus lateralis muscle of the previously reported mechanism of glycogen metabolism regulation in rabbit tibialis anterior muscle. After overnight low muscle glycogen level and/or in response to exhausting exercise-induced glycogenolysis, GS is associated with spherical structures at the I-band of sarcomeres...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether having T 2 D and also being obese had a greater or lesser impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than having either of the two conditions alone. Methods: The 2003 dataset of the Health Survey for England (HSE) was analyzed using multiple regression analyses to examine the influence of obesity and T 2 D on HRQoL, and to determine whether there was any interaction between these two disutilities. Results: T 2 D reduced HRQoL by 0. 029 points, and obesity reduced HRQoL by 0. 027 points. There was no significant interaction effect between T 2 D and obesity, suggesting that the effect of having both T 2 D and being obese is simply additive and results in a reduction in HRQoL of 0. 056. Conclusions: Based on analysis of HSE 2003 data, people with either T 2 D or obesity experience significant reduction in HRQoL and people with both conditions have a reduction in HRQoL equal to the sum of the two independent effects. The effect of obesity on HRQoL in people with T 2 D should be considered when selecting a therapy. Keywords: diabetes, health-related quality of life, obesity, type 2 diabetes, Englan...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} linked the {{production}} of increased levels of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) with the malignant phenotype. It {{has also been shown}} that a specific cell surface receptor can bind uPA through a domain distinct and distant from the proteolytic domain. In an in vivo model of invasion, consisting of experimentally modified chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of a chick embryo, only cells that concurrently expressed both uPA and a receptor for uPA, and in which the receptor was saturated with uPA, were efficient in invasion. To test whether uPA produced by one cell can, in a paracrine fashion, affect the invasive capacity of a receptor-expressing cell, we transfected LB 6 mouse cells with human uPA (LB 6 [uPA]), or human uPA- receptor cDNA (LB 6 [uPAR]). LB 6 (uPA) cells released into the medium 1 - 2 <b>Ploug</b> units of human uPA per 10 (6) cells in 24 h. The LB 6 (uPAR) cells expressed on their surface approximately 12, 000 high affinity (Kd 1. 7 x 10 (- 10) M uPA binding sites per cell. Unlabeled LB 6 (uPA) and 125 -IUdR- labeled LB 6 (uPAR) cells were coinoculated onto experimentally wounded and resealed CAMs and their invasion was compared to that of homologous mixtures of labeled and unlabeled LB 6 (uPAR) or LB 6 (uPA) cells. Concurrent presence of both cell types in the CAMs resulted in a 1. 8 - fold increase of invasion of the uPA-receptor expressing cells. A four- fold stimulation of invasion was observed when cells were cocultured in vitro, prior to in vivo inoculation. Enhancement of invasion was prevented in both sets of experiments by treatment with specific antihuman uPA antibodies, indicating that uPA was the main mediator of the invasion-enhancing, paracrine effect on the receptor-expressing cells...|$|E
40|$|CALL FOR PAPERS: Integrative and Translational Physiology: Inflammation and Immunity in Organ System PhysiologyObese {{individuals}} {{are characterized by}} low circulating adiponectin concentrations and an increased number of macrophages in adipose tissue, which {{is believed to be}} causally associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. Regular physical exercise decreases overall morbidity in obese subjects, which may be due to modulations of inflammatory pathways. In this randomized clinical trial we investigated the separate effects of endurance training-induced weight loss, diet-induced weight loss, and endurance training per se (without weight loss) on plasma adiponectin multimer composition (Western blotting) and adipose tissue macrophage content (immunohistochemistry) in young, moderately overweight men. Weight loss and endurance training per se decreased whole body fat percentage in an additive manner. No intervention-induced changes were observed for plasma total adiponectin. Surprisingly, endurance training, irrespectively of any associated weight loss, shifted the adiponectin multimer distribution toward a lower molecular weight (21 % decrease in HMW/LMW, P = 0. 015), whereas diet-induced weight loss shifted the distribution toward a higher molecular weight (42 % increase in HMW/MMW, P < 0. 001). Furthermore, endurance training per se increased the number of anti-inflammatory CD 163 ⁺ macrophages [from 12. 7 ± 2. 1 (means ± SE) to 16. 1 ± 3. 1 CD 163 ⁺ cells/ 100 adipocytes, P = 0. 013], whereas diet-induced weight loss tended to decrease CD 68 ⁺ macrophages in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. Thus regular physical exercise influences systemic and adipose tissue inflammatory pathways differently than diet-induced weight loss in younger, moderately overweight men. Our data suggest that some of the health benefits of a physically active lifestyle may occur through modulations of anti- rather than pro-inflammatory pathways in young, overweight men.

40|$|Dysregulation of the {{plasminogen}} activation cascade is a prototypic {{feature in}} many malignant epithelial cancers. Principally, this {{is thought to}} occur through activation of overexpressed urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) concomitant with binding to its high specificity cell surface receptor urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). Up-regulation of uPA and uPAR in cancer appears to potentiate the malignant phenotype, either (i) directly by triggering plasmin-mediated degradation or activation of uPA's or plasmin's proteolytic targets (e. g., extracellular matrix zymogen proteases or nascent growth factors) or indirectly by simultaneously altering a range of downstream functions including signal transduction pathways (Romer, J.; Nielsen, B. S.; <b>Ploug,</b> M. The urokinase receptor as a potential target in cancer therapy Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004, 70 (19), 235976). Because many malignant epithelial cancers express high levels of uPAR, uPA or other components of the plasminogen activation cascade and because these are often associated with poor prognosis, characterizing how uPAR changes the downstream cellular "proteome" is fundamental to understanding any role in cancer. This study describes a carefully designed proteomic study {{of the effects of}} antisense uPAR suppression in a previously studied colon cancer cell line (HCT 116). The study utilized replicate 2 DE gels and two independent gel image analysis software packages to confidently identify 64 proteins whose expression levels changed (by ≥ 2 fold) coincident with a moderate (~ 40 %) suppression of cell-surface uPAR. Not surprisingly, many of the altered proteins have previously been implicated in the regulation of tumor progression (e. g., p 53 tumor suppressor protein and c-myc oncogene protein among many others). In addition, through a combination of proteomics and immunological methods, this study demonstrates that stathmin 1 α, a cytoskeletal protein implicated in tumor progression, undergoes a basic isoelectric point shift (p/) following uPAR suppression, suggesting that post-translational modification of stathmin occur secondary to uPAR suppression. Overall, these results shed new light on the molecular mechanisms involved in uPAR signaling and how it may promulgate the malignant phenotype. 15 page(s...|$|E
