Harpin protein), Phoenix (a. i. Potassium phosphite) and Rigel (a. i. Salicylic acid derivative) applied at four different growth stages of tree development (bud break, green cluster, 90 % petal fall, early fruitlet) against the foliar pathogens Venturia inaequalis and Venturia pirina which cause apple and <b>pear</b> <b>scab</b> respectively. A conventional synthetic fungicide (penconazole) used within the UK for apple and <b>pear</b> <b>scab</b> control was included for comparison. Little efficacy as scab protectants was demonstrated when each SIR product and penconazole was applied at only two growth stages (bud break, green cluster). However when the above compounds were applied at three or more growth stages efficacy as scab protectants was confirmed. The synthetic fungicide penconazole provided greatest protection against apple and <b>pear</b> <b>scab</b> in both the 2006 and 2007 field trials.

It has become a serious economic problem in the main pear-growing districts since 1932. Of all diseases, scab causes the most consistent depreciation of Oregon's 6 -million-box pear crop, although pear blight may be more spectacular during occasional seasons of epidemics. During seasons favorable for scab infestations, losses of 20 to 30 per cent of the fruit have not been uncommon, and where control practices have been neglected the losses often reach 80 to 90 per cent in individual orchards. <b>Pear</b> <b>scab</b> is common in western Oregon, occasionally severe in the Hood River and Rogue River valleys, but is rare in the drier districts of eastern Oregon.

Flax culture in Ohio was eliminated in the 1800 's largely because of the seriousness of fusarium wilt and the cultivation of pears in the state is seldom profitable because of the fire blight disease. Virus diseases are the most important factors to be considered in raspberry culture in Ohio. The plant pathologist has a need for more exact information regarding the distribution of the parasitic fungi.

40|$|The organic {{market has}} grown {{exponentially}} in Europe {{during the last}} ten years. However, the organic fruit industry has shown the lowest growth rates (1 - 5 % market share) compared to other commodities. One major reason is the high production risk due to high disease and pest pressure in humid climates. Key pests and diseases in apple and <b>pear</b> include <b>scab,</b> sooty blotch, and fire blight as well as rosy apple aphid, pear sucker, and codling moth. In cherry, damages due to brown rot (Monilinia) and the cherry fruit fly make organic production almost unfeasible. In an ideal organic system, all possible measures that lead to improved stability of the system must be implemented. In fruit production, such measures include (i) use of resistant varieties (scab), (ii) active promotion of predators (rosy apple aphid), (iii) sanitation (cherry monilinia), (iv) microclimate management (planting density, covering trees), and (v) strengthening the plant self-defence system (e. g. building up of soil fertility, bio-dynamic preparations). At present, most organic orchards have been designed for conventional production and, therefore, lack most stabilising components. In consequence, organic fruit production still depends largely on direct pest and disease control methods. These include traditional pesticides such as copper, sulphur, and lime sulphur, pyrethrin, oil and soap preparations. More recently, new pest control compounds and techniques have been developed including neem products, granulosis virus, and mating disruption. New tools for disease control are less spectacular {{and focus on the}} replacement of copper (e. g. with clay powders and resistance inducers).

40|$|<b>Pear</b> <b>scab,</b> {{caused by}} Venturia pirina, {{is the most}} {{important}} disease of pears (Pyrus communis L.) in Australia. Fungicide reduction in pear production is needed for reasons that include the risk of food contamination with fungicide residues, damage to the environment, pathogen resistance to fungicides, and reduction in production costs. The broad aim of this study was, therefore, to extend knowledge of the epidemiology of <b>pear</b> <b>scab,</b> as a basis for improved disease forecast and management. In controlled experiments, the minimum wetness durations required for leaf infections by V. pirina ascospores and conidia ranged from 27 h at 4 C to 9 h at 25 C. The minimum infection times for V. pirina were similar to those required by ascospores of V. inaequalis at temperatures above 10 C as stated in the Mill's apple scab infection criteria. Below 10 C, the minimum infection times required by V. pirina ascospores for infection were shorter than the times reported by the Mills' criteria. The length of a dry period, interrupting a wet period, and the RH during the dry period both significantly affected disease severity. Ascospore release of V. pirina occurred mainly in the day time during periods of moisture caused by rainfall but smaller release also occurred at night and during periods of dew. Most ascospores were released during the period between green-tip and within 2 - 3 weeks after petal-fall, but in years with extended periods (> 7 days) of no rain during the bloom period, ascospore release was significantly delayed. Based on this new information of V. pirina ascospore release and spore infection criteria, the Mills' criteria was modified and recommended for calculation of <b>pear</b> <b>scab</b> infection periods in Australia. The length of the V. pirina ascospore maturation period was effectively modelled with linear regression equations that accumulated degree-days above 0 C, calculated both daily and only for days with > 0. 2 mm of rainfall. The rate of ascospore maturation and the percentage of ascospores discharged during rain periods at daytime were also effectively modelled using a logistic equation that accumulated degree-days above 0 C and used > 0. 2 mm of rainfall as a threshold for ascospore discharge. The ascospore maturity models developed in this study estimated well the beginning, peak and end of the ascospore maturation and release season, giving a reasonable prediction of the times when the risk of infection from ascospores was high or low. A simulation model was constructed, validated and used in a simulation study to investigate the effect of using pathogen and disease forecasts to estimate the potential risk of <b>pear</b> <b>scab</b> infection during infection periods. The results indicated that the use of forecasts of V. pirina ascospore release and infection of pear leaves would be more effective in forecasting the possible risk of infection during wet events in spring than using infection period criteria alone. The use of these forecasts would be particularly valuable in identifying the important infections of the primary infection season and this could lead to an improved timing and efficiency of fungicide applications for scab control and therefore lead to possible reductions in fungicide sprays.

Ascospore discharge was associated with rain and dew, with 90 - 98 % of the season 's total number of ascospores trapped during rain events and 2 - 10 % trapped during dew events in the 12 data sets examined. Most ascospores were trapped (82. 5 - 99. 9 %) during daytime (0600 - 1800 hours). The 0. 1 - 17. 5 % of ascospores detected during night time (1900 - 0500 hours) were trapped mainly within 1 - 3 h of dawn or dusk. There were linear relationships between the logit of cumulative percentage of ascospore maturation and temperature accumulation (above 0 degree-days), calculated both daily and for days with >= 0. 2 mm of rainfall.

40|$|SUMMARY: Series of {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} both in witro and in vivo on single conidial isolates of Venturia inaequalis and V. pirina. Relationships between colony type and sporulation in vitro were apparent in both species. In addition, isolates of V. inaequalis showed relationships between degree of resistance of host source, width of host range and stability of cultural characters and pathogenicity during storage in culture. Isolates of V. pirina showed no such relationships, cultural characters being invariably stable while pathogenicity rapidly declined in the storage conditions. Studies of nutritional requirements suggested no deficiencies in the synthetic abilities of either pathogen, but limiting nutritional factors were im-portant. Isolates of both species which differed widely in pathogenicity and other characteristics, reacted similarly to various culture media. The use of Venturia inaequalis (Cke.)

In this study, it was conducted to investigate the relationship between resistance of V. nashicola and mutation of β-tubulin gene and the fungicide resistance in field isolate group in benzimidazole fungicides. Responce of V. nashicola to carbendazim could be classified into 3 groups as sensitive that does not grow at all on PDA amended with 0. 16 μg/ml of carbendazim, low resistance that could not grow in 4. 0 μg/ml medium, and high resistance that can grow even at 100 μg/ml. Thirty isolates of V. nashicola collected from 3 regions as Wonju, Naju, and Okcheon were highly resistant to carbendazim.

The researches were conducted in the years 2013 - 2014 at the company SC Mecanochim Lapusel, Maramures County.

40|$|Background: Fungal plant {{pathogens}} {{belonging to}} the genus Venturia cause damaging scab diseases {{of members of the}} Rosaceae. In terms of economic impact, {{the most important of these}} are V. inaequalis, which infects apple, and V. pirina, which is a pathogen of European pear. Given that Venturia fungi colonise the sub-cuticular space without penetrating plant cells, it is assumed that effectors that contribute to virulence and determination of host range will be secreted into this plant-pathogen interface. Thus the predicted secretomes of a range of isolates of Venturia with distinct host-ranges were interrogated to reveal putative proteins involved in virulence and pathogenicity. Results: Genomes of Venturia pirina (one European <b>pear</b> <b>scab</b> isolate) and Venturia inaequalis (three apple scab, and one loquat scab, isolates) were sequenced and the predicted secretomes of each isolate identified. RNA-Seq was conducted on the apple-specific V. inaequalis isolate Vil (in vitro and infected apple leaves) to highlight virulence and pathogenicity components of the secretome. Genes encoding over 600 small secreted proteins (candidate effectors) were identified, most of which are novel to Venturia, with expansion of putative effector families a feature of the genus. Numerous genes with similarity to Leptosphaeria maculans AvrLm 6 and the Verticillium spp. Avel were identified. Candidates for avirulence effectors with cognate resistance genes involved in race-cultivar specificity were identified, as were putative proteins involved in host-species determination. Candidate effectors were found, on average, to be in regions of relatively low gene-density and in closer proximity to repeats (e. g. transposable elements), compared with core eukaryotic genes. Conclusions: Comparative secretomics has revealed candidate effectors from Venturia fungal plant pathogens that attack pome fruit. Effectors that are putative determinants of host range were identified; both those that may be involved in race-cultivar and host-species specificity. Since many of the effector candidates are in close proximity to repetitive sequences this may point to a possible mechanism for the effector gene family expansion observed and a route to diversification via transposition and repeat-induced point mutation...|$|E
40|$|The {{last two}} years we {{measured}} the amounts of leaf litter and ascospore production per unit of leaf litter area in 7 organic pear orchards throughout the Netherlands. In one of the orchards, adapted managements strategies were implemented two years ago, being grass/clover that is grown as ground cover on the tree-strip, and organic cattle-manure that replaces chicken manure pellets, in order to stimulate the earthworm population and change the palatability of the leaf litter. First results indicate large differences between orchards in percentage of ground covered by dead leaves {{at the time of}} major ascospore infections, but also in number of ascospores per cm 2 leaf litter and in resulting potential ascospore dose. We used these data, together with weather data (temperature, rainfall), in a simple multivariate analysis to gain insight in the dynamics of the system. In 2010, 85 % of the variation in <b>pear</b> <b>scab</b> was explained with a model with rainfall during summer and the amount of asco sores per unit of leaf area. In 2011, 81 % of the variation was explained by a model with the amounts of ascospores per unit leaf area and the potential ascospore dose. In the adapted management experiment we measured no changes in leaf litter in the treatments yet. We discuss that our first results show that, to a limited degree, leaf litter was indeed important for the scab epidemic in 2011, whereas in 2010 the high amount of rainfall {{in the second part of}} the growing season must have led to a high conidial infection pressure. Surprisingly, in both years ascospore number per unit leaf area was of more importance than leaf litter area or potential ascospore dose. This raises questions on for example the correlation with branch-lesions that we did not measure, and whether the number of ascospores per unit of leaf litter is a direct or an indirect factor that steers the scab incidence in the orchards...|$|E

The original can be found at: [URL] To {{the best of our}} knowledge, one or more authors of this paper were federal employees when contributing to this work. The area devoted to pear production in the United States (U. S.) is declining due to lack of precocity and high cost of production. The U. S. pear industry currently lacks "modern" orchard systems characterized by compact trees that produce early, high yields of large, high quality fruit. Tall, shaded canopies are not economically sustainable and are at a competitive disadvantage for attracting and sustaining a labor supply. There is broad and deep consensus in the pear industry that developing size-controlling rootstocks is imperative to remain competitive nationally and globally. Currently employed rootstocks in the U. S. are Pyrus communis seedlings and clones, none of which achieve more than about a one-third size reduction, and P betulifolia seedlings. Quince (C. oblonga), used with interstems in Europe and South America, is utilized commercially (without interstems) in the U. S. only for 'Cornice' in southern Oregon and northern California. This is due primarily to a lack of cold hardiness needed in more northern production areas, a lack of graft-compatibility with the other major scion cultivars, fire blight and iron chlorosis susceptibility, and relative lack of productivity versus other rootstocks, especially in California. Current evaluative trials rely on older U. S. and imported selections, and include the NC- 140 Multistate Rootstock Research Project and several individual programs in California, New York, Oregon and Washington. A fundamental deficiency is the lack of a mature pear rootstock breeding program, despite access to the USDAARS National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR), which holds a major worldwide collection of Pyrus and related genera. International breeding programs focus on increasing yield efficiency, but also graft compatibility, fruit quality and size, high soil pH tolerance, winter hardiness, warm climate/low chilling adaptation, drought and salt tolerance, and resistance to fire blight, pear decline, and <b>pear</b> <b>scab.</b> An intensive planning and implementation effort is needed to develop the necessary contacts, collaborations, explorations, and importation logistics to acquire the most promising clonal selections for propagation and testing.

[1 - 5] According to the European Food Safety Authority, pyrimethanil has no evident mutagenic, genotoxic or carcinogenic potential, but a short-term toxicity study on {{rats and mice}} has shown an increase in liver weight accompanied by changes in the histopathology of the liver and thyroid. [6] To avoid these side effects, the concentration of pyrimethanil has been limited by legislation. The European Commission set the Maximum Residue Level of pyrimethanil at 10 [*]mg/l in citrus fruits, 5 [*]mg/l in pome fruits, strawberries, table and wine grapes and 0. 05 [*]mg/l in tree nuts (EC/ 600 / 2010). [7] It is thus important to increase our knowledge regarding the concentration of pyrimethanil in environmental matrices, its degradability and the factors affecting it. One of these factors is the photo alteration by sunlight, which is known to {{play a significant role}} in the degradation of this compound, due to the prolonged half-life (77 [*]days approximately) of pyrimethanil in the environment. [8] Previous studies on the degradation of pyrimethanil were carried out mainly in a waste water treatment context and focused on the photo catalytic degradation using various salts as catalysts. Agüera et al. [9] used TiO 2, Vanni et al. [10] and Anfossi et al. [11] added iron III, Navarro et al. [12] added ZnO and Gomis et al. [13] used thiopyrylium. Irradiation was carried out using a mercury or xenon lamp or direct sunlight. These studies have showed that a long irradiation time (between 150 and 1400 [*]min, depending on the conditions and catalyst) is required for total disappearance of pyrimethanil. Degradation of pyrimethanil in water using the technique of photo-Fenton was investigated by Sirtori et al. They reported that the addition of sodium chloride accelerated the reaction and characterized four chlorinated photo-Fenton by-products. [14] The aim of the present study was the identification of UV-visible photo transformation products of pyrimethanil in water. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography coupled with multi stage mass spectrometry (GC-MSn) were used for analysis, with the aim of covering a large range of polarities for the detection of the potential transformation products. Elucidation of the structures of photoproducts was carried out performing high-resolution measurements and collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Photolysis mechanisms have also been proposed to explain the formation of photo products of pyrimethanil in water...|$|E
