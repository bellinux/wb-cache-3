40|$|Seven {{of eight}} {{plasmids}} of incompatibility group P {{were found to}} code for the capacity to propagate bacteriophage IKe in Escherichia coli. Six of the seven plasmids allowed <b>propagation</b> of IKe <b>by</b> one bacterial host (RG 172) but not by another (RG 176); the other plasmid allowed IKe <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> both hosts. IKe <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> a number of E. coli K- 12 strains was quite variable. IKeh, an extended host range mutant of IKe, was found to plaque specifically on N+ and P+ strains...|$|R

40|$|Malabar spinach is a non-conventional {{vegetable}} propagated {{mainly by}} seeds. This research evaluated the <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> stem cuttings {{as an alternative}} method of propagation and verified its effect on growth of the vegetable. Plantlets propagated by seeds and stem cuttings were grown in greenhouse and their growth were evaluated in five successive intervals of 21 days each, with the first evaluation carried out 60 days after the transplanting. The {{results showed that the}} propagation methods have influence on the Malabar spinach growth. Plants propagated by seeds display slow, but vigorous growth, with larger relative yield of leaves and tender leaves, while plants propagated by cuttings showed fast initial growth, with rapid fruit formation. Thus, the <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> cuttings is more suitable for seed production, while <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> seeds is more profitable for leaves production...|$|R

50|$|Propagation of {{this species}} may be {{vegetative}} or from seed. It is capable of vegetative <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> coppice regeneration and suckering from stumps or roots, as well as <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> rooted cuttings and grafting using scions from mature trees. This species is mainly found on shallow, stony and lateritic soils, often on hills, {{as well as in}} regions with an annual rainfall of 600-1000 mm. It is most common in wooded savannahs or savannahs, semi-cleared dry forest areas and fallows, growing in sandy or hard soils with high iron content.|$|R

50|$|For Australian gardens, Gahnia sieberiana {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a native replacement for pampas grass (Cortaderia selloana), which is a noxious weed there.

50|$|M. sandwicense can be {{cultivated}} using seeds {{separated from}} the fruit - the average germination time varies by reports but is most commonly noted as taking between six and eighteen months. <b>Propagation</b> <b>by</b> cuttings and air layering is also possible.|$|R
50|$|Most Sansevieria species seldom set seed, and {{commercial}} {{species such as}} Sansevieria trifasciata are typically grown using micropropagation.

50|$|P. ahipa plants must be {{propagated}} sexually, {{because the}} reproductive rate by cloning from tubers is very low. <b>Propagation</b> <b>by</b> seed is very advantageous, because {{transmission of viruses}} can be avoided and the storage of the propagation material is inexpensive.|$|R
50|$|Ring lasers are {{sometimes}} modified to allow only one direction of <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> placing a device {{into the ring}} which leads to different losses for different propagation directions. For instance, {{this could be a}} Faraday rotator combined with a polarizing element.|$|R
5|$|<b>Propagation</b> is <b>by</b> seed, {{but these}} are hard to obtain.

The plant should be grown in deep, acidic to neutral sand at a sheltered site. It is recommended to prune it when young, to encourage branching.|$|R
