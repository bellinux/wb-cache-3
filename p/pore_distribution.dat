Permeability and porosity are often specified by the <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution.</b> Knowing <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> along wellbore can greatly help us in determining perforating depth, mud, and cement type, etc. There are several experimental methods for determining <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> such as capillary pressure measurements, but these methods are time and cost consuming. The goal {{of this study is}} to analyze repeat formation tester (RFT) data to determine <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> profile along wellbore. By analyzing RFT data, reservoir pressure, fluids density, fluids contact, and capillary pressure were determined. Pore radiuses were calculated from capillary pressure, and <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> was determined from frequency analysis of pore radius.

After proper adjustment, the particle size, aggregate size, <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> curves and the water characteristic curves were drawn on the same graph for each soil. Comparisons between pore size and particle size, aggregate size, and water characteristics were then made. A linearly transformed logistic response function was used to evaluate the equation d[subscript pore]= R[subscript x]d[subscript x], where R [subscript x] is the ratio coefficient of pore diameter to the diameter of component x, x = particle, aggregate, pore from water characteristics. Soil aggregation was quantitively related to pore size in this study. The calculated R[subscript aggregate] values are from 0. 06 to 0. 18; R [subscript particle] values are 0. 87 to 3. 20; and R[subscript water] values are 0. 87 to 1. 75. The R [subscript aggregate] values are much more consistent than the R [subscript particle]. This suggests that the aggregate size may be a better index for predicting <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution,</b> especially for swelling and high clay content soils. For soils with non-swelling clay, low clay content, and low aggregation, the shape of the <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution,</b> particle size distribution, and aggregate size distribution curves and their density function curves are very similar. The predicted <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> curves fit the experimental curves very well. For soils with high swelling, high clay content and good structure, <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> and aggregate size distribution have a better relation than the pore size and particle size. Water characteristic curves and <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> curves did not coincide because of the different behaviors of particles and aggregates in water and in mercury. A systematic model was suggested to predict <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> from particle size or aggregate size. This model divides the <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> curve into six regions.

While filters {{are used for}} the main loop, components of the UPW system can contribute additional particle contamination into the water, and {{at the point of}} use, additional filtration is recommended. [...] The filters themselves must be constructed of ultraclean and robust materials, which do not contribute organics or cations/anions into the UPW, and must be integrity tested out of the factory to assure reliability and performance. Common materials include nylon, polyethylene, polysulfone, and fluoropolymers. Filters will commonly be constructed of a combination of polymers, and for UPW use are thermally welded without using adhesives or other contaminating additives. [...] The microporous structure of the filter is critical in providing particle control, and this structure can be isotropic or asymmetric. In the former case the <b>pore</b> <b>distribution</b> is uniform through the filter, while in the latter the finer surface provides the particle removal, with the coarser structure giving physical support as well reducing the overall differential pressure.|$|E

Here, we extend uncertainty methodologies from adsorption isotherm data uncertainty and apply them to calculate <b>pore</b> size <b>distributions</b> based on adsorption integral methods. The analyses consider as variables: uncertainty in adsorption isotherm data, regularization parameter, molecular potential model, {{and the number of}} single pore isotherms calculated with an associated quadrature interval. We demonstrate how the calculated <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> is quite insensitive to the uncertainty in experimental data, but in contrast, the uncertainty in the experimental data affects the calculated value of the optimized regularization parameter which, in turn, leads to considerable variation in the calculated <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution.</b> The calculated <b>pore</b> size <b>distribution</b> is also shown to be highly dependent on the potential model selected and on the number of single pore isotherms applied to the inversion process.

These carbons having a wide <b>pore</b> <b>distribution</b> ranges from micropores to macropores in conjunction with a random pore connection that facilitates the high specific-capacitance values. <b>Pore</b> <b>distribution</b> plays a central role in controlling the capacitance value of EDLCs, since electrolyte distribution inside the active material mainly depends on the <b>pore</b> <b>distribution.</b> This has a direct influence on the distribution of resistance and capacitance values within the electrode. As a result, preparation of electrodes remains a vital issue in realising high-performance EDLCs. Generally, carbon materials along with some binders are dispersed into a solvent and coated onto the current collectors. This study examines the role of binder solvents used for the carbon-ink preparation on the microstructure of the electrodes and the consequent performance of the EDLCs.

40|$|PURPOSE: Several {{phenomena}} in tablets indicate that an inhomogeneous <b>pore</b> <b>distribution</b> is formed during the compaction process. Examples are lamination and the capping of corners. In {{order to gain}} an understanding of the relation between structure and compact properties, analyzing the structure in a location dependent manner would be extremely useful. Our aim was to visualize and to quantitatively analyze the <b>pore</b> <b>distribution</b> in compacts. METHODS: This was done by embedding a cubic (sodium chloride) compact with polymer, allowing the compact to be cut without disrupting the structure. By doing so, it was possible to make scanning electron microscopic images from different angles at different locations in the compact. These images were made binary with a two-means cluster algorithm (Isodata) after which the porosity could be calculated. Counting the number of transitions from the pixels in the pores to the pixels in the sodium chloride particles in two perpendicular directions allows us to construct a measure for the anisotropic connectivity of the particles.
