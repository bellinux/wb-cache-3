40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research has investigated {{the management of the}} concept and schematic design stages with particular reference to brief development, the exchange of design and cost information between the client and designers, and the impact of early design decisions on construction. A critical review of current practice by both literature review and case study revealed that early stage design often failed to meet the expectation of clients leading to frequent redesign and inaccurate <b>cost</b> <b>advice.</b> Poor communication of information between all parties was primarily to blame. This led to the research combining the three elements, design, cost, and risk and developing a Scheme Design Process Model (SDPM) based on ADePT principles to provide designers {{for the first time the}} opportunity to: • Accurately and systematically, plan ahead for the work required during the scheme design stage. • Identify conflicts that lead to iterative problems. • Mitigate iterative problems by identifying and recording the design risks source. • Qualify the accuracy of the <b>cost</b> <b>advice</b> based on the progress of the design. • Ensure closer cross-disciplinary cooperation. • Reduce overall project timescale. The research identified that a generic programme of work can now be produced that includes all major elements for the multi-disciplinary design team. The research provides a contribution to the design-modelling database by introducing and demonstrating flexibility between design stages. In addition to the SDPM the research has also addressed accountability within the decision making process by demonstrating QFD techniques that can be applied at various stages of early design...|$|R

50|$|Dungeons & Dragons was not {{the only}} {{role-playing}} game to incorporate Lovecraftian horror. The most overt example was published in 1980 by Chaosium. Call of Cthulhu is directly based on the Cthulhu Mythos. In keeping with its source material, and unlike most other role-playing games, characters who attempt to confront its monsters directly are likely to die or be driven insane rather than succeed. This is reinforced by the game's best-known feature, a mechanism by which knowledge about Mythos entities can only be gained at a <b>permanent</b> <b>cost</b> to one's sanity. The Call of Cthulhu rules and source material have been adapted and included in a number of subsequent science fiction and fantasy role-playing games and rules supplements.|$|R

We have examined a resistance mechanism in Staphylococcus aureus that negates these costs. Exposure to gentamicin both in vitro and in vivo has been reported to result in the emergence of a gentamicin-resistant small colony variant (SCV) [3 – 8]. We show that the emergence of SCVs following exposure to gentamicin results from a rapid switch and that bacteria exposed to cycles of gentamicin followed by antibiotic-free medium repeatedly switched between a resistant SCV and a sensitive parental phenotype (revertants). The fitness of revertants relative to S. aureus with stable gentamicin resistance was greater in drug-free media, which suggests that S. aureus has evolved an inducible and reversible resistance mechanism that circumvents a <b>permanent</b> <b>cost</b> to fitness...|$|R

Yet, such discounting varies according to several factors. This paper isolates one of these factors: the <b>cost</b> of <b>advice.</b> Specifically, three experiments investigate whether the <b>cost</b> of <b>advice,</b> independent of its quality, affects how people use advice. The studies use the Judge-Advisor System (JAS) to investigate whether people value advice from others more when it costs money than when it is free, and examine the psychological processes that could account for this effect. The results show that people use paid advice significantly more than free advice and suggest that this effect is due to the same forces that have been documented in the literature to explain the sunk costs fallacy. Implications for circumstances under which people value others' opinions are discussed. Advice taking Judge-Advisor System Sunk costs Paid-advice effect Information use...|$|R
40|$|Providing sound <b>advice</b> on {{construction}} <b>costs</b> across national boundaries requires special care. It is seldom sufficient {{to look up}} a suitable cost/m 2 rate in a price book and then apply the current exchange rate. There are three main issues here: one relates to {{the reliability of the}} price data, another to differences in design in different places and the third to the method used to bring costs in different currencies to a common base. Different sources of cost data can suggest very different rates and money market exchange rates provide nothing more than a snapshot of relative prices at one point in time. Using different base costs and fluctuating exchange rates can produce very different results depending on the source of cost data and what is happening on global money markets.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on building pre-tender cost estimating {{stresses the importance}} of giving accurate estimates and minimizing estimating errors. Cost models, especially those mathematical models using mean square error or the like for model training and validation, often treat positive errors (overestimates) and negative errors (underestimates) of equal magnitude the same with an implicit assumption that the regret or disutility of positive errors (overestimates) is equal to that of negative errors (underestimates). A survey was conducted in Hong Kong to study estimating practice and in particular, the attitude of clients and estimators towards estimating errors. This involved the use of regression analysis to model the relative disutility of underestimates (in terms of overestimates) for four different building types. Both clients and estimators are found to be risk averse—tolerating overestimates more than underestimates—and, arguably, clients are satisfied with overestimates. However, they have contrasting views on the desired characteristics of estimates with clients considering the ability to identify cost sensitive elements to be more important than accuracy. In this regard, the formalization of value analysis as part of the <b>cost</b> <b>advice</b> function under typical cost consulting agreements should be the best form of improvement.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{monetary authorities}} should aim for low inflation or price stability. It first outlines and assesses {{many of the}} costs of inflation. Some of these, such as the distortionary effect upon the tax system, have been shown to involve significant welfare costs, even at very low inflation rates. When a variety of estimates of the transitional costs of moving to price stability are set against the permanent benefits of getting there, the evidence strongly favours the objective of stable prices. Some commentators argue, however, that there may be <b>permanent</b> <b>costs</b> associated with price stability, such as higher equilibrium rates of unemployment and less effective monetary policy. These arguments are not short of their critics, however, who suggest that such costs either do not exist, or are likely to be unimportant in practice. Overall, it is not possible, given the current state of economic knowledge, to arrive at a definite value for the optimal rate of inflation, although the evidence reviewed in this paper suggests that price stability may be optimal. ...|$|R

Controlling for the transitory effects, we find that the cost of capital gains to overseas listings are more modest than those reported in earlier studies: the average cost of capital decline is 2. 5 percentage points for the entire sample of cross-listings. We find that although gains from increasing the size of the investor pool, liquidity, disclosure, and shareholder protection maintain some role, firms generate the greatest cost of capital gain when listing in markets with which there is large cross product market trade. The evidence emphasizes the importance of investor familiarity and information in cross-listing behavior. JEL classification: G 15; G 32...|$|R

40|$|AbstractQuantity {{surveying}} is {{global and}} provides services across various industries. Quantity surveyors {{are involved in}} all phases of a facility's lifecycle such as feasibility, design, construction, extension, refurbishment, maintenance, and demolition. The competencies of quantity surveyors are aimed at producing constructions that meet the client's value system. Building engineering services are part of buildings, but quantity surveyors’ involvements in procurement are limited. Therefore, this study examines the kinds of services that quantity surveyors play in the procurement of building services. Primary data is collected through a survey questionnaire. The results of the findings led {{to the conclusion that}} quantity surveyors were actively involved in the procurement of building services. <b>Cost</b> <b>advice</b> during construction is the most offered service while advice on the impact of building engineering services on environment is seldom offered.

40|$|In the {{emerging}} field of industrial ecology {{one of the}} unsettled questions {{is the degree to}} which design for the environment, closing energy and materials loops, and other industrial ecology concepts apply at the firm level. In this article we examine this issue with a particular focus on whether industrial ecology can guide company strategy and efforts to enhance competitiveness. We conclude that industrial ecology thinking will often be useful for firms seeking to improve their resource productivity and thus their competitiveness. The systems perspective that industrial ecology promotes can help companies find ways to add value or reduce costs both within their own production processes and up and down the supply chain. But industrial ecology cannot always be counted upon to yield competitive advantage at the firm level. In some cases, the cost of closing loops will exceed the benefits. In other cases, regulatory requirements do not fully internalize environmental costs, and thus polluting firms may gain temporary or <b>permanent</b> <b>cost</b> advantages relative to companies that attempt to eliminate all emissions. Finally, because industrial ecology focuses attention on materials and energy flows, it may not optimize other variables that contribute to competitiveness within the corporate setting...|$|R
