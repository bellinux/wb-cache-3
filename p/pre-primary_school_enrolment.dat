The practical part focuses on significant difficulties in establishing and running private <b>pre-primary</b> <b>schools</b> compared to public ones as well as their advantages.

40|$|The Uganda language-in-{{education}} {{policy is}} silent about <b>pre-primary</b> <b>schooling.</b> This {{level of education}} is largely {{in the hands of}} private individuals who, because of wide-spread misconceptions about learning and acquiring English in Uganda (as in many other African countries), instruct <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> learners in English. This article demonstrates how this omission in language-in-education policy is creating competition between rural government and private schools regarding the teaching of English and the development of initial literacy. The absence of an official language policy for <b>pre-primary</b> <b>schooling</b> has also dichotomised the implementation of mother tongue education in rural areas. The policy allows rural primary schools to use mother tongue as language of learning and teaching in the first three school grades. However, whereas private schools instruct through English only, government schools to a large extent adhere to the policy, albeit with undesirable consequences. The practical implications of lack of a language-in-education policy for and minimal government involvement in <b>pre-primary</b> <b>schooling</b> are discussed in this article...|$|R

40|$|Knowing {{that the}} time {{in which we live}} in is based on the changes and {{expectations}} that educational institutions always keep in step with the changes, led me to investigate the effects of professional education of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> teacher as well as motives and strategies of implementing those changes into pedagogic practice in the light of their professional development. Increasingly, we can perceive professional challenges brought about by competition between children, educational institutions, parents, enforcement of market mechanisms, financial reorganization, etc. Pedagogic workers should therefore always follow the trends and innovations in the field of work methods, approaches, programmes, etc. They should cope with the diversity among children (multiculturalism, individual differences in perception, integration of children with special needs). The mentioned elements require a high degree of professionalism from <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> teacher, in-depth personal reflection, as well as knowledge of appropriate approaches, methods and forms of work. The study, which I conducted, included 180 <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> teacher, assistant <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> teacher, <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> teacher who provide professional help, first grade teachers, and some pedagogic workers who are not included in the aforementioned terms and have been selected randomly. Research questions have been divided into 4 parts, namely the frequency of implementing changes, factors of support, fields of implementing changes - 6 curriculum areas (language, movement, nature, social science, mathematics, art), area of conflict resolution, integration of pedagogic workers, active learning, ICT, cooperation with parents, health care and children with special needs, communication, sharing of information, and education of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> teachers in connection with the implementation of changes into pedagogic practice.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on a preschool-aged {{children}} and on possibilities of their personality and social development through the educational project in preschool education. The first, theoretical part, deals {{with the process of}} socialization which is broadly developing after the start of preschool education. It also presents pieces of information about educational process in <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> related to the importance of the process of socialization in educational practice as well as in relation to contemporary personality approach and comprehensive integrated approach in preschool education. The main focus remains on the possibilities of educational projects in this area. The second, practical part, explores via observation and questionaire methods the personality expressions of children in social interaction and relationships between children. But first and foremost it verifies the benefits of educational projecting for the possibility of intentional work on personality and social development of children in <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school.</b> KEY WORDS socialization, personality of a preschool child, <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school,</b> preschool education, personality model of preschool education, <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> teacher, educational projec...|$|R

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} {{on the impact of}} a large construction of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> facilities in Argentina. We estimate the causal impact of the program on <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> attendance and maternal labor supply. Identification relies on a differences-in-differences strategy where we combine differences across regions in the number of facilities built with differences in exposure across cohorts induced by the timing of the program. We find a sizeable impact of the program on <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> participation among children aged between 3 and 5. In fact, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of a full take-up of newly constructed places. In addition, we find that the childcare subsidy induced by the program increases maternal employment and that this effect is in line with the one previously found for the US. ...|$|R

40|$|Research Findings: The {{present study}} {{concerns}} children's behavioral adjustment {{in the context}} of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>schools</b> in Tanzania. Twenty teachers and 320 children from 20 <b>pre-primary</b> <b>schools</b> participated in the study. Teacher-child relationships, children's behavioral adjustment, and teachers' cultural beliefs were reported by teachers; classroom emotional support was measured through classroom observation. The multilevel findings revealed that high-quality teacher-child relationships and high-quality teacher sensitivity were related to children's prosocial behavioral adjustment. In contrast, observed low-quality teacher-child relationships and low-quality teacher sensitivity were found to be related to children's aggression and anxiety. In addition, teachers' cultural beliefs, concerning play in particular, were found to be related to children's anxiety. The findings support the ecological theory regarding the importance of child characteristics and classroom context in shaping a child's behavioral adjustment in schools. Practice or Policy: The results have implications for <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> teachers in Tanzania, to consider their relationships with children and their sensitivity to children as important aspects for children's behavioral adjustment in schools. They also inform policymakers about the role of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> teachers in the country. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
