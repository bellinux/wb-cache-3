25|$|This {{classification}} {{refers to}} the position of the N- and C-terminal domains. Types I, II, and III are single-pass molecules, while type IV are multiple-pass molecules. Type I transmembrane proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen during synthesis (and the extracellular space, if mature forms are located on <b>plasmalemma).</b> Type II and III are anchored with a signal-anchor sequence, with type II being targeted to the ER lumen with its C-terminal domain, while type III have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen. Type IV is subdivided into IV-A, with their N-terminal domains targeted to the cytosol and IV-B, with an N-terminal domain targeted to the lumen. The implications for the division in the four types are especially manifest at the time of translocation and ER-bound translation, when the protein has to be passed through the ER membrane in a direction dependent on the type.|$|E

50|$|Primordial embryo. All {{the genetic}} {{material}} {{necessary for a}} new individual, along with some redundant chromosomes, are present within a single <b>plasmalemma.</b> Penetration of the fertilising sperm allows the oocyte to resume meiosis and the polar body is extruded.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The cell {{membrane}}, {{also called}} the plasma membrane or <b>plasmalemma,</b> is a semipermeable lipid bilayer common to all living cells.

50|$|Paramural {{bodies are}} {{membranous}} or vesicular structures located between the cell walls and cell membranes {{of plant and}} fungal cells. When these are continuous with the cell wall, they are termed lomasomes, while they {{are referred to as}} plasmalemmasomes if associated with the <b>plasmalemma.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Hypolemmal cisternae {{is found}} within a {{perikaryon}} (cell body (soma) of a neuron {{not including the}} nucleus) and is the SER that extends into the dendrites and axon. Hypolemmal cisternae is found directly beneath the <b>plasmalemma</b> and is continuous with the RER of the soma. Its function is unclear.|$|E

These morphologic changes, {{referred to as}} Schüffner's dots, are important {{in the identification of}} this species of malarial parasite and have been associated by electron microscopy with caveolavesicle complexes along the erythrocyte <b>plasmalemma.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two {{theories}} {{explain the}} long time {{of action for}} LABAs. The first explained the long action {{in terms of a}} putative “exosite” or “exoceptor” distinct from the β2-adrenoreceptor that long aliphatic tail of salmeterol binds to with high affinity. This allows the active saligenin head to angle on and off the receptor to activate it repeatedly. Formoterol does not have a long side chain like salmeterol to bind to the “exosite”, so this theory has been questioned. In 1994 Anderson. et al. introduced the <b>plasmalemma</b> diffusion microkinetic theory, explaining what happens to the β2- agonist in the cell membrane lipid bilayer and in the aqueous biophase closest to the binding site of the β2-adrenoceptor. It is postulated that the <b>plasmalemma</b> lipid bilayer of airway smooth muscles acts as a depot for β2-adrenoceptor agonists. β2-adrenoceptor agonists remain available to interact with the β2-adrenoceptor active site after having partitioned into the lipid bilayer.|$|E
50|$|Proton (H+ ion) {{stress can}} also limit plant growth. The proton pump, H+-ATPase, of the <b>plasmalemma</b> of root cells works to {{maintain}} the near-neutral pH of their cytoplasm. A high proton activity (pH within the range 3.0-4.0 for most plant species) in the external growth medium overcomes {{the capacity of the}} cell {{to maintain the}} cytoplasmic pH and growth shuts down.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} organelles of the mastigote {{are essentially}} the same as described in the coccoid cell (see below). The transition from mastigote to coccoid stage in Symbiodinium occurs rapidly, but details about cellular changes are unknown. Mucocysts (an ejectile organelle) located beneath the <b>plasmalemma</b> are found in S. pilosum and their function is unknown, but may be involved in heterotrophic feeding.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasite}} begins development {{within the}} host’s muscles as a merogonial plasmodia. The process of sporogony {{occurs when the}} amorous coat separates from the <b>plasmalemma.</b> A merontogenic sporophorous vesicle is then formed around the sporont The sporonts then proceed the developmental process by transforming into sporoblasts. The process transitioning from a sporont to sporoblast is known as morphogenesis. The final product {{of the life cycle}} yields a mature sporoblast complete with organelles.|$|E
50|$|Enid MacRobbie {{characterized}} Roger Spanswick’s scientific legacy as follows: Roger {{made major}} contributions {{to our understanding}} of basic ion transport processes in plants, and was a true pioneer. He was both a very original thinker and a very versatile, thorough and careful experimentalist. He initiated a revolution in our understanding of ion transport in plant cells. His demonstration (in 1972) that the most important transport system in the <b>plasmalemma</b> of Characean cells is a proton-pumping ATPase, generating membrane potentials well negative of the potassium equilibrium potential, was a major advance… Previously plant physiologists had assumed that plant cells were like animal cells, with an ATP-dependent sodium-potassium exchange pump as the major process of active ion transport. There was opposition to this new view, but by the time of his review in the 1981 Annual Reviews of Plant Physiology further experimental work {{made it clear that he}} was right. In the period of the 1970s and 1980s he continued to make major contributions to the new thinking. He showed that two distinct proton pumping ATPases were present in <b>plasmalemma</b> and tonoplast, with different inhibitor characteristics. He also showed that the gradients of pH and membrane potential generated by the primary proton pump in the <b>plasmalemma</b> could be used to drive secondary active transport of other solutes, sugars, amino acids and other ions. Thus his original idea led to a very large volume of experimental work, in which he also had a major input, and the consequence was a revolution in the field. He later went on to work successfully on more applied problems over a wide range of topics, but it is important to recognize the lasting legacy of his work in the field of basic ion transport.|$|E
50|$|In {{a famous}} 1967 paper - The Renewal of Photoreceptor Cell Outer Segments - Professor Richard Young {{described}} his observations that new discs are assembled {{at the base}} of the outer segment - the ciliary <b>plasmalemma</b> - by incorporating proteins and lipids that are synthesized and transported from the inner segment. Discs mature along with their distal migration; aged discs shed at the distal tip and are engulfed by the neighboring retinal pigment epithelial cells for degradation.|$|E
5000|$|The cell {{membrane}} (or plasma membrane or <b>plasmalemma)</b> surrounds the cytoplasm of living cells, physically separating the intracellular components from the extracellular environment. The {{cell membrane}} {{also plays a}} role in anchoring the cytoskeleton to provide shape to the cell, and in attaching to the extracellular matrix and other cells to hold them together to form tissues. Fungi, bacteria, most archaea, and plants also have a cell wall, which provides a mechanical support to the cell and precludes the passage of larger molecules.|$|E
50|$|During fasting, some GLUT4 {{transporters}} will {{be expressed}} {{at the surface}} of the cell. However, most will be found in cytoplasmic vesicles within the cell. After a meal and at the binding of insulin (released from the islets of Langerhans) to receptors on the cell surface, a signalling cascade begins by activating phosphatidylinositolkinase activity which culminates in the movement of the cytoplasmic vesicles toward the cell surface membrane. Upon reaching the <b>plasmalemma,</b> the vesicles fuse with the membrane, increasing the number of GLUT4 transporters expressed at the cell surface, and hence increasing glucose uptake.|$|E
50|$|Standard reuptake inhibitors are {{believed}} to act simply as competitive substrates that work by binding directly to the <b>plasmalemma</b> transporter of the neurotransmitter in question. They occupy the transporter {{in place of the}} respective neurotransmitter and competitively block it from being transported from the nerve terminal or synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron. With high enough doses, occupation becomes as much as 80-90%. At this level of inhibition, the transporter will be considerably less efficient at removing excess neurotransmitter from the synapse and this causes a substantial increase in the extracellular concentrations of the neurotransmitter and therefore an increase in overall neurotransmission.|$|E
50|$|A nonfunctioning {{centriole}} lies {{adjacent to}} the kinetosome. Nine interconnected props attach the kinetosome to the <b>plasmalemma,</b> and a terminal plate {{is present in the}} transitional zone. An inner ring-like structure attached to the tubules of the flagellar doublets within the transitional zone has been observed in transverse section. No roots associated with the kinetosome have been observed. In many zoospores, the nucleus lies partially within the aggregation of ribosomes and was invariably situated laterally. Small vacuoles and a Golgi body with stacked cisternae occurred within the cytoplasm outside the ribosomal area. Mitochondria, which often contain a small number of ribosomes, are densely staining with discoidal cristae.|$|E
50|$|Atractylodes lancea is a {{medicinal}} herb that grows in central China. A. strictum {{acts as a}} fungal endophyte and interacts with A. lancea in drought conditions and confers tolerance in moderate drought. Under mild drought conditions, A. strictum enhanced leaf soluble sugars, proteins, proline and antioxidant enzyme activity, which decreased the degree of <b>plasmalemma</b> oxidation. This increased A. lancea abscisic acid level and root:shoot ratio. While A. strictum may alleviate {{the effects of a}} mild to moderate drought, benefits of this endophytic relationship are constrained by drought degree, as there were no significant effects of A. strictum on A. lancea during periods of regular watering or severe drought.|$|E
50|$|Producing {{membrane}} vesicles {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to investigate various membranes of the cell. After the living tissue is crushed into suspension, various membranes form tiny closed bubbles. Big fragments of the crushed cells can be discarded by low-speed centrifugation and later the fraction of the known origin (<b>plasmalemma,</b> tonoplast, etc.) can be isolated by precise high-speed centrifugation in the density gradient. Using osmotic shock, it is possible temporarily open vesicles (filling them with the required solution) and then centrifugate down again and resuspend in a different solution. Applying ionophores like valinomycin can create electrochemical gradients comparable to the gradients inside living cells.|$|E
50|$|The cytoplasmic sleeve is a fluid-filled space {{enclosed}} by the <b>plasmalemma</b> {{and is a}} continuous extension of the cytosol. Trafficking of molecules and ions through plasmodesmata occurs through this space. Smaller molecules (e.g. sugars and amino acids) and ions can easily pass through plasmodesmata by diffusion {{without the need for}} additional chemical energy. Larger molecules, including proteins (for example green fluorescent protein) and RNA, can also pass through the cytoplasmic sleeve diffusively. Plasmodesmatal transport of some larger molecules is facilitated by mechanisms that are currently unknown. One mechanism of regulation of the permeability of plasmodesmata is the accumulation of the polysaccharide callose around the neck region to form a collar, thereby reducing the diameter of the pore available for transport of substances.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two general}} classes of {{glutamate}} transporters, {{those that are}} dependent on an electrochemical gradient of sodium ions (the EAATs) {{and those that are}} not (VGLUTs and xCT). The cystine-glutamate antiporter (xCT) is localised to the plasma membrane of cells whilst vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are found in the membrane of glutamate-containing synaptic vesicles. Na+-dependent EAATs are also dependent on transmembrane K+ and H+concentration gradients, and so are also known as 'sodium and potassium coupled glutamate transporters'. Na+-dependent transporters have also been called 'high-affinity glutamate transporters', though their glutamate affinity actually varies widely. EAATs are antiporters which carry one molecule of glutamate in along with three Na+ and one H+, while export one K+. EAATs are transmembrane integral proteins which traverse the <b>plasmalemma</b> 8 times.|$|E
50|$|The cell's membrane, or <b>plasmalemma,</b> {{is loose}} and {{extremely}} plastic, allowing the organism to change shape from one moment to the next. The cytoplasm within the membrane is conventionally {{described as having}} two parts: the internal fluid, or endoplasm, which contains loose granules and food vacuoles, as well as organelles such as nuclei and mitochondria; and a more viscous ectoplasm {{around the perimeter of}} the cell, which is relatively clear and contains no conspicuous granules. Like other lobose amoebae, Chaos move by extending pseudopodia. As a new pseudopod is extended, a variable zone of ectoplasm forms at the leading edge and a fountaining stream of endoplasm circulates within. The effort of describing these motions, and explaining how they result in the cell's forward movement, has generated a large body of scientific literature.|$|E
5000|$|The coccoid cell is {{surrounded}} by a cellulosic, usually smooth cell wall that contains large-molecular-weight proteins and glycoproteins. [...] Cell walls grow thicker in culture than in hospite (Fig 11B). The cell membrane (<b>plasmalemma)</b> is located beneath the cell wall yet little is known about its composition and function in terms of the regulation of trans-membrane transport of metabolites. During karyokinesis and cytokinesis, the cell wall remains intact until the mastigotes escape the mother cell. In culture, the discarded walls accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} culture vessel. It is not known what becomes of the walls from divided cells in hospite. One species, S. pilosum, possesses tufts of hair-like projections from the cell wall; this is the only known surface characteristic used to diagnose a species in the genus.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, small {{necrotic}} spots (without exudate) {{appear on}} stems and branches. These necrotic lesions then enlarge in stretched, perennial cankers on the branches, wilting, premature shedding {{of leaves and}} particularly in the death of the top of the crown. [...] Below the bark, necrotic lesions frequently extend to the xylem, especially in the axial and paratracheal ray tissue. [...] The mycelium can pass through the simple pits, perforating the middle lamella but damage to either the <b>plasmalemma</b> or cell walls was not observed. [...] The disease is often chronic but can be lethal. [...] It is particularly destructive of young ash plants, killing them within one growing season of symptoms becoming visible. Older trees can survive initial attacks, but tend to succumb eventually after several seasons of infection.|$|E
5000|$|This {{disruption}} of muscle fibers triggers {{white blood cells}} to increase following induced muscle soreness, leading to the inflammatory response observation from induced muscle soreness. Elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure are concluded {{to be associated with}} inflammatory response. High tension in the contractile-elastic system of muscle results in structural damage to the muscle fiber and <b>plasmalemma</b> and its epimysium, perimysium, and/or endomysium. The mysium damage disrupts calcium homeostasis in injured fibers and fiber bundles, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 48 hours after exercise. The products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents (such as histamines, kinins, and K+) accumulate outside cells. These substances then stimulate free nerve endings in the muscle; a process that appears accentuated by eccentric exercise, in which large forces are distributed over a relatively small cross-sectional area of the muscle [...]|$|E
5000|$|Symbiodinium {{are known}} {{primarily}} for {{their role as}} mutualistic endosymbionts. In hosts, they usually occur in high densities, ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions per square centimeter. The successful culturing of swimming gymnodinioid cells from coral led to the discovery that [...] "zooxanthellae" [...] were actually dinoflagellates. Each Symbiodinium cell is coccoid in hospite (living in a host cell) and surrounded by a membrane that originates from the host cell <b>plasmalemma</b> during phagocytosis (Figures 2B and 3). This membrane probably undergoes some modification to its protein content, which functions to limit or prevent phago-lysosome fusion. The vacuole structure containing the symbiont is therefore termed the symbiosome. A single symbiont cell occupies each symbiosome. It is unclear how this membrane expands to accommodate a dividing symbiont cell. Under normal conditions, symbiont and host cells exchange organic and inorganic molecules that enable the growth and proliferation of both partners.|$|E

5000|$|Liposomes {{were first}} {{described}} by British haematologist Alec D Bangham in 1961 (published 1964), at the Babraham Institute, in Cambridge. They were discovered when Bangham and R. W. Horne were testing the institute's new electron microscope by adding negative stain to dry phospholipids. The {{resemblance to the}} <b>plasmalemma</b> was obvious, and the microscope pictures served as the first evidence for the cell membrane being a bilayer lipid structure. Their integrity as a closed, bilayer structure, that could release its contents after detergent treatment (structure-linked latency) was established by Bangham, Standish and Weissmann in the next year. Weissmann - during a Cambridge pub discussion with Bangham - first named the structures [...] "liposomes" [...] after the lysosome, which his laboratory had been studying: a simple organelle the structure-linked latency {{of which could be}} disrupted by detergents and streptolysins. Liposomes can be easily distinguished from micelles and hexagonal lipid phases by negative staining transmission electron microscopy.|$|E
5000|$|Franzini-Armstrong’s {{primarily}} {{interest in}} science has been the disposition of membranes and macromolecular complexes {{that are responsible for}} excitation-contraction (e-c) coupling in cardiac and skeletal muscles. [...] She engaged in four main phases of structural work in terms of her career. Her first phase focused on calcium cycling and, especially, on defining the distribution and nature of the two membrane systems involved in this specific type of cycling. Franzini-Armstrong’s second phase discovered the location of the channels that release calcium during muscle activation. She also demonstrated that in muscles that are able to engage in high activity rates, a limiting factor is the density of the pump protein and not the density of calcium release channels. [...] Furthermore, the third phase of Franzini-Armstrong’s structural work recognized the relationship between the L type calcium channels of <b>plasmalemma</b> and T tubules in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Specifically, she worked with CaV channels or dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) and the calcium release channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (RyRs). [...] Her fourth phase which continues to be her current interest is the supramolecular complex that enables a number of molecules located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum that regulate calcium release to interact with one another. In her current work, Franzini-Armstrong continues to utilize structural approaches in order to better comprehend the different interactions between molecules.|$|E
