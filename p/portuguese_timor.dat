5|$|Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> (later East Timor). Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E
25|$|He was {{actively}} involved in the development of political awareness in <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor,</b> which caused him to be exiled for two years in 1970–71 to Portuguese East Africa. His grandfather, before him, had also been exiled, from Portugal to the Azores Islands, then Cape Verde, Portuguese Guinea and finally to <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor.</b>|$|E

Likewise, Brazil, alongside the Japanese American population of the United States, maintains its status as home to the largest Japanese community outside Japan.|$|R
25|$|Up to this point, the {{government}} of Portugal had declined to co-operate with the Allies, relying on its claim of neutrality and plans to send an 800-strong force from Mozambique to defend the territory {{in the event of}} any Japanese invasion. However, this refusal left the Allied flank severely exposed, and a 400-man combined Dutch-Australian force subsequently occupied <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> on 17 December. In response, the Portuguese Prime-Minister, António de Oliveira Salazar, protested to the Allied governments, while the governor of <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> declared himself a prisoner in order to preserve the appearance of neutrality. No resistance was offered by the small Portuguese garrison; however, and the local authorities tacitly co-operated, while the population itself generally welcomed the Allied force. Most of the Dutch troops and the whole of the 2/2nd Independent Company were subsequently transferred to <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> and distributed in small detachments around the territory.|$|E

50|$|For the <b>Portuguese,</b> East <b>Timor</b> {{remained}} {{little more}} than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century. Investment in infrastructure, health, and education was minimal. Sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. In places where Portuguese rule was asserted, it tended to be brutal and exploitative.|$|R

25|$|In 1897 {{the ship}} was {{deployed}} to the Moroccan coast, along with Spanish vessels and the Portuguese ironclad Vasco da Gama, to hunt pirates. Around 1908 she visited <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> and stopped in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of 19/20 February, the Imperial Japanese Army's 228th Regimental Group, began landing in <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor.</b> The first contact was at Dili, the capital of <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor,</b> where the Allies were caught by surprise. Nevertheless, they were well-prepared and after inflicting heavy {{casualties}} on the troops attacking the airfield, the garrison destroyed the airfield and began an orderly retreat towards the mountainous interior and the south coast. On the same night, Allied forces in West Timor were under extremely intense air attacks, which had already caused the RAAF force to be withdrawn to Australia. Sparrow Force HQ was immediately moved further east, to its supply base at Champlong, and soon lost contact with the 2/40th.|$|E

25|$|East of Solor, on {{the island}} of Timor, Dutch {{advances}} were halted by an autonomous and powerful group of Portuguese Eurasians called the Topasses. They remained in control of the Sandalwood trade and their resistance lasted throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, causing <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> to remain under the Portuguese sphere of control.|$|E

40|$|When the <b>Portuguese</b> left East <b>Timor</b> in 1975 after 450 years, {{the country}} was annexed by Indonesia. The East Timorese wanted their {{independence}} and a resistance movement grew, which operated from the rugged, mountainous interior of the country. As a result of pressure from the United Nations, a referendum was held in 1999, in which the East Timorese voted for independence...|$|R
50|$|For {{almost a}} century after this event, Amarasi {{remained}} a Portuguese vassal, {{during much of the}} time fighting the Timorese clients of the VOC in the Kupang area in westernmost Timor. This was a low-scale warfare that took the form of headhunting raids. Amarasi was in fact counted as one of the principal props of <b>Portuguese</b> authority on <b>Timor</b> in this era.|$|R
25|$|The pataca was {{introduced}} in Portuguese Macau and <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> in the year 1894, but only as a unit of account. The unit initially corresponded to the Mexican dollar, and it replaced the Portuguese real {{at a rate of}} 1 pataca = 450 reais. The name pataca derives {{from the fact that the}} Portuguese always referred to the Mexican dollar as the pataca mexicana.|$|E
25|$|Of the Snake-class {{boats that}} saw service, {{at least three}} were used to deploy Z {{operatives}} with Hoehn military folboats in enemy occupied areas for reconnaissance or small scale raids. HMAS Riversnake went to <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor,</b> to deploy SUNCHARLIE operatives. HMAS Blacksnake deployed GIRAFFE and SWIFT operatives in the Celebes and HMAS Tigersnake sailed out of Sarawak to set down operatives of SEMUT IVB.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, {{the island}} of Timor was divided into two territories under {{different}} colonial powers: <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> and West Timor part of the Dutch East Indies. The Australian and Dutch governments agreed that, {{in the event of}} Japan entering World War II, Australia would provide forces to reinforce West Timor. Consequently, a 1,400-strong detachment, known as the Sparrow Force, and centred on the 2/40th Battalion, arrived at Kupang on 12 December 1941.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, LHT {{traffic was}} {{introduced}} by the British in Atlantic Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the East Africa Protectorate, British India, Southern Rhodesia and the Cape Colony (now Zimbabwe and South Africa), British Malaya (now Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore), British Guiana, and British Hong Kong. LHT was also introduced by the Portuguese Empire in Portuguese Macau, Colonial Brazil, East <b>Timor,</b> <b>Portuguese</b> Mozambique, and Angola.|$|R
5000|$|East Timor has an {{embassy in}} Lisbon whilst Portugal has an embassy in Dili. East Timor was {{a colony of}} Portugal for over 400 years.

50|$|Colonialism {{and trade}} brought the Romance {{languages}} to many coastal areas and islands in Asia, {{but today the}} only places with official Romance languages in the continent are limited to East <b>Timor</b> (<b>Portuguese),</b> Macau (Portuguese), the Philippines (Spanish), Puducherry (French), and administrative status in Cambodia (French), Laos (French), Vietnam (French), and Lebanon (French), and yet in those places they compete with numerically stronger languages.|$|R
25|$|Of mestiço ethnicity, Ramos-Horta {{was born}} in 1949 in Dili, capital of East Timor, to a Timorese mother and a Portuguese father who had been exiled to what was then <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> by the Salazar dictatorship. He was educated in a Catholic mission in the small village of Soibada, later chosen by Fretilin as {{headquarters}} after the Indonesian invasion. Of his eleven brothers and sisters, four {{were killed by the}} Indonesian military.|$|E
25|$|There {{was already}} a {{relatively}} large and vibrant Hakka community in East Timor before the 1975 Indonesian invasion. According to an estimate by the local Chinese Timorese association, the Hakka population of <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor</b> in 1975 {{was estimated to be}} around 25,000 (including a small minority of other Chinese ethnicities from Macau, which like East Timor was a Portuguese colony). According to a book source, an estimated 700 Hakka were killed within the first week of invasion in Dili alone. No clear numbers had been recorded since many Hakka had already escaped to neighbouring Australia. The recent re-establishment of Hakka associations in the country registered approximately 2,400 Hakka remaining, organised into some 400 families, including part-Timorese ones.|$|E
25|$|No. 31 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAAF Base Wagga on 14 August 1942 and was {{equipped}} with Bristol Beaufighter fighter and attack aircraft, {{the first of which}} was received on 23 August 1942. Under the command of Squadron Leader Charles Frederick Read, who later went on to serve as Chief of the Air Staff, the squadron undertook a period of training before deploying to Batchelor Airfield, Northern Territory, in October, the aircraft flying via Alice Springs. A period of more intense training followed and familiarisation flights were carried out before moving to its operational base at Coomalie Creek Airfield on 12 November and then began flying combat operations on 17 November, attacking targets in <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Timor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For the <b>Portuguese,</b> East <b>Timor</b> {{remained}} {{little more}} than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century. Investment in infrastructure, health, and education was minimal. The island was seen as a way to exile those who the government in Lisbon saw as [...] "problems" [...] - these included political prisoners as well as ordinary criminals. Portuguese ruled through a traditional system of liurai (local chiefs). Sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. In places where Portuguese rule was asserted, it tended to be brutal and exploitative. At {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies.|$|R
50|$|The {{judicial}} system {{suffers from a}} lack of staffing and resources, thus even though the law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, incarceration may occur because judges are unavailable, and there are long delays until people are heard at trial. There are also significant comprehension difficulties as although Tetum and Portuguese are both official languages of East <b>Timor,</b> <b>Portuguese</b> is the main legal language, which most of the population does not speak.|$|R
5000|$|After Portugal entered World War I in March 1916, {{several of}} its colonies issued war tax stamps as well. Most of these were {{produced}} by overprinting [...] "TAXA DE GUERRA" [...] on existing stamps, though Mozambique issued a set of two which depicted allegorical figures of History and the Republic. [...] The Portuguese colonies of Macao, Mozambique, Portuguese Africa, Portuguese Guinea, <b>Portuguese</b> India and <b>Timor</b> issued war tax stamps.|$|R
