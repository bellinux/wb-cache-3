These deficiencies in immunization {{education and training}} may contribute to low immunization rates for some groups of people, particularly hard-to-reach consumers and those with misconceptions about vaccinations. In this paper, we call upon all <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> to mandate immunization education and training as part of their core curricula, not just as an elective course. In doing so, we encourage <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> to adopt the Pharmacy-Based Immunization Delivery program developed by the American Pharmacists Association.

40|$|At present, {{graduates}} of international <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> {{can apply to}} take the Korean Pharmacist Licensing Examination after passing a review by the Accreditation Board of the <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Schools</b> and Licenses.

To prepare to implement a preliminary examination for foreign pharmacy graduates in Korea, we summarized the preliminary examinations used in four other countries and presented {{a proposal for a}} preliminary examination. Data were collected via the internet and through telephone interviews with appropriate persons. The proposal was revised after a public forum. There are preliminary examinations in the USA, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, and these involve written, oral, practice, and English proficiency tests. We proposed that the Korean preliminary examination consist of a written test on basic pharmacy, a test in the Korean language, and an interview. The preliminary examination should include suitable items that effectively evaluate international graduates. Graduates of international <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> who have an ability equivalent to {{graduates of}} Korean <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> should be eligible to write the Korean Licensing Examination...|$|R

40|$|Background: Health {{literacy}} (HL) influences patients’ health status, use of {{the healthcare}} system and medication-relatedbehaviours.

Aims: To explore HL training in <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> internationally, and academics’ opinions in regards to how it shouldbe taught and assessed. Methods: An anonymous, online survey was administered to academics who teach within pharmacy degree coursesfrom countries where English is the main language. Results: Responses were received from 21 <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> in seven countries; 20 stated that HL was taught withintheir pharmacy degree, in four as a stand-alone topic.

40|$|IntroductionSeveral {{organizations}} representing {{pharmacy and}} other health professions {{stress the importance of}} teaching public health topics as part of training future practitioners. The objective of our study was to assess the number of U. S. <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> that incorporate lifestyle modification topics into their curricula. MethodsWe developed an electronic survey on lifestyle modification topics and sent it to each of the 89 <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> in the United States. The survey defined lifestyle modification topics as topics that address nutrition, exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation, and alcohol use. ResultsOf 89 <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> contacted, 50 (56 %) responded to the survey. Of the 50, four offer at least one required course in a lifestyle modification topic, seven offer at least one elective course, and one offers a required course that incorporates more than one lifestyle modification topic. Five required and nine elective courses were identified from the responses. Nutrition was the most commonly offered required course topic, followed by smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, and alcohol use. ConclusionFew <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> are addressing recommendations to promote public health education through formalized didactic courses. More courses on lifestyle modification topics should be offered to pharmacy students, who will be highly accessible to the public as pharmacists and will be able to offer education to enhance public health focused on the prevention of chronic diseases...|$|R
