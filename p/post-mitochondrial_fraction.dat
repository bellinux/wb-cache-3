40|$|Problem statement: The Amino {{glycoside}} antibiotics cause drug induced nephrotoxicity at therapeutic doses {{and thus}} limits the use clinically. Oxidative stress {{is one of}} the main reasons for the development of nephrotoxicity. Approach: In light of this the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of mitochondrial as well as post-mitochondrial oxidative stress in the development of Gentamicin (GM) induced nephrotoxicity and to elucidate the role of Enicostemma Littoral blame (EL) extract, as a promising antioxidant therapy. Rats were divided into four groups, 1) (Control 2) GM (i. p., 80 mg kg - 1 day - 1 for 8 days) (treated 3) GM+EL treated (i. g, 2. 5 gm kg - 1 day - 1) and (4) GM+ Vitamin C (VC) treated (i. g, 600 mg kg - 1 day - 1). GM treated animals showed high oxidative stress in mitochondrial as well as post-mitochondrial fractions of renal tissues as evidenced by increased lipid per oxidation levels, decrease in GSH content and activities of antioxidant enzymes, SOD and GPx. Results: Oxidative stress was more pronounced in mitochondrial fraction as compared to <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction.</b> GM-induced nephrotoxicity was further corroborated by an increase in serum cretonne and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) levels and altered kidney histopathological observations. Treatment with EL ameliorates antioxidant defense system of mitochondrial as well as <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction,</b> with better improvement seen in mitochondrial fraction. Conclusion: The present study explored beneficial effect of EL extract as an antioxidant therapy to counteract mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial oxidative stress generated in kidney upon GM-treatment, thus prevented nephrotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} described that silencing of the mitochondrial protein OPA 1 enhances mitochondrial Ca 2 + signaling and aldosterone production in H 295 R adrenocortical cells. Since extramitochondrial OPA 1 (emOPA 1) {{was reported to}} facilitate cAMP-induced lipolysis, we hypothesized that emOPA 1, via the enhanced hydrolysis of cholesterol esters, augments aldosterone production in H 295 R cells. A few OPA 1 immunopositive spots were detected in approximately 40 % of the cells. In cell fractionation studies OPA 1 /COX IV (mitochondrial marker) ratio in the <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fractions</b> was {{an order of magnitude}} higher than that in the mitochondrial fraction. The ratio of long to short OPA 1 isoforms was lower in post-mitochondrial than in mitochondrial fractions. Knockdown of OPA 1 failed to reduce db-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), Ca 2 + signaling and aldosterone secretion.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) inside thecal and granulosa-lutein cells of human corpus luteum 9 (CL) was assessed by immunoelectron microscopy. We found greater levels of StAR immunolabeling in steroidogenic cells from early- and mid-than in late luteal phase CL and lower levels in cells from women treated with a GnRH antagonist in the mid-luteal phase. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed significant levels of StAR antigen in the mitochondria and in the cytoplasm of luteal cells. The 30 kDa mature StAR protein was present in both mitochondria and cytosol (<b>post-mitochondrial)</b> <b>fractions</b> from homogenates of CL at different ages, whereas cytochrome c and mitochondrial HSP 70 were detected only in the mitochondrial fraction. Therefore, we hypothesized that either appreciable processing of StAR 37 kDa pre-protein occurs outside the mitochondria, or mature StAR protein is selectively released into the cytoplasm after mitochondrial processing. The presence of mature StAR in the cytoplasm is consonant {{with the notion that}} StAR acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane to effect sterol import, and that StAR may interact with other cytoplasmic proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism, including hormone sensitive lipase...|$|R
40|$|Enchytraeus albidus are {{important}} organisms {{of the soil}} biocenosis, used as standard test species in environmental risk assessment. The inhibition of cholinesterases (ChE) activity of several species has been widely {{used to assess the}} exposure and effects of anti-cholinesterase environmental contaminants. Several studies have shown the association between ChE activity inhibition and adverse effects on behaviour and survival. Extensive studies addressing survival and behavioural endpoints, as well as other biomarkers, have been done in E. albidus with different types of soil contaminants. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to characterize biochemically the ChE present in the soluble <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction</b> of E. albidus whole body homogenates, using different substrates and selective inhibitors; (2) to assess the in vivo effects of copper, phenmedipham and different soil properties (pH, organic matter, clay) on the ChE activity; (3) to assess the in vitro effects of copper and phenmedipham on the ChE activity. The results suggest the presence of one ChE in the soluble <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction</b> of E. albidus whole body homogenates, which displays properties of both acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase considering the typical mammalian enzymes. It is also shown that ChE activity is not inhibited by exposure to different soil properties and that copper and phenmedipham inhibited ChE activity both in in vivo and in in vitro conditions and therefore ChE inhibition seems to be a robust biomarker for this herbicide and this heavy metal. This study showed that ChE activity in E. albidus might be correlated to previously determined higher level effects like survival and reproduction, as well as avoidance behaviour...|$|E

40|$|The {{translational}} {{activity of}} actively growing microplasmodia and dormant microsclerotia of Physarum polycephalum was investigated {{by analyzing the}} distribution of ribosomes in polysomes. Microplasmodial <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fractions</b> contained substantial amounts of polysomes and ribosomal subunits but very few native monosomes. During the starvation period which preceded microsclerotium formation, polysome levels remained constant, whereas the subunit titer began to increase. During encystment ribosomal subunits continued to accumulate {{as the level of}} polysomes gradually decreased. Dormant microsclerotia contained a large surplus of stored ribosomal subunits but no detectable polysomes. However, incubation of microsclerotia with concentrations of cycloheximide sufficient to slow polypeptide elongation without affecting initiation caused the gradual reappearance of polysomes {{at the expense of the}} subunits. Under these conditions the percentage of subunits driven into polysomes reached values similar to those of actively growing microplasmodia. Microsclerotia returned to nutrient medium contained very low levels of polysomes during the lag period which preceded germination. These were formed with preexisting, stored messenger ribonucleic acid. During the germination period, polysome levels were markedly increased. This elevation was dependent on new ribonucleic acid transcription. It is concluded that dormant microsclerotia contain functional messenger ribonucleic acid and ribosomes which are subject to translational repression at the level of initiation...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the Southern African Society of Aquatic Scientists Conference in 2004. Toxic metals such as {{lead and}} cadmium are widely {{found in our}} environment. Humans and animals are exposed to these metals from {{numerous}} sources through contaminated air, water, soil and food. Exposure to these metals {{has been shown to}} cause an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radical COIr), superoxide anion radical C 02 -) or hydrogen peroxide (H 202). These ROS are toxic to the cell and usually cause apoptosis. A number of enzymes are responsible for the removal of these ROS and include superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and quinone oxidoreductase (QOR). At times exposure to metals results in the induction, repression or inhibition of these enzymes. We have prevsiously reported on the effect of metals on CAT, GPX and QOR. However, {{it has been shown that}} SOD can be induced as a result of exposure to metals. This study was therefore conducted to assess the possibility of using metal exposure related induction of SOD as a potential biomarker of water pollution. The study was performed using two species of aquatic snails found in Southern Africa, namely Lymnaea natalensis and Helisoma duryi. Adult snails reared in outdoor cement aquaria were exposed daily for three days to three concentrations (0. 01 ppm, 0. 1 ppm and 1. 0 ppm) of copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Ph) or zinc (Zn) individually. SOD activity was measured in <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fractions.</b> Although not statistically significant, our data indicates a trend in hoth species of snails where Cu, Cd and Pb caused dose related increases in SO [...] p activity. However, Pb caused a dose related change only in L natalensis and not in H. ~ryi. The activity was increased several fold at 1 ppm while the lower concentrations seemed to have little or no effect. These results suggest that metal exposure results in an increased SOD activity in aquatic invertebrates. Furthermore, induction of SOD activity as a result of exposure to metal is a potential biomarker of water pollution. However, further studies are required using other metals and a wider concentration range in order to test the reliability of this enzyme as a biomarker.

40|$|The gene mutated in {{the human}} genetic {{disorder}} ataxia-telangiectasia codes for a protein, ATM, the known functions of which include response to DNA damage, cell cycle control, and meiotic recombination. Consistent with these functions, ATM is predominantly present in the nucleus of proliferating cells; however, {{a significant proportion of}} the protein has also been detected outside the nucleus in cytoplasmic vesicles. To understand the possible role of extra-nuclear ATM, we initially investigated the nature of these vesicles. In this report we demonstrate that a portion of ATM co-localizes with catalase, that ATM is present in purified mouse peroxisomes, and that there are reduced levels of ATM in the <b>post-mitochondrial</b> membrane <b>fraction</b> of cells from a patient with a peroxisome biogenesis disorder. Furthermore the use of the yeast two-hybrid system demonstrated that ATM interacts directly with a protein involved in the import of proteins into the peroxisome matrix. Because peroxisomes are major sites of oxidative metabolism, we investigated catalase activity and lipid hydroperoxide levels in normal and A-T fibroblasts. Significantly decreased catalase activity and increased lipid peroxidation was observed in several A-T cell lines. The localization of ATM to peroxisomes may contribute to the pleiotropic nature of A-T...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and purification of N-hydroxy-N-formyl-p-phenetidine (N-OH-FP) is described.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} recently that incubation of the aminoglycoside gentamicin with an hepatic <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction</b> produces a compound toxic to sensory {{cells from the}} inner ear in short-term culture; in contrast, the parent aminoglycoside was non-toxic in vitro (Huang MY and Schacht J, Biochem Pharmacol 40 : R 11 -R 14, 1990). In the present study, we investigated the subcellular distribution of the enzymatic activity {{and the nature of}} the metabolite. Isolated outer hair cells from the guinea pig cochlea were used to assay for cytotoxicity. The enzyme(s) responsible for this novel reaction of aminoglycosides was exclusively localized to the cytosolic fraction of guinea pig liver. No activity was detected in nuclear, lysosomal/mitochondrial or microsomal preparations. Furthermore, the toxin-forming enzymatic activity was associated with the high molecular weight fraction of the cytosol and did not require low molecular weight components. Filtration of the toxin through molecular weight cut-off membranes showed a molecular size of approximately 500. This evidence is consistent with the toxin being a gentamicin derivative...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} is described for {{the isolation of}} a plasma membrane-enriched preparation from a rat liver <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction</b> by using discontinuous Percoll density-gradient centrifugation.

40|$|The studies {{reported}} in this thesis have been primarily concerned with the mechanism of the selective action of the substituted phenylurea herbicide chlortoluron (N 1 -(3 -chloro- 4 -methylphenyl) -N,N-dimethylurea) in cereals and monocotyledonous cereal weeds. The introduction reviews relevant aspects of photosynthetic electron transport, {{the use of the}} substituted phenylureas as herbicides and the mode of action of the substituted phenylureas with reference to structure/activity relationships. In addition, their selective properties are discussed particularly in relation to their metabolic fate in biological systems. Studies on the Hill activity of chloroplasts isolated from resistant and sensitive plants and incubated in vitro with chlortoluron or the related phenylurea isoproturon (NT-(3 -chloro- 4 -isopropylphenyl) -N,N -dimethylurea) demonstrated a similar inhibition of DCPIP photoreduction in each case. Examination of the Hill activity of chloroplasts isolated from plantstreated with either chlortoluron or isoproturon, however, demonstrated a greater inhibition of DCPIP photoreduction in sensitive compared to resistant plants. Studies on the recovery of photosynthetic activity both in whole plants and in leaf segments following inhibition by prior treatment with chlortoluron or isoproturon demonstrated a greater ability to restore oxygen evolution in the case of resistant plants, suggesting a more rapid detoxification of the herbicides in these varieties. Metabolism studies made using (carbonyl- 14 C) chlortoluron indicated degradation by both N-demethylation and ring-methyl oxidation pathways, followed by conjugation. The ring-methyl oxidation pathway predominated in the resistant cereal varieties {{to a greater extent than}} in the sensitive cultivars. In contrast, the N-demethylation pathway constituted the major metabolic route in the case of the cereal weeds. Studies onthe inhibition of the Hill reaction by the metabolites of chlortoluron indicated that the initial product of N-demethylation retained significant phytotoxicity, whereas all products of ring-methyl oxidation were essentially non-phytotoxic. Further metabolism studies made using 14 (carbonyl-C) diuron (N 1 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) -N,N-dimethylurea) and 14 (carbonyl-C) N 1 -(3 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenyl) -N,N-dimethylurea emphasised the importance of both the presence and the positioning of the ring-methyl group in the selective action of the substituted phenylureas. Studies on the polar conjugated metabolites of chlortoluron revealed that the glycone moiety was B-D-glucose in each case. In vitro experiments indicated that chlortoluron metabolism was achieved by a microsomal-linked system requiring molecular oxygen and NADPH as cofactors. Experiments on the absorption of chlortoluron from both soil and nutrient media indicated a greater uptake of the herbicide by the cereal weeds compared to the cereal varieties examined. A sub-cellular organelle localisation study of absorbed chlortoluron and its metabolites demonstrated the association of significantly larger amounts of phytotoxic material with the chloroplasts of sensitive compared to resistant plants. In addition, <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fractions</b> prepared from resistant plants contained correspondingly larger quantities of non-phytotoxic metabolites. The various experimental results are discussed in terms of their significance in accounting for the observed differences in the response of cereals and cereal weeds to chlortoluron. <p...|$|R

In contrast only the glucuronide was synthesized by human liver and only the sulphate by mouse and cat livers. Neither of these conjugates was formed by the kidney or the small or large intestine of the rat. A high sulphate-conjugating activity was observed in mouse kidney; the rate of sulphation of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylethanol with kidney homogenate and high-speed supernatant preparations was 1. 8 times greater than with liver preparations. The sulpho-conjugates of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylethanol and 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy-phenylglycol were also formed by enzyme preparations of rabbit adrenal and rat brain; the glycol was the better substrate in the latter system. Mouse brain did not possess any sulphotransferase activity. For the conjugation of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylethanol by rabbit liver, the Km for UDP-glucuronic acid was 0. 22 mM and that for Na 2 SO 4 was 3. 45 mM. The sulphotransferase has a greater affinity for 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl-ethanol than has glucuronyltransferase, as indicated by their respective Km values of 0. 036 and 1. 3 mM.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of the antitumor agent 6 -thioguanine (TG, NSC- 752) by rat liver was {{studied in}} vitro. Livers from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized and the 2 ÃÜ 2 liver homogenate 2 ÃÜ 2 {{was subjected to}} differential centrifugation to obtain the 2 ÃÜ 210, 000 x g pellet 2 ÃÜ 2, the 2 ÃÜ 2 <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction</b> 2 ÃÜ 2, the 2 ÃÜ 2 cytosol fraction 2 ÃÜ 2, and the 2 ÃÜ 2 microsomes 2 ÃÜ 2. The homogenity of each fraction was estimated by appropriate marker enzyme assays. To delineate the in vitro metabolism of TG by rat liver, 0. 2 mM of 8 -(2 ÃÜ 714) CTG was incubated with different subcellular fractions in KCl-Tris-MgCl(, 2) buffer, pH 7. 4 at 37 (DEGREES). The metabolites formed were identified by chromatography, UV spectrometry, as well as mass spectrometry. After a 1 hr incubation, TG was metabolized by the liver homogenate, the 10, 000 x g pellet and the <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction</b> mainly to 6 -thioguanosine (TGR), accompanied by varying lesser amounts of 6 -thiouric acid (TUA), allantoin, guanine- 6 -sulfinic acid (G-SO(, 2) H) and an unknown product. In comparison, the cytosal fraction converted TG almost entirely to TGR and TUA in equal amounts. The formation of TGR from TG was limited by the endogenous supply of ribose- 1 -phosphate. With the microsomal fraction, however, TG was metabolized significantly to G-SO(, 2) H and the unknown, accompanied with some TGR. After a 5 hr incubation the metabolism of TG was changed to favor the catabolic route, yielding mostly TUA in the post-mitochondrial and cytosol fractions; but mainly allantoin in the liver homogenate fraction. The kinetic studies of TG metabolism by the subcellar fractions indicated that the formation of TGR served as a depot form of TG. The level of TGR decreased when the catabolism of TG became prominent. The oxidation of TG to GSO(, 2) H mediated by the hepatic microsomes represented a new catabolic pathway of TG. This GSO(, 2) H, under acidic conditions, readily decomposes to guanine and inorganic sulfate. In the presence of reduced glutathione in Tris buffer, pH 7. 8 at 25 (DEGREES), GSO(, 2) H is adducted to glutathione chemically to form S-(2 -amino-purin- 6 -yl) glutathione and conceivably, inorganic sulfate. Therefore, the formation of GSO(, 2) H from TG might have implication in the desulfuration mechanism of TG. On the other hand, the unknown formed from TG {{by the action of}} the microsomal enzymes appeared to be a TG conjugate. However, it is neither a glutathione, a glucuronide, nor a ribose conjugate. Additionally, the deamination of TG by guanine deaminase (E. C. 3. 5. 4. 3) isolated from rat liver was also investigated. TG is a poorer substrate (Km = 4. 8 x 10 (2 ÃÜ 7 - 3) M) for guanine deaminase than that of guanine (Km = 4. 7 x 10 (2 ÃÜ 7 - 6) M) at pH 7. 25, optimal pH for TG as a substrate. TG is also a competitive inhibitor of guanine for guanine deaminase, with a ki of 2. 2 x 10 (2 ÃÜ 7 - 4) M. ...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 (GYP) are {{a family}} of membrane-bound enzymes which form a {{component}} of the mixed function oxidase (MFO) system and are involved in the metabolism of many endogenous and exogenous compounds and, as such, play key roles in many physiological, pharmacological and toxicological processes. Due to the diversity of their substrates, it is essential to gain an understanding of how their activities can be modulated. The membrane lipid environment of CYP isoforms has proved to be an essential component for their optimal activities and consequently investigations into this aspect of modulation are fundamental to many areas of research. The work described in this thesis investigates 3 methods for the modulation of hepatic microsomal membrane lipids in order to relate 3 components of the lipid bilayer to the associated GYP isoform activities. The effect of incubating <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fractions</b> with a range of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) concentrations at 37 ¬∞G on 4 CYP-catalysed reactions during microsomal fraction preparation was examined. The size of the membrane free fatty acid (FFA) pool was found to increase substantially following PLA 2 treatment, and the main hydrolysis product was revealed to be arachidonate. Although the bulk fluidity of the membrane was unchanged at specific PLA 2 concentrations, differential sensitivities of the GYP isoforms were observed at these concentrations. By assaying the activity of the NADPH-P 450 reductase component of the MFO independently, in addition to using an oxygen surrogate to by-pass the reductase enzyme, it was concluded that it was specifically the GYP proteins that were susceptible to the membrane modulation which consequently lead to the observed decreases in the rates of reaction. The subsequent removal of the FFA pool with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was found not to restore the GYP isoform activities. It has been suggested that the inhibitory effect of FFAs may be due to conformational changes in the lipid environment of the isozymes. Also, hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids by PLA 2 activity results in the formation of FFAs and Iysophospholipids, both of which can affect substrate partitioning within a membrane. Thus, the remaining lysophospholipids following BSA treatment {{may have contributed to the}} decreased activities of the GYP isoforms. A range of PLA 2 concentrations at the lower incubation temperatures of 10 ¬∞G and 20 ¬∞C were used to retailor microsomal lipids in order to investigate the possibility that the GYP activities were associated with specific lipid domains. As with the 37 ¬∞G incubation, the main hydrolysis product within the FFA pool was found to be arachidonate. Although arachidonate release was not significantly affected at any of the incubation temperatures, the activities of individual GYP isoforms were significantly decreased with increases in incubation temperature at specific PLA 2 concentrations. Kinetic studies suggested that PLA 2 treatment of the microsomal membrane modulated CYP activity through the hydrolysis of associated lipid domains, and not by competitive inhibition by the endogenously released arachidonate. In an attempt to elucidate it microsomal membrane fatty acid saturation affected the activities of associated CYP isoforms, a preliminary study was conducted in which membrane lipid species were chemically modified by the use of catalytic hydrogenation. Membrane fractions were successfully hydrogenated, particularly long-chain fatty acids such asarachidonate. The activities of those CYP isoforms investigated were modulated to varying degrees upon hydrogenation of the membrane environment. It was concluded that the use of such catalysts should provide a suitable system for investigations fatty acid unsaturation and CYP activities. Finally, as phosphatidylcholine (PC) has been shown to be important for certain CYP isoform activities, a preliminary study was carried out to determine the effect of the biosynthetic pathway for PC synthesis on mouse hepatic MFO activity. Using microsomal fractions obtained from a transgenic strain in which one of the pathways for PC synthesis was absent, it was found that the PC fatty acid profile was changed compared to that of the wildype fractions. Additionally, the activities of certain CYP isoforms were affected by the biosynthetic origin of PC synthesis. This sensitivity of specific isozymes to the PC biosynthetic pathway may have also been sex-dependent. The work described in this thesis suggests several strategies which could be exploited further to refine and improve experimental studies of CYP isoforms. The results obtained support the concept that the membrane composition and environment of CYP isoforms differentially affects their activities. Due to the complexity of these remarkable biochemical systems, further studies are clearly required to define the membrane properties involved in the modulation of CYP activity...|$|R
40|$|Currently three {{different}} {{methods have been}} taken to develop new mutagenicity tester strains containing human cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs). Each of these use a single expression vector. In this paper we describe a fourth approach, i. e., the coexpression of a CYP and its electron-transfer flavoprotein, NADPH CYP reductase (RED), encoded by two different expression vectors. The Escherichia coli mutagenicity tester strain BMX 100 has been expanded to a strain, MTC which stably expresses human RED. This new tester strain permits the biplasmid coexpression of human CYP 1 A 2 and RED (MTC 1 A 2). This novel strain can be used for the determination of the mutagenicity of chemicals known to be procarcinogens and metabolized by CYP 1 A 2. The mutagenicity tester strain MTC 1 A 2 was compared with: (i) BMX 100 using the <b>post-mitochondrial</b> rat liver <b>fraction</b> (S 9); (ii) BMX 100 with expressing CYP 1 A 2 alone (iii) or with expressing CYP 1 A 2 fused to rat RED or (iv) with expressing CYP 1 A 2, bicistronically coexpressed with rat RED. The biplasmid RED/CYP coexpression system generated a strain with the highest methoxy- and ethoxy-resorufin dealkylase activities and highest mutagenic activities for the procarcinogens 2 -aminoanthracene (2 AA), aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) and 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo(4, 5 -f) quinoline (IQ). Furthermore, the metabolism of 2 AA and IQ was detected more efficiently using the MTC 1 A 2 strain than with the BMX 100 strain plus the standard rodent liver S 9 metabolic system...|$|R

The system consisted of Sephadex G- 25 treated <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction</b> prepared from rat liver (Sephadex-PM) {{as a source of}} membranes, and radioactive free polysomes prepared from another rat liver. The following results were obtained. 1. Nascent chains on free polysomes labeled in vivo were transferred to membranes in vitro. The process required protein synthesis. 2. This reaction occurred in two steps: a) Binding of the free polysomes to mem-branes in the absence of protein synthesis, b) Release of ribosomes, leaving nascent chains on the membranes, requiring protein synthesis. 3. A portion of the ribosomes found on membranes in vivo (membrane-bound ribo-somes) was also released from the membranes during incubation in vitro, leaving their nascent chains on the membranes. The significance of the transfer of nascent chains from free polysomes to mem-branes in vitro is discussed in the light of known polysome-membrane interaction in vivo.

The drug was devoid of mutagenic activity in bacterial assays (maximum con-centration 5000 mg/plate) using a range of test strains (Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 1538, TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102 and Escherichia coli WP 2 uvrA and WP 2 uvrA pkm 101). No effects were seen in the hgprt gene mutation assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells {{in the presence of}} S 9. In the absence of S 9, sporadic increases in revertant numbers were not dose-related or reproducible in subsequent experiments and hence were concluded to be chance events. In an in vitro chromosome aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells, chromosome damage in the presence and absence of S 9 (concentration 200 [...] 5000 mg/ml) was attributed to overt cell toxicity. To confirm this, a comprehensive in vivo evaluation of the drug was performed. Negative results were obtained in two independent rodent micronucleus tests. In the first mice were given oral doses (of carbonate) up to 2000 mg/kg, in the second rats were given a single i. v. bolus injection (of chloride) up to 0. 1 mg/kg. Negative results were also obtained in a rat liver unscheduled DNA synthesis assay after treatment for 28 days with i. v. bolus injections (of chloride) up to 0. 1 mg/kg/day. In these in vivo studies lanthanum plasma concentrations were 43000 times higher than the steady-state peak plasma concentration observed in dialysis patients given therapeutic doses of lanthanum carbonate.

40|$|It remains {{uncertain}} why non-genotoxic {{compounds that}} result in liver hypertrophy cause liver tumors. In an effort to resolve this issue, we examined whether liver <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction</b> (S 9) prepared from rats treated with non-genotoxic compounds affected the genotoxicity of pro-mutagens. Known hepatotoxic compounds, such as piperonyl butoxide (PBO), decabromodiphenyl ether (DBDE), beta-naphthoflavone (BNF), indole- 3 -carbinol (I 3 C) and acetaminophen (AA), were orally administered to male and female F 344 rats at doses sufficient to cause liver hypertrophy. Rats received diets containing each test compound for 3 days, 4 weeks or 13 weeks, and were then kept for 4 weeks without the test chemical. S 9 prepared from the livers of each group {{was used for the}} Ames test with 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). In both sexes, liver hypertrophy was observed following administration of all test compounds, and was then reversed to the control state when administration ceased. The mutagenicity of MeIQx, BaP and NDMA increased with the use of S 9 derived from rats treated with non-genotoxic compounds other than AA. DBDE administration had a marked effect on the mutagenicity of BaP (over a 30 -fold increase in females) and NDMA (about a 20 -fold increase in males). To estimate the involvement of metabolic enzymes in the alteration of mutagenicity, we measured the activity of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase (MROD) (phase I enzymes), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) (phase II enzymes) in each S 9 sample. The activity of phase I enzymes increased, even at the 3 rd day following administration, and then decreased gradually, except in the case of AA, while the activity of phase II enzymes increased slightly. These results suggest that non-genotoxic hepato-hypertrophic compounds may be partly involved in carcinogenesis by modulating the metabolism of pre-carcinogens incorporated from the environment, {{in a manner that is}} dependent on sex and pre-incorporated chemicals...|$|E

In this thesis, {{a combination of}} high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and mass spectrometry (MS) is {{used to assess the}} metabolic profile of doxorubicin in vitro using the <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction</b> (PMF) from the liver of Fischer 344 rats. Monitoring the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs is important in the development, screening and assessment of new chemical compounds for use in therapies. This often requires the use of two or more techniques in order to collect the relevant data. This is the case for the analysis of metabolic products of the anticancer drug doxorubicin. An HPLC instrument with tandem LIF and MS detection was developed and then used to quantify and identify the metabolic products of doxorubicin in vitro. Using this instrumentation, the consumption of doxorubicin and the appearance of 7 -deoxydoxorubicinone and 7 -deoxydoxorubicinolone were monitored in rat liver post-mitochondrial fractions. This application demonstrates the potential of the tandem LIF-MS detection scheme in quantification and characterization of biotransformations of fluorescent xenobiotics of biomedical and environmental relevance. The HPLC-LIF-MS instrumentation and in vitro methods were then applied to investigate the changes in metabolism between young adult (10 months-old, 100 % survival rate) and old (26 months-old, ~ 25 % survival rate) Fischer 344 rats. Results suggest that with aging there is decrease in the rate of biotransformation of doxorubicin and that the timeframes needed to reach steady metabolite and doxorubicin levels are longer. On the other hand, the levels of metabolites and doxorubicin concentrations are not statistically different between the two age groups. In the future, the new methodologies presented here could be applied to investigate age-related changes in metabolism of drugs already in use, new compounds and xenobiotics with health relevance (e. g. pesticides or environmental pollutants) ...|$|E
40|$|Isolation and {{characterization}} of ribosome from the midgut of Bombyx mori, and their capacity for in vivo protein synthesis {{at different stages}} of development were studied. Conventional procedures for ribosome isolation were ineffective when applied to Bombyx mori. The preparation of ribosomes from this material depended upon the elimination of Mg ion from the homogenizing medium, the presence of a moderately high KC 1 concentration in the homogenizing medium, and the addition of Triton X- 100 rather than deoxycholate to <b>post-mitochondrial</b> <b>fraction.</b> The ribosomes prepared in this manner had a RNA content of 55 per cent, A 260 : A 235 ratio of 1. 9, with absorption maxima and minima at 260 and 235 nm, respectively, and were given 80 S by sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis. The ribosome had a particle of diameter of 200 A by electron microscopic observation. The ribosomes prepared in this manner had a capacity for in vitro protein synthesis. Addition of this ribosome to E. coli cell-free system stimulated amino acid incorporation into protein. By the use of in vitro protein synthesizing system with ribosomal and supernatant fractions from different stages of the development (glutoneous and maturation stages), their capacity for in vitro protein synthesis was studied {{at different stages of}} the development. The level of amino acid incorporation exhibited higher by ribosomal and supernatant fractions from maturation stage than that from glutoneous stage. Endogenous capacity for protein synthesis of ribosomal fraction from maturation stage exhibited higher than that from glutoneous stage, and also it is true of endogenous capacity for protein synthesis of supernatant fraction from maturation stage. The activity of protein synthesis is higher at the stage of maturation than at the stage of feeding. Results obtained by the use of in vitro protein synthesizing system suggest that the nature of ribosomal and supernatant faction from the stage of maturation is {{different from that of the}} glutoneous stage and control of protein synthesis takes place at each of the levels of ribosome and supernatant.

Adamussium colbecki and Chlamys islandicus represent key organisms for monitoring Antarctic and Arctic regions while Pecten jacobaeus was chosen for comparison with a related temperate species. TOSC values for ROO* were significantly higher in A. colbecki, indicating that this species is the most efficient ROO* scavenger. Mediterranean scallops had the lowest TOSC for ROO*. Adamussium colbecki also exhibited the highest scavenging capacity for *OH with values more than two‚Äêfold greater than for C. islandicus and P. jacobaeus. TOSC values for HOONO were lower for all scallops as compared to those for ROO* or *OH; for microsomes they {{were not significantly different}} among the species for any reactive oxygen species studied, and the percentage contribution to the specific TOSC for the various oxidants of microsomes of all scallops accounted for 1 ‚Äì 3 % of the total TOSC of the <b>post‚Äêmitochondrial</b> <b>fraction.</b> The specific TOSC of scallop microsomes for *OH was ‚Äê 10 times lower than that for ROO* or HOONO. The higher basal capability of the Antarctic scallop to neutralise different reactive oxygen species is discussed in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment, and TOSC is validated as a quantifiable measure of susceptibility to oxidative stress in marine organisms. In a second part of this study, the seasonal fluctuations of susceptibility to oxidative stress were analysed in the Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki by the TOSC Assay. A marked increase in the capability to neutralise peroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals was demonstrated at the end of December, while resistance towards peroxynitrite did not show significant variations during the Antarctic summer. The increased resistance to these specific oxyradicals was almost contemporary with the period of highest feeding activity and the development of gonadic tissues. Sensitivity to hydroxyl radicals and peroxyl radicals toxicity was also influenced by UV‚ÄêB and UV‚Äê? wavelengths, as indicated by the lower TOSC values in scallops exposed under laboratory conditions. Toxicity of UV radiation seems partly mediated by formation of reactive oxygen species caused by the direct exposure of mantle edges and/or the photochemical production of hydrogen peroxide in sea water...|$|E
