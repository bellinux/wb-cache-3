25|$|Menopause is the <b>permanent</b> <b>cessation</b> of {{menstruation}} {{resulting from}} loss of ovarian follicular activity. Menopause {{can be divided}} into early and late transition periods, also known as perimenopause and postmenopause. Each stage is marked by changes in hormonal patterns, which can induce menopausal symptoms. It is possible to induce menopause prematurely by surgically removing the ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy). This is often done as a consequence of ovarian failure, such as ovarian or uterine cancers. The most common side effects of the menopausal transition are: lack of sexual desire or libido, lack of sexual arousal, and vaginal dryness. The modification of women’s physiology can lead to changes in her sexual response, the development of sexual dysfunctions, and changes in her levels of sexual desire.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroduction. Smoking is {{the single}} most {{important}} aetiological factor for the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Unfortunately, most patients receive little or no treatment for their nicotine addiction. This review aims to make evidence based recommendations for smoking cessation as part of a comprehensive delivery of best medical therapy to patients with peripheral arterial disease. Methods. A search of MEDLINE (1966 to 2003) and the Cochrane library was undertaken for studies relating to smoking cessation. Major priority was given to meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials including Cochrane reviews. Results. Physician advise, nicotine replacement therapy and Bupropion are all evidence based treatments that have success in increasing the likelihood of <b>permanent</b> smoking <b>cessation.</b> A basic understanding of the psychology of addictive behaviour is essential so that appropriate advice and treatment can be tailored to individual patients. Conclusions. Complete and <b>permanent</b> smoking <b>cessation</b> is by far the most clinically and cost effective intervention in patients with atherosclerosis. Greater awareness of smoking cessation strategies, by clinicians treating vascular patients, is essential for the effective delivery of best medical therapy...|$|R

50|$|Finding {{a common}} {{platform}} regarding {{the concept of}} death {{was the first step}} towards this work. Dr Hossain's finding was that without a common idea about death people {{will not be able to}} share the same remedy for death anxiety. There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases. It was Hossain's claim that whenever death is taken as <b>permanent</b> and absolute <b>cessation</b> of human existence, morbid fear of death begins; therefore DAH he presented with different ideas of death in relation to existence to reach a conclusion that will be acceptable to most.|$|R
50|$|In {{the process}} of brain death, all brain {{function}} permanently ceases. Many {{people who believe that}} death is a <b>permanent</b> <b>cessation</b> of consciousness also believe that consciousness is dependent upon the functioning of the brain. Scientific research has discovered that some areas of the brain, like the reticular activating system or the thalamus, appear to be necessary for consciousness, because damage to these structures or their lack of function causes a loss of consciousness.|$|E
50|$|A {{supersonic}} transport (SST) is a civilian supersonic aircraft designed to transport passengers at speeds {{greater than the}} speed of sound. To date, the only SSTs to see regular service have been Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144. The last passenger flight of the Tu-144 was in June 1978 and it was last flown in 1999 by NASA. Concorde's last commercial flight was in October 2003, with a November 26, 2003 ferry flight being its last airborne operation. Following the <b>permanent</b> <b>cessation</b> of flying by Concorde, there are no remaining SSTs in commercial service.

50|$|This {{concept of}} {{brainstem}} death is also accepted as grounds for pronouncing death for legal purposes in India and Trinidad & Tobago.

The United States' President's Council on Bioethics made it clear, in its White Paper of December 2008, that the United Kingdom concept and clinical criteria are not considered sufficient for the diagnosis of death in the United States of America.|$|E
40|$|AIMS To {{investigate}} the cost-effectiveness of English specialist smoking cessation services. DESIGN Combination of observational cost and outcome data from English smoking cessation services to calculate cost-effectiveness ratios. Multivariate analysis of factors influencing variation in services' cost-effectiveness. SETTING Fifty-eight of the 92 specialist smoking cessation services in England in 2000 / 01. METHODS Services' costs were estimated using survey data which described services' configurations, staffing, interventions delivered and development. Information on services' throughput and outcomes (as biochemically validated 4 -week smoking cessation rates) {{were obtained from}} routine sources. With reference to relevant literature and assumptions about relapse and background cessation rates, 4 -week cessation rates were converted first to 1 -year rates. One-year cessation rates were adjusted to reflect the likely <b>permanent</b> smoking <b>cessation</b> rate attributable to service intervention and finally attributable life-years gained were calculated. A wide variety of sensitivity analyses was performed to test the robustness of the average cost-effectiveness ratio, calculated by combining the cost and life-year gained estimates, for all services. With additional data on deprivation levels in services' areas, ordinary least-squares regression techniques were used to investigate variations in individual services' costs per client and cost-effectiveness ratios.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the aspects of}} return to work, socio-economic {{and quality of life}} aspects in 145 employed patients under 60 years of age treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Material and Methods: During hospital treatment demographic and clinical data was collected. Data about major adverse cardiovascular events, rehabilitation, sick leave, discharge from job and retirement, salary, major life events and estimation of quality of life after myocardial infarction were obtained after follow-up (mean: 836 ± 242 days). Results: Average sick leave was 126 ± 125 days. Following myocardial infarction, 3. 4 % of patients were discharged from their jobs while 31. 7 % retired. Lower salary was reported in 17. 9 % patients, major life events in 9. 7 %, while 40. 7 % estimated quality of life as worse following the event. Longer hospitalization was reported in patients transferred from surrounding counties, those with inferior myocardial wall and right coronary artery affected. Age, hyperlipoproteinemia and lower education degree were connected to <b>permanent</b> working <b>cessation.</b> Significant salary decrease was observed in male patients. Employer type was related to sick leave duration. Impaired quality of life was observed in patients who underwent in-hospital rehabilitation and those from surrounding counties. Longer sick leave was observed in patients with lower income before and after myocardial infarction. These patients reported lower quality of life after myocardial infarction. Conclusions: Inadequate health policy and delayed cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction may lead to prolonged hospitalization and sick leave as well as lower quality of life after the event, regardless of optimal treatment in acute phase of disease...|$|R
40|$|Minorities suffer disproportionately from tobacco smoke-related {{morbidity}} and mortality nationwide. Tobacco-related illnesses are responsible for approximately 47, 000 deaths of African Americans annually. Furthermore, greater tobacco- related health disparities exist among African American women {{in the state of}} Pennsylvania and the city of Pittsburgh; as the local and state maternal smoke rates exceed the national average. Additionally, low birth weight and infant mortality rates linked to maternal smoking has been disproportionately elevated among African American women in this geographical area. African American mothers who quit smoking generally have higher relapse rates than their Caucasian counterparts. Research limitations in understanding the smoking cessation, self- quitting and relapse prevention among African American women particularly in Pittsburgh, PA; serves as a foundation for this study. Thus, two focus groups were conducted with a sample of 13 African American maternal smokers in the Pittsburgh area to assess their smoking and quitting experiences as well as their unmet needs for cessation treatment. A brief survey was administered to ascertain the participants' socio demographic characteristics. The data collected mirror previous research as nicotine addiction, stress and poor social surroundings act as barriers to successful quitting. The women identified willpower as the key to <b>permanent</b> smoking <b>cessation</b> but lack the self-efficacy to quit. Recommendations for advanced investigations and cessation programs for this population are provided. The findings from this exploratory study are significant to public health research as they provide a guide for future research and offer valuable insight for modifying and creating effective smoking cessation interventions for African American women; which can produce long term effects by decreasing the maternal smoking rate disparity in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of Lp(a) on the occurrence of occlusive arterial thrombosis. Occlusive arterial thrombus formation was examined in 18 cynomolgus monkeys with high plasma Lp(a) concentrations (> 35 mg/dL, n= 6), intermediate Lp(a) concentrations (20 - 25 mg/dL, n= 6), and low Lp(a) concentrations (< 12 mg/dL, n= 6). A Goldblatt clamp was positioned around the left common carotid artery to produce a stenotic segment, and the artery was pinch-injured with needle holders. A 20 -MHz Doppler velocity crystal, placed distal to the stenosis/injury site, was used to detect cyclic flow reductions (indicative of transient thrombosis) or <b>permanent</b> <b>cessation</b> of flow velocity (indicative of more stable occlusive thrombosis). All monkeys with high Lp(a) concentrations developed <b>permanent</b> <b>cessation</b> of flow, whereas only one of six arteries from low-Lp(a) monkeys developed <b>permanent</b> <b>cessation</b> of flow (p< 0. 05).

40|$|SUMMARY We {{studied the}} role of von Willebrand factor in {{coronary}} thrombosis in normal, heterozygous, and homozygous von Willebrand's disease pigs by producing coronary stenosis with a Goldblatt clamp positioned around the left anterior descending coronary artery. Flow velocity was assessed by a 20 -MHz Doppler velocity probe distal to the Goldblatt clamp. Myocardial extracellular potassium levels were measured by potassium-sensitive electrodes in myocardium supplied by the left anterior descending artery. Whereas stenosis sufficient to block reactive hyperemia to a 20 -second occlusion produced an elevation of myocardial extracellular potassium, it produced neither spontane-ous cyclic flow reductions nor <b>permanent</b> <b>cessation</b> of coronary blood flow velocity. Injury of the coronary artery at the stenosis site with spring-loaded forceps produced cyclic flow reductions or <b>permanent</b> <b>cessation</b> of flow in eight of nine phenotypically normal pigs.
