40|$|Flextech Manufacturing (Pty) Ltd {{manufactures}} Control Cables and Rear View Mirrors for {{the local}} as well as global automotive industries. The company, situated in Pretoria Gauteng is also known for its manufacturing of tools {{and the production of}} plastic mouldings. The aim of this project is to investigate the lean tools available, select the best suited approach to develop a waste reduction priorities in a specific area in Flextech. Constraints were identified based on an investigation of the environment of Flextech through structured discussions with management, constraints were identified. The Front <b>Park</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>Cable</b> production line of Ford South Africa was chosen for this project to implement Lean thinking tools. The Front PKB can be better described as the framework of the new Ford Ranger’s hand brake. Gaps in the Front PKB process were identified using engineering techniques and lean tools such as Value stream mapping. Each of these identified problems was analysed in detail. Solutions or improvements were developed. The brazing area was seen as the key problem where the proposed lean implementation road map could be used. The problem was thoroughly analysed by investigating the current situation at Flextech. The goal was established as improving the throughput at the Brazing area for the Front PKB Brackets, meeting daily requirements of 600 brazed brackets per day using only the day shifts. Countermeasures identified improved the Brazing layout and provided visual target boards for each individual operator. Changing the layout resulted in improving the continuous flow of the material as well as eliminating double handling of the material. The target boards motivated the operators to achieve their requirement of 38 brazed brackets per hour. A Gantt chart was prepared to show the steps of a Lean Road Map implementation improvement plan for the brazing area. This Lean Road Map will be used as a foundation of improving other problems in Flextech. The follow up plan, according to the Gantt chart as steps 10 - 14, will be completed during October 2012 to mid-December 2012. Thesis (B Eng.

5000|$|In 2003, the Chrysler Voyager was {{discontinued}} in the U.S. and Canada, a {{short wheelbase}} Town & Country became available, and the Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V returned {{after having been}} discontinued in 1995. The C/V featured the option of deleted side windows (replaced by composite panels), optional rear seats, a cargo floor made of plastic material similar to pickup truck bedliners, rubber flooring in lieu of carpeting and normal hatch at the rear. Minor changes {{were made to the}} Grand Caravan ES including many of the features included in Option Group 29S becoming standard, the 17 inch Titan Chrome wheels no longer being an option replaced with standard 16 inch chrome wheels, and the disappearance of the AutoStick Transmission option. This year also saw the appearance of an optional factory-installed rear seat DVD system with single disc player mounted below the HVAC controls, and the addition of a SXT model. 2004 offered an exclusive one year only [...] "Anniversary Edition" [...] package to mark Caravan's 20th year in production. This package was offered on higher level SXT models, and included chrome wheels, body color moldings, special interior accents and a unique fender badge.The 2005 minivans received a mid-cycle refresh including revised front fascias and a mildly restyled interior. This model introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. It was marketed as Stow 'N Go and was available exclusively on long-wheelbase models. In a development program costing $400 million, engineers initially used an Erector Set to visualize the complex interaction of the design and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cables,</b> rear climate control lines, and rear suspension but brought the elimination of all-wheel drive (AWD). The system, in turn, creates a combined volume of 12 cuft L of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat-load floor and a maximum cargo volume of 160.7 cuft L. The Stow 'n Go system received the Popular Science Magazine's [...] "Best of What's New" [...] for 2005 award.|$|R

25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes.</b> Power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional <b>parking</b> <b>brakes,</b> but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> easier. When releasing the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, in bicycles, shifter cables are {{anchored}} on the shifter {{with a small}} cylindrical nipple, concentric {{with the}} <b>cable.</b> Bicycle <b>brake</b> nipples however, vary between mountain bikes (MTB), with straight handlebars, and road bikes, with drop-handlebars. MTB bikes use a barrel-shaped (cylindrical) nipple to anchor the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> at the <b>brake</b> lever, while road bikes have a pear-shaped nipple.

Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include zero offset forks, narrow handlebars, very high pressure tires (100psi and higher), and a very small front sprocket (18-28 teeth).|$|R

5000|$|... "Servo Wave" [...] - This is {{a system}} Shimano {{introduced}} to brake levers which allowed them to pull more <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> {{at the start of}} the lever stroke than at the end, giving improved separation between the brake blocks and the rim to allow for mud and lack of trueness in the wheels while still delivering the same braking power as systems which have a constant ratio between lever movement and cable pull and therefore less pad clearance. This was introduced during the mid-1990s. This was implemented initially by mounting the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on a roller that moves towards the lever pivot in a slot in the lever blade as the lever is pulled. A second design pulled the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> downwards towards a cam near to the brake lever pivot instead. Servo wave has appeared for the first time on a hydraulic disk brake lever on the 2008 Shimano XT groupset.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} important safety subsystems in a vehicle. Its main function is to hold a vehicle in position when parks on a flat or slope road. A typical problem of the mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is that it requires a driver to apply sufficient or sometimes high pulling force to keep the vehicle stationary at any road slopes. Insufficient pulling force may cause the vehicle to move away or known as rollaway phenomenon. In order to overcome such an issue, an electro-mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> (EMPB) is proposed and developed. The EMPB system is then tested using in-house <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> test bench. It is found that the EMPB takes within 0. 6 s to fully engage and within 0. 5 s to disengage the system, respectively at 11. 3 degrees of the road slope. Thus, current design of an EMPB system can prevent rollaway problem and also can be used as alternative replacement for the existing fully mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system...|$|R

5000|$|Electric <b>park</b> <b>brakes</b> (EPB) {{are used}} on {{passenger}} vehicles {{to hold the}} vehicle stationary on grades and flat roads. This was accomplished traditionally using a manual <b>parking</b> <b>brake.</b> With electric <b>park</b> <b>brakes,</b> the driver activates the holding mechanism with a button and the brake pads are then electrically applied onto the rear brakes. This is accomplished by an electronic control unit (ECU) and an actuator mechanism. There are two mechanisms that are currently in production: 1. Cable puller systems and 2.

25|$|Power {{operated}} <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure that a vehicle remains {{stationary}} when it is parked at a certain road slope, the driver has to apply sufficient pulling force on the handbrake lever. Otherwise, the vehicle will start to rollaway where the torque generated by the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is lower that the torque required by the vehicle to remain stationary. This poses a danger situation not only to the vehicle's occupants but also to the people surrounding it. Thus, this paper aims to investigate performance of a typical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system used in passenger cars. A theoretical model of drum-type <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is derived and later being validated by test data that measured from the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> test bench. A good agreement is achieved between calculated and test results. Results from the model show that the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system used in this work can hold the vehicle stationary at 11 degree slope less than 200 N of the applied force and thus it meets the regulation requirement, and also the vehicle will not rollaway even though there are four adult passengers inside it...|$|R

2500|$|In road vehicles, the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> {{also called}} hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. <b>Parking</b> <b>brakes</b> on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a straight pull handle located near the steering column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking.

50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service <b>brake</b> {{circuits}}, the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> circuit, and the trailer brake circuit.

The <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> air tank via a <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve.
