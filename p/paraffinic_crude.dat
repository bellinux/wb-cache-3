Different products require different compositions and properties in the oil. One {{of the most important}} factors is the liquid’s viscosity at various temperatures. Whether or not a crude oil is suitable to be made into a base oil is determined by the concentration of base oil molecules as well as how easily these can be extracted. [...] Base oil is produced by means of refining crude oil. This means that the crude oil is heated in order that various distillates can be separated from one another. During the heating process, light and heavy hydrocarbons are separated - the light ones can be refined to make petrol and other fuels, while the heavier ones are suitable for bitumen and base oils. There are large numbers of crude oils all around the world that {{are used to}} produce base oils. The most common one is a type of <b>paraffinic</b> <b>crude</b> oil, although there are also naphthenic crude oils that create products with better solubility and very good properties at low temperatures. By using hydrogenation technology, in which sulfur and aromatics are removed using hydrogen under high pressure, you can obtain extremely pure base oils, which are suitable when quality requirements are particularly stringent. Chemical substances - additives - are added to the base oil {{in order to meet the}} quality requirements for the end products in terms of, for example, friction and cleaning properties. Certain types of motor oils contain more than twenty percent additives.|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{insulating}} {{mineral oils}} are mainly manufactured from naphthenic crude sources, {{with a small}} number being produced from <b>paraffinic</b> <b>crudes</b> and gas-to-liquids technology. The resulting products are most frequently free of additives, except for certain types of phenol-based oxidation inhibitors, and of a very low percentage by weight, only up to 0. 4 %. The main specifications for electrical insulating oils, Doble TOPS, ASTM D 3487 and IEC 60296, only allow oxidation inhibitors and any other additives must be agreed upon by the entities involved in the selling and purchasing of the product. Over the years, other additives have been used, sometimes unbeknownst to the purchaser, some of which include pour point depressants, gassing tendency additives, other types of oxidation inhibitors, passivators and metal deactivators. This paper discusses the uses of passivators and how they work in transformer systems. Presently, passivators {{are being used to}} control issues with corrosive sulfur but they have also been used to control oxidation stability of the oil and streaming (static) electrification. This paper will focus mainly on the use of passivators to control corrosive sulfur...|$|R

Wax deposition is an important problem in the petroleum industry because it may cause obstruction in well bores, production facilities and transportation pipelines during production. To control or avoid this problem {{it is necessary to}} predict the formation of these deposits under different operational conditions. In this work is presented an implementation of a deposition model proposed by Singh et al., (2000) and applied to a highly <b>paraffinic</b> Colombian <b>crude.</b> Solution was carried out using a CFD code and the analysis considers the behavior of operational variables like: flow rate, wall temperature and time of deposition. dc 201...|$|R

40|$|Rotary {{viscometer}} {{tests of}} crude oil with a high content of resins and asphaltenes (Yaregskoye oil field) and crude oil with high paraffin content (Yaraktinskoye oil field) have been conducted. The typical flow curves for these oil types have been plotted. It has been detected that these oils are non-Newtonian fluids, viscosity of which is dependent on shear rate. Based on Arrhenius-Eyring equation, calculations of viscous flow activation energy and complex structural unit (CSU) sizes have been performed. It has been stated {{that there is a}} tenfold reduction in CSU size in asphaltic crude oil with the increase in shear rate in a rotary viscometer, while particle size in <b>paraffinic</b> <b>crude</b> oil does not essentially change under the same hydrodynamic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Distributed feed {{was applied}} on an Atmospheric Crude Distillation Unit (ACDU) to {{establish}} the energy and capital expenditure saving potential of the distributed feed policy, {{with the aid of}} (Column Profile Maps) CPMs and Aspen Plus as analysis tools. As shown by Holland (2005), the advantages of using distributed feed over single feed are seen in separations with non-sharp split product specifications, thus making ACDU an ideal candidate for feed distribution. For multicomponent mixtures with more than 3 components, compositional plot visualisation is more difficult, thus most graphical methods fail and as a result a representative three component constant volatility mixture of pentane, heptane and hexane was selected on the assumption that it would fairly mimic the <b>paraffinic</b> synthetic <b>crude</b> oil behaviour. After analysis of the three component distributed feed schemes, the ideas were then extended to a synthetic crude oil system in Aspen Plus. The results showed that there was potential to reduce equipment size, such as the condenser and furnace, plus there is a real opportunity to possibly do away with at least one or two pump-around circuits.

40|$|The phase {{separation}} of <b>paraffinic</b> solids from <b>crude</b> oil constitutes a major operating {{issue for the}} petroleum industry, {{in view of the}} fact that the association of wax crystals into a disordered spanning network can lead to severe flow assurance problems. Although the presence of water in crude oil is quite common, its impact on waxy crude oil gelation and rheology has not received much more attention in the literature. In this study, we show that the presence of water above a threshold value can greatly enhance gel formation, changing both the pour point temperature and the yield strength. The rheological characteristics of crude oils are examined both above and below the gel point and a qualitative interpretation of the structure of waxy crude oil gels in the presence of water is proposed. The results suggest that the impact of emulsified water on pour point and gel rheology needs to be added to the standard tests conducted on crude oils during field development studies...|$|R

Microorganisms were {{obtained}} by separation and purification experiment from waxy oil production wells in Daqing Oilfield. The paraffin removal strain was named for S 1, and the biological surfactant strain was named for G 1. Microscopic and morphological examinations showed strain S 1 was to be Bacillus Subtilis and strain G 1 was to be Bacillus Cereus. As {{an indicator of the}} degradation of paraffin, strain S 1 and strain G 1 were added in different proportions, the optimum proportion was 5 : 2. In this proportion the degradation rate of paraffin could reach to 64 %, the prevention rate of paraffin could reach to 55 %. By experiment after mixed bacteria group treatment, the viscosity of crude oil reduced from 36. 9 mPa&bulls to 27. 8 mPa&bulls, the reduction rate of viscosity was 24. 7 %, and the freezing point of crude oil reduced by 3. 6 掳C, <b>paraffinic</b> hydrocarbons of <b>crude</b> oil were degraded. 漏 (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R
30|$|Experimental runs were {{conducted}} in a down flow and riser-type pilot plants and a demonstration plant using various catalysts, additives and feedstocks. The results demonstrated {{the advantage of the}} down flow technology to suppress back-mixing and reduce thermal cracking reactions, thereby increasing the yield of light olefins (ethylene, propylene and butylenes) while minimizing dry gas and coke yields despite the high operating temperatures [3]. Using <b>paraffinic</b> <b>crude</b> based vacuum gas oil (VGO) feed and proprietary ultrastable Y-type (USY) FCC catalyst, propylene yield of 25  wt % (feed basis) and gasoline yield of 30  wt % were obtained under HS-FCC reaction conditions [4]. Increasing the yield of the valuable light olefins, especially propylene and butenes, is a profitable opportunity for integrated refineries. As global petrochemical demand for propylene continues to grow, opportunities for improved production routes will emerge. Propylene is used as a feedstock {{for a wide range of}} polymers, product intermediates, chemicals and derivatives. The processing of propylene to polypropylene improves refinery margins and increases revenues because of the high value of polypropylene.|$|E

This work reports investigations on oil sorption behavior of a commercially available hydrophobic nano-silica when tested with a light <b>paraffinic</b> <b>crude</b> oil and a heavy aromatic crude oil. Sorption experiments were carried out in batch sorption system under static and dynamic conditions. Influence of mass of sorbent, sorption time, temperature and pH value of water on sorption capacity were tested and compared to find an optimal operational conditions for adsorption process.

40|$|Five {{experimental}} petroleum extracts {{were produced}} from luboil distillates derived from Middle East <b>paraffinic</b> <b>crude</b> by solvent extraction and severe hydrotreatment. The polycyclic aromatic content (PCA) of the extracts {{was determined by}} dimethyl sulphoxide extraction and ranged from 3. 7 - 9. 2 % w/w. The five extracts were evaluated for their potential to induce cutaneous and systemic neoplasia in female mice derived from Carworth Farm No 1 strain (CF 1). The test substances were applied undiluted (0. 2 ml per application) to the shorn dorsal skin twice weekly for up to 78 weeks, with 48 mice in each treatment group and 96 in the untreated control group; two further groups, each of 48 mice, were similarly treated either with a non-hydrotreated commercial aromatic extract (PCA content, 19. 7 % w/v) or with a low dose of benzo(a) pyrene (12. 5 micrograms/ml acetone). The mice were housed individually in polypropylene cages in specified pathogen free conditions. The incidence of cutaneous and systemic tumours was determined from histological analysis of haematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections. The results were correlated with the PCA content of the extracts and compared with those from female mice exposed to a non-hydrotreated commercial aromatic extract. Four of the hydrotreated extracts were carcinogenic for murine skin; the two products with the lower PCA contents were less carcinogenic than the products with the higher PCA contents and all were less carcinogenic than the commercial extract. One extract with the lowest PCA content was non-carcinogenic. Thus refining by severe hydrotreatment was an effective method of reducing the carcinogenic potential of petroleum aromatic extracts. Although other physicochemical properties may influence the biological activity of oil products, the PCA content determined by dimethyl sulphoxide extraction may be a useful indicator of the potential of oil products to induce cutaneous tumours in experimental animals. There {{was no evidence that}} the commercial or hydrotreated extracts increased the incidence of systemic neoplasms when applied twice weekly to the dorsal skin...|$|E
