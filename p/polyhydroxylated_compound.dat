Eleven high affinity mAbs were recovered. Nine mAbs are isotype IgG (all subisotype IgG 1) and two mAbs are isotype IgM. All mAbs react strongly with EBNA 1 in an ELISA assay while only one mAb (designated 1 EB 6) fails to react in a Western blot assay. The epitopes for these mAbs were mapped to seven different regions, providing good {{coverage of the}} entire EBNA 1 protein. The mAbs had differing affinity for an EBNA 1 /DNA complex with four mAbs able to supershift the complex completely. All mAbs can immunoprecipitate EBNA 1 from E. coli overexpressing EBNA 1. A modified ELISA assay, termed ELISA-elution assay, was used to screen for mAbs that release EBNA 1 {{in the presence of}} a low molecular weight <b>polyhydroxylated</b> <b>compound</b> (polyol) and a nonchaotropic salt. MAbs with this property, termed polyol-responsive (PR) -mAbs, allow gentle elution of labile proteins and protein complexes.

It consists of four tribes, the Hyacintheae, Urgineeae, Ornithogaleae, and Oziroeeae. Members of the Asparagaceae are widely used in traditional remedies {{for the treatment of}} several ailments, such as infections, rheumatism, inflammation and disorders associated with the central nervous system. Different species belonged to Urgineeae tribe (Rhodocodon campanulatus, R. calcicola), Hyacintheae tribe (Chionodoxa luciliae (Gigantea Hort)), Ornithogaleae tribe (Ornithogalum pyramidale and Avonsera convallarioides) have been selected for the present phytochemical study. The bulbs of R. campanulatus yielded five new compounds, a bufadienolide (RC. 1), a homoisoflavonoid (RC. 2) and two acetylated derivatives of a homosoflavonoid (RC. 2 a & RC. 2 b) and an acetylated neolignan (RC. 3 a). The bulbs of R. calcicola gave two known bufadienolides (RA. 1 & RA. 2). C. luciliae yielded ten compounds, including scillascillin-type homoisoflavonoids (CL. 1 -CL. 5 a), 4 -chromanone (CL. 4), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (CL. 6), 3 -benzyl-chromanone type (CL. 7 -CL. 9) and 3 -benzylidene- 4 -chromanone (CL. 10). O. pyramidale yielded new cardenolide glycosides (OP. 1). A. convallarioides gave a known <b>polyhydroxylated</b> <b>compound,</b> polybotrin (AV. 1), a purine nucleoside, adenosine (AV. 2) and trans N-p-coumaroyloctopamine (AV. 3). The Euphorbiaceae family is a large and diverse family which comprises 340 genera. Several species belonging to the Croton genus are employed as traditional medicinal agents in Africa, Asia and South America. The Croton species are popularly used to treat cancer, hypertension, inflammation, rheumatism, bleeding gums, malaria, asthma, diabetes and ulcers. In this study, three Croton species, C. megalocarpus, C. menyhartii and C. rivularis have been investigated for their chemistries. The roots of C. megalocarpus gave ten compounds, six diterpenoid compounds belonged to ent-clerodane (CP. 1 -CP. 6), halimane (CP. 7) and ent-abietane (CP. 8 -CP. 9) and a triterpenoid, lupeol (CP. 10). The leaves of C. menyhartii gave two flavonoids: (CM. 1 -CM. 2) and 4 -hydroxy- 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (CM. 3) as well as large quantities of sitosterol. The leaves of C. rivularis gave one acyclic triterpene, squalene (CR. 1) and an acyclic diterpenoids, phytol (CR. 2). The structures of these compounds were determined using FTIR, MS, 1 D, 2 D NMR studies and CD analysis. Compounds RC. 1 and RC. 3 a, and compound OP. 1, were screened against the NCI 60 cancer cell lines. Compound OP. 1 showed significant growth inhibition of cancer cell lines at five dose concentration level with good responses at the GI 50, TGI and LC 50 parameters.

40|$|The {{recently}} developed technique of bichromophoric derivatization extends {{the utility of}} the exciton chirality method. Selective introduction of two types of exciton chromophores to two different types of hydroxyl groups gives rise to highly characteristic CD curves. Pairs of chromophores are evaluated for two different applications: 1) an oligosaccharide linkage analysis, and 2) elucidation of stereochemistry in acyclic polyhydroxyl compounds with two or more stereocenters. For the latter application, selective introduction of the 9 -anthroate chromophore (lemax = 253 nm) at prirnary hydroxyls, together with the p-methoxycinnamate chromophore (, 1,m" = 311 nm) introduced at secondary hydroxyls of stereocenters, gives rise to highly characteristic CD spectra. Examination by this method of all diastereomeric n-tetrose and n-peritose diethyl dithioacetals indicates that the anthroate/methoxycinnamate bichromophoric approach is a promising method for assignment of stereochemistry in 1, 2, 3 -triols, 1, 2. 3, 4 -tetrols,and other <b>polyhydroxylated</b> <b>compounds...</b>|$|R

Various polysaccharides were tested to encapsulate FSAwt and pre-immobilised FSAwt in LDH (FSAwt@Mg 2 Al-LDH). ι-Carrageenan appears {{as the most}} suitable candidate to prepare biohybrid beads. The retained activities in ι-carrageenan beads were measured for both free FSAwt and immobilised FSAwt revealing a 3 fold higher activity in favour of the pre-immobilised FSA. This result was probably due to a positive interaction between the negatively charged polysaccharide and the positively charged LDH layers. The catalytic activity, the recyclability and the storage of the beads were studied {{in addition to the}} leakage of FSAwt activity from beads.

40|$|Time-resolved {{transient}} {{absorption spectroscopy}} {{has been used}} to study nanosecond and sub-microsecond electron dynamics in aqueous anatase nanoparticles in the presence of hole scavengers: chemisorbed polyols and carbohydrates. These <b>polyhydroxylated</b> <b>compounds</b> are rapidly oxidized by the holes; 50 - 60 % of these holes are scavenged within the duration of 355 nm excitation laser pulse. The scavenging efficiency rapidly increases with the number of anchoring hydroxyl groups and varies considerably {{as a function of the}} carbohydrate structure. A specific binding site for the polyols and carbohydrates is suggested that involves an octahedral Ti atom chelated by the poly-OH ligand. This mode of binding accounts for the depletion of undercoordinated Ti atoms observed in the XANES spectra of polyol coated nanoparticles. We suggest that these binding sites trap a substantial fraction of holes before the latter descend to surface traps and/or recombine with free electrons. The resulting oxygen hole center rapidly loses a CH proton to the environment, yielding a metastable C-centered radical. Comment: 22 pages, 4 figures; to appear in Chem. Phys. Let...|$|R

The Murchison meteorite is the best-characterized carbonaceous meteorite with respect to organic chemistry. The study of its organic compounds has related principally to aqueous meteorite parent body chemistry and compounds of potential importance for the origin of life. Among the classes of organic compounds found in Murchison are amino acids, amides, carboxylic acids, hydroxy acids, sulfonic acids, phosphonic acids, purines and pyrimidines (Table 1).

The conversion yield, the regioselectivity and the reaction rate of the biocatalytic process strongly depended on the ionic liquid used, their water content, the incubation temperature, {{as well as the}} solubility and the concentration of substrates. For most glucosides tested, one major product (monoacylated derivative) was detected {{as a result of the}} acylation of the primary hydroxyl group of glucose moiety. The acylation rate and the regioselectivity of the process are higher in [bmim]BF 4, where the solubility of all glucosides is significantly higher than in [bmim]PF 6 or acetone.

At the optimal reaction conditions the maximum acylation yield was 87 %.

40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} on a transaldolase B variant (TalB F 178 Y) that is able to use dihydroxyacetone (DHA) as donor in aldol reactions. In {{a second round of}} protein engineering, we aimed at improving the affinity of this variant towards nonphosphorylated acceptor aldehydes, that is, glyceraldehyde (GA). The anion binding site was identified in the X-ray structure of TalB F 178 Y where a sulfate ion from the buffer was bound in the active site. Therefore, we performed site-directed saturation mutagenesis at three residues forming the putative phosphate binding site, Arg 181, Ser 226 and Arg 228. The focused libraries were screened for the formation of D-fructose from DHA and d,l-GA by using an adjusted colour assay. The best results with respect to the synthesis of D-fructose were achieved with the TalB F 178 Y/R 181 E variant, which exhibited an at least fivefold increase in affinity towards d,l-GA (KM= 24 mM). We demonstrated that this double mutant can use D-GA, glycolaldehyde and the L-isomer, L-GA, as acceptor substrates. This resulted in preparative synthesis of D-fructose, D-xylulose and L-sorbose when DHA was used as donor. Hence, we engineered a DHA-dependent aldolase that can synthesise the formation of <b>polyhydroxylated</b> <b>compounds</b> from simple and cheap substrates at preparative scale.

The period of most intense biomass burning was characterized by high concentrations of submicron particles rich in carbonaceous material and water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC). At the onset of the rainy period, submicron total carbon (TC) concentrations decreased by about 20 times. In contrast, the concentration of supermicron TC was fairly constant throughout the experiment, pointing to a constant emission of coarse particles from the natural background. About 6 – 8 % of TC (9 – 11 % of WSOC) was speciated at the molecular level by GC-MS and liquid chromatography. <b>Polyhydroxylated</b> <b>compounds,</b> aliphatic and aromatic acids were the main classes of compounds accounted for by individual compound analysis.

In spite of the significant change in the {{chemical composition}} of tracer compounds from the dry to the wet period, the functional groups and the general chemical classes of WSOC changed only to a small extent.

40|$|The {{research}} {{summarized in}} this thesis focuses on directed evolution and enzyme mechanism studies of two aldolases: 2 -deoxyribose- 5 -phosphate aldolase (DERA) and fructose- 6 -phosphate aldolase (FSA). Aldolases are nature’s own catalysts {{for one of the}} most fundamental reactions in organic chemistry: the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds. In biological systems, aldol formation and cleavage reactions play central roles in sugar metabolism. In organic synthesis, aldolases attract great attention as environmentally friendly alternative for the synthesis of <b>polyhydroxylated</b> <b>compounds</b> in stereocontrolled manner. However, naturally occurring aldolases can hardly be used directly in organic synthesis mainly due to their narrow substrate scopes, especially phosphate dependency on substrate level. Semi-rational directed evolution was used in order to investigate the possibility of expanding the substrate scope of both DERA and FSA and to understand more about the relationship between protein structure and catalytic properties. The first two projects focus on the directed evolution of DERA and studies of the enzyme mechanism. The directed evolution project aims to alter the acceptor substrate preference from phosphorylated aldehydes to aryl-substituted aldehydes. Effort has been made to develop screening methods and screen for variants with desired properties.   In the study of enzyme mechanism where enzyme steady state kinetic studies were combined with molecular dynamic simulations, we investigated the role of Ser 238 and Ser 239 in the phosphate binding site and the possible connection between enzyme dynamics and catalytic properties. The other two projects focus on the directed evolution of FSA and the development of a new screening assay facilitating screening for FSA variants with improved activity in catalyzing aldol reaction between phenylacetaldehyde and hydroxyacetone. The new assay is based on a coupled enzyme system using an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase, FucO DA 1472, as reporting enzyme. The assay has been successfully used to identify a hit with 9 -fold improvement in catalytic efficiency and to determine the steady state kinetic parameters of wild-type FSA as well as the mutants. The results from directed evolution illustrated the high degree malleability of FSA active site. This opens up possibilities to generate FSA variants which could utilize both aryl-substituted donor and acceptor substrates. ...|$|R

Therefore, we decided to investigate the pharmacological properties of mulberroside A in primary culture of rat cortical neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R), evaluating its ability to counteract the hypoxia-ischemia impairment. The results showed that mulberroside A elicited neuroprotective effects comparable to nimodipine. The mechanistic studies showed that mulberroside A decreased the expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, and IL- 6 and inhibited the activation of NALP 3, caspase- 1, and nuclear factor-kappa B and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p 38, exhibiting anti-inflammatory antiapoptotic effects. Our results also further demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokines of IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, and TNF-alpha are promising targets for treatment of cerebral ischemic injury.

40|$|AbstractThe {{scope of}} the present review focuses on the {{interfacial}} properties of cell membranes that may establish {{a link between the}} membrane and the cytosolic components. We present evidences that the current view of the membrane as a barrier of permeability that contains an aqueous solution of macromolecules may be replaced by one in which the membrane plays a structural and functional role. Although this idea has been previously suggested, the present is the first systematic work that puts into relevance the relation water–membrane in terms of thermodynamic and structural properties of the interphases that cannot be ignored in the understanding of cell function. To pursue this aim, we introduce a new definition of interphase, in which the water is organized in different levels on the surface with different binding energies. Altogether determines the surface free energy necessary for the structural response to changes in the surrounding media. The physical chemical properties of this region are interpreted in terms of hydration water and confined water, which explain the interaction with proteins and could affect the modulation of enzyme activity. Information provided by several methodologies indicates that the organization of the hydration states is not restricted to the membrane plane albeit to a region extending into the cytoplasm, in which polar head groups play a relevant role. In addition, dynamic properties studied by cyclic voltammetry allow one to deduce the energetics of the conformational changes of the lipid head group in relation to the head–head interactions due to the presence of carbonyls and phosphates at the interphase. These groups are, apparently, surrounded by more than one layer of water molecules: a tightly bound shell, that mostly contributes to the dipole potential, and a second one that may be displaced by proteins and osmotic stress. Hydration water around carbonyl and phosphate groups may change by the presence of <b>polyhydroxylated</b> <b>compounds</b> or by changing the chemical groups esterified to the phosphates, mainly choline, ethanolamine or glycerol. Thus, surface membrane properties, such as the dipole potential and the surface pressure, are modulated by the water at the interphase region by changing the structure of the membrane components. An understanding of the properties of the structural water located at the hydration sites and the functional water confined around the polar head groups modulated by the hydrocarbon chains is helpful to interpret and analyze the consequences of water loss at the membranes of dehydrated cells. In this regard, a correlation between the effects of water activity on cell growth and the lipid composition is discussed in terms of the recovery of the cell volume and their viability. Critical analyses of the properties of water at the interface of lipid membranes merging from these results and others from the literature suggest that the interface links the membrane with the aqueous soluble proteins in a functional unit in which the cell may be considered as a complex structure stabilized by water rather than a water solution of macromolecules surrounded by a semi permeable barrier...|$|R

40|$|Phytoecdysteroids are plant-produced <b>polyhydroxylated</b> steroidal <b>compounds</b> {{that have}} valued bioactivities {{including}} plant defense against herbivorous insects, and growth and performance-enhancing properties in mammals. In this program of research, phytoecdysteroid accumulation {{was investigated in}} Ajuga turkestanica (Regel) Briq., a medicinal herb indigenous to Central Asia, and in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), a valuable crop produced worldwide, and purported bioactivities were examined in in vitro and in vivo mouse models. Results showed that A. turkestanica hairy root cultures were a sustainable alternative source of valued phytochemicals compared to wild-harvesting (Chapter 2). Extracts from both wild-harvested A. turkestanica shoots and hairy root cultures enhanced protein synthesis in murine cell cultures. In spinach, significant variations in phytoecdysteroid accumulation in seeds and shoots was demonstrated, which may help further investigations of plant defense properties and biosynthetic regulation (Chapter 3). A review of strategies to investigate anabolic effects of phytoecdysteroids lead to the evaluation of a continuous infusion of 20 -hydroxyecdysone, the predominant phytoecdysteroid, on body tissue composition and skeletal muscle gene expression (Chapters 4 and 5) in mice. The mass of the triceps brachii muscles was significantly increased, however, no differences between treatment groups were observed in the other parameters measured. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis identified genes with the most evidence for differential expression from microarray gene expression data, which included genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction. These results provide leads and resources for future research on phytoecdysteroids, which have demonstrated potential in improving agriculture and human health...|$|R

Fecha de lectura: 22 - 05 - 2009 Antioxidants protect cells {{against the}} effects of harmful free radicals and {{play an important role}} in preventing many human diseases (e. g. cancer, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, inflammatory disorders, etc.) and aging itself. In addition, antioxidant molecules are employed to prevent unsaturated oil products from becoming rancid during storage, thus extending oil life. The modification of natural antioxidants in order to increase their miscibility and/or stability towards the action of light and/or oxygen renders a series of “semisynthetic” antioxidants with great value-added in the food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. These antioxidant derivatives may have impact not only as food preservatives but also as components of functional foods and nutraceuticals. Vitamin E (acting as a free radical scavenger) enhances the oxidative stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids towards peroxidation and, to increase its stability, is generally administered in the form of all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate. Several approaches have been described for the enzyme-catalysed synthesis of vitamin E acetate, e. g. the regioselective hydrolysis of α-isophorone followed by reaction with isophytol. We have investigated the modification of antioxidant vitamin E by acylation with vinyl acetate catalyzed by lipases. Several parameters have been probed: (1) the source of the enzyme and its water content; (2) the effect of the carriers; and (3) the composition of the reaction medium. Resveratrol (trans- 3, 5, 4 '-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic phytochemical found in grapes and wine that is biosynthesized in response to pathogenic attack or stress conditions. It possesses a variety of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumour, cardioprotective and immunomodulatory bioactivities. As part of our interest in regioselective biotransformations of <b>polyhydroxylated</b> <b>compounds,</b> we have investigated the one-step enzymatic synthesis of acylated or glycosylated resveratrol by enzyme-catalyzed processes. Such modifications could render derivatives bearing different acyl- or glucosyl- groups in various positions, which may beneficially affect their bioavailability and/or pharmacological properties. Although the three phenolic groups of resveratrol at positions 3 -, 5 - and 4 ’- exhibit very similar chemical reactivity, our results suggest that the regioselectivity of the acylation can be controlled by an adequate selection of the biocatalyst. Regarding the glucosylation, we have investigated the modification of resveratrol by glucosyltransferases, with starch as glucosyl donor. We studied several parameters: (1) source of the enzyme, (2) presence of cosolvents, (3) reaction temperature, (4) weight ratio donor (starch) : acceptor (resveratrol). We obtained 14 new resveratrol glucosides, which were further characterized by HPLC-MS and NMR. Using Rancimat test and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity assay (TEAC), we studied the antioxidant capability of all new derivatives of tocopherol and resveratrol. To know the surfactant properties of resveratrol glucosides, we measured the variation of the surface tension vs concentration in order to determinate the value of critical micellar concentration. Apart from this, we have characterized a new group of epoxy-activated supports, called DilbeadsTM, based on methacrylate, to immobilize enzymes (Dilbeads TA, DVK, SZ, EZ, NK and RS). Scanning electron microscopy, mercury intrusion porosimetry analysis and nitrogen adsortion isotherms were employed. We have studied the distribution of a sterol sterase within Dilbeads using fluorescence confocal microscopy and a FITC-labelled enzyme. Most of the enzyme molecules are confined in a surface layer of 10. 5 μm width. There is an apparent diffusional limitations of enzyme molecules to reach the center of the bead particle, which can be caused by several factors including: (1) the tortuosity of the pore structure; (2) the steric hindrance exerted by the enzyme molecules that are immobilized in the shell of the particle. 1...|$|R
40|$|A mutant of D-fructose- 6 -phosphate {{aldolase}} (FSA) of Escherichia coli, FSA A 129 S, {{with improved}} catalytic efficiency towards dihydroxyacetone (DHA), the donor substrate in aldol addition reactions, was explored for synthetic applications. The kcat/KM value for DHA was 17 -fold higher with FSA A 129 S than that with FSA wild type (FSA wt). On the other hand, for hydroxyacetone as donor substrate FSA A 129 S {{was found to}} be 3. 5 -fold less efficient than FSA wt. Furthermore, FSA A 129 S also accepted glycolaldehyde (GA) as donor substrate with 3. 3 -fold lower affinity than FSA wt. This differential selectivity of both FSA wt and FSA A 129 S for GA makes them complementary biocatalysts allowing a control over donor and acceptor roles, which is particularly useful in carboligation multi-step cascade synthesis of <b>polyhydroxylated</b> complex <b>compounds.</b> Production of the mutant protein was also improved for its convenient use in synthesis. Several carbohydrates and nitrocyclitols were efficiently prepared, demonstrating the versatile potential of FSA A 129 S as biocatalyst in organic synthesis.

40|$|Leprosy or Hansen {{disease is}} a slowly {{progressive}} infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae,affecting the skin and peripheral nerves and resulting in disabling deformities. Studies show that M. lepraebinds to nasal epithelial cells in human after binding to fibronectin, using Beta-integrins (ITGB 1) asreceptors. The corresponding component on M. leprae, which binds to fibronectin, Fibronectin AttachmentProtein (FAP), has been identified. The 3 D structure of both the human (ITGB 1) and M. leprae (FAP-L) protein involved in this mechanism are modeled using homology modeling. Hemolin, an insect-immuneprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily is found to have an efficient defense system againstbacterial infections. So this protein is selected and its 3 D structure is modeled too. The active compoundAnacardic acid of marine brown alga Fucus vesiculosus and the <b>compound</b> <b>Polyhydroxylated</b> fucophloretholof Anacardium occidentale is found to have antibacterial activity. Their structure was drawn usingChemsketch, combined and converted to *. pdb. The combination is docked with Hemolin protein. Thisdocked compound is again redocked with the human ITGB 1 protein using GRAMM-X.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, microalgae {{belonging}} to Ostreopsis genus have been blooming along Italian coastlines, causing serious concerns to both environment and public health. In fact, concurrently to the algal blooms, environmental sufferings involving mostly epibenthos were observed and symptoms of respiratory distress occured in people exposed to marine aerosols by recreational or working activities. Such a phenomenon was recorded {{for the first time}} during summer 1998 along the north-western Tuscanian coasts, but reached alarming proportions in late July 2005, when about 200 people exposed to marine aerosols on the beach and promenade of Genoa required extended hospitalization. Human illness was concurrent with a massive bloom of Ostreopsis ovata along the Genoa coasts and disappeared as O. ovata population decreased. From 2006 onwards, O. ovata outbreaks have been observed every single year along the whole Tyrrhenian coasts from Liguria to Sicily {{as well as in the}} Adriatic Sea. These episodes caused great concern as Ostreopsis species are reported to produce palytoxin-like compounds. Palytoxin is a complex <b>polyhydroxylated</b> water-soluble <b>compound</b> and one of the most potent non-protein marine toxins so far known. A method for determination of palytoxin, based on combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS), was developed by our group and used to investigate toxin profile of plankton collected along the Genoa coasts during 2005 and 2006 toxic outbreaks. In all O. ovata samples, the presence of two main toxins was highlighted: putative palytoxin and a much more abundant palytoxin-like compound never reported so far, ovatoxin-a; this latter shares part structure A with palytoxin. In 2007, Regione Campania has started a monitoring program to investigate the presence of O. ovata along the Campania coastlines. In this frame, we set up extraction methods for fast and accurate analyses of both seawater and seafood samples. A relevant number of plankton, mussels and sea-urchins samples collected at various sites were analyzed by LC-MS and the presence of putative palytoxin and ovatoxin-a was ascertained, indicating that both toxins had entered the marine food web with potential risk for the health of seafood consumer...|$|R
