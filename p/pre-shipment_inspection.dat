5000|$|Non-tariff {{barriers}} to trade (NTBs) or sometimes called [...] "Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs)" [...] are trade barriers that restrict imports or exports of goods or services through mechanisms other than the simple imposition of tariffs. The SADC says, [...] "a Non-Tariff Barrier is any obstacle to international trade {{that is not an}} import or export duty. They may take the form of import quotas, subsidies, customs delays, technical barriers, or other systems preventing or impeding trade." [...] According to the World Trade Organisation, non-tariff {{barriers to}} trade include import licensing, rules for valuation of goods at customs, <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspections,</b> rules of origin ('made in'), and trade prepared investment measures.|$|R

30|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} {{analyzing}} {{the impact of}} TPP (with and without the USA) on China using a CGE modeling exercise. Schott (2013) does a comprehensive discussion on the features of TPP and reflects on its possible implementation for China, but his study {{is not based on}} any model building exercise. Petri et al. (2016) use a CGE model to analyze the implications of TPP but for several countries/regions—America, Asia, Oceania and Rest of the world. Impact on China is discussed as part of its discussion on Asia. Xin (2014) focusses on impact on China and also uses a CGE modeling exercise. He considers two liberalization scenarios: one with China and the other without China. But the study considers full tariff liberalization unlike the present study which looks at the implications of the TPP for the members and China taking into account the actual phased tariff liberalization commitments of the member countries. The study further does two more simulations—first, a scenario where the developing member countries experience input augmenting technical changes due to the likely development of production networks within the region and second, the improvement in trade costs between members, particularly the developing countries. Given its scope and coverage, TPP {{is one of the most}} comprehensive trade deals of recent times. It includes not only tariff liberalization but also easing of non-tariff barriers like custom rules and <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspections.</b> Thus, an analysis of its impact based only on tariff liberalization is rather an incomplete analysis. The present study seeks to fill this gap by calibrating various trade integration scenarios involving tariff and non-tariff liberalization and improved market access between the members of the TPP agreement. Besides, all the studies by Schott (2013), Petri et al. (2016) and Xin (2014) consider the TPP deal in its original form where the USA was one of the negotiating countries. There is no study which discusses the impact of TPP, without the USA on China to the best of the knowledge of the present researchers. The present study contributes toward filling up that gap too.|$|R
50|$|While {{engaging}} a <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> agency {{may appear}} justified {{in a country}} with an inexperienced or inadequate customs establishment, the measure {{has not been able to}} plug the loophole and protect revenue. It has been found that evasion of customs duty escalated when pre-shipment agencies took over. It has also been alleged that involvement of such agencies has caused shipping delays. Privatization of customs has been viewed as a fatal remedy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> can be {{agreed upon}} between a buyer, a supplier, and a bank, {{and it can}} be used to {{initiate}} payment for a letter of credit. A PSI can be performed at different stages before shipment, such as checking the total amount of goods and packing, controlling the quality or consistency of goods, checking of all documentation, as for example test reports, packaging list, or verification of compliance with standards of the destination country like ASME, CE mark and import duties.|$|E
50|$|Customs {{is part of}} one of {{the three}} basic {{functions}} of a government, namely: administration; maintenance of law, order, and justice; and collection of revenue. However, in a bid to mitigate corruption, many countries have partly privatised their customs. This has occurred by way of contracting <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> agencies, which examine the cargo and verify the declared value before importation occurs. The country's customs is obliged to accept the agency's report for the purpose of assessing duties and taxes at the port of entry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> (PSI) {{agencies}} are companies that carry out physical {{inspection of the}} cargo and certify {{the value of the}} consignment after verification of the declared price against the ruling international price. Then the Customs authorities calculate the leviable of amount of duties and taxes on the basis of that certified value. This essentially has shifted the critical task of tax assessment to the PSI companies from the Customs inspectors and appraisers who were supposed to ascertain the assessable value of a consignment in accordance with the GATT valuation code.|$|E
50|$|An {{acceptable}} {{quality level}} {{is a test}} and/or inspection standard that prescribes {{the range of the}} number of defective components that is considered acceptable when random sampling those components during an inspection. The defects found during an electronic or electrical test, or during a physical (mechanical) inspection, are sometimes classified into three levels: critical, major and minor. Critical defects are those that render the product unsafe or hazardous for the end user or that contravene mandatory regulations. Major defects can result in the product's failure, reducing its marketability, usability or saleability. Lastly, minor defects do not affect the product's marketability or usability, but represent workmanship defects that make the product fall short of defined quality standards. Different companies maintain different interpretations of each defect type. In order to avoid argument, buyers and sellers agree on an AQL standard, chosen according to the level of risk each party assumes, which they use as a reference during <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} some factors that reduce evasion of customs duties in developing countries. Following the recent literature on customs evasion, we proxy customs fraud by discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. Estimates first {{show that the}} more frequently a product is imported, the more customs fraud reduces. We argue that this result {{is indicative of the}} fact that customs officers use what they have learned from similar import declarations - use customs' internal information - to better assess the compliance of declarations. Then, we show that relying on an information provider - a <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> company in our case - seems to increase tax enforcement. Results indicate that pre-shipment inspections significantly reduce observed discrepancies in trade statistics. In line with previous studies, we find that the semi-elasticity of evasion increases with the tax rate. Finally, estimates confirm that enforcement is product-varying. Results are robust to various robustness checks...|$|E
40|$|If {{the only}} {{solution}} tried for customs corruption and evasion in a developing country is to outsource certain customs functions to a <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> (PSI) company, PSI will prove more of a fiscal burden than a panacea. PSI works best in countries where the customs service already performs fairly well-by reducing the costs of catching evaders. Typically a developing country's customs service brings in {{a large share of}} its revenues and accounts for an even larger share of its corruption. One prescription popular among development agencies for reducing corruption and customs evasion by importers has been to outsource certain customs functions to <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> (PSI) companies. More than 35 countries employ PSI as a second-best solution to corruption in customs collection. But whether PSI companies are an effective alternative to comprehensive civil service reform has been widely questioned. The success of PSI contracts depends on the institutional environment-the formal and informal rules of enforcement that affect different agents'incentives-but the reasons for PSI's success or failure in different institutional settings have not been well understood. Johnson presents a simple model highlighting the principal-agent problems in a typical PSI contract. Based on his conclusions, he suggests that PSI should be thought of less as a second-best alternative to customs reform (in countries where the customs service performs poorly) than as a cost-effective complement to reforms in"intermediate"cases (countries where the customs service already performs fairly well). PSI could help in these intermediate cases by reducing the costs of catching evaders. This {{would make it easier for}} the ministry of finance to maintain separate reforms to eliminate corruption between customs and importers. In countries where the customs service is powerful-ishighly independent and controls the country's borders-and where the government does not have the institutional ability to put through the complementary reforms essential for using PSI successfully, introducing a PSI contract will add to the burdens of public finance rather than provide the hoped-for panacea.

40|$|Customs {{reform in}} the 21 st century for {{developing}} countries will principally be the redefinition {{of public and private}} sector roles. As customs moves from physical control to documentary compliance, the private sector can and will play a larger role in customs administration. The widespread use of <b>Pre-Shipment</b> <b>Inspection</b> (PSI) and Mexico’s innovative privatized second inspection illustrate these trends. This paper examines Mexico’s recently introduced Second Inspection which is privatized and provides a check on the government’s physical inspection. The Second Inspection is uniquely poised to improve both physical control and documentary audit in Mexico’s customs by defining Rough Justice in customs. Rough Justice is a recognition of the limitations of time and space in customs operations and is an approach that promotes systematic but selective review of contents and documents. Unlike PSI services, Mexico’s Second Inspection builds the capacity of a government’s customs administration. In addition to reviewing the operation of the Second Inspection, the paper concludes with several observations about administrative reform of customs. The two most important conclusions are that administrative reform should promote accountability first and efficiency second, and that appropriate administrative redundancy promotes accountability. Mexico’s Second Inspection has promoted accountability by providing a layer of administrative redundancy...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} empirical {{investigation is}} carried out to ascertain the import-reducing effect of trade protection barriers. We first present a statistical summary {{of the status of}} global trade protection. Then, based on a monopolistic competition trade model and 1994 cross-country data on trade barriers, trade flows, and production, we estimate the import-reducing effect of trade barriers including both tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). We use the disaggregated cross-country, cross-industry data on manufactured goods and, unlike previous studies, our sample covers a broad range of countries-more than 70 in total-including countries from the most developed ones like those in the Group of Seven to the least developed one, Bangladesh. We specify an empirical model that captures the stylized facts well and helps generate sensible estimates. Our econometric framework is designed to control for the simultaneous determination of trade flows, trade barriers, and production. We find that both tariff and NTBs are quite significant in restricting imports.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} future of the world trading system in the face of {{diminishing}} returns from current multilateral trade negotiations and the proliferation of bilateral and regional trade agreements (RTAs). It traces the evolution of the postwar trading regime from {{the early decades of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that were dominated by the United States and the European Communities to the new World Trade Organization (WTO) in which developing countries have begun to play a more important role, especially in the current Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations (MTNs). The paper discusses the substantive and tactical reasons why the Doha Round has progressed so grudgingly and is unlikely to achieve its ambitious objectives. It then examines why developing countries increasingly have turned to RTAs to complement WTO talks, whether these pacts benefit or hinder MTNs, and how RTAs affect the influence of developing countries in the WTO. The final section of the paper looks at the WTO going forward and posits that, after the Doha Round, the trading system in the 21 st century requires substantial reform. The problems of the Doha Round and the proliferation of regionalism confront WTO members with three central challenges: First, multilateralize multilateralism. There are a vast number of exceptions that take the WTO far away from the ideal of a universal system with a single set of rules. The paper suggests that officials focus on the broad exceptions to most-favored nation (MFN) and national treatment in Articles XX and XXI, especially the provisions covering border security and environmental issues. Second, multilateralize regionalism. The challenge is to make the design and implementation of RTAs more WTO-friendly. The paper calls for greater transparency of RTAs through more frequent and rigorous WTO reporting requirements, and new disciplines on discriminatory rules of origin. The paper offers two correctives: cut MFN tariffs and thus reduce the margin of preference for RTA members; or, alternatively, require that RTA members harmonize and lower the MFN tariffs down to the level of the lowest rate applied by any of the RTA members. Third, modernize multilateralism. The WTO agenda needs to be refocused on the problems of international commerce in the 21 st century. WTO rules on taxes and subsidies need to be recast to cover concerns about currency manipulation, regulatory abuse or neglect, and labor market practices as well as to meet the new challenges of climate change initiatives. In addition, WTO members will have to address trade and security linkages before <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> and visa requirements become major obstacles to international flows of goods, services, and people. To do so, the WTO will have to collaborate more effectively with other international economic organizations. " [author's abstract...|$|E
