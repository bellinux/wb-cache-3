5|$|On May21, 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Central Pacific Hurricane Center {{released}} its {{outlook for the}} 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season, <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> total of 2–3 tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin; in a typical season, 4–5 systems cross or form in the Central Pacific. A day later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center {{released its}} seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season, <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> total of 11–16 named storms, 6–9 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes. Below-average activity was expected {{as a result of}} either ENSO-Neutral or La Niña conditions, as well as the continuation of the reduction in activity beginning in 1995.|$|E
5|$|On May21, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) {{issued its}} forecast, <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> season with below-normal activity. It {{predicted}} 8 storms, with a 70% {{chance that the}} number of storms would be between 6 and 10; it predicted 5 hurricanes, with a 70% chance that that number would fall in the range of 3 to 7. UKMO's ACE index prediction was 74 units, with a 70% chance of the index falling in the range of 40 to 108 units. On May27, NOAA released its seasonal forecast, <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> below-normal season with 6 to 11 named storms, 3 to 6 hurricanes, and 0 to 2 major hurricanes. NOAA indicated that there was a 70% chance of a below-normal season, a 20% chance of a near-normal season, and a 10% chance of an above-normal season.|$|E

5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa. Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked {{toward the open}} Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline. The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> favorable environment for tropical cyclone development within the next 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center. Around midnight August30, satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression had formed about 300miles (480km) west-northwest of Conakry, with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h).|$|E
5|$|Hours before Isabel made {{landfall}} on North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} tropical storm warning {{for a portion of}} the southern Long Island coastline from the New Jersey/New York border to Moriches. About a day before the hurricane moved ashore, forecasters estimated the hurricane possessed a 10% chance of passing within 75miles (120km) of New York City. Other portions of southern New England were estimated to have similar probabilities, with the same forecast <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> 3% chance for it passing within 75miles (120km) of Eastport, Maine. By about two days before Isabel struck land until several hours after it moved ashore, forecasters predicted the storm to pass over western New York as a transitioning tropical cyclone before passing into Canada as an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Presently, {{there is}} much {{interest}} in how students study and what skills best facilitate their academic performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how students’ conceptions of knowledge, approaches to learning, and personality relate to academic success. An online survey was completed by 198 first-year tertiary students, including 116 off-campus psychology students. This paper will report the relationships among the key variables. As expected, Quick Learning and Simple Knowledge variables positively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Surface learning approach. In contrast, Innate Ability, Simple Knowledge, and Certain Knowledge variables negatively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Deep learning approach. Innate Ability negatively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Strategic learning approach. However, students’ conceptions of knowledge did not <b>predict</b> academic success. <b>As</b> expected, students who adopted a Surface learning approach experienced lower academic success. Contrary to expectations, however, Deep and Strategic learning approaches did not positively predict academic success. An interesting finding was that Intellect positively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Deep learning approach. Further, Conscientiousness, Intellect, and Emotional Stability positively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Strategic learning approach and negatively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Surface learning approach. Personality also predicted academic success. Neuroticism negatively predicted academic success; Conscientiousness positively predicted academic success. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

The agreement will give member state citizens access to employment and education across the union. It will also entail collaborative policies in many sectors, including agriculture, energy, technology and transportation. These collaborative policies are particularly interesting for countries in Asia seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|On April9, CSU also {{released}} its first quantitative forecast for the 2015 hurricane season, predicting 7 named storms, 3 hurricanes, 1 major hurricane, and a cumulative ACE index of 40 units. The combination of cooler than average {{waters in the}} tropical and subtropical Atlantic, {{as well as a}} developing El Niño predicted to reach at least moderate intensity, were expected to favor one of the least active seasons since the mid-1990s. The probabilities of a major hurricane striking various coastal areas across the Atlantic were lower than average, although CSU stressed that it only takes one landfalling hurricane to make it an active season for residents involved. On April13, North Carolina State University (NCSU) {{released its}} forecast, <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> near record-low season with just 4 to 6 named storms, 1 to 3 hurricanes, and 1 major hurricane.|$|E
5|$|On December 3, 2004, Gray's team {{issued its}} first extended-range {{forecast}} for the 2005 season, <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> slightly above-average season. Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased {{chance of a}} major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States and the Florida peninsula. Though the forecast predicted above-average activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004 season. On April 1, 2005, after confirming that El Niño conditions would not develop, Gray and his team revised the December forecast upward, expecting 13 tropical storms instead of 11 and seven hurricanes instead of six. In addition, {{the chance of a}} storm impacting the United States was raised slightly.|$|E

5|$|Pre-season {{forecasts}} by the Colorado State University (CSU) {{called for}} a below average season, with 10 named storms, 4 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued its first outlook on May24, <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> total of 9–15 named storms, 4–8 hurricanes, and 1–3 major hurricanes; both agencies noted {{the possibility of an}} El Niño, which limits tropical cyclone activity. Following two pre-season storms, the CSU updated their forecast to 13 named storms, 5 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, while the NOAA upped their forecast numbers to 12–17 named storms, 5–8 hurricanes, and 2–3 major hurricanes on August9. Despite this, activity far surpassed the predictions.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Science <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior, with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive amount of heat produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit.

This effect would be even greater with a differentiated Io.|$|E
5|$|Cory Shankman et al. {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} a distant massive perturber on the TNOs used to infer the planet's existence. They simulated clones (objects with similar orbits) of 15 objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU under the influence of a 10 Earth-massed Planet Nine in Batygin and Brown's best fit orbit. While longitude of perihelion alignment of the objects with semi-major axis > 250 AU was observed in their simulations, the alignment of the arguments of perihelion was not. The simulations also revealed an increase in the inclinations of many objects, thereby <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> larger reservoir of high-inclination TNOs. These objects should have been detected in existing surveys but are still unseen so far—suggesting there is a currently missing or unseen signature of Planet Nine. A previously published paper concluded that current observations are insufficient to identify this signature, however. The perihelia of many of the objects also rose and fell smoothly, inconsistent with the current absence of extreme TNOs with perihelia between 50 AU and 70 AU. Their perihelia also reached values where the objects would not be observed and, after declining, fell low enough for the objects to enter planet-crossing orbits leading to their ejection from the Solar System. These factors would require a population of Sednas significantly larger than current estimates, and inconsistent with current models of the early Solar System, to explain current observations. Based on these challenges Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed alignment of the existing TNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.|$|E

5|$|In June, {{predictions}} from CSU and TSR {{were similar}} to pre-season forecasts due to the a lack of an El Niño and warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean. However, by July and August, CSU and TSR all adjusted their forecasts downward because of predictions of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures and above-average wind shear. NOAA also decreased the amount of activity in its final outlook, despite <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> wetter-than-average western Africa and above-average sea surface temperatures in its report. On June3, CSU issued its first mid-season prediction {{for the remainder of}} the year. In its report, the organization continued to predict well above-average activity, with eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165 units. CSU stated that there was a 72% chance of at least one major hurricane impacting any stretch of the United States coastline; the chances of a major hurricane hitting the East Coast and Gulf Coast were 48% and 47%, respectively. The following day, Tropical Storm Risk issued its third forecast for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, calling for sixteen named storms, eight hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE of 134 units; this activity was predicted to be roughly 30% above the 1950–2012 long-term mean. TSR gave a 65% probability that the landfalling ACE index would be above-average. A month later, TSR lowered its numbers to 15named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. On August2, Colorado State University issued another update for the season, lowering its numbers slightly. However, the organization continued to state that there was an above-average probability of a United States and Caribbean major hurricane landfall. Finally, on August8, NOAA issued its second and final outlook for the season, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, six to nine hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes; these numbers were down slightly from its May outlook.|$|E
5|$|On December7, 2011, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), {{a public}} {{consortium}} consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast predicting an above-average hurricane season. In its report, TSR noted that tropical cyclone activity could be about 49% above the 1950–2010 average, with 14.1 (±4.2) tropical storms, 6.7 (±3.0) hurricanes, and 3.3 (±1.6) major hurricanes anticipated, and a cumulative ACE index of 117 (±58). Later that month on December21, Weather Services International (WSI) issued an extended-range forecast <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> near average hurricane season. In its forecast, WSI {{noted that a}} cooler North Atlantic Oscillation not seen in a decade, combined with weakening La Niña, {{would result in a}} near-average season with 12named storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. They also predicted a near-average probability of a hurricane landfall, with a slightly elevated chance on the Gulf Coast of the United States and a slightly reduced chance along the East Coast of the United States. On April 4, 2012, Colorado State University (CSU) issued their updated forecast for the season, calling for a below-normal season due to an increased chance for the development of an El Niño during the season. In April 2012, TSR issued their update forecast for the season, slightly revising down their predictions as well.|$|E
