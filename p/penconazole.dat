An infected plant can be removed from the area, which will slow the spread of infection to other plants, but this often is not desirable. Fungicides, such as mancozeb, chlorothalonil, flutriafol, <b>penconazole,</b> or a copper-based product, applied upon new leaf emergence or first appearance of black spot, can be used to control the disease. If a more natural and nontoxic approach is desired, diluted neem oil is effective both against black spot and as an insecticide against aphids. It is usually necessary to repeat the spraying at seven- to 10-day intervals throughout the warmest part of the growing season, as the fungus is most active at temperatures from 75 to 90 °F.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was {{performed with the}} aim to assess the amount of <b>penconazole</b> losses during field application and the spatial variability of <b>penconazole</b> concentration in a vineyard soil, under two different management techniques (tilled and grass covered). The field dissipation of <b>penconazole</b> under the two techniques was also followed for 114 days, highlighting the effects of spatial variability of the initial concentration and of the grass covering {{in terms of the}} different soil metabolic activity. Data found show that a high percentage of <b>penconazole,</b> from 42. 5 % to 67. 43 %, can reach the soil during the treatments, despite the fact that <b>penconazole</b> is applied to the foliage. The high values of the coefficient of variation for data within rows show considerable variability in all applications, ranging from 30 to 65 in the first application, from 35 to 79 in the second and from 36 to 75 in the third. Since the applications of <b>penconazole</b> occurred under almost same climatic conditions in terms of wind speed and direction, the high variability of concentration of <b>penconazole</b> found within mid-rows was attributed to the uneven slope of the vineyard causing an irregular speed of the sprayer equipment. However, least significant differences of the mean values did not end in a significant difference of <b>penconazole</b> concentration among mid-rows for all applications, indicating that the variability between rows does not contribute to the overall variability. The calculated half-life values for <b>penconazole</b> in tilled soil were 62. 4 days for tilled and 33. 0 for grassed soil, highlighting the tendency of <b>penconazole</b> to faster dissipate in grassed than in tilled soil. Grassed soil was characterised by a higher metabolic activity in terms of microbial biomass carbon content, basal respiration and total hydrolytic activity, than tilled soil. A significant correlation between <b>penconazole</b> dissipation and total hydrolytic activity, was found. The faster dissipation of <b>penconazole</b> in grassed soil was attributed to the higher amount of the total hydrolytic activity which, in grassed soil, was 1. 5 fold-higher than in tilled soil...|$|E

40|$|A {{detached}} leaf bioassay {{was used}} to determine the influence of several film forming polymers and a conventional triazole fungicide on apple scab (Venturia inaequalis (Cooke) G. Wint.) development under laboratory in vitro conditions, supported by two field trials using established apple cv. Golden Delicious to further assess the efficacy of foliar applied film forming polymers as scab protectant compounds. All film forming polymers used in this investigation (Bond, Designer, Nu-Film P, Spray Gard, Moisturin, Companion PCT 12) inhibited germination of conidia, subsequent formation of appressoria and reduced leaf scab severity using a detached leaf bioassay. Regardless of treatment, there were no obvious trends in the percentage of conidia with one to four appressoria 5 days after inoculation. The synthetic fungicide <b>penconazole</b> resulted in the greatest levels of germination inhibition, appressorium development and least leaf scab severity. Under field conditions, scab severity on leaves and fruit of apple cv. Golden Delicious treated with a film forming polymer (Bond, Spray Gard, Moisturin) was less than on untreated controls. However, greatest protection in both field trials was provided by the synthetic fungicide <b>penconazole.</b> Higher chlorophyll fluorescence Fv/Fm emissions in polymer and <b>penconazole</b> treated trees indicated less damage to the leaf photosynthetic system as a result of fungal invasion. In addition, higher SPAD values as measures of leaf chlorophyll content were recorded in polymer and <b>penconazole</b> treated trees. Application of a film forming polymer or <b>penconazole</b> resulted in a higher apple yield per tree at harvest in both the 2005 and 2006 field trials compared to untreated controls. Results suggest application of an appropriate film forming polymer may provide a useful addition to existing methods of apple scab management. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

DHDDMA-clays showed a good capacity to sorb both fungicides from water. Freundlich sorption constants (Kf) increased 22 - 268 -fold for <b>penconazole</b> and 4 - 112 -fold for metalaxyl in relation to natural clays. High sorption irreversibility was observed for <b>penconazole</b> for all modified clays, while for metalaxyl this occurred only for some of the modified clays. Additionally, a comparative study of the sorption of the fungicides by clay minerals modified with organic cations of different structure was carried out by a statistical approach. Non layered and layered clay minerals modified with the two-chain alkylammonium organic cation DHDDMA, and with single-chain organic cations octadecyltrimethylammonium (ODTMA) and hexadecylpyridinium (HDPY) were used as sorbents. The study indicated a significant linear regression between the distribution coefficients Kd of fungicides and the organic carbon (OC) content of the organo clays (r 2 ≥ 0. 80, p< 0. 001). According to this sorption of fungicides by partition between the aqueous solution and the organic medium created by the alkyl chains of the exchanged ammonium cations regardless of the type and structure of these cations is suggested. However, linear relationships between Kd values of each pesticide by the different organo clays and their relative OC contents revealed higher increase in sorption for HDPY-clays (<b>penconazole)</b> and for ODTMA-clays (metalaxyl) pointing out different effectiveness of the OC provided by each organic cation. These effects were also supported by the values of Kd relative to OC, Kdoc.

A non-random sample of 149 residents living within 100  m of fields where pesticides were sprayed provided first morning void urine samples one and/or two days after spraying. Using farmers’ spray information, regulatory exposure assessment (REA) models were applied to estimate potential pesticide intake among residents, with a toxicokinetic (TK) model used to estimate urinary biomarker concentrations in the mornings of the two days following the spray. These were compared with actual measured urinary biomarker concentrations obtained following the spray applications. The study focused on five pesticides (cypermethrin, <b>penconazole,</b> captan, chlorpyrifos and chlormequat). All measured cypermethrin urinary biomarker levels were lower than the REA-predicted concentrations. Over 98 % and 97 % of the measured urinary biomarker concentrations for <b>penconazole</b> and captan respectively were lower than the REA-predicted exposures. Although a number of the chlorpyrifos and chlormequat spray-related urinary biomarker concentrations were greater than the predictions, investigation of the background urinary biomarker concentrations suggests these were not significantly different from the levels expected had no pesticide spraying occurred. The majority of measured concentrations being well below the REA-predicted concentrations indicate that, in these cases, the REA is sufficiently conservative...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Owing to the {{complexity}} of soil composition, accurate predictions of both apoplastic systemicity of lipophilic xenobiotics and their leaching from the soil are made difficult. Therefore, a non-destructive method to assess directly these two components of the spatial behaviour of soil-applied phytochemicals is needed. RESULTS: The plant selected was a dwarf tomato, which can exude an abundant apoplastic fluid through large stomata for several months. The feasibility and reliability of the method were assayed using three triazoles exhibiting different log D values. HPLC-MS analyses indicated that triadimenol (log D = 2. 97) was clearly the most mobile compound within the apoplast, especially its diastereoisomer A. Propiconazole (log D = 3. 65) and <b>penconazole</b> (log D = 4. 64) exhibited a similar low systemicity. The data remained the same when the three fungicides were applied together on the soil. Long time-course studies (1. 5 months) of <b>penconazole</b> behaviour indicated that, in contrast to leaching, which decrease sharply, root-to-shoot translocation remained almost unchanged during the whole experiment, in spite of the high lipophilicity of this fungicide.

Their widespread use has resulted in their introduction into the environment and raised concerns about potential deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the toxicity of the biocides triclosan, <b>penconazole</b> and metalaxyl were evaluated with the freshwater bacterium Caulobacter crescentus and with a freshwater microbial community {{using a combination of}} single- and double-stain flow cytometric assays. Growth of C. [*] crescentus and the freshwater community were repressed by triclosan but not by <b>penconazole</b> or metalaxyl at concentrations up to 250 μM. The repressive effect of triclosan was dependent on culture conditions. Caulobacter crescentus was more sensitive to triclosan when grown with high glucose at high cell density than when grown directly in sterilized lake water at low cell density. This suggests that the use of conventional growth conditions may overestimate biocide toxicity. Additional experiments showed that the freshwater community was more sensitive to triclosan than C. [*] crescentus, with 10 nM of triclosan being sufficient to repress growth and change the phylogenetic composition of the community. These results demonstrate that isolate-based assays may underestimate biocide toxicity and highlight the importance of assessing toxicity directly on natural microbial communities.

Three different treatments were tested in two soils: control soil (unamended), and soil amended with fresh or composted spent mushroom substrates, which correspond to common agricultural practices in Spain. Leaching experiments were performed under non-saturated flow conditions. The model was parameterized with laboratory and literature data, and using pedotransfer functions.

Mancozeb-efosite-Al mixture, diazinon, dicofol, bromopropylate, anziphos-ethyl and phosmet were assessed as moderately harmful. Fenitrothion, phosalone and manzcozeb were assessed as slightly harmful and some of them had delayed detrimental effect on the predatory mites. These pesticides can be used only cautiously in IPM programs. Sulphur, <b>penconazole,</b> trimorfamid and endosulfan were assessed as harmless and can be recommended for vineyards with T. pyriAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The main {{objective}} of this work was to develop and test a pilot scheme for decontaminating pesticide-containing water derived from pesticide mixtures used to protect vineyards, in which the scheme comprises adsorption by an organoclay and includes a system where an enhanced or rapid microbial degradation of the adsorbed residues can occur. Methods In laboratory experiments, the Freundlich adsorption coefficients of formulations of two fungicides, <b>penconazole</b> and cyazofamid, onto the organoclay Cloisite 20 A were measured in order to predict the efficiency of this organoclay in removing these fungicides from the waste spray-tank water. Subsequently, the adsorption tests were repeated in the pilot system {{in order to test}} the practical operation of the depuration scheme.

40|$|Many anthropic activities, {{including}} the agricultural and food industries, {{give rise to}} environmental problems {{for which it is}} necessary to find solutions. The presence of undesirable substances in water, the soil and foodstuffs can pose a risk to the health and hygiene to humans and animals. It is therefore essential to study methods for removing pollutants from these matrices, as to make them compatible with the maintenance of healthy environmental conditions. This paper aims at verifying the possibility of using modified clays (or organic-clays) to remove contaminants from waste water coming from different areas. This work derives from the necessity to overcome the numerous, negative aspects of current techniques and offers new, effective, easy to use and economic methods. The adsorption of the different pesticides onto micelle-clay complexes and unmodified montmorillonite clay were measured to allow the determination of the maximum pesticide quantity adsorbed in order to obtain a dose-effect relationship for practical applications. The modified clay Cloisite 20 A was showed to be more efficient for use in treatment plants for the adsorption of chlorpyrifos and <b>penconazole</b> from aqueous solutions whereas metalaxyl is more efficiently removed by Cloisite 30 B. Adsorption tests in laboratory using Cloisite 20 A were also developed for cyazofamid and cyprodinil and the results showed a high affinity of the both fungicides for the organoclay. Therefore Cloisite 20 A was show to be the most efficient organoclay from those tested in this study. This, in part, is explained by the structure of the modifier quaternary salt which contains two aliphatic chains on the structure and determinate a higher space between the layers of the montmorillonite. Subsequently a depuration scheme was developed to test the practical applicability of the Cloisite 20 A organoclay and the results showed it to be efficient for decontaminating pesticide-containing water derived from vineyards. The adsorption tests in the pilot system show a removal of three of the pesticide considered, cyazofamid, <b>penconazole</b> and cyprodinil, to be similar to that predicted from the adsorption tests developed in the laboratory. The recovery of the modified clay after the adsorption was shown to be dependent on the presence of surfactants in the pesticide formulation. For the adsorption test of <b>penconazole,</b> which contains a higher quantity of surfactants in the formulation, if compared with the formulation of cyazofamid, the recovery of Cloisite 20 A was 20 % higher. For the fungicide cyprodinil, formulated with antifoaming agents, an alternative treatment of the clay-water suspension was necessary. After adsorption the suspension was passed through a compost layer which determinates the sedimentation of the clay at the compost surface. Concerning the waste disposal, for instance the organoclay composted after the adsorption, additional treatments appear to be necessary for pesticides with moderate and high persistence in soil as <b>penconazole</b> and cyprodinil. The fungicide cyazofamid shows a significant decrease after 90 days, in favourable conditions of compost humidity and environment temperature. The results of the modelling exercise shows that the FOCUS PEARL model, generally used for calculating leaching and drainage of PPP from open field cultivations to ground/surface water could be parameterised to simulate PPP emissions from greenhouses to surface water. For the case study, weather conditions were found to have a major role on the PPP emissions from glasshouses and the open field. The more controlled climate in the greenhouse prevented a substantial precipitation excess as was observed for the open field, which had a large effect on the leaching concentrations. Furthermore, in greenhouse cultivation it was noticed that the temperature has a slightly higher influence on CC-M emissions from the greenhouse than the irrigation excess volume. However, the main conclusion of this exercise was that there are potential PPP emissions to surface water associated with crop cultivation in greenhouses, contrary to what is stated in the European Council Regulation 1107 / 2009, article 3. Therefore a possible use of the outputs of this exercise is in future work to develop decontamination systems for greenhouses or for open field cultivation...|$|E
40|$|A two phase {{hollow fiber}} liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and gas {{chromatography}} mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the separation and determination of triazole fungicides, namely, <b>penconazole,</b> hexaconazole, diclobutrazole and diniconazole, is described. The extraction conditions were optimized {{for the four}} triazole fungicides as follows: extractant solvent, toluene; extraction time, 20 min; stirring rate, 720 rpm; no salt addition; and no pH adjustment. Under the optimal extraction conditions, the method showed good linearity (r 2 = 0. 997 – 0. 999), acceptable reproducibility (RSD% = 6 – 9 %), low limit of detection (0. 3 – 0. 8 μg·L– 1), and satisfactory relative recoveries.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on {{pesticide}} residues in artichokes treated with Pirimicarb, Chlorpyriphos-methyl, <b>Penconazole</b> and Fenarimol, representing the mostly used pesticides in the protection of this crop. The treatment was performed after covering with plastic films about 50 % globes at different ripening stages. The residues detected 24 hours after treatment were lower than 0. 05 mg/kg for the covered globes, whereas ranged from 0. 32 to 2. 70 mg/kg for the uncovered ones. The residues found in the covered samples were {{probably due to the}} migration of the active ingredients from the leaves to the globes. As far as the uncovered globes are concerned, residues were barely lower than the legal limits {{at the end of the}} pre-harvest interval. Covering of the globes does not compromise the product safety and allows the harvest from the first day after the treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of solid phase microextraction (SPME) for enrichment of pesticides from apple juice was investigated. Samples were diluted with water, extracted by solid-phase microextraction and analysed by gas chromatography using mass-spectrometry detector (MSD) in {{selected ion monitoring}} mode (SIM). The method was tested for the following pesticides used mostly in fruit culturing at Slovakia: tebuthylazine, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos, myclobutanil, cyprodinil, phosalone, pyrimethanil, tebuconazole, kresoxim-methyl, methidathion, <b>penconazole.</b> All pesticides were extracted with polydimethylsiloxane fibre 100 μm thickness. The linear concentration range of application was 0. 05 μg dm− 3 – 10 μg dm− 3. The method described provides detectabilities complying with the maximum residue levels (MRLs) set by regulatory organizations for pesticides in apple juice matrices.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of some pesticide residues in must and wine samples was developed using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography – electron capture detection (GC/ECD). The procedure only needs dilution as sample pre-treatment and is therefore simple, fast and solvent-free. Eight fungicides (vinclozolin, procymidone, iprodione, <b>penconazole,</b> fenarimol, folpet, nuarimol and hexaconazole), one insecticide (chlorpyriphos) and two acaricides (bromopropylate and tetradifon) can be quantified. Good linearity was observed for all the compounds in the range 5 – 100 µg/L. The reproducibility of the measurements was found acceptable (with RSD’s below 20 %). Detection limits of 11 µg/L, on average, are sufficiently below the proposed maximum residue limits (MRL’s) for these compounds in wine. The analytical method was applied to {{the determination of}} these compounds in Portuguese must and wine samples from the Demarcated Region of Alentejo, where any residues could be detected...|$|E

In introduction, theoretical informations are presented concerning electrophoresis instrumentation and theory as well as different electrophoresis modes. Then, enantiomeric separation is introduced through cyclodextrins and possibilities of partial filling mode to finally terminate with a definition of chiral pesticides and some information about their enantioseparation. Concretely, in the experimental part, the evaluation of enantioresolution of several chiral pesticides (trichlorphon, cyproconazole, hexaconazole, imazalil, myclobutanil, <b>penconazole,</b> tebuconazole, propiconazole, and benalaxyl) using CM-β-CD as chiral selector was performed. First of all, a univariate optimization of variables (CM-β-CD injection time, voltage, temperature, pH, and buffer nature and concentration) was carried out for benalaxyl. Finally a screening, involving {{the effect of the}} CM-β-CD injection time, was performed for the other pesticides to check the potential of this CD as chiral selector...|$|E

(2013) who described {{the impact of}} bacterial communities in the same biomixture (soil, straw, peat) contaminated with atrazine. The inoculation of A. discolor in the biomixture produced changes {{in the structure of}} the microbial communities between inoculated biomixture and control. Tortella et al. (2013) found high similarity indices (> 85 %) in DGGE patterns of fungal communities and no difference between inoculated and non-inoculated biomixture. However, the authors observed differences in the DGGE patterns that were associated with the pesticide application. In addition, Coppola et al. (2012) showed an evident modification of microbial diversity in a biomixture contaminated with <b>penconazole,</b> dimethomorph, metalaxyl, azoxystrobin, cyprodinil and fludioxonil by DGGE analysis. The highest degradation of atrazine in the system inoculated, allow to confirm the presence of A. discolor in the process through the DNA showed in the DGGE analysis.|$|E

Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods, premature Golden Delicious apples collected 64, 50, 36 days before harvest and matured fruit were examined for residues of active ingredients. No residues of triflumuron, triazamate, chlorpyrifos, etofenprox, fenoxycarb, kresoxim-methyl, cyprodinyl, difenoconazole and thiram were {{detected in the}} first sampling, also the levels of chlorpyrifos-methyl, <b>penconazole,</b> tebuconazole and tolylfluanid dropped during the pre-harvest interval. Although detectable, residues of pyridaben, thiacloprid, trifloxystrobin and tetraconazole in harvested fruits were below 0. 01 mg kg- 1 what is the maximum concentration of residues acceptable by baby food producer in any raw material to be processed. The only residues exceeding this concentration were captan and teflubenzuron. Based on these data farmers may consider the choice of pesticides for optimisation of treatment plants enabling production of safe crop suitable for baby food production...|$|E
