40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the price and}} volatility behaviour of two similar commodities (Brent Crude Oil and West Texas Intermediate) and attempts to identify the variables that affect their relative <b>price</b> <b>differential.</b> <b>Price</b> <b>spreads</b> and convenience yields are estimated {{in an effort to}} test a number of hypotheses relating to market segmentation, seasonality and maturity effect. Cash and futures price data covering the period 1991 - 1995 reveal that: convenience yields are significant and about 2. 5 % of cash prices on the average; convenience yields exhibit strong yearly and monthly seasonalities due to supply/demand imbalances; convenience yield is a negative function of the level of stocks and behaves like a call option; as maturity of futures contracts nears, their convenience yields get smaller, an indication that the maturity effect exists in futures prices, and crude oil price spreads are affected by convenience yields which act as surrogates for demand/supply conditions and market price behaviour. ...|$|R

The empirical studies cover four aspects: Big Four premium; <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> among accounting firms with different sizes; audit fee differentials within Big Four; audit fee differentials between different industries.

In developing countries where recorded <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> between regions or provinces are large, using the remedy of adjusting for <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> may sometimes lead to very wrong conclusions about the spatial distribution of poverty.

Since China implemented its special split equity structure, the unusual <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> of Chinese cross-listed stocks have been important issues in previous researches all the time. This study focuses on cross-listed Chinese companies which are listed and traded in China, Hong Kong, and the U. S. We discuss the <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> between A-shares and their corresponding B-shares across China's two exchanges (Shanghai and Shenzhen) and their corresponding H-shares, and ADRs. We focus on the financial reforms and the “Black-Swan Events” in China's market to examine their short-term impacts on <b>prices</b> <b>differentials,</b> which are the differences between the pre-event and the post-event. In other words, we pay close attention to whether the level of <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> significantly changed or not. This thesis, by event studies, scrutinizes the “Black-Swan Events” spanning from 1995 to 2008. The research shows that in terms of China financial reform, the flat regulation on stock market brings remarkably positive effects on the <b>price</b> <b>differentials,</b> which is believed to last. It takes time to reform corporate governance and optimize declaration of revolution to await its practical benefits to come, while a brief positive effect is to anticipate. As far as the “Black-Swan Events” is concerned, the impact level on China stock market varies from stage to stage. During the early reforming in China, the crisis impact on <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> retards and briefly rises, which helps promote security. While in the late reforming, as China becomes even internationalized, the <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> are immediately influenced and the effect continues to increase. As to this unexpected “Black-Swan Events”, it attributes to brief increase of <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> and is deviated off norm. This study aims to provide reference, as well as the financial reform sample, for pro-China investors and China administration, in the hope that they stay calm and weather the storm and to be safe from the negative impact. 「黑天鵝事件」（Black-Swan Events）是指看似極不可能發生的事件，具三大特性：不可預測性（稀少性）；衝擊力強大；以及，一旦發生之後，我們會編造出某種解釋，使它看起來不如實際上那麼隨機，而且更易於預測。自中國證券市場實行股權分置結構起，中國雙軌發行公司的異常價差現象一直為學者所探討的重要議題。本研究主要觀察中國上海、深圳A股與其相對雙軌發行的B股、香港H股、美國ADR之價差現象，針對中國金融改革與「黑天鵝事件」，探討其對雙軌發行股票價差的短期影響效果，即事件發生前後短期價差水準之偏離程度。本文以 1995 至 2008 年為研究期間，以事件研究法觀察研究期間所發生之「黑天鵝事件」對價差的影響，結果顯示：就中國金融改革而言，直接規範證券市場的改革，實施時即對價差有顯著正面效果，且效果持續；改革公司治理與宣告性改革消息須時間執行以產生實質改革效益，但會有非常短暫的正面效果。就黑天鵝之金融危機事件而言，不同改革時期之中國證券市場，受金融危機的衝擊效果不同，改革初期的中國，價差受危機影響效果遞延且短暫增加，並有助規避風險；改革後期的中國，與全球連動性提升，價差受危機影響效果立即且持續增加。就黑天鵝突發事件而言，則造成價差暫時性增加，偏離過去水準。本研究期望給予偏好中國市場的投資者及中國政府於黑天鵝事件中，能以不變應萬變，甚至規避負面衝擊，並提供中國政府執行金融改革的參考。目錄 第一章 緒論 [...] . 1 第二章 中國證券市場概況 [...] . 3 第一節 中國證券市場的發展 [...] . 3 第二節 中國市場結構分析 [...] . 5 第三節 中國金融改革 [...] . 6 第三章 文獻回顧 [...] . 11 第一節 黑天鵝效應 [...] . 11 第二節 價差相關文獻 [...] . 11 第三節 其他相關文獻 [...] . 13 第四章 資料與研究方法 [...] . 14 第一節 資料與變數 [...] . 14 第二節 研究方法 [...] . 15 第五章 實證結果分析 [...] . 19 第一節 中國金融改革之價差實證結果 [...] . 19 第二節 黑天鵝事件之價差實證結果 [...] . 22 第六章 結論與建議 [...] . 25 第一節 結論 [...] . 25 第二節 建議 [...] . 26 參考資料 [...] 2...|$|R

M., "How US Antitrust Can Go Astray: The Brand Name Prescription Drug Litigation", International Journal of Business and Economics, 1997, 4, 3, 000 - 000) is incomplete because it presumes the optimality of marginal cost pricing, ignoring the sunk costs of R&D.
