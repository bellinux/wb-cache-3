40|$|Situations {{involving}} people who, due to {{a mental}} illness, are unable to care for themselves or {{pose a threat to}} others are typically handled by the police. Dealing with people experiencing mental illness who are in crisis is inherently challenging work and police officers are often considered to be unprepared and unsupported. When resolving such encounters, police officers have a number of options, including formal dispositions, such as arrest or involuntary hospitalisation, and informal dispositions, such as calming the person down or ignoring the situation. Given that there is no single framework which can be applied to all encounters between law enforcement personnel and people experiencing mental illness, police officers are necessarily afforded some discretion when resolving these situations. Much research has been conducted regarding the factors which influence outcomes following police encounters with people experiencing mental illness. Among these are the policies and procedures which operate in different police organisations, the availability of community mental health resources, whether the encounter was invoked by the police or the public, and the characteristics of the offender and the police officers involved. The broad aims of this thesis were to (i) describe police officers’ perceptions regarding their experiences dealing with people experiencing mental illness in Victoria, Australia, (ii) describe police officers’ attitudes toward working with people experiencing mental illness, and (iii) investigate the <b>predictive</b> capacity of <b>police</b> officers’ attitudes regarding mental illness related to their preferred means for handling cases involving people experiencing mental illness. Three main studies are reported. The first is an investigation of the current interface between police officers in Victoria and people experiencing mental illness. Based on survey data, findings related to the frequency of police contacts, the types of encounters, the signs and symptoms associated with mental illness and the challenges faced by police officers when performing these duties are reported. The second study is an examination of police officers’ attitudes toward people experiencing mental illness. Participants completed a survey measuring their attitudes and the results were then analysed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Analyses revealed four distinct themes underlying the attitudes of surveyed police officers. Broadly speaking, the officers held positive attitudes toward people experiencing mental illness, but negative attitudes about the system that cared for them. Multivariate analyses revealed that the measured attitudes were not associated with demographic characteristics. The third study explored factors which are related to police officers’ preferred means for resolving encounters with people experiencing mental illness. Participants watched one of three vignettes depicting an encounter with a man who might be mentally ill, and were asked to speculate on how they would “likely” and “ideally” resolve the encounter. Each of the vignettes differed according to the apparent severity of the man’s psychiatric symptoms. Discriminant function analysis revealed that the outcomes chosen by officers were related to both the severity of the man’s psychiatric symptoms and the officers’ attitudes toward people experiencing mental illness. These findings highlight the important role played by police officers in managing people in the community who experience mental illness. Some police officers surveyed felt unprepared for this role and many perceived that there was inadequate cooperation from mental health services. Given these challenges, it was important to begin to understand police officers’ attitudes to their work involving people experiencing mental illness. Following quasi-experimental analysis, these attitudes, among with other situational variables, were found to relate to outcomes chosen by police officers following their encounters with people experiencing mental illness...|$|R

50|$|Non-legal controversies also arise {{over the}} passive {{discrimination}} that <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> programs can generate. In New York, a data-driven stop and frisk program was aborted after a US District Court {{found that the}} program constituted racial profiling. Roughly 83% of persons stopped under the program were persons of colour. This discrimination was masked through the noise generated by mass data analysis, leading some academics to state {{that the number of}} factors within <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> algorithms may result in conflicting data and biased sampling. The European Court of Human Rights has also acknowledged the disproportionate targeting of search powers against persons of colour in the UK, highlighting the dangers of smart city technology in <b>predictive</b> <b>policing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> was recently {{tested by the}} Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which found its accuracy to be twice that of its current practices. In Santa Cruz, California, the implementation of <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> over a 6-month period resulted in a 19 percent drop {{in the number of}} burglaries. In Kent, 8.5 percent of all street crime occurred in locations predicted by PredPol, beating the 5 percent from police analysts.|$|E
50|$|The {{high level}} of big data {{collection}} and analytics has raised questions regarding surveillance in smart cities, particularly {{as it relates to}} <b>predictive</b> <b>policing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that anticipatory {{governance}} can be considered hypothetical the certainty of the future is not definite, thus, there is a measure of doubt associated with the practice. For example, following the Great Depression, measures were taken within the United States economy to prevent a depression from ever occurring again, however, the market crash in 2008 still occurred, despite these measures. Anticipatory governance also supersedes information about people that may never happen in actual reality. By drawing conclusions based on anticipatory predictions certain groups in society face the consequences of this practice and are subject to prejudices by others within society. For example, <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> can target specific individuals within a society because the information provided by such analytics and technology, supports recidivism. Recidivism is the concept that people that have committed crimes are likely to recommit offences, thus becoming individuals of interest in <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> data (see <b>Predictive</b> <b>policing).</b> Anticipatory governance can also target specific people and places concerning policing, which affects the behaviours of people within these areas, such as enforcing self-fulfilling prophecies and discrimination.|$|E

5000|$|The use of Precobs {{has risen}} {{different}} questions and concerns. One {{of the main}} concerns of <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> software in general and hence of Precobs refers {{to the use of}} data the software needs to forecast any crimes. Since the software does not use any personal information and the final decision is always met by a police officer, the Bavarian Data Security Officer has qualified Precobs as unproblematic. [...] However, critics of Precobs refer to the possibility of enriching the near repeat prediction process with data deriving from the internet of things and social networks. [...] For example, a 2014 published study suggests that the use of real time Twitter messages could improve automated crime prediction significantly. Other authors believe that the use of Precobs or comparable systems could be a justification for authorities to broadly expand the collection of data. Furthermore, critics question the reliability of the data produced by <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> systems. Generally, the causal link between the reduction in crime numbers and the use of <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> software has been doubted. When tested in Nuremberg, Germany, for example, numbers of break-ins first decreased in the typically burglary-intensive autumn, but then went up again in December. One of the often articulated concerns in this context is that authorities might tend to rely too easily on software predictions instead of their grown experience.|$|E
50|$|<b>Predictive</b> <b>policing</b> uses {{data on the}} times, {{locations}} and nature of past crimes, to provide insight to police strategists concerning where, and at what times, police patrols should patrol, or maintain a presence, {{in order to make}} the best use of resources or to have the greatest chance of detering or preventing future crimes.|$|E
50|$|The system {{depends on}} the data fed in by the {{authorities}}. With regard to a high dark figure of burglaries, the use of systems like Precobs might narrow down {{the focus of the}} authorities too much on a specific area. In addition, especially professional criminals could adapt to the system. Knowing that authorities use a <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> software, criminals could switch to other geographical areas or adopt a specific behavior to mislead the software. This could finally lead to a “run” of mutual behavior prediction.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{the concept}} of <b>predictive</b> <b>policing,</b> TIA aimed to gather {{detailed}} information about individuals in order to anticipate and prevent crimes before they are committed. As part of efforts to win the War on Terror, the program searched for all sorts of personal information in the hunt for terrorists around the globe. Admiral John Poindexter referred to it as a [...] "Manhattan Project for Counter-Terrorism". According to Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), TIA was the [...] "biggest surveillance program {{in the history of the}} United States".|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to general {{awareness of the}} intended purpose of data collection ‘before the fact’, accountability processes ‘after the fact’ are also required. A potential measure is for responsible parties to be notified where some sort of discriminatory decision is made, thus allowing appropriate action to be taken. In data-driven processes, particularly {{in the fields of}} law enforcement, it is difficult to attribute responsibility to a single body or source, as often the information is derived from a number of different locations. Further, opacity is often essential to <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> technologies, as transparency may encourage potential offenders to alter their behaviour to avoid detection.|$|E
50|$|Social sorting is {{understood}} as the breakdown and categorization of group- or person-related raw data into various categories and segments by data manipulators and data brokers. Social sorting involves the key task of separating one group from the other. These groups can be based on income, education, race, ethnicity, profiling, gender, occupation, social status, derived power (social and political) and geographic residence. Depending on {{the goals of the}} manipulator raw data is collected and then further evolves into meaningful data in order to be exploited for a specific purpose. For example, the formulation of profiling and <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> are all derivations of social sorting.|$|E
50|$|Although it is {{possible}} to envisage such law enforcement intervention as becoming the norm where smart city surveillance technologies have been adopted and implemented, <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> has raised a number of legal and non-legal controversies. Firstly, the level of criminal activity in a particular area sufficient to warrant extra patrols is unclear when predicting the commission of offences. The point at which the probability of crime becomes statistically significant is one which legal scholars and courts alike have had trouble defining. Within this framework, there is a degree of arbitrariness upon which the weight of the predictive data analysis must be considered, as high crime areas can only be defined with reference to “low levels of crime”.|$|E
50|$|Government {{surveillance}} {{is arguably}} driven by paternalistic desires to protect citizens, however the individualistic and tailor-made benefits delivered by smart city technology may reduce autonomy. This holds {{particularly true in}} light of the shift towards <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> that occurs within the smart city environment. Whilst nobly intended, such unilateral actions by a Government may be seen as oppressive - with the omnipotent role assumed by the Government seen as giving rise to that of a panoptic institution. Modern cities are increasingly valuing privacy and digital security, as evidenced by the latest “The Economist Safest Cities Index 2015”, where a Digital Security metric was incorporated alongside traditional measures of safety such as Personal Security and Health.|$|E
5000|$|Founded {{thirty years}} prior to when the story is set, Precrime is a <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> system {{dedicated}} to apprehending and detaining people before they {{have the opportunity to}} commit a given crime. This method has replaced the traditional system of discovering a crime and its perpetrator after the crime has already been committed, then issuing punishment after the fact. As Witwer says early on in the story, [...] "punishment was never much of a deterrent and could scarcely have afforded comfort to a victim already dead". Unlike the film adaptation, the story version of Precrime does not deal solely with cases of murder, but all crimes. As Commissioner John A. Anderton (the founder of Precrime) states, [...] "Precrime has cut down felonies by 99.8%." ...|$|E
50|$|Predictive {{techniques}} in policing are not new, as search warrants are a pre-existing example of authorities {{acting on the}} basis of suspicion and prediction in contemporary communities In the smart cities context, <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> is the use of data analytics to determine potential locations of future crime. This data collection often occurs through smartphones carried around by urban populations. Through location-based services in smartphones, the movements of individuals can be tracked and scrutinized by authorities. This {{has the potential to be}} particularly effective in crowd control. By comparing the different velocities of individual smartphone users within a certain location, it is possible for law enforcement authorities to ascertain crowd density. This allows for targeted crowd management and prediction of dangers related to excessive crowding. Police are thus able to take appropriate action (such as information broadcasting) in order to reduce the threat of injuries from incidents (such as crowd stampedes), as well as crowd related crime (such as thefts) from occurring.|$|E
5000|$|Mobile ANPR use is {{widespread}} among US {{law enforcement agencies}} at the city, county, state and federal level. According to a 2012 report by the Police Executive Research Forum, approximately 71% of all US police departments use some form ofANPR. Mobile ANPR is becoming a significant component of municipal <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> strategies and intelligence gathering, {{as well as for}} recovery of stolen vehicles, identification of wanted felons, and revenue collection from individuals who are delinquent on city or state taxes or fines, or monitoring for [...] "Amber Alerts". With the widespread implementation of this technology, many U.S. states now issue misdemeanor citations of up to $500 when a license plate is identified as expired or on the incorrect vehicle. Successfully recognized plates may be matched against databases including [...] "wanted person", [...] "protection order", missing person, gang member, known and suspected terrorist, supervised release, immigration violator, and National Sex Offender lists. In addition to the real-time processing of license plate numbers, ANPR systems in the US collect (and can indefinitely store) data from each license plate capture. Images, dates, times and GPS coordinates can be stockpiled and can help place a suspect at a scene, aid in witness identification, pattern recognition or the tracking of individuals.|$|E
50|$|Further, in the United States, {{searches}} and arrests {{must be made}} on grounds of reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment. This means that officers {{must be able to}} “point to specific and articulable facts” that “warrant the intrusion”, or make a predictive judgment that the person is in possession of an item that related to the commission of an offence. Similar protections, though not constitutionally based, exist in Australia, as well as the UK. The latter was confirmed as binding by the European Court of Human Rights on a number of European nations, which includes civil law states. The ability to formulate such “reasonable suspicion” on the basis of big data algorithms is controversial, with some critics arguing that in the absence of active police corroboration of predictive forecasts, there are insufficient grounds to warrant an arrest. Further, the general nature of predictive forecasts is arguably incompatible with the acceptable standards outlined by the United States Supreme Court with respect to specific individuals. Patterns of crime generated through data analytics are unlikely to generate the level of accurate predictive detail required for police officers to effect an arrest, when compared to informed tip offs. While in the US, courts have allowed profiling to be used in stopping and searching persons in the right context, notable judicial dissents and academic research highlight that profiling lacks probative value. In the UK, a House of Lords Report recommended that such technology be prohibited from use by local authorities, unless they were tied to the investigation of serious criminal offenses. In addition, a major factor in Europe is that <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> technology must be exercised in accordance with legislation that is sufficiently clear on the scope of use (foreseeability) and affords persons adequate legal protection from arbitrary uses of predictive data algorithms.|$|E
40|$|Improving {{knowledge}} {{of crime and}} crime causation is an important focus for many law enforcement agencies. Many believe such knowledge {{can be used to}} predict crime and criminal behavior. <b>Predictive</b> <b>policing</b> is one of a variety of strategies developed by law enforcement personnel and researchers. The practice of law enforcement is frequently reactive, in nature, where police officers respond to crimes after they have been committed. In an effort to prevent future crimes, however, those with an interest in prevention have also added the strategy of proactive policing, where information and advanced analyses are added to their repertoire of approaches.

40|$|<b>Predictive</b> <b>policing</b> {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to determine}} how to allocate police across a city in order to best prevent crime. Discovered crime data (e. g., arrest counts) are used to help update the model, and the process is repeated.

In response, we develop a mathematical model of <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> that proves why this feedback loop occurs, show empirically that this model exhibits such problems, and demonstrate how to change the inputs to a <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> system (in a black-box manner) so the runaway feedback loop does not occur, allowing the true crime rate to be learned. Our results are quantitative: we can establish a link (in our model) between the degree to which runaway feedback causes problems and the disparity in crime rates between areas. Moreover, we can also demonstrate the way in which reported incidents of crime (those reported by residents) and discovered incidents of crime (i. e. those directly observed by police officers dispatched {{as a result of the}} <b>predictive</b> <b>policing</b> algorithm) interact: in brief, while reported incidents can attenuate the degree of runaway feedback, they cannot entirely remove it without the interventions we suggest.
