40|$|We {{report a}} series of Raman-Rayleigh-LIF {{measurements}} in two turbulent natural-gas jet diffusion flames produced by the Delft <b>piloted</b> <b>jet</b> diffusion flame burner. The main objective of the Raman-Rayleigh-LIF measurements was to obtain detailed information on the major species concentrations in the flames. The measurements provide simultaneous data on temperature, the concentrations of the major species and the radicals OH and NO and mixture fraction. The application of the Raman technique in the undiluted natural-gas flames proves to be very challenging {{because of the high}} fluorescence interference levels. The interference contributions to the recorded Raman signals are identified and subtracted using empirical correlations between the Raman signals and the signals on fluorescence interference monitor channels. The calibration and data reduction of the Raman-Rayleigh and LIF signals are discussed in detail. The resulting dataset compares excellently with data from previous experiments. Because the Raman-Rayleigh-LIF data provide quantitative concentrations and accordingly quantitative mixture fractions, they form a valuable and useful extension of the existing database for the Delft <b>piloted</b> <b>jet</b> diffusion flame burner...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} large eddy {{simulation of}} unconfined swirling jets. In the first part, an unconfined annular jet is investigated for swirl numbers ranging from 0 to 1. 2. The {{impact of the}} swirl on the mean flow and the precessing vortex structures in this flow is analysed. In {{the second part of}} the paper, a co-annular <b>pilot</b> <b>jet</b> is introduced near the axis. The investigations show that the additional swirl near the axis has a stronger effect than the <b>pilot</b> <b>jet</b> itself, leading to an almost entire removal of coherent structures...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} impact of heat release and <b>pilot</b> <b>jet</b> {{location}} on the swirling flow structures in a co-annular swirl burner without confinement. Two iso-thermal turbulent swirling flow cases and three turbulent premixed swirling flames are studied {{with the aid of}} large-eddy simulation. Two geometries are considered, one featuring a pilot lance flush with the outlet and one with retracted pilot lance. The Reynolds number is 35, 000. Detailed comparisons with experimental data are performed for velocity statistics and generally good agreement is achieved. Furthermore, coherent structures are analyzed and local power spectra computed. In the non-reactive case with retracted <b>pilot</b> <b>jet,</b> a very strong precessing vortex core (PVC) is observed in both numerical results and the experiment. The PVC is weak in the non-retracted case. In the reactive cases where the whole central recirculation zone (CRZ) is enclosed in the high-temperature post-flame region, the PVC is almost completely suppressed...|$|E
40|$|In lean {{premixed}} combustors, swirling flow {{is widely}} used to stabilize the flame via a swirl-generated central circulation zone (CRZ). However, the CRZ often exhibits a precessing vortex core (PVC) which may drive combustion instabilities. The paper investigates the occurrence of CRZ and PVC in an unconfined double-concentric swirl burner, and the flame response to a sinusoidal variation of the mass flow rate in the <b>pilot</b> <b>jet,</b> {{with the aid of}} large-eddy simulation (LES). The results are compared with a corresponding experiment and detailed analyses of the flow structures are performed. The isothermal flow is also simulated for comparison...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Current work focuses on the development and performance evaluation of advanced flamelet models for turbulent non-premixed and partially premixed combustion in RANS and large eddy simulation (LES) based modelling. A RANS based combustion modelling strategy which {{has the ability to}} capture the detailed structure of turbulent non-premixed flames, including the pollutant NO, and account for the effects of radiation heat loss and transient evolution of NO, has been developed and incorporated into the in-house RANS code. The strategy employs an 'enthalpy-defect' based non-adiabatic flamelet model in conjunction with steady or unsteady nonadiabatic flamelets based NO submodels.

It is concluded that the addition of similar rough-air response capabilities to training simulators would be of value in pilot indoctrination in turbulent-flight procedures...|$|R
