40|$|Background: In a {{traditional}} medical programme prior academic performance {{is a good}} indicator for success. We aimed to determine whether <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> year one correlated with undergraduate <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> Medical Science in our integrated curriculum. Summary of work: Prior <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> anatomy, biochemistry and physiology was accessed for students who had attended the University of Wollongong for their undergraduate studies. Performance was correlated with examination results achieved in year 1. Summary of results: Seventy six students enrolled in Medicine (2007 - 2010), had completed their undergraduate degree at UOW taking subjects in anatomy (n= 63), biochemistry (n= 69) or physiology (n= 69). Prior <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> each discipline significantly correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) with overall <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> a year 1 integratedexamination (r 2 = 0. 33 -anatomy, 0. 21 -biochemistry, 0. 38 - physiology). Current and prior performance was significantly correlated within each discipline, however, physiology (r 2 = 0. 31, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) correlated more strongly than anatomy (r 2 = 0. 07, P= 0. 04) or biochemistry (r 2 = 0. 08, P= 0. 017). Conclusions: Undergraduate <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> medical sciences correlated with academic <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> year 1. Undergraduate <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> physiology had the strongest correlation, suggesting that learning in physiology was able {{to prepare students for}} learning in an integrated curriculum. Take-home messages: Prior academic <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> medical science can be predictors of student <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> first year medical exams...|$|R
