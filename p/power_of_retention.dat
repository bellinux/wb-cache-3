40|$|One of the {{important}} challenges for multinational organisations {{is to increase the}} ability to retain their repatriates. The literature review shows high turnover rates amongst repatriates {{in the first two years}} following return from the international assignment. This paper discusses organisation’s (in) ability to retain its repatriates. A diversity of predictable factors of repatriates’ turnover is identified, including factors related to the job, the organisation, qualification, career development, personality, social context and the market. The paper analysis organisational support practices designed to increase the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> and decrease the turnover. We concluded that research about retention versus turnover of repatriates is scarce, mainly regarding the role a formal repatriation and retention programme in facilitating the retention of these employees with acquired international knowledge and skills, that is, the role that organisational factors play in voluntary turnover decisions. Further research is suggested at the end of the article...|$|E

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of this work a brief idea was given on what is understood as "clay", on the scientific methods applied {{to the study of the}} matter "clay" as well as on its conception with regard to the edaphic studies. A description is given of the methods of total and natural mechanical analyses which were employed in the agro-geological Department. The work is illustrated by a graphic showing the fractions of the mechanical analysis of the chief great soil types of the State of São Paulo. The fraction clay is then studied by chemical way in the following sequence : 1. ° total chemical analysis, 2. ° partial chemical analysis, 3. ° chemical analysis of the Helmholz layer and 4. ° study of the fixation of the ion Ca+ + in the already mentioned Helmholz layer. The first analysis separates and attacks the hydrated aluminium silicates, the hydrated oxyds of iron and aluminium, manganese, etc. In this analysis the relationship between silica and sesquioxyds was determined. The second type of attack or chemical analysis does not affect the hydrated silicates of aluminium, all others go in dissolution. In this analysis were determined chiefly the sesquioxyds in their free form in the clay complex. For the study of the Helmholz layer, i. e. the determination of changeable ions, solutes of NH 4 Cl N/l, HNO 3 N/ 5, KCl N/l, etc. were used, percolation of these liquids being made through a layer of air dried soil. The relationship between soil and liquid was always 1 : 10. In this analysis, principally the cations K+, Ca++, Mg++, Al+ + +, H+ etc. were determined. With such determinations the calculations of the following values were obtained: S = sum of the changeable bases in ME; T = total value in ME of the sorptive power of the complex in each 100 g dried soil at 110 ° C. and V = percentage of saturation of the complexes with bases. Finally, the qualitative radiographic analysis of the fraction clay was carried out by means of the Debye-Scherrer-Hull method. For these studies the Siemens-Berlin apparatus was used, the transformer of which runs with all 0 - 220 volts 60 -cycle alternating current. The bulb has a copper anti-cathode and is fed by a current of 13 m. A. of intensity and the difference of potential is of 30, 000, 35, 000 and 47, 000 volts. The flash of X-rays goes through the nickel filter in order to free it of the b irradiations which are deleterious. In this way, inciding vertically on the preparation, radiations CuK a with l = 1, 539 A are obtained. The sensible film used was a Lawe-Film-Agfa, with an exposure going from 11 / 2 to 2 hours with 35, 000 V. The chassis has a diameter of 57 mm. More than 500 radiographs of soil samples were taken, of those proceding from all districts of the State, 79 of which are presented in the present work. With this material the different constituents of the clay minerals contained in our soils were known. Thus, in the soils over the Archean geological formation, kaolinite is represented most frequently and abundantly; the hydrargillite also appears commonly. The soils over the Glacial formation contain the same representatives and oscillations as those just mentioned. In the Corum-batai formation, quartz is the most important constituent. The Botucatu formation (lava) is that which gave origin to our legitimate red soils; the mineralogical clay constituents of these soils are : 1. ° large amount of hydrated oxyds of iron up to 35 % of Fe 2 O 3 for each 100 g of soil at 110 ° C.; 2. ° hydrargillite and 3. ° kaolinite. The amount of the latter in the clay complex ranges between 9 and 25 %. The sandy soils existing in the geological formations of lower and upper Baurú bear in their clays the following mineralogical constituents : 1. ° kaolinite, 2. ° montmorrillonitic type (on the upper Baurú only), 3. ° hydrargillite (more common on the lower Baurú) and 4. ° quartz, generally, in small percentages. These researches made it evident that the constituents of the clay fraction of our soils commonly have a small sorptive power related to the cations; it follows hence that they do not show a great <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> of manure with the exception of the montmorrillonitic type...|$|E
40|$|Is more always better? Is {{conventional}} wisdom always the right guideline {{in the development}} of security policies that have large opportunity costs? Is the evaluation of security measures after their introduction the best way? In the past, these questions were frequently left unasked before the introduction of many public security measures. In this paper we put forward the new paradigm that agent-based simulations are an effective and most likely the only sustainable way for the evaluation of public security measures in a complex environment. As a case-study we provide a critical assessment <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> Telecommunications Data <b>Retention</b> (TDR), which was introduced in most European countries, despite its huge impact on privacy.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal design <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> in securitisation, {{in order to}} maximize welfare of screening per unit <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> assuming that screening is costly and that the bank intends to securitise its loans. In contrast to the focus of previous literature on tranche retention, we deviate from the constitutional mechanisms <b>of</b> tranche <b>retention</b> to present a pareto-optimal method <b>of</b> tranche <b>retention.</b> Unlike the current ad-hoc-regulations, we derive the optimal design <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> from a utility maximization problem. We show that the level <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> per tranche should be dependent on the rate of credit default, i. e. the higher the rate of default, the higher the optimal rate <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> required to provide an incentive to screen carefully. From this approach, it follows that the rate <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> per tranche should be higher, the higher the position within the ranking order of subordination. Accordingly, the efficiency <b>of</b> tranche <b>retention</b> can be enhanced, reducing the level <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> required to maintain a given level <b>of</b> screening-effort. This <b>retention</b> design entails a recovery of the bank’s equity capital, thereby increasing liquidity and lending capacities...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} <b>of</b> cash <b>retention</b> {{has been}} identified to be an opportunity cost to the contractor, equivalent to interest loss on cash retained, which could amount to a huge sum for larger contract. Literature revealed the use <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> bond as the best solution to the problems <b>of</b> cash <b>retention.</b> Hence, the need to evaluate and compare the cost of ‘cash retention’ and ‘retention bond’ costs to the contractor. This study will assist in improving payment practice {{in the construction industry}} and also improves financial stability of the contractor. Data were collected from interim valuations of completed projects and subsequently analyzed using “compounding method” to evaluate the compound interest loss on cash retained by the client and the cost <b>of</b> providing <b>retention</b> bond in-lieu <b>of</b> cash <b>retention.</b> T-test analysis was further used to determine the level of significance of the difference between both costs.

The identification <b>power</b> <b>of</b> these two parameters, expressed in standardized form (retention index and absorption maximum {{with the highest}} wavelength), is calculated using two approaches: discriminating power (DP) and mean list length (ML/).
