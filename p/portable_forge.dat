60|$|They now {{fixed on}} {{the site for the}} fort. It was upon the top of the bank, some twenty yards above the lode, and it was settled there should be a strong double {{palisade}} running down from it to the stream, so that in case of siege they could fetch water without being exposed to the bullets of an enemy taking post higher up the creek. Among the men from Denver were two or three experienced carpenters, and a blacksmith, for whose use a <b>portable</b> <b>forge</b> had been brought in the waggons.|$|E
60|$|I {{report this}} {{reflection}} in French, since {{the man was}} of Paris, not of Barcelona at all. At the Maranon he lived apart from the station, in a small shed with a metal roof and straw walls, which he called mon atelier. He had a work-bench there. They had given him several horse-blankets and a saddle--not that he ever had occasion to ride, but because no other bedding {{was used by the}} working-hands, who were all vaqueros--cattlemen. And on this horseman's gear, like a son of the plains, he used to sleep amongst the tools of his trade, in a litter of rusty scrap-iron, with a <b>portable</b> <b>forge</b> at his head, under the work-bench sustaining his grimy mosquito-net.|$|E
6000|$|Availing {{himself of}} the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes, and in {{preparation}} for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not removed his <b>portable</b> <b>forge</b> to the hold again, after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pikeheads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.--Most miserable! ...|$|E
50|$|Temporary staging {{could now}} be erected to support the truss {{erection}} process; the trusses were assembled using service bolts, and <b>portable</b> <b>forges</b> were employed on the staging to facilitate the process of riveting the joints.|$|R
50|$|The limbers, caissons, and gun {{carriages}} {{were all}} constructed of oak. Each ammunition chest typically carried about 500 pounds (226.8 kg) of ammunition or supplies. In {{addition to these}} vehicles, there were also battery supply wagons and <b>portable</b> <b>forges</b> {{that were used to}} service the guns.|$|R
25|$|The {{stations}} were approximately 18 miles apart and the teams were changed at each one. The hostlers at the stations {{took pride in}} {{taking care of the}} company's horses, often competing to see who kept the teams in the best condition. One rule that was strictly followed was that each horse had its own harness, which was cleaned every time it was taken off. To ensure that the horses always had proper shoes, traveling horseshoers with <b>portable</b> <b>forges</b> visited the stage stations regularly.|$|R
60|$|Some {{idea of the}} {{magnitude}} and weight of the vessel may be formed {{from the fact that}} each iron plate weighs about the third of a ton, and is fastened with a hundred iron rivets. About thirty thousand of these plates were used in her construction, and three million rivets. The fastening of these rivets was one among the many curious operations performed in course of building. The riveting men were arranged in gangs, each gang consisting of two riveters, one holder-up, and three boys. Two boys were stationed at the fire or <b>portable</b> <b>forge,</b> and one with the holder-up. This boy's duty was to receive the red-hot rivet with his pincers from the boy at the forge, and insert it in the hole destined for its reception, the point protruding about an inch. The holder-up immediately placed his heavy hammer against the head of the rivet, and held it firmly there, while the two riveters assailed it in front with alternate blows, until the countersunk part of the hole was filled up, after which the protruding head was cut off smooth with the plate, the whole operation scarce occupying a minute. In riveting the double part of the ship the holder-up and his boy were necessarily in the interior part of the tubes, and passed the whole day in the narrow space between, (of two feet ten inches wide), in comparative darkness, having only the glimmer afforded by a single dip candle, and being immediately under the deafening blows of the riveters.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1870s he was {{involved}} in the Keystone <b>Portable</b> <b>Forge</b> Company. He also may have revived his Panoramic Directory business in the late 1870s. Upon his death in May 1881, his obituary reported, Baxter was holding [...] "a position at the Custom house." [...] He died on May 9, 1881, and his obituary appeared on the front-page the following day in the Philadelphia Public Ledger.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the death}} of Benjamin Hick in 1842, the firm {{continued}} as Benjamin Hick & Son under the management of his eldest son, John Hick. In 1845 John took his brother-in-law John Hargreaves Jr (1800-1874) into partnership followed by his younger brother William Hargreaves (1821-1889) in 1847. John Hargreaves Jr left the firm in 1851. The same year B. Hick and Son exhibited engineering models and machinery at The Great Exhibition in Class VI. Manufacturing Machines and Tools, including a 6 horse power crank overhead engine and mill-gear driving Hibbert, Platt and Sons' cotton machinery and a 2 hp high-pressure oscillating engine driving a Ryder forging machine. Both engines were modelled in the Egyptian Style. The company received a Council Medal award for its mill gearing, radial drill mandrils and <b>portable</b> <b>forges.</b> The B. Hick & Son London office was at 1 New Broad Street in the City.|$|R
