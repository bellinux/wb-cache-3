The Cruze SE 1.6-liter tested scored a maximum of 16 points in side-impact collision, 14.44 in front-end collision, and 15.73 in the 40percent frontal offset collision. Euro NCAP released its rating in November, with the Chevrolet Cruze again receiving the full five-star grading.

2500|$|Testing {{conducted}} by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) resulted in the Camry XV40 receiving a four-star safety rating or a score of 27.53 out of 37. Dual frontal airbags were fitted to the model tested. ANCAP later tested the hybrid variant fitted with additional side and curtain airbags. The hybrid also scored four-stars, although did achieve a higher 28.22-point grading. Prompted by the five-star ANCAP safety rating mandate for all passenger cars purchased by the Australian federal government from 1 July 2011, Toyota Australia revised the XV40 specification including the fitment of a front passenger seatbelt reminder. This resulted in an upgraded five-star result for Australian models produced from May 2011. While the regular version scored 33.13 points, the hybrid rated marginally better at 33.22 out of 37. The offset crash yielded 14.29 out of 16, with 14.84 out of 16 for the side impact crash test. An additional two points came from completing the pole test, while the seatbelt reminders yielded the qualifying two points required for the five-star result. The hybrid fared identically except in the offset crash test where it gained 0.08 points then picking up 0.01 in the side impact crash.

40|$|This paper {{aimed at}} {{improving}} a bumper system to meet the second phase EEVC (European Enhanced Vehicle Safety Committee) requirements for <b>pedestrian</b> lower leg <b>protection.</b> An approach is presented to optimize the front bumper system for minimizing the risk of pedestrian's lower leg injuries from the bumper impact. Firstly, a vehicle FE model was developed, a two-layer-material EA (Energy Absorber) and a lower stiffener were also developed to attach in the front bumper system. Then some structure parameters of the EA and the lower stiffener were selected and the design of experiment with orthogonal arrays was used to generate the test sample points. Finally, the multi-objective optimization of the structure parameters was conducted based on the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Algorithm). The maximum tibia acceleration, the maximum knee bending angle and the maximum shear displacement were chosen as the objective functions. The optimized results were used to redevelop the EA and the lower stiffener FE modals. The {{results of the study}} show that the performance of the vehicle for lower leg protection could be dramatically improved by the optimization of EA and lower stiffener and the second phase EEVC requirements for <b>pedestrian</b> lower leg <b>protection</b> can be satisfied...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the injury mechanism of pedestrian chests in collisions with passenger vehicles of various frontal shapes and examining {{the influence of the}} local structural stiffness on the chest injury risk by using the headform impact test at the chest contact area of the vehicle. Three simulations of vehicle to pedestrian collisions were conducted using three validated pedestrian finite element (FE) models of three pedestrian heights of 177 (AM 50 th), 165 and 150 cm and three FE vehicles,models representing a one-box vehicle, a minicar and a medium car. The validity of the vehicle models was evaluated by comparing the headform acceleration against the measured responses from headform impact tests. The chest impact kinematics and the injury mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the distribution of the von Mises stress of the ribcage {{and in terms of the}} chest deflections. The chest contact locations on the front panel and the bonnet top were identified in connection to the causation of rib fractures. The risk of rib fractures was predicted by using the von Mises stress distribution. The headform impact tests were carried out at the chest contact area on the front panel and bonnet to examine the safety performance with respect to <b>pedestrian</b> chest <b>protection.</b> In simulations of the one-box vehicle to pedestrian collisions, the chest was struck directly by the frontal structure at a high velocity and deformed substantially, since a shear force was generated by the stiff windshield frame. The acceleration of the headform was related to the rib deflections. The injury threshold of the ribcage deflection (42 mm) corresponded to the headform average acceleration of 68 G. In the minicar collision, the chest was struck with the bonnet top and cowl area at a low velocity, and the deformation was small due to the distributed contact force between the chest and the bonnet top. Besides, the ribcage deformation was too small for bridging a relation between the headform accelerations and rib deflections. In the medium car collision, the deformation mode of the chest was similar to that in the minicar collision. The chest collided with the bonnet top at a low velocity and deformed uniformly. The deflection of the ribs had an observable correlation with the headform accelerations measured in the headform impact tests. The frontal shape of a vehicle has a large influence on a pedestrian's chest loadings, and the chest deformation depends on the size of the pedestrian and the stiffness of the vehicle. The one-box passenger vehicle causes a high chest injury risk. The headform impactor test can be utilized for the evaluation of the local stiffness of a vehicle's frontal structure. The reduction of the headform acceleration is an effective measure for <b>pedestrian</b> chest <b>protection</b> for specific shapes of vehicles by efficacy in modifying the local structural stiffness...|$|R
40|$|The {{front body}} {{structure}} of an automobile should have sufficient stiffness and strength {{to protect the}} occupants during a high speed frontal collision; simultaneously, it should not induce unduly high impact loads during a low speed pedestrian collision. The above requirements {{appear to be in}} conflict with each other. Traditionally, the design solutions for crashworthiness and pedestrian safety have been addressed separately by designing the front rails and back-up structure of a car for crashworthiness and occupant safety, while optimizing the front bumper for <b>pedestrian</b> impact <b>protection.</b> In the current study, it is shown that it would be more prudent to pose the tasks of designing a vehicle for frontal impact and pedestrian impact safety as a single problem of weight reduction (i. e. lightweighting) by considering major vehicle crash safety requirements in the form of US-NCAP (United States New Car Assessment Program) and IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) offset impact test standards, and pedestrian impact safety according to the EEVC/WG 17 (European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee/Working Group 17) standard.

5000|$|Modern safety {{barriers}} {{are designed to}} absorb impact energy and minimize the risk to the occupants of cars and bystanders. For example, most side rails are now anchored to the ground, so that they cannot skewer a passenger compartment. Most light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them. Some road fixtures such as signs and fire hydrants are designed to collapse on impact. Highway authorities have removed trees {{in the vicinity of}} roads; while the idea of [...] "dangerous trees" [...] has attracted a certain amount of skepticism, unforgiving objects such as trees can cause severe damage and injury to errant road users.
