40|$|Background: Only unequivocal {{evidence}} {{confirming the}} total extent of injury. Biomechanical analysis, objectifications of permanent consequences after injury and objectification, whether such injuries influence life activities of an injured person, {{should be the}} basics for <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> expert medical <b>opinion.</b> To make a necessary distinction from the previous injuries or illnesses that might have influence on current health state of a patient and its treatment, analysis of all medical records of a certain injured person is needed. Therefore this are inevitable steps in <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> an expert medical opinion. In cases when medical opinion should explain disability of a patient {{as a consequence of}} a certain contractual relationship, the contract should be taken into consideration when such opinions is prepared. Methods: 500 opinions have been retrospectively analysed, selected at random out <b>of</b> 3452 <b>opinions,</b> submitted in claims for damages at Zavarovalnica Maribor, d. d., in the period from January 2001 until January 2006. Thirteen typical data have been analysed and evaluated on the basis of objective evidences. Results: On the basis of analyses it has been established that there is a great difference between principles of objectification and the data in analysed opinions. It has been noticed the most obvious deviation in biomechanical analysis (95 %), in records of decreased life activities (90 %), in all medical records of an injured person (65 %) and in objectification of permanent consequences after injuries (55 %). Conclusions: As results of analysis demonstrate, there are significant differences in <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> expert and medical opinions in Slovenia, particularly when basic principles are analysed that need to be considered when writing such <b>opinions.</b> Irrational avoidance <b>of</b> basic principle of objectification, nomination of experts without licence in certain fields of medicine, avoidance of objectification of subjective statements of injured people and lack of experience or consequences of disrespect of basic principles in <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> expert <b>opinion</b> all lead towards curtailment of those who pay the claims, especially in cases of banal injuries. Such opinions often mislead injured persons as well and also the ones who order such opinions and especially judges in court proceedings.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{are some}} of the most {{dangerous}} environmental toxins. They were used in plasticizers, varnishes, transformers, or as hydraulic liquid. Their production and use has since been banned. Because of their longevity they still occur in the environment and are to be found in particular in fat-containing food of animal origin like milk, meat, eggs and fish. The European Commission is currently in the process of drawing up maximum level provisions for most PCBs, i. e. the so-called non-dioxin-like PCBs (ndl-PCBs). It envisages using as their representative the sum of six selected ndl-PCBs (Σ 6 PCBs) that frequently occur in food. BfR welcomes the fact that in the new proposal the maximum levels have been reduced for most foods and that fish liver and food for babies and infants has been included in the new proposal. One exception to this positive assessment is, however, the new maximum level for chicken eggs of 75 nanogram (ng) Σ 6 PCBs per gram fat which, in contrast to the first proposal of 50 ng Σ 6 PCBs per gram fat, has been set at an incomprehensibly high level. The maximum level for eggs should be oriented towards the maximum level for poultry meat where 30 ng Σ 6 PCBs per gram fat was established as the maximum level and this is more than 50 % lower, as the PCB contaminations in the fat portion of eggs and poultry meat are roughly the same. * In the <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> BfR the proposed maximum levels for Σ 6 PCBs in food should, however, be lowered further. *After the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> this <b>Opinion,</b> this concern <b>of</b> BfR was presented to the European Commission (DG SANCO) with the consequence that the proposal for the maximum level for chicken eggs was reduced to 50 ng/g fat for Σ 6 PCB...|$|R

The problems were verified {{on the basis}} of a case of sodium azide poisoning which was unique due to its circumstances and the development of an analytical method applied for medico-legal practice. Material and methods : The object of the study was a toxicological analysis of biological specimens collected from a woman who ingested two doses of sodium azide purchased over the Internet, in a suicide attempt. After the ingestion of the first dose, the clinical management in the form of symptomatic treatment indicated a possibility of recovery. However, the ingestion of a second dose of the xenobiotic, already in the hospital, caused death. Toxicological findings were obtained with the dedicated technique of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS-MS) after extraction combined with derivatization using pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr). Results : Post-mortem toxicological studies demonstrated sodium azide in the blood (0. 18 mg/l) and urine (6. 50 mg/l) samples collected from the woman. Conclusions : Cases of sodium azide poisoning are rare and difficult to treat, but a review of the literature over a longer interval of time shows that they continue to occur. Therefore, case studies of sodium azide poisoning, together with descriptions of research methodology, can be useful both in clinical terms and in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> toxicological expert <b>opinions</b> for medico-legal purposes...|$|R

We expect earnings announcements to reduce differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> among investors, and consequently, these announcements should reduce overvaluation. Using five distinct proxies for differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{we find that}} high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks earn significantly lower returns around earnings announcements than low differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks. In addition, the returns on high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks are more negative within the subsample of stocks that are most difficult for investors to sell short. These results are robust when we control for the size effect and the market-to-book effect and when we examine alternative explanations such as financial leverage, earnings announcement premium, post-earnings announcement drift, return momentum, and potential biases in analysts' forecasts. Also consistent with Miller's theory, we find that stocks subject to high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and more binding short-sales constraints have a price run-up just prior to earnings announcements that is followed by an even larger decline after the announcements.
