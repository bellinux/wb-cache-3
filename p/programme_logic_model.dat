40|$|Climate {{change has}} become one of the most {{important}} global issues of our time, with far- reaching natural, socio- economic, and political impacts. In order to equip the community to deal with the effects of climate changes, various adaptation interventions have been furthered. However, efficacy of these interventions varies in terms of their ability to address specific climate change vulnerabilities of human populations and the natural and economic systems. To understand the efficacy of the interventions towards envisaged climate change results, rigorous monitoring and evaluation of these interventions becomes imperative both for ensuring efficiency, results, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions. With these considerations, <b>programme</b> <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> can be an appropriate overarching Monitoring & Evaluation Framework.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{formulation}} of policy, at whatever level, to whatever scale or scope, is any different to the myriad of processes involved in strategic planning within and between organisations, and the attendant decision making processes that abound {{in such an environment}} (Hage, 1980; Hickson, 1987; Thompson, 1967; Weick, 1976). Those forces that impact upon organisations are precisely the same forces that impact upon policy making groups who are themselves ‘organisations’ (or institutions), whether actual or representative. This provides a startign point for considering a synthesis between various models or paradigms. The argument continues, that program theory and the program <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> can incorporate and synthesise theories from elsewhere that, in turn, usefully inform and develop programme theory and program <b>logic.</b> A ‘hierarchical’ <b>model</b> is presented to explore the linkages between the components and ‘simple’ processes of theory, <b>programme</b> theory, <b>logic</b> <b>modelling,</b> organisational functioning, policy, and the consequent impact.

40|$|Schools {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{services}} present in many rural communities in South Africa. Whole school development requires a broad set of participants, and a shared vision of what the school should be like in the future, looking at the whole system and not just the parts and the interaction between all parts. The shift in school development is from a deficiency-based model to a capacity building model. The research question is: What are the educational needs and assets of a primary school in a rural community in the Greater Sekhukhune District? The study is action research, a qualitative ethnographic study using a descriptive case study. Within the Emancipatory Action Research Model, the community action planning workshops were implemented for data collection using semi-structured interviews, silent observations and note-taking (all data were audiotaped). Data were analysed inductively which implied that data were transcribed, coded, categorised, and analysed. Findings reflect the educational needs and assets, and the community education programme.

Similar to other evaluation it measures the changes, develops <b>programme</b> <b>logic</b> <b>model,</b> clarifies the evaluation purpose, identifies the stakeholders, determines the evaluation key questions, develops indicators and develops evaluation plan. Dissimilar to other evaluation approaches that lay emphasis on finding out the root causes of programme not meeting the set results, the appreciative approach focuses on what worked in the organisation, why it worked and how it worked. Unlike other evaluation where the evaluator plays major role in designing, conducting, and interpreting evaluation results, this approach involves all stakeholders into the evaluation cycle. The evaluation is complete only when the evaluation results are used for refining vision/goal/objective, redefining strategy and refining plan of work of programme being evaluated. Since evaluation results are used right way to improve the programme, this evaluation is considered as user-focused evaluation.

40|$|Based on the {{recognition}} that many women who come into refuge have few options but {{to return to the}} sort of environment in which they have been abused, the Transition and Wellbeing programme aims to provide medium to long term housing for families as they re‐establish themselves in the community. Data for the evaluation of the programme was collected from two main sources; the women on the programme and key informants at Te Whakaruruhau. Five women, two of whom are housed in transitional accommodation were interviewed individually, while focus groups were conducted with middle and senior management teams. The completion of the interviews enabled the development of a <b>programme</b> <b>logic,</b> which describes the ‘theory’ of the programme. The model details the activities or what the programme does. These activities include linking women to programmes and resources, providing practical support, addressing specific cultural needs and the availability of quality advocates. These activities are built on foundational values, such as, whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and wairuatanga. The programme is only made possible with internal and external inputs. Of the external inputs, funding contributions are considered vital to the functioning of the programme. The women’s perspectives identified varying outcomes from their participation in the <b>programme.</b> The <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> details the intended outcomes in the short, medium and long‐term, reflecting personal, relational and community wellbeing. Short term outcomes include improved communication, improved self‐esteem, improved confidence and personal growth. Medium outcomes saw (re) engagement in training, education and for some, (re) entry into the workforce. Long term outcomes related to the establishment of a sustainable life style free from violence. The participants did not see a need to modify the programme in any significant way. Some did think that it could be usefully extended by adding to the existing activities a hands on, artistic approach. Programme developers may consider more creative ways in which to assess and measure the impact of the programme. Finally, it is suggested that the programme could benefit from a more systemic assessment process to determine whether women are “ready” to enter it...|$|R
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy on 5 th July 2012, available online: [URL] Sport/physical activity interventions are sometimes viewed as a panacea for youth-related social problems, and this may explain their proliferation. Yet, there is little robust evidence to support some of the claims made for the efficacy of such programmes, particularly those relating to sustained benefits for young people. Aims: The {{purpose of this paper}} is to report findings from longitudinal research on two youth sport/physical activity interventions in the UK in order identify key features in their design that were found to be central to sustained positive impact. Method: Two physical activity programmes that sought to address youth disaffection and disengagement were evaluated by one research team using a similar evaluation strategy. Between 2003 and 2007 (years 1 - 4 of each programme), over 10, 000 young people participated in the programmes (HSBC/OB and SSLfS). Impact data were collected on over 50 % of all SSLfS pupils engaged in the programme nationally (n = 4700) and 90 % of HSBC/OB pupils from the five participating schools (n = 540). An evaluation framework was designed based on a range of detailed, individualised methods including: individual pupil profiling, school-level case studies and the creation of <b>programme</b> <b>logic</b> <b>models.</b> Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, profile comparisons and a constructivist revision of the grounded theory method. Results: Data on sustainability of impact on young people are reported from each project and the findings are considered together to identify common themes. Data suggest that six key features should be embedded in the design of physical activity/positive youth development programmes: matching pupils' specific needs with programme objectives; locating project activities outside of the 'normal' school context; working closely with pupils to choose activities, set targets and review progress; establishing positive relationships between leaders, mentors and pupils; offering young people the opportunity to work with and for other young people; and making available structured pathways to enable young people to have sustained involvement in further project or complementary activities. Importantly, what these data illustrate is that in combination and through complex interaction, these six design features can maximise the potential for sustained positive impact on youth participants. Conclusions: These data offer insights into the mechanisms that can lead to positive impact from physical activity/sport interventions/programmes. Perhaps more importantly, the findings illustrate the complex ways in which these different mechanisms interact to produce positive outcomes. © 2013 Copyright Association for Physical Education...|$|R

This paper describes a multi-level programme evaluation {{to be conducted}} alongside an RCT of a falls prevention programme (RESPOND). Objectives 1) To conduct a process evaluation {{in order to identify}} the degree of implementation fidelity and associated barriers and facilitators. 2) To evaluate the primary intended impact of the programme: participation in fall prevention strategies, and the factors influencing participation. 3) To identify the factors influencing RESPOND RCT outcomes: falls, fall injuries and ED re-presentations. Methods/ Design Five hundred and twenty eight community-dwelling adults aged 60 – 90 years presenting to two EDs with a fall will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention or standard care group. All RESPOND participants and RESPOND clinicians will be included in the evaluation. A mixed methods design will be used and a <b>programme</b> <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> will frame the evaluation.

40|$|The {{complexity}} {{associated with}} how interventions result – {{or fail to}} result – in outcomes, and how context matters is increasingly recognised. <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> provide an important tool for handling complexity, with contrasting uses in programme evaluation and evidence synthesis. To reconcile these, we developed an approach that combines the strengths of both traditions, propose a taxonomy of <b>logic</b> <b>models,</b> and provide guidance on how to choose between approaches and types of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> in systematic reviews and health technology assessments (HTA). The taxonomy distinguishes three approaches (a priori, staged, iterative) and two types (systems-based, process-orientated) of <b>logic</b> <b>models.</b> An a priori <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is specified {{at the start of}} the systematic review/HTA and remains unchanged. With a staged <b>logic</b> <b>model,</b> the reviewer pre-specifies several points, at which major data inputs require a subsequent version. An iterative <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is continuously modified throughout the systematic review/HTA process. System-based <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> describe the system, in which the interaction between participants, intervention and context takes place; process-orientated models display the causal pathways leading from the intervention to multiple outcomes. The proposed taxonomy of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> offers an improved understanding of the advantages and limitations of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> across the spectrum from a priori to fully iterative approaches. Choice of <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> should be informed by scope of evidence synthesis, presence/absence of clearly defined PICO elements and feasibility considerations.

40|$|Challenges in {{assessments}} of health technologies In recent years {{there have been}} major advances {{in the development of}} health technology assessment (HTA). However, HTA still has certain limitations when assessing technologies, which ﬁ are complex, i. e. consist of several interacting components, target different groups or organisational levels, have multiple and variable outcomes, and/or permit a certain degree of flexibility or tailoring; ﬁ are context-dependent, with HTA usually focusing on the technology rather than on the system within which it is used; ﬁ perform differently depending on the way they are implemented; and/or ﬁ have distinct effects on different individuals. <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> are one important means of conceptualising and handling complexity in HTAs or systematic reviews (SRs) of complex technologies, as well as integrating the findings of multi-component HTAs. A <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is described as “… a graphic description of a system … designed to identify important elements and relationships within that system”. When evaluating complex health technologies, <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> can serve an instrumental purpose at every stage of the HTA/SR process, from scoping the topic of the HTA/SR, including formulating the question and defining the intervention; conducting the HTA/SR; interpreting results and making the HTA/SR relevant for decision makers to implement in policy and practice. Purpose and scope of the guidance This guidance is targeted at commissioners, producers and users of guidelines, HTAs and SRs with an interest in using <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> as an overarching framework for their work. It aims to make the use of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> as straightforward as possible by facilitating the systematic identification or development as well as utilisation of different types and sub-types of <b>logic</b> <b>models.</b> In principle, <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> are a useful tool in any kind of SR or HTA, as they aid with the conceptualisation of the intervention and the review question. This is particularly useful for complex technologies, where conceptualising the intervention and its implementation within a system is critical. In addition, <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> can enhance communication within the HTA/SR team and with relevant stakeholders. Three types of <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> are described: With a priori <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> the <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is specified upfront and remains unchanged during the HTA/SR process. With iterative <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> the <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is subject to continual modification throughout the course of an HTA/SR. The staged <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> harnesses the strengths of both a priori and iterative approaches by pre-specifying revision points at which major data inputs are anticipated. In | 6 addition, two subtypes are identified, namely <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> that seek to represent structure (system-based) and those that focus on processes or activities (process-orientated). This guidance offers direction on how to choose between distinct types and sub-types of <b>logic</b> <b>models,</b> describes each <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> type and its application in detail, and provides templates for getting started with the development of an HTA/SR-specific <b>logic</b> <b>model.</b> Development of the guidance This guidance was informed by a combination of (i) systematic searches for published examples of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> supplemented by purposive sampling of iterative <b>logic</b> <b>modelling</b> approaches; (ii) searches for existing guidance on the use of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> in primary research, SRs and HTAs; (iii) development of two draft templates for system-based and process-orientated <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> in an iterative process within the research team and in consultation with external methodological experts; and (iv) application of these draft templates in multiple SRs and one HTA of different complex health technologies covering technical, educational and policy interventions in environmental health, e-learning for health professionals and models of palliative care. Application of this guidance For a comprehensive integrated assessment of a complex technology we have developed a five step process, the INTEGRATE-HTA model. In Step 1 the HTA objective and the technology are defined with the support from a panel of stakeholders. A system-based <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is developed in Step 2. It provides a structured overview of technology, the context, implementation issues, and relevant patient groups. It then frames the assessment of the effectiveness, as well as economic, ethical, legal, and socio-cultural aspects in Step 3. In Step 4 a graphical overview of the assessment results, structured by the <b>logic</b> <b>model,</b> is provided. Step 5 is a structured decision-making process informed by the HTA (and is thus not formally part of the HTA but follows it). <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> therefore form an integral element of the INTEGRATE-HTA model but may also be useful in individual steps. This guidance starts off by offering support in identifying and, as needed, adapting existing <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> from the literature or developing an HTA-/SR-specific <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> de novo. In either case, the user will need to decide upfront whether to pursue an a priori, staged or iterative approach to <b>logic</b> <b>modelling,</b> and the guidance offers criteria on how to decide between these distinct types of <b>logic</b> <b>modelling.</b> The system-based and process-orientated <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> templates provide a starting point for the de novo development of either type of <b>logic</b> <b>model.</b> The guidance also discusses the advantages and drawbacks of adopting the system-based or process-orientated sub-type, and offers some general considerations in applying <b>logic</b> <b>models,</b> such as the variety of data sources used, transparency in reporting and necessary trade-offs between comprehensiveness and complexity of the <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> in communicating with stakeholders. For a priori <b>logic</b> <b>modelling,</b> a six-step process comprises: (1) defining the PICO elements of the HTA/SR as well as relevant aspect of context and implementation; (2) deciding on a system- vs. process-orientated <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> subtype with the former focusing on a conceptualization of the question and the latter more concerned with an explanation of the pathways from the intervention to the outcomes; (3) populating the <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> template with information obtained through literature searches, discussions within the author team and consultations with content experts; (4) asking stakeholders for input and refining the <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> accordingly; (5) repeating steps 3 and 4 until all members of the author team agree that the <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> accurately represents the framework for the specific HTA/SR; and (6) publishing the final <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> with the protocol of the HTA or SR. This <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> remains unchanged during the HTA/SR process. For iterative <b>logic</b> <b>modelling,</b> a five-step process includes: (1) creating an initial <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> {{as a starting point for}} subsequent exploration, where a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> template is used to create an initial <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> de novo; (2) identifying data on the whole system or entire process, or on individual components of the model, where data may come from stakeholders, the review team, ongoing primary research or the published literature; (3) making 7 | changes to the initial <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> repeatedly and at any point of the review and documenting these changes carefully; (4) creating a new numbered version of the <b>logic</b> <b>model,</b> where changes are considered substantive or stepwise; and (5) recording a definitive version of the <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> for the purpose of publication within the final HTA/SR report. It is recognised that this version of the <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is only definitive with regard to the specific project timeframe and may well be subject to subsequent modification by the HTA/SR team, or indeed by other teams. For staged <b>logic</b> <b>modelling,</b> a four-step process consists of: (1) developing an initial <b>logic</b> <b>model,</b> using one of the templates and various mechanisms to populate them, in particular input from stakeholders and literature searches; (2) pre-specifying points within the HTA/SR process at which significant inputs, defined in terms of quantity or importance, are likely to have an impact on the structure and content of the HTA/SR and thus the logic model; (3) revisiting the <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> at the pre-specified review and revision points, and creating new and clearly labelled versions, documenting how and based on which data sources changes were made; and (4) presenting selected versions of the <b>logic</b> <b>model,</b> as a minimum the initial and the final <b>logic</b> <b>models,</b> in the HTA/ SR report. Conclusions <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> are an important tool when conducting HTAs or SRs of complex health technologies, as they enhance transparency on underlying assumptions and help understand complexity by depicting the entire system, its parts and the interactions between intervention and outcomes; they also play a key role in integrating across different parts of a multi-component HTA. Nonetheless, <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> are not a panacea in addressing or resolving complexity and each type shows its specific strengths and limitations. This guidance provides a stateof-the-art overview of current practices in the use of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> within HTAs and SRs. By providing templates for generating a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> de novo, it aims to make the process of <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> development and application as straightforward as possible. Certain types and sub-types of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> are more or less suitable depending on the technology concerned and the HTA/SR question addressed and approach pursued.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the process undertaken {{to develop a}} program <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> into a program theory that could be tested through a large scale evaluation. <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> are widely promoted to establish program intention and outcomes, thus {{setting the stage for}} effective program evaluation. However, the causal links in program <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> are often assumptive in nature, and lack the specificity of conditions needed in order for the program to achieve its planned success. The authors share a process of observation and focus groups that allowed them to probe some of the links of the program <b>logic</b> <b>model.</b> The result presented is an “enhanced” <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> that reveals possible moderators of program success, which leads to the development of evaluation questions that will be used in a subsequent large-scale evaluation.

40|$|SUMMARY. The use of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> {{in program}} development, evalu ation, and {{dissemination}} {{is becoming more}} commonly accepted {{as a means of}} facilitating communication, replication, quality improvement, and assessment. Each of the following chapters in this book includes a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> of the program being described. The purpose of this chap ter is to describe what <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> are, and to convey to a diverse field the role and functioning of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> in the conceptualization, deliv ery, management, and evaluation of programs. Since this volume is in tended for a wide audience including service providers, program ad ministrators, and researchers, we will attempt to provide information on <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> that is broadly useful. Therefore, this chapter is structured so that each of the four authors presents her/his unique perspective based principally on their own experience using <b>logic</b> <b>models.</b> [Article copies available for a fee from The Haworth Document Delivery Service...|$|R

A 2011 global assessment reported lack {{of monitoring}} capacity was the top barrier for home fortification interventions, such as micronutrient powders or lipid-based nutrient supplements. A Manual for Developing and Implementing Monitoring Systems for Home Fortification Interventions was recently disseminated. It is comprehensive and describes monitoring concepts and frameworks and includes monitoring tools and worksheets. The monitoring manual describes the steps of developing and implementing a monitoring system for home fortification interventions, including identifying and engaging stakeholders; developing a <b>programme</b> description including <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> and logical framework; refining {{the purpose of the}} monitoring system, identifying users and their monitoring needs; describing the design of the monitoring system; developing indicators; describing the core components of a comprehensive monitoring plan; and considering factors related to stage of programme development, sustainability and scale up. A fictional home fortification example is used throughout the monitoring manual to illustrate these steps. The monitoring manual is a useful tool to support {{the development and implementation of}} home fortification intervention monitoring systems. In the context of systematic capacity gaps to design, implement and monitor nutrition interventions in many low-income and middle-income countries, the dissemination of new tools, such as monitoring manuals may have limited impact without additional attention to strengthening other individual, organisational and systems levels capacities.

This paper presents <b>Logic</b> <b>Model</b> Creator (LMC), {{a new environment}} that supports building and exploration of intuitive visual representation of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> by young children. LMC <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> are structured as hypothesis, decision and/or counter decision components. These models are built using visual entities which represent the learning concepts of a specific domain. In this paper {{we focus on the}} architecture of LMC and the basic functionality of the environment. In particular we describe the the dynamic creation of equivalent <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> according to the so-called Reference <b>Logic</b> <b>Model,</b> constructed by the students' tutor. Furthermore an assessment module which provides immediate advice to the student in order to help them create a valid <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is presented. Through experimentation it is demonstrated that the users of LMC can have rich interaction and assessment while exploring decision making logic constructs. © 2006 International Federation for Information Processing...|$|R

40|$|<b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> are {{becoming}} an increasingly common feature of systematic reviews, {{as is the}} use of programme theory more generally in systematic reviewing. <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> offer a framework to help reviewers to 'think' conceptually at various points during the review, and can be a useful tool in defining study inclusion and exclusion criteria, guiding the search strategy, identifying relevant outcomes, identifying mediating and moderating factors, and communicating review findings. In this paper we critique the use of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> in systematic reviews and protocols drawn from two databases representing reviews of health interventions and international development interventions. Programme theory featured only in a minority of the reviews and protocols included. Despite drawing from different disciplinary traditions, reviews and protocols from both sources shared several limitations in their use of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> and theories of change, and these were used almost unanimously to solely depict pictorially {{the way in which the}} intervention worked. <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> and theories of change were consequently rarely used to communicate the findings of the review. <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> have the potential to be an aid integral throughout the systematic reviewing process. The absence of good practice around their use and development may be one reason for the apparent limited utility of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> in many existing systematic reviews. These concerns are addressed in the second half of this paper, where we offer a set of principles in the use of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> and an example of how we constructed a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> for a review of school-based asthma interventions...|$|R

This article examines the long-standing pecan program at New Mexico State University and the deficiencies and successes in the evolution of its <b>logic</b> <b>model.</b> The university’s agricultural experiment station’s pecan program <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> has evolved along with increased external funding, but never has developed into a complete <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> because the outcome-impact component remains incomplete. With increased assistance from the university, the pecan industry grew and became stronger and more economically viable; however, the incomplete development of a pecan program <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> has prevented development of a complete synergy.

5000|$|Creating a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is a {{wonderful}} way to help visualize important aspects of programs, especially when preparing for an evaluation. An evaluator should create a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> with input from many different stake holders. <b>Logic</b> <b>Models</b> have 5 major components: Resources or Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Short-term outcomes, and Long-term outcomes [...] Creating a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> helps articulate the problem, the resources and capacity that are currently being used to address the problem, and the measurable outcomes from the program. Looking at the different components of a program in relation to the overall short-term and long-term goals allows for illumination of potential misalignments. Creating an actual <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is particularly important because it helps clarify for all stakeholders: the definition of the problem, the overarching goals, and the capacity and outputs of the program.|$|R
40|$|IntroductionConcept mapping is a {{structured}} conceptualization process {{that provides a}} visual representation of relationships among ideas. Concept mapping was used to develop a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Prevention Research Centers Program, which has a large and diverse group of stakeholders throughout the United States. No published studies have used concept mapping to develop a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> for a national program. MethodsTwo <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> were constructed using {{the data from the}} concept mapping process and program documents: one for the national level and one for the local level. Concept mapping involved three phases: 1) developing questions to generate ideas about the program's purpose and function, 2) gathering input from 145 national stakeholders and 135 local stakeholders and sorting ideas into themes, and 3) using multivariate statistical analyses to generate concept maps. <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> were refined using feedback received from stakeholders at regional meetings and conferences and from {{a structured}} feedback tool. ResultsThe national concept map consisted of 9 clusters with 88 statements; the local concept map consisted of 11 clusters with 75 statements. Clusters were categorized into three <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> components: inputs, activities, and outcomes. Based on feedback, two draft <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> were combined and finalized into one for the Prevention Research Centers Program. ConclusionConcept mapping provides a valuable data source, establishes a common view of a program, and identifies inputs, activities, and outcomes in a <b>logic</b> <b>model.</b> Our concept mapping process resulted in a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> that is meaningful for stakeholders, incorporates input from the program's partners, and establishes important program expectations. Our methods may be beneficial for other programs that are developing <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> for evaluation planning. 16356359 PMC 150095...|$|R
