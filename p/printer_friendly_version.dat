As a result, the magazine is no longer available in print copy. This move sparked a harsh response from {{some members of the}} community.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{presence of}} thermal {{components in the}} early X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts is investigated. We discuss both {{the presence of a}} thermal continuum and, in particular, of collisional X-ray emission lines. We compute the predicted luminosity by a thin plasma for a range of metallicities for the continuum and the K_alpha lines of the elements Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe. We show that light travel effects are dominant in the determination of the thermal continuum and line luminosities, and derive the relevant equations. We conclude that thermal lines and continua are unlikely to dominate the early afterglow of GRBs, unless the explosion site is surrounded by a very massive and extremely clumped shell of material. Such conditions are difficult to envisage in the close environment of GRB progenitor, unless they are excited by some strong precursor activity, like in the Supranova scenario.

40|$|Accepted in A&A, June 23, 2005 (<b>printer</b> <b>friendly</b> {{replacement}} <b>version,</b> includes language corrections) We {{present a}} new method to parameterize Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) multi-color light curves. The method {{was developed in}} order to analyze {{the large number of}} SN Ia multi-color light curves measured in current high-redshift projects. The technique is based on empirically modeling SN Ia luminosity variations as a function of phase, wavelength, a shape parameter, and a color parameter. The model is trained with a sample of well measured nearby SN Ia and then tested with an independent set of supernovae by building an optimal luminosity distance estimator combining the supernova rest-frame luminosity, shape parameter and color reconstructed with the model. The distances we measure using B- and V-band data show a dispersion around the Hubble line comparable or lower than obtained with other methods. With this model, we are able to measure distances using U- and B-band data with a dispersion around the Hubble line of 0. 16 +- 0. 05...|$|R

30|$|Baseline {{pure tone}} audiograms between 250 and 16, 000  Hz will be {{performed}} for all the patients using a KUDU wave audiometer (Geoaxon, Pretoria, South Africa). This is a portable device run by an eMoyo algorithm on a laptop and it obviates {{the need for a}} sound proof booth (Swanepoel et al. 2010). The audiometer uses external audio cups to attenuate environmental noise and intra-aural probe and fore head vibrator to deliver the pure tones. It also monitors ambient sound via an inbuilt microphone and the test is stopped once the environmental sound becomes loud enough to interfere with the examination. A user friendly game pad is also attached to the laptop and user is instructed to press the keys after perceiving the pure tones. This enables the software to plot the user responses directly on an audiogram. The software also prompts the examiner to position the forehead vibrator after completion of the air conduction tests; at the end of both the bone and air conduction test the pure tone average is automatically calculated and a <b>printer</b> <b>friendly</b> audiogram is generated.|$|R
