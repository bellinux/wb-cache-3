Its main pathological hallmark feature is the formation of insoluble protein deposits of amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau protein into extracellular plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, respectively. Many of the mechanistic details of this process remain unknown, but a well-established consequence of protein aggregation is synapse dysfunction and neuronal loss in the AD brain.

30|$|Although {{these results}} {{indicate}} that monocytes are considerably more susceptible to NP-induced cytotoxicity than other immune cell types tested, {{it is important to note}} that these differences may be related to distinctions in cell-culture conditions. While T cells, B cells, and NK cells grow as suspension cultures, cultured monocytes grow as an adherent monolayer. These differences in growth characteristics may act to increase the effective ZnO NP concentration in adherent cultures. It is also plausible that the inherently greater capacity of adherent monocytes to phagocytose foreign materials, including NPs, may underlie their greater sensitivity, and the inherent cytolytic activity of NK cells against foreign <b>pathogens,</b> <b>and</b> <b>altered</b> self-cells may contribute to their greater sensitivity compared to lymphocyte populations. To address these possibilities, future experiments involving three-dimensional cell culture systems and those evaluating the extent to which phagocytic/endocytic mechanisms contribute to cell-type differences are needed. Nevertheless, given the variable susceptibilities of different immune cell types to ZnO NPs, it seems clear that careful analysis of in vitro cellular systems, followed by appropriate in vivo studies, is necessary to provide thorough and possibly predictive screening data regarding the relative toxicity and immunomodulatory effects of ZnO NP.|$|R
40|$|The {{immune system}} {{provides}} a highly sophisticated surveillance mechanism to detect diverse antigens {{and to protect}} the host organism from invading <b>pathogens</b> <b>and</b> <b>altered</b> cells (e. g., virus-infected and tumor cells). Adaptive immune responses depend on the recognition of antigen by specific antigen receptors that are expressed on the surface of T and B lymphocytes. Helper T cells provide regulatory functions and direct the adaptive immune system to respond appropriately to a particular antigen (i. e., cytotoxic T cell responses against viral infections and tumor cells, humoral responses against extracellular bacteria and parasitic worms). Helper T cells express CD 4 coreceptors, which recognize conserved domains on proteins expressed by the class II major histocompatibility complex, the same proteins that present antigen to the T cell receptor. Recent progress in T cell biology has identified multiple regulatory functions of CD 4 during thymocyte development and antigen stimulation of mature T helper cells. Signaling pathways induced by engagement of CD 4 independently of T cell receptor signaling mediate these regulatory functions. In this review, we discuss the regulation of T cell signaling and emphasize the functional consequences of proper and improper CD 4 coreceptor signaling...|$|R

We show that mice infected with epidemic C. difficile (genotype 027 /BI) develop highly contagious, chronic intestinal disease and persistent dysbiosis characterized by a distinct, simplified microbiota containing opportunistic <b>pathogens</b> <b>and</b> <b>altered</b> metabolite production. Chronic C. difficile 027 /BI infection was refractory to vancomycin treatment leading to relapsing disease. In contrast, treatment of C. difficile 027 /BI infected mice with feces from healthy mice rapidly restored a diverse, healthy microbiota and resolved C. difficile disease and contagiousness. We used this model to identify a simple mixture of six phylogenetically diverse intestinal bacteria, including novel species, which can re-establish a health-associated microbiota and clear C. difficile 027 /BI infection from mice. Thus, targeting a dysbiotic microbiota with a defined mixture of phylogenetically diverse bacteria can trigger major shifts in the microbial community structure that displaces C. difficile and, as a result, resolves disease and contagiousness. Further, we demonstrate a rational approach to harness the therapeutic potential of health-associated microbial communities to treat C. difficile disease and potentially other forms of intestinal dysbiosis...|$|R

40|$|Immune {{protection}} by the {{complement system}} critically depends on assembly of C 3 convertases {{on the surface}} of <b>pathogens</b> <b>and</b> <b>altered</b> host cells. These short-lived protease complexes are formed through pro-convertases, which for the alternative pathway consist of the complement component C 3 b and the pro-enzyme factor B (FB). Here, we present the crystal structure at 2. 2 -Å resolution, small-angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy (EM) data of the pro-convertase formed by human FB and cobra venom factor (CVF), a potent homologue of C 3 b that generates more stable convertases. FB is loaded onto CVF through its pro-peptide Ba segment by specific contacts, which explain the specificity for the homologous C 3 b over the native C 3 and inactive products iC 3 b and C 3 c. The protease segment Bb binds the carboxy terminus of CVF through the metal-ion dependent adhesion site of the Von Willebrand factor A-type domain. A possible dynamic equilibrium between a ‘loading' and ‘activation' state of the pro-convertase may explain the observed difference between the crystal structure of CVFB and the EM structure of C 3 bB.

Our results provide the molecular details of the rearrangement accompanying C 4 cleavage and suggest intramolecular flexibility of C 4 b. The conformations of C 4 b and its paralogue C 3 b are shown to be remarkably conserved, suggesting that the convertases from the classical and alternative pathways are likely to share their overall architecture and mode of substrate recognition. We propose an overall molecular model for the classical pathway C 5 convertase in complex with C 5, suggesting that C 3 b increases the affinity for the substrate by inducing conformational changes in C 4 b rather than a direct interaction with C 5.

40|$|For {{many years}} it has been {{supposed}} that the production of an excess of nitric oxide (NO) by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) {{plays a major role}} in inflammatory diseases, including asthma. However, recent studies indicate that a deficiency of beneficial, bronchodilating constitutive NOS (cNOS) -derived NO is important in allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Although several mechanisms are proposed to explain the reduction of cNOS activity, reduced substrate availability, caused by a combination of increased arginase activity and decreased cellular uptake of L-arginine, appears to play a key role. Recent evidence also indicates that iNOS-induced pathophysiological effects involve substrate deficiency. Thus, at low concentrations of L-arginine iNOS produces both NO and superoxide anions, which results in the increased synthesis of the highly reactive, detrimental oxidant peroxynitrite. Based on these observations, we propose that a relative deficiency of NO caused by increased arginase activity <b>and</b> <b>altered</b> L-arginine <b>homeostasis</b> is a major factor in the pathology of asthma...|$|R

FoxO 1 ablation brings about two signature lipid abnormalities of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, elevated liver and plasma TG. These changes are associated with deficiency of 12 α-hydroxylated BAs and their synthetic enzyme, Cyp 8 b 1, that hinders the TG-lowering effects of the BA receptor, Fxr. Accordingly, pharmacological activation of Fxr with GW 4064 overcomes the BA imbalance, restoring hepatic and plasma TG levels of FoxO 1 -deficient mice to normal levels.

The aim of this research was to study the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from periodontitis patients and to evaluate the influence of LPS on fibroblasts to better understand the pathophysiology of periodontitis and its relationship with CVD. PBMCs from patients showed lower CoQ 10 levels and citrate synthase activity, togetherwith high levels of ROS production. LPS-treated fibroblasts provoked increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction by a decrease in mitochondrial protein expression, mitochondrial mass, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Our study supports the hypothesis that LPS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction could be at the origin of oxidative stress in periodontal patients.

The interaction of M-ficolin with the long pentraxin pentraxin 3 (PTX 3) has been characterized using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and electron microscopy. M-ficolin was shown to bind PTX 3 with high affinity {{in the presence of}} calcium ions. The interaction was abolished in the presence of EDTA and inhibited by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, indicating involvement of the fibrinogen-like domain of M-ficolin. Removal of sialic acid from the single N-linked carbohydrate of the C-terminal domain of PTX 3 abolished the interaction. Likewise, an M-ficolin mutant with impaired sialic acid-binding ability did not interact with PTX 3. Interaction was also impaired when using the isolated recognition domain of M-ficolin or the monomeric C-terminal domain of PTX 3, indicating requirement for oligomerization of both proteins. Electron microscopy analysis of the M-ficolin-PTX 3 complexes revealed that the M-ficolin tetramer bound up to four PTX 3 molecules. From a functional point of view, immobilized PTX 3 was able to trigger M-ficolin-dependent activation of the lectin complement pathway. These data indicate that interaction of M-ficolin with PTX 3 arises from its ability to bind sialylated ligands and thus differs from the binding to the short pentraxin C-reactive protein and from the binding of L-ficolin to PTX 3. The M-ficolin-PTX 3 interaction described in this study represents a novel case of cross-talk between soluble pattern-recognition molecules, lending further credit to the integrated view of humoral innate immunity that emerged recently...|$|R

To explore a potential role for ARC in protecting muscle fibers from dystrophic breakdown, we have cloned and characterized murine ARC and studied its expression in normal and dystrophic mouse muscle. ARC is expressed at high levels in striated muscle and displays fiber-type restricted expression patterns. ARC expression levels are normal in dystrophic mdx mice, although the intracellular localization pattern of ARC is slightly altered compared with normal muscles. Overexpression of ARC in transgenic mdx mice failed to alleviate the dystrophic pathology in skeletal muscles, suggesting that misregulation of the molecular pathways regulated by ARC does not significantly contribute to myofiber death...|$|R
40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} muscles undergo increased oxidative stress <b>and</b> <b>altered</b> calcium <b>homeostasis,</b> which contribute to myofiber loss by trigging both necrosis and apoptosis. Here, we asked whether treatment with free radical scavengers could improve the dystrophic pattern of mdx muscles. Five-week-old mdx mice were treated for 2 weeks with alpha-lipoic acid/l-carnitine. This treatment decreased the plasmatic creatine kinase level, the antioxidant enzyme activity, and lipid peroxidation products in mdx diaphragm. Free radical scavengers also modulated the phosphorylation/activity of some {{component of the}} mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades: p 38 MAPK, the extracellular signal-related kinase, and the Jun kinase. beta-Dystroglycan (beta-DG), a multifunctional adaptor or scaffold capable of interacting with components of the extracellular signal-related kinase-MAP kinase cascade, was also affected after treatment. In the mdx muscles, beta-DG (43 kd) was cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases into a 30 -kd form (beta-DG 30). We show that the proinflammatory protein nuclear factor-kappaB activator decreased after the treatment, leading to a significant reduction of matrix metalloproteinase activity in the mdx diaphragm. Our data highlight the implication of oxidative stress and cell signaling defects in dystrophin-deficient muscle via the MAP kinase cascade-beta-DG interaction and nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation process...|$|R
