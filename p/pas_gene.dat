40|$|Objectives: Mutations of {{all three}} PAS genes, N-, H-, and KRAS, are {{identified}} mainly in codons 12, 13, and 61 of exons 2 and 3 in human cancers. Design and methods: DNA samples were isolated from 58 oral cancer and 106 colorectal cancer patients. Multiplex amplification of codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 and codon 61 of exon 3 of three PAS genes using two pairs of universal primers for exons 2 and 3 was performed in a single tube. The products were cleaned and split in three tubes. Each was subjected for primer extension using seven different-sized PAS primers for different <b>PAS</b> <b>gene</b> separately to detect base changes in codons 12, 13, and 61 of each RAS gene. Results: We compared the results with that from direct sequencing for detecting N-, H-, and KRAS mutations in 58 oral cancers and 106 colorectal cancers. The two methods yield identical results, but our method is superior to direct sequencing in terms {{the amount of work}} and time required. Conclusions: We presented a rapid method to detect codons 12, 13, and 61 mutations of N-, H, and KRAS genes in human cancers. (C) 2009 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain insight into the {{molecular}} mechanisms involved in interleukin- 9 (IL- 9) activities, representational difference analysis (RDA) was used to identify messages that are induced by IL- 9 in a murine T-helper-cell clone. One of the isolated genes encodes for the newly described M-Ras or R-Ras 3, {{which is part of}} the <b>Pas</b> <b>gene</b> superfamily. M-Ras expression was found to be induced by IL- 9 but not IL- 2 or IL- 4 in various murine T-helper-cell clones, and this induction seems to be dependent on the JAK/STAT pathway. Contrasting with the potent upregulation of M-Ras expression, M-Ras was not activated by IL- 9 at the level of guanosine triphosphate/guanosine diphosphate (GTP/GDP) binding. However, IL- 3 increased GTP binding to M-Ras, suggesting that M-Ras induction might represent a new mechanism of cooperativity between cytokines such as IL- 3 and IL- 9, Constitutively activated M-Ras mutants induced activation of Elk transcription factor by triggering the MAP kinase pathway and allowed for IL- 3 -independent proliferation of BaF 3 cells. Taken together, these results show that cytokines such as IL- 9 can regulate the expression of a member of the RAS family possibly involved in growth-factor signal transduction.

40|$|The {{complete}} resection of pituitary adenomas (PAs) {{is unlikely}} {{when there is}} an extensive local dural invasion and given that the molecular mechanisms remain primarily unknown. DNA microarray analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes between nonfunctioning invasive and noninvasive <b>PAs.</b> <b>Gene</b> clustering revealed a robust eightfold increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9 expression in surgically resected human invasive PAs and in the (nonfunctioning) HP 75 human pituitary tumor-derived cell line treated with phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate; these results were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, gelatin zymography, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and Northern blot analyses. The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) increased both MMP- 9 activity and expression, which were blocked by some PKC inhibitors (G 66976, bisindolylmaleimide, and Rottlerin), PKC-α, and PKC-δ small interfering (si) RNAs but not by hispidin (PKC-β inhibitor). In a transmembrane invasion assay, phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (100 nmol/L) increased the number of invaded HP 75 cells, a process that was attenuated by PKC inhibitors, MMP- 9 antibody, PKC-α siRNA, or PKC-δ siRNA. These results demonstrate that MMP- 9 and PKC-α or PRC-δ may provide putative therapeutic targets for the control of PA dural invasion.

40|$|Comparisons of codon {{frequencies}} of genes to several gene classes {{are used to}} characterize highly expressed and alien genes on the Synechocystis PCC 6803 genome. The primary gene classes include the ensemble of all genes (average gene), ribosomal protein (RP) genes, translation processing factors (TF) and genes encoding chaperone/degradation proteins (CH). A gene is predicted highly expressed (PHX) if its codon usage is close {{to that of the}} RP/TF/CH standards but strongly deviant from the average <b>gene.</b> Putative alien (<b>PA)</b> <b>genes</b> are those for which codon usage is significantly different from all four classes of gene standards. In Synechocystis, 380 genes were identified as PHX. The genes with the highest predicted expression levels include many that encode proteins vital for photosynthesis. Nearly all of the genes of the RP/TF/CH gene classes are PHX. The principal glycolysis enzymes, which may also function in CO 2 fixation, are PHX, while none of the genes encoding TCA cycle enzymes are PHX. The <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> are mostly of unknown function or encode transposases. Several <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> encode polypeptides that function in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Both PHX and <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> often form significant clusters (operons). The proteins encoded by PHX and <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> are described with respect to functional classifications, their organization in the genome and their stoichiometry in multi-subunit complexes...|$|R
40|$|Reassortant SG 3 {{inherits}} {{only the}} acidic polymerase (<b>PA)</b> protein <b>gene</b> from the cold-adapted B/AA/ 1 / 66 influenza virus (ca B/AA/l/ 66) and all remaining genes from a virulent, wild-type virus. This reassortant demonstrates attenuated virulence in ferrets and expresses a is phenotype {{characteristic of the}} ca parent. During virulence evaluation of SG 3, a virulent, non-ts revertant virus (designated SG 3 rFL) was isolated from the lungs of one ferret. In order {{to determine whether the}} reversion of SG 3 resulted from mutation of the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> and/or as the result of extragenic supressor mutations, the revertant <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> of SG 3 rFL was transferred to a reassortant (SG 3 r) inheriting only the revertant <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> from SG 3 rFL and all remaining genes from SG 3. Reassortant SG 3 r was non-ts and virulent, indicating that mutation of the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> was sufficient for the reversion of the is and attenuation phenotypes expressed by SG 3 rFL. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the SG 3 rFL <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> were determined and compared to those of wt and ca B/AA/ 1 / 66. The predicted PA proteins of wt and ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 are known to differ by six amino acid substitutions including a valine to methionine substitution at residue 431. The PA proteins of ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 and SG 3 rFL were distinguished by only the single amino acid substitution of methionine to isoluecine also occurring at residue 431. Thus, the methionine residue was implicated in the attenuation of ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 and its reassortants. The hydropathic properties of valine, isoleucine, and methionine suggested that reversion involved the restoration of hydrophobic character at this site...|$|R
40|$|Several {{consecutive}} undiluted {{passages of}} infectious virus are usually required to obtain defective interfering particles of influenza virus. In contrast, a reassortant (Wa- 182) of influenza A/WSN, which we isolated, whose NS gene {{was replaced with}} the NS gene of A/Aichi, was readily converted to defective interfering form after only a single high-multiplicity infection. The defective interfering particles of Wa- 182 were devoid of the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> (RNA segment 3) but possessed several species of subgenomic RNAs of the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> origin. Such aberrant replication of the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> was shown {{to be caused by}} an extragenic effect of the NS gene of Wa- 182, because, when the NS gene of Wa- 182 was singly transferred to the wild-type A/Ann Arbor/ 6 / 60 virus, the recipient showed exactly the same features. Analysis of nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the NS gene of Wa- 182 contained three point mutations relative to the wild-type NS gene that resulted in two amino acid substitutions in the nonstructural protein NS 2, suggesting that the mutation in NS 2 protein affected the normal replication of the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> of Wa- 182. The results also suggest that the NS 2 protein {{plays an important role in}} the synthesis of intact genome RNAs...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{variations}} {{impact on}} the balance between photosynthetic electron transport and electron-consuming assimilation reactions and transiently increase generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Previous studies demonstrated that the expression of C-repeat binding factors (CBFs), which activate cold acclimation reactions, respond to chloroplast ROS signals and that cold deacclimation is partly halted for days after the transfer of acclimated plants to optimal growth conditions in four Arabidopsis accessions from cold-continental habitats. We hypothesized that these accessions differ from others in the regulation of the plastid antioxidant system (PAS). In the present study, we compared the expression intensity of the 12 most prominent PAS genes for peroxidases, superoxide dismutase and low molecular weight antioxidant regenerating enzymes in 10 Arabidopsis accessions with regulation of CBF and COR (cold regulated genes) transcript levels and cold-regulated metabolite levels prior to cold, after 2 week long cold acclimation and {{during the first three}} days of deacclimation. In the accessions with prolonged activation of cold responses, by trend, weaker induction of various cold-inducible PAS genes and stronger decreases in the expression of negatively cold-regulated PAS genes were observed. Low <b>PAS</b> <b>gene</b> expression delayed the post-cold decrease in H 2 O 2 levels after transfer of the plants from cold to optimal growth conditions. We conclude that weaker expression of various PAS genes in the cold is an adapted strategy of the Arabidopsis accessions N 14, N 13, Ms- 0 and Kas- 1 to avoid full inactivation of cold-responses in the first days {{after the end of the}} cold period...|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} that a mouse develops a pulmonary tumor, {{as well as the}} structure of that tumor, are dependent on several genes. Three pulmonary adenoma susceptibility (pas) genes predispose some inbred strains to develop lung tumors, {{even in the absence of}} carcinogen exposure, and cause others to be resistant. One <b>pas</b> <b>gene</b> is K-ras, which may also be overexpressed in these tumors in a mutated form capable of transforming cells. Mice with activated Ha-ras transgenes override the resistant pas alleles and are born with lung cancer. Susceptible strains have a higher turnover rate of alveolar type II and bronchiolar Clara cells, those cells from which lung tumors arise, than more resistant strains. A high precursor cell turnover rate correlates with a propensity to neoplasia in other animal models as well, possibly due to low concentrations of endogenous growth regulatory molecules such as corticosterone and protein kinase C (PKC). Neoplastic lung epithelial cells are relatively resistant to glucocorticoids and have low PKC levels. A set of genes other than the pas genes governs the response to tumor modulation by butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The genes that determine whether lung tumor multiplicity is enhanced by chronic BHT exposure may regulate the ability to hydroxylate BHT at a tert-butyl position to form BHT-OH, a metabolite with greater tumor-promoting potency than BHT. Inbred and recombinant inbred strain variations in adenoma growth patterns indicate that another set of genes, which we have designated pah for pulmonary adenoma histogenesis, may determine which cell type becomes neoplastic and whether adenomas will undergo malignant conversion...|$|E
40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor through which halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) cause altered gene expression and toxicity. The AHR belongs to the basic helix–loop–helix/Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcriptional regulatory proteins, whose members play key roles in development, circadian rhythmicity, and environmental homeostasis; however, the normal cellular function of the AHR is not yet known. As part of a phylogenetic approach to understanding the function and evolutionary origin of the AHR, we sequenced the PAS homology domain of AHRs from several species of early vertebrates and performed phylogenetic analyses of these AHR amino acid sequences in relation to mammalian AHRs and 24 {{other members of the}} PAS family. AHR sequences were identified in a teleost (the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus), two elasmobranch species (the skate Raja erinacea and the dogfish Mustelus canis), and a jawless fish (the lamprey Petromyzon marinus). Two putative AHR genes, designated AHR 1 and AHR 2, were found both in Fundulus and Mustelus. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the AHR 2 genes in these two species are orthologous, suggesting that an AHR gene duplication occurred early in vertebrate evolution and that multiple AHR genes may be present in other vertebrates. Database searches and phylogenetic analyses identified four putative PAS proteins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, including possible AHR and ARNT homologs. Phylogenetic analysis of the <b>PAS</b> <b>gene</b> family reveals distinct clades containing both invertebrate and vertebrate PAS family members; the latter include paralogous sequences that we propose have arisen by gene duplication early in vertebrate evolution. Overall, our analyses indicate that the AHR is a phylogenetically ancient protein present in all living vertebrate groups (with a possible invertebrate homolog), thus providing an evolutionary perspective to the study of dioxin toxicity and AHR function...|$|E

Reassortants which inherit {{one or more}} genes from ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 and all other genes from a virulent, wild-type {{influenza virus}}, B/Houston/ 1732 / 76, were produced and evaluated {{in order to identify}} the gene(s) responsible for the ts, ca and attenuation phenotypes. Only reassortants which inherited the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> from ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 expressed the ts phenotype in MDCK cells at 39 [deg]C. None of the reassortants tested expressed the ca phenotype in embryonated eggs at 25 [deg]C. The virulence of several reassortants was evaluated in ferrets. Inheritance of the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> from ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 was correlated with significant febrile attentuation and the apparent restriction of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract. Isolation of a virulent, non-ts revertant virus inheriting only the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> from ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 established a direct relationship between expression of the ts phenotype and attenuated virulence. Evidence for the contribution of at least one other gene from ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 to attenuation was observed. Thus, based on the methods used to determine reassortant gene compositions, these results indicate that the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> is primarily responsible for attenuation of ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 and its reassortants...|$|R
40|$|Proanthocyanidins (PA) {{is a type}} of {{prominent}} flavonoid compound deposited in seed coats which controls the pigmentation in all Brassica species. Annotation of B. juncea genome survey sequences showed 72 PA genes; however, a functional description of these genes, especially how their interactions regulate seed pigmentation, remains elusive. In the present study, we designed 19 primer pairs to screen a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of B. juncea. A total of 284 BAC clones were identified and sequenced. Alignment of the sequences confirmed that 55 genes were cloned, with every Arabidopsis <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> having 2 - 7 homologs in B. juncea. BLAST analysis using the recently released B. rapa or B. napus genome database identified 31 and 58 homologous genes, respectively. Mapping and phylogenetic analysis indicated that 30 B. juncea <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> are located in the A-genome chromosomes except chromosome A 04, whereas the other 25 genes are mapped to the B-genome chromosomes except B 05 and B 07. RNA-seq data and Fragments Per Kilobase of a transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) analysis showed that most of the <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> were expressed in the seed coat of B. juncea and B. napus, and that BjuTT 3, BjuTT 18, BjuANR, BjuTT 4 - 2, BjuTT 4 - 3, BjuTT 19 - 1, and BjuTT 19 - 3 are transcriptionally regulated, and not expressed or downregulated in yellow-seeded testa.

Stupar, Fumiaki Katagiri. 1 {{computer file}} (PDF); vii, 47 pages. Maize inbred lines exhibit {{high levels of}} gene expression diversity. Several hundred genes exhibit severe expression variation such that the transcript is detected only in one inbred and absent in another. However, the frequency, types of genes affected and potential causes for these “present-absent” (PA) expression patterns in maize inbred lines are not well characterized. Microarray analyses of gene expression patterns in 11 -day old seedlings, ear, embryo, and endosperm tissues from two maize inbred lines, B 73 and Mo 17, identified 570 genes (out of 17000) with PA expression patterns {{in at least one}} tissue type. Over 55 % of the <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> exhibit “constitutively absent expression” in which one of the two genotypes exhibits lack of expression in all tissues tested. The remaining <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> exhibit “tissue specific absent expression” where a gene exhibits present-absent expression in some tissues and present-present expression in at least one other tissue types studied. Many of the <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> are maize-specific sequences that do not have orthologues in other plant species and the majority of the remaining <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> are members of gene families. Using existing eQTL and aCGH datasets, we found that PA expression differences are primarily caused by differential regulation rather than by differences in gene content. Collectively, our analysis documented a high frequency of genes that are expressed in some maize lines but not others and suggests that many of these changes are due to trans-regulatory variation...|$|R
40|$|CTLs- and lymphokine-induced {{apoptosis}} {{of infected}} hepatocytes {{during the course}} of chronic viral hepatitis is thought to be important for both disease termination and prevention of hepatocellular transformation, We therefore studied apoptosis induced by Pas (APO- 1 or CD 95) - a widely expressed cell surface receptor whose ligand is involved in lymphocyte cytotoxicity - in a set of human hepatoma cell lines. As normal hepatocytes, all of the human hepatoma cell lines tested do express detectable amounts of Fas on their surface. Nevertheless, only PLC/PRF/ 5 cells undergo apoptosis following treatment with anti-Fas. Systematic cloning and sequence analysis of the Pas cDNA did not show mutations in the <b>Pas</b> <b>gene</b> in any of the cells lines tested, However, due to alternative splicing, 5 to 10 % of the Fas cDNAs are deleted of 63 internal nucleotides corresponding to the transmembrane domain, thus encoding for a soluble and secreted form of Fas (Fas Delta TM), potentially able to neutralize anti-Fas or Fas-Ligand. Although we could not demonstrate a direct correlation between resistance of different hepatoma cell lines to Pas mediated death and endogenous expression of this transcript, we show that PLC/PRF 5 stable transfectants overexpressing Fas Delta TM are less sensitive to anti-Pas than control cells, Tn three different cell lines, resistance to anti-Pas was overcome by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexymide, Although this could suggest the existence of short-lived repressors of the Fas-activated apoptotic signalling pathway(s), we show that translational inhibition is not required for the synergistic effect of cycloheximide to take place, and that resistant hepatoma cells can be sensitized to anti-Pas by subinhibitory concentrations of this protein synthesis inhibitor. Since cycloheximide is able to activate intracellular signalling independently on its effects on protein sysnthesis, we suggest that it might provide a costimulatory signal that cooperates with Fas in the induction of cell death and that, at least in the cells we tested, resistance to Fas is not an active process involving gene transciption and translation but only the consequence of an inadequate apoptotic stimulation...|$|E

The hGK- 1 gene shows a strong homology to PA and is, similarly to PA, exclusively expressed in prostate tissue. KLK 1 is mainly expressed in kidney, pancreas and salivary glands. In addition to PA eDNA, hGK- 1 cDNAs were isolated and characterized. This allowed the comparison of PA and hGK- 1 mRNA expression.

40|$|The broad-host-range Thiobacillus ferrooxidans plasmid pTF-FC 2 is stably {{inherited}} {{over many}} generations despite a low copy number. The <b>pas</b> <b>genes</b> which lie between the repB primase and the repA helicase encode a proteic plasmid stabilisation system and {{are capable of}} stabilising the unstable heterologous R 1 replicon present on p 0 U 82. The deletion of the <b>pas</b> <b>genes</b> has been shown not to change the copy number of mutant plasmids. This suggested that the <b>pas</b> <b>genes</b> {{are not involved in}} replication and function as a stabilisation cassette. The pasA gene encodes an antidote, the pasB gene a toxin which exerts a bacteriocidal effect in an E. coli host and the pasC gene a protein which moderates the toxic effect of PasB. The PasC is unique in proteic plasmid stabilisation systems and reduces PasB toxicity only in the presence of PasA. PasA is able to repress the pas promoter and the addition of PasB increases this repression. PasC has been shown not to effect the pas promoter by itself. In the presence of PasA and PasB, PasC reduces the ability of PasA and PasB to repress the pas promoter. PasC is thought to stabilise the interaction of PasA and PasB and in doing so reduces their ability to function as repressors of the pas operon. The IncQ plasmid RSF 1010 which has similarity to pTF-FC 2 has two genes in a position analogous to the pasA, pasB and pasC genes.

40|$|Most highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} A viruses cause only mild clinical signs in ducks, {{serving as an}} important natural reser-voir of influenza A viruses. However, we isolated two H 5 N 1 viruses that are genetically similar but differ greatly in virulence in ducks. A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k 0402 / 2010 (CK 10) is highly pathogenic, whereas A/Goose/Jiangsu/k 0403 / 2010 (GS 10) is low patho-genic. To determine the genetic basis for the high virulence of CK 10 in ducks, we generated a series of single-gene reassortants between CK 10 and GS 10 and tested their virulence in ducks. Expression of the CK 10 PA or hemagglutinin (HA) gene in the GS 10 context resulted in increased virulence and virus replication. Conversely, inclusion of the GS 10 <b>PA</b> or HA <b>gene</b> in the CK 10 back-ground attenuated the virulence and virus replication. Moreover, the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> had a greater contribution. We further determined that residues 101 G and 237 E in the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> contribute to the high virulence of CK 10. Mutations at these two positions produced changes in virulence, virus replication, and polymerase activity of CK 10 or GS 10. Position 237 plays {{a greater role in}} determining these phenotypes. Moreover, the K 237 Emutation in the GS 10 <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> increased <b>PA</b> nuclear accumulation. Mutant GS 10 viruses carrying the CK 10 HA <b>gene</b> or the <b>PA</b> 101 G or PA 237 Emutation induced an enhanced innate immune response. A sustained in-nate response was detected in the brain rather than in the lung and spleen. Our results suggest that the PA and HA gene-medi-ated high virus replication and the intense innate immune response in the brain contribute to the high virulence of H 5 N 1 virus in ducks.

The coexistence of H 9 N 2 and pandemic influenza H 1 N 1 / 2009 viruses in pigs and humans {{provides an opportunity}} for these viruses to reassort. To evaluate the potential public risk of the reassortant viruses derived from these viruses, we used reverse genetics to generate 127 H 9 reassortants derived from an avian H 9 N 2 and a pandemic H 1 N 1 virus, and evaluated their compatibility, replication ability, and virulence in mice. These hybrid viruses showed high genetic compatibility and more than half replicated to a high titer in vitro. In vivo studies of 73 of 127 reassortants revealed that all viruses were able to infect mice without prior adaptation and 8 reassortants exhibited higher pathogenicity than both parental viruses. All reassortants with higher virulence than parental viruses contained the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> from the 2009 pandemic virus, revealing the important role of the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> from the H 1 N 1 / 2009 virus in generating a reassortant virus with high public health risk. Analyses of the polymerase activity of the 16 ribonucleoprotein combinations in vitro suggested that the PA of H 1 N 1 / 2009 origin also enhanced polymerase activity. Our results indicate that some avian H 9 -pandemic reassortants could emerge with a potentially higher threat for humans and also highlight the importance of monitoring the H 9 -pandemic reassortant viruses that may arise, especially those that possess the <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> of H 1 N 1 / 2009 origin...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a wealth}} of {{information}} on the genetic regulation and biochemical properties of bacterial C 4 -dicarboxylate transport systems. In sharp contrast, there are far fewer studies describing the transport and assimilation of C 5 -dicarboxylates among bac-teria. In an effort to better our understanding on this subject, we identified the structural and regulatory genes necessary for the utilization of -ketoglutarate (-KG) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1. The <b>PA</b> 5530 <b>gene,</b> encoding a putative dicarboxylate transporter, was found to be essential for the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO 1 on both -KG and glutarate (another C 5 -dicarboxy-late). Metabolite analysis confirmed that the <b>PA</b> 5530 <b>gene</b> was necessary for the uptake of extracellular -KG. Like other sub-strate-inducible transporter genes, expression of the <b>PA</b> 5530 <b>gene</b> was induced by extracellular C 5 -dicarboxylates. It was later found that the expression of the <b>PA</b> 5530 <b>gene</b> was driven solely by a 24 / 12 promoter recognized by the alternative sigma fac-tor RpoN. Surprisingly, the enhancer binding proteinMifR, which is known to have an essential role in biofilm development, was required for the expression of the <b>PA</b> 5530 <b>gene.</b> TheMifR protein is homologous to other transcriptional regulators in-volved in dicarboxylate assimilation, suggesting that MifRmight interact with RpoN to activate the expression of the <b>PA</b> 5530 <b>gene</b> in response to extracellular C 5 -dicarboxylates, especially -KG. The results of this study provide a framework for exploring the assimilation of-KG in other pseudomonads.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is {{globally}} prevalent {{and dangerous}} opportunistic bacterial pathogen, which has challenged Cystic Fibrosis (CF) {{patients in the}} United States. Pa causes serious chronic infections by forming biofilm in the CF patient’s lungs and respiratory tracts, which help the bacteria’s resistance to host defense immunity and antibiotics. The co-infection Pa and Burkholderia cenocepacia (Bc) further endangers the CF patients because Pa and Bc can form a more productive biofilm with increased virulence in mixed species biofilm (MSB) compared to Pa acting alone in a single species biofilm (SSB). Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} determine how these two bacterial pathogens form biofilm together, specifically, which <b>genes</b> of <b>Pa</b> and Bc are important for MSB. Identifying these genes could lead to discoveries in new methods for prevention and treatment of the infection. Moreover, these studies help us to further understand the bacterial communication network and interactions in MSB, which is currently not well characterized. Biofilms grow vertically and expand outward following attachment of the bacteria to a surface and subsequent cell-cell adhesion, proliferation, maturation and dispersion (Seminara et al., 2012). Bacterial cells in the biofilm exhibit a spatially different expression to adapt to the host-specific environment (Davey et al., 2000). Our previous transcriptome microarray study of different spatial regions (surface, middle, and bottom) of vertically sectioned biofilms using Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) was performed and determined 49 <b>Pa</b> <b>genes</b> that have different spatial expression in MSB in comparison to SSB (unpublished data) (Table 1 and Figure 1). My hypothesis is that the reason these <b>Pa</b> <b>genes</b> are altered is that they are important for MSB with Bc. In this study, Pa mutants of these 49 genes were screened for biofilm formation ability alone (SSB) and in the presence of Bc (MSB) using a crystal violet assay. The mutants of these genes, which can form SSB but cannot form wild-type levels of MSB, are important for MSB. To validate microarray data, non-disruptive gfp transcriptional gene fusions were constructed and tested in a drip flow reactor to visualize the gene expression in mature SSB and MSB. From the 49 genes exhibiting spatially different expression in SSB and MSB, 8 genes (Group 1, Table 1) implied importance for MSB because its mutants could form biofilm in SSB but exhibited reduced biofilm formation in MSB compared to wildtype Pa (PA 01) and Bc (LO 6). This thesis focuses on three of the eight <b>Pa</b> <b>genes</b> from Group 1 (important for MSB), PA 1497, PA 2422 and <b>PA</b> 5150. The <b>gene</b> <b>PA</b> 2422, a predicted secreted protein, is strongly expressed at the bottom of MSB while expressing lowly in surface and middle in SSB. The <b>gene</b> <b>PA</b> 5150, a predicted short chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs), showed low and discontinuous expression in surface and middle of SSB but high and continuous expression in surface of MSB. The <b>gene</b> <b>PA</b> 1497 exhibited low expression in SSB but high expression in surface and middle of MSB. Moreover, the <b>gene</b> <b>PA</b> 1497 was initially demonstrated to be a probable urea transporter and related to urea uptake for nutrient or urea stress reduction in MSB. To investigate their roles in virulence, colonization and biofilm formation in vivo, survival curves and competitive indexes of the mutants of each <b>Pa</b> <b>gene</b> in single and mixed infection with LO 6 were studied in vivo by the D. melanogaster feeding model. The results indicated that these genes were not related to virulence since its mutants still killed flies similar to wild-type. Interestingly, <b>genes</b> <b>PA</b> 2422 and PA 5150 indicated importance for mixed aggregation as well as mixed biofilm formation in vivo since their mutants could not compete and aggregate to its complements to form MSB with LO 6 in the fly crop. The <b>gene</b> <b>PA</b> 1497 showed importance for MSB in vitro but not for MSB in D. melanogaster feeding model since its mutant could compete and aggregate to its complement to form MSB in the fly crop. These findings further contribute to the information of the physiology of bacteria interaction in MSB, which is important to develop new methods for treatment and prevention of co-infection with Pa and Bc for CF patients...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Metabolically {{versatile}} {{soil bacteria}} Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) {{have emerged as}} opportunistic pathogens, especially of cystic fibrosis (CF). Previously, we initiated the characterization of the phenylacetic acid (PA) degradation pathway in B. cenocepacia, {{a member of the}} Bcc, and demonstrated the necessity of a functional PA catabolic pathway for full virulence in Caenorhabditis elegans. In this study, we aimed to characterize regulatory elements and nutritional requirements that control the <b>PA</b> catabolic <b>genes</b> in B. cenocepacia K 56 - 2. Results Translational fusions of the <b>PA</b> degradation <b>gene</b> promoters with eGFP were constructed and introduced in B. cenocepacia K 56 - 2. eGFP expression was observed when the reporter strains were grown in minimal media containing glycerol and PA or other compounds expected to proceed through the PA pathway, and in synthetic CF medium (SCFM). Addition of succinate or glucose to the PA containing medium repressed eGFP expression. To show that BCAL 0210, a putative TetR-type regulator gene encodes a regulator for the <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> in B. cenocepacia, we developed a BCAL 0210 insertional mutant reporter strain. Results show that these strains exhibit fluorescence regardless of the presence of PA in the culture. Conclusion The <b>PA</b> catabolic <b>genes</b> of B. cenocepacia K 56 - 2 are induced by PA and other related compounds, are negatively regulated by PaaR (named herein), a TetR-type regulator, and are subjected to catabolic repression by glucose and succinate. As the PA catabolic pathway of B. cenocepacia appears to be induced during growth in synthetic cystic fibrosis medium (SCFM), further research is necessary to determine the relevance of this pathway in CF-like conditions and in other host-pathogen interactions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies suggest}} that the {{plasminogen}} activator (PA) system plays a role in the proteolytic degradation of the follicle wall at the time of ovulation. Consistently, the ovulation efficiency is reduced by 26 % in mice where both physiological <b>PA</b> <b>genes</b> have been inactivated. To reveal the mechanism behind reduced ovulation efficiency in PA-deficient mice and its effect on ovarian proteolysis. we have studied the regulation of plasmin activity in the ovaries of 25 -day-old wild-type mice and mice with deficient <b>PA</b> <b>gene</b> function during gonadotropin-induced ovulation. In wild-type mice the plasmin activity was low in ovarian extracts from mice treated with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin. However, this activity was increased between 2 - 8 h after an ovulatory dose of human choriogonadotropins. In mice lacking either tissue-type PA (tPA) or PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1) the plasmin activity levels prior to ovulation were similar to wild-type mice, while extracts prepared from urokinase-type PA (uPA) deficient mice had 10 % or less of the plasmin activity. This indicates that most of the plasmin activity in the mouse ovary is generated by uPA. In addition, as the ovulation efficiency is impaired in tPA/uPA-deficient mice but appears normal in uPA-deficient mice, our data indicates that the amount of plasmin generated by PAs prior to ovulation in wild-type mice greatly exceeds the amount required for efficient ovulation. status: publishe...|$|R

Fruits of the nonastringent (NA) -type mutants lose their ability to produce PA at an early stage of fruit development, while those of the normal astringent (A) type remain rich in PA until fully ripened. The expression of many <b>PA</b> pathway <b>genes</b> was coincidentally terminated in the NA type at an early stage of fruit development. The five genes encoding the Myb transcription factor were isolated from an A-type cultivar (Kuramitsu).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are {{commonly}} occurring neoplasms with diverse endocrine and neurological effects. Although somatic gene mutations are uncommon in sporadic PAs, recent studies {{lend support to}} epigenetic modification as a potential cause of tumorigenesis and tumor progression. METHODS: A systematic literature review of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify abstracts (n= 1, 082) pertaining to key targets and mechanisms implicated in epigenetic dysregulation of PAs published between 1993 - 2013. Data regarding histopathological subtype, target genes, mode of epigenetic modification, and clinical correlation were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 47 that studies met inclusion criteria and focused on epigenomic assessment of PAs, only 2 were genome-scale analyses. Current evidence supports epigenetic alteration in at least 24 <b>PA</b> <b>genes,</b> which were categorized into four groups based on function and epigenetic alteration: 1) Sixteen tumor suppressor genes silenced via DNA methylation; 2) Two oncogenes overexpressed via histone acetylation and hypomethylation; 3) Three imprinted genes with selective allelic silencing; and 4) One epigenome writer inducing abnormal genome-scale activity and 5) Two transcription regulators indirectly modifying the genome. Of these, 5 genes (CDKN 2 A, GADD 45 y, FGFR 2, caspase- 8, and PTAG) showed particular susceptibility to epigenetic modification, with abnormal DNA methylation in > 50 % of <b>PA</b> samples. Several <b>genes</b> displayed correlations between epigenetic modification and clinically relevant parameters, including invasiveness (CDKN 2 A; DAPK; Rb 1), sex (MAGE-A 3), tumor size (GNAS 1), and histopathological subtype (CDKN 2 A; MEG 3; p 27; RASSF 1 A; Rb 1).
