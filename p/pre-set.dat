5|$|Spike appears {{along with}} the other main {{characters}} in the manga adaptation of Cowboy Bebop and the alternate manga Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star. In the PlayStation Cowboy Bebop, players control Spike as he pilots the Swordfish II during aerial battles through <b>pre-set</b> courses. Spike appears as one of the playable characters in the PlayStation 2 action/beat 'em up video game , a game set within the continuity of the series.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in <b>pre-set</b> locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign, Perfect Dark features a multiplayer mode. With {{the help of a}} Game Link Cable, two players can link together and compete in four different types of deathmatch modes, ranging from the standard kill-the-other-person on a <b>pre-set</b> time to the Counter Force mode, where the first player must rescue two hostages while the second player has to guard them. Various multiplayer maps are unlocked as the player progresses through the single player mode. Additionally, {{with the use of the}} optional Transfer Pak, players can use the game's cartridge to alternatively unlock some cheats in its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Players may also use the Game Boy Printer to print out character profiles.|$|E

The player can choose an avatar and the lightsaber color, and compete {{with up to}} seven other players over the internet or a local area network. The game includes a ranking system that tracks the player's experience. Multiplayer mode allows the use of <b>pre-set</b> characters featured in both Mysteries of the Sith and Dark Forces II. There is also a choice of characters from the Star Wars films, such as Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and Boba Fett. Each type of character has advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|The on-disc soundtrack {{contains}} 93 mixes, each featuring {{one or two}} songs. These {{are arranged}} across 24 setlists, ordered roughly by difficulty of the mix, with more difficult mixes appearing later in the game. To access later tiers, the player must earn a <b>pre-set</b> number of stars on previous mixes at any difficulty. All mixes are immediately available {{to play in the}} Quickplay and competitive modes. The table below lists the mixes in the game, including the two songs that contribute to their mix as well as their individual artists; the mix artist that created the mix; whether the song is playable in the game's DJ vs Guitar mode; and the career tier in which the song is located.|$|E
5|$|This mode was {{introduced}} in WWE 2K15, social media followers were counted for the WWE Universe liking the player (the number of followers can decrease if bad performances occur during matches); <b>pre-set</b> cutscenes {{that used to be}} created for Story Mode in WWE '12 to WWE 2K14 appear at random times. In WWE 2K16, the player has to fight for ranks to earn championships (the main goal is to reach the WWE Hall of Fame by fulfilling certain requirements). WWE 2K17 brings in a promo engine and every action can trigger a backstage brawl depending on what answer the created superstar gives. WWE 2K18 continues with the promo engine from 2k17 with free roaming now a central focus.|$|E

30|$|The optimal {{portfolio}} of classical Roy safety-first principle and Markowitz’s {{model in the}} presence or absence of short sale constraint or stability constraints hold a large number of assets and especially small weights assigned to their proportions. However, holding a large number of assets leads to the investor incurring high transaction costs. Due to this factor and other market and economic frictions, investors often hold only a small number of stocks in their portfolio. This is usually known as a sparse portfolio (a portfolio with few non-zero weights). With sparsity, one <b>pre-sets</b> limit of assets (stocks) with non-zero entries of portfolio allocations.|$|R
30|$|The proper {{functioning}} of the ultrasound transducer is a key factor for reliable diagnosis by ultrasound. This function depends highly {{on the condition of}} the piezoelectric elements and on the wires within the transducer. It is also important that the function of the matching layers in front of the elements and the backing material behind the elements work properly [17]. Modern US equipment is pre-loaded with “pre-sets”, a set of pre-determined parameters related to the different organs and type of patient. While such <b>pre-sets</b> are useful as screening images or as an initial approach, they almost always need to be changed {{on the basis of the}} clinical scenario and disease [15].|$|R
5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to <b>pre-set</b> spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family.|$|E
5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode {{allows one}} to {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard <b>pre-set</b> rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still {{be removed from the}} service, Neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues. The PS2 version does not support this feature.|$|E
5|$|Having had an {{unsuccessful}} trial with Barcelona {{at the age}} of 15, Balotelli was signed by Inter in 2006 on loan with a <b>pre-set</b> price of €150,000 to co-own the player. In June 2007 Inter exercised the option and purchased another half for additional €190,000. On 8 November 2007, as part of Sheffield F.C.'s 150th anniversary celebrations, Balotelli featured in a friendly between the two sides at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane. The game finished 5–2 to Inter, with Balotelli scoring twice. He made his first team and Serie A debut on 16 December 2007, replacing David Suazo in a 2–0 win against Cagliari. Three days later he was featured in the starting lineup in a Coppa Italia match against Reggina, scoring two goals in a 4–1 win. Balotelli gained national attention after he scored two goals against Juventus in the return leg of the Coppa Italia quarter-finals, being instrumental in a 3–2 away win for Inter. His first Serie A goal then came in April 2008 in a 2–0 away win against Atalanta. Inter {{went on to win the}} 2007–08 Serie A. Balotelli was a substitute in the 2008 Supercoppa Italiana final against Roma. He came on as a replacement for Luís Figo, scoring in the 83rd minute. Inter went on to win the final 6–5 on penalties after the match ended 2–2.|$|E
5000|$|The 5510 {{could play}} both MP3 and AAC audio files {{but not in}} their usual formats, instead the files must be {{encrypted}} and packaged into a Lockstream Embedded (.lse) files, which was a DRM technology that ensured that the encrypted files could only be played on the device. This encryption could be achieved using the bundled Nokia PC Suite software. Additionally it could record AAC audio directly from its internal FM radio, or through its built-in 2.5 mm (3/32") audio jack to another format with the extension [...]rel which only the phone could play back.

40|$|In music production, “monitoring” refers {{traditionally}} to audile strategies {{intended to}} reveal the “true” sound of mediated audio. Here, it is expanded to include new, digital technologies intended to better know and control the record-object beyond what listening and listening technologies allow. Surveying traditional, contemporary, and emerging tools of record production and distribution, this essay addresses three types of monitoring: audio, visual, and data. In sum, monitoring entails the supplementation and subversion of the ear through protocols promising to surmount the biases and distortions of audio media. Key technologies include reference speakers, room correction systems, digital audio workstations, open mixes, <b>pre-sets,</b> social networking sites, and automatic music information retrieval. Situating these within a “techoustemology” of monitoring, the central argument is that many innovations in digital audio are non-auditory and, therefore, displace sound and listening as the central means of producing relevant knowledge about music mediated in the digital age...|$|R
5|$|North Korean {{troops had}} the {{advantage}} of planning the invasion in advance and organizing a <b>pre-set</b> logistics network, but they were not able to keep this logistics network running efficiently. Their largest disadvantage was the successful large-scale UN interdiction effort, as North Korean supplies and supply lines were subjected to UN bombing raids. This effort was not successful in stopping the North Korean supplies, and the North Koreans have also been praised by historians for {{the way in which they}} were able to maintain a supply network in the face of a massive bombing campaign. However, the North Koreans did suffer reduced supply because of this, and inefficiencies in transporting supplies from railroads to individual units negated the railroads' advantage. North Korean forces, though initially successful, were unable to counter UN forces with effective air defense, and were also unable to conduct successful interdiction of their own. This meant their supply network limited the combat actions that they could undertake; logistics could not keep up with units on the offensive, and North Korean units went almost completely unsupported during key engagements, reducing their ability to fight effectively. North Korean logistical inefficiency prevented them from overwhelming UN units in the Pusan Perimeter and enabled the defending UN troops to hold on long enough for a counterattack to be launched at Inchon. This landing, coming behind North Korean lines, had the effect of collapsing the North Korean front and ultimately ended the battle around Pusan in September.|$|E
5|$|The battle system, {{called the}} Style-Change Active Time Battle system, uses {{elements}} from the Active Time Battle (ATB)-based Paradigm {{system from the}} first and second XIII games and bears similarities to the dressphere system featured in Final Fantasy X-2. Lightning has access to several customizable outfits (garb) with different power sets (plural: Schemata; singular: Schema). Each garb has its own separate ATB gauge, and actions for them are mapped onto the controller's face buttons, meaning that the usual menu-style ATB battle system is no longer needed: this enables Lightning to be moved around the battle field to a limited degree. The majority of the garbs and their accessories are either purchasable in the in-game shops or received upon completing quests. Stronger garbs, items, shields and weapons are unlocked in Hard Mode, along with access to more challenging areas and boss battles. Lightning can equip three Schemata directly, while having additional slots for backup costumes which can be equipped outside battle. She can be equipped with a close-combat weapon (sword, spear, etc.), a shield and a cosmetic accessory. The color scheme of each garb can be customized using both <b>pre-set</b> and custom color: there are options to alter both specific portions and all portions of the costume.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{set-point}} model, {{levels of}} positive and negative affects are more or less fixed within each individual, hence, after a positive or negative event, people's moods tend {{to go back to the}} <b>pre-set</b> level. According to the set-point model, extraverts experience more happiness because their <b>pre-set</b> level of positive affect is set higher than the <b>pre-set</b> point of positive affect in introverts, therefore extraverts require less positive reinforcement in order to feel happy.|$|E
50|$|Outpost can {{generate}} {{a large number}} of security alerts, which some experts believe will lead to an inexperienced end-user habitually dismissing all alerts, even important ones. This firewall is preferred by experienced users as Agnitum's direction is to give the end user complete control to all aspects of their system to avoid unwanted changes by malicious software, disclosure of personal information and malware. In advanced security mode, Outpost's Component Control will notify the user every time a network enabled application has a changed component and Anti-Leak Control will notify the user whenever an application performs a potentially dangerous operation such as overwriting another application's memory space. In practice this can result in such a high number of alerts that they can quickly become intrusive. To mediate this, Outpost includes the option to apply validated <b>pre-sets</b> automatically, to allow for a secure configuration, and yet provide ease of use.|$|R
50|$|Career mode is {{slightly}} altered, {{in that the}} player fights {{their way through the}} thirty imaginary boxers in the game, with the last of these fights being for the World Heavyweight Title. After the player has won the title, they then fight all eight of the pugilists based on real-life boxers, in 'challenge' matches. Also, when creating a fighter, it is no longer possible to alter whether the boxer is left or right-handed. Instead, it is now possible to choose the physical size of your boxer from three <b>pre-sets.</b> An improvement over Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing is that the player now has many more colors to choose from when determining skin and hair colour for their fighter. If they so wish, they can have boxers that are wildly unrealistic colours such as bright blue or green. There are also more colors to choose from when adjusting the color of a fighter's shorts.|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 2 nd Web Audio Conference (WAC), April 4 - 6, 2016, Atlanta, Georgia. This paper {{describes}} a web-based application {{which can be}} used to construct AudioUnit plugins. Using this application the audio DSP component of an AudioUnit plugin can be created using the Csound audio programming language, and the user interface (UI) composed using HTML 5. This is made possible using the combination of a Csound binary compiled for Google's portable native client API (PNaCl) which runs Csound code inside of the web application, and the Csound AudioUnit API which allows Csound compiled code to run inside of native AudioUnit plugins. The application allows users to live-code an AudioUnit plugin using on-the-y Csound code and HTML 5 evaluation within the browser which allows rapid testing of the plugin au- dio DSP and UI components. A common Javascript inter- face allows the plugin UI to communicate with both the web-based PNaCl Csound and the native AudioUnit encapsulated Csound instances. This common interface uses a JSON representation of the plugin control parameters and presets allowing users to control the plugin and create <b>pre-sets</b> that function inside of both the web application and the AudioUnit...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{nutritional}} status during fetal {{life on the}} overall health of adults has been recognized; however, dietary effects on the developing immune system are largely unknown. Development of secondary lymphoid organs occurs during embryogenesis and {{is considered to be}} developmentally programmed. Secondary lymphoid organ formation depends on a subset of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC 3) named lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Here we show that mouse fetal ILC 3 s are controlled by cell-autonomous retinoic acid (RA) signalling in utero, which <b>pre-sets</b> the immune fitness in adulthood. We found that embryonic lymphoid organs contain ILC progenitors that differentiate locally into mature LTi cells. Local LTi cell differentiation was controlled by maternal retinoid intake and fetal RA signalling acting in a haematopoietic cell-autonomous manner. RA controlled LTi cell maturation upstream of the transcription factor RORγt. Accordingly, enforced expression of Rorgt restored maturation of LTi cells with impaired RA signalling, whereas RA receptors directly regulated the Rorgt locus. Finally, we established that maternal levels of dietary retinoids control the size of secondary lymphoid organs and the efficiency of immune responses in the adult offspring. Our results reveal a molecular link between maternal nutrients and the formation of immune structures required for resistance to infection in the offspring...|$|R
50|$|Phaedra was {{the first}} album in which many things had to be structured. The reason {{was that we were}} using the Moog {{sequencer}} (all driving bass notes) for the first time. Just tuning the instrument took several hours each day, because at the time there were no <b>pre-sets</b> or memory banks. We worked each day from 11 o'clock in the morning to 2 o'clock at night. By the 11th day we barely had 6 minutes of music on tape. Technically everything that could go wrong did go wrong. The tape machine broke down, there were repeated mixing console failures and the speakers were damaged because of the unusually low frequencies of the bass notes. After 12 days of this we were completely knackered. Fortunately, after a two-day break in the countryside a new start brought a breakthrough. 'Mysterious Semblance' was recorded on Dec 4th. Pete and Chris were asleep after a long day's recording session so I invited my wife, Monique, into the studio. I called in the studio engineer and recorded it in one take on a double-keyboarded Mellotron while Monique turned the knobs on a phasing device. This piece is on the record exactly as it was recorded that day. And this practice was to continue {{for the rest of the}} session.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} four decades, various {{techniques}} including spectroscopic, wet chemical and mass spectrometric methods, have been developed and applied {{for the detection of}} ambient nitrous acid (HONO). We developed a HONO detection system based on long path photometry which consists of three independent modules i. e., sampling module, fluid propulsion module and detection module. In the propulsion module, solenoid pumps are applied. With solenoid pumps the pulsed flow can be computer controlled both in terms of pump stroke volume and pulse frequency, which enables the attainment of a very stable flow rate. In the detection module, a customized Liquid Waveguide Capillary Cell (LWCC) is used. The customized LWCC <b>pre-sets</b> the optical fiber in-coupling with the liquid wave guide, providing the option of fast startup and easy maintenance of the absorption photometry. In summer 2014, our system was deployed in a comprehensive campaign at a rural site in the North China Plain. More than one month of high quality HONO data spanning from the limit of detection to 5 ppb were collected. Intercomparison of our system with another established system from Forschungszentrum Juelich is presented and discussed. In conclusion, our instrument achieved a detection limit of 10 pptV within 2 min and a measurement uncertainty of 7 %, which is well suited for investigation of the HONO budget from urban to rural conditions in China...|$|R

25|$|<b>Pre-set</b> hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is <b>pre-set.</b> If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is to rack the slide, clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to pull the trigger a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional <b>pre-set)</b> offered this feature starting in 2006.

40|$|The {{presented}} thesis interprets {{works by}} Karolina Světlá on {{the background of}} Czech literary critical discourse {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century. It focuses on the period approaches to the forms and functions of national literature. It is aimed at problems of tasks set on a Czech writer. Karolina Světla's prose raises a question - in what extent such "political order" might have influenced individual writing style. We are interested in the issue of both author's and reader's reflection of patriotic-educational influence on literary output. Such period acceptance of this intention of given kind as a factor that in desirable (but in no manner restricting) way <b>pre-sets</b> the formation of the sense of artwork, is understood as an expression of heritage of early revival idea (belief in a nonsubstitutable power of national literature the task of which is to arouse intellectual life of a nation and to guard its independence and uniqueness is a part of this heritage in the process). It is understood as an expression of movement in myth about a nation raised from the dead - a movement that under the terms of a generally accepted patriotic-educational communication code is shared by both readers and their writer.

40|$|For {{many years}} hydrologists {{have tried to}} build {{physically}} realistic models which are still simple enough to be fitted {{to a range of}} observations made in the field. This is an ongoing process which will become even more difficult as the quality and variety of field and remotely sensed data improves. Hence models must be able to predict soil moisture patterns in time and in space as well as the outflow hydrograph. The model presented here (TOPMODEL) aims to predict the nature of variable source areas in a way that reflects their dynamics over space and time. All component processes are described and shown in operation. As TOPMODEL and similar models have a growing popularity, this paper {{can be seen as a}} demonstration of the model's predictive capabilities. The model is applied to the catchments of Plynlimon, mid-Wales for 1984, 1985 and 1986 data sets. The model has been thoroughly tested and cross-validated against independent data sets for different time periods, for a separate catchment, for internal gauges and for wet and dry periods. The resulting predicted soil moisture patterns show a small, semi-permanent variable source area that has the ability during large storms to expand dynamically over short time periods. Spatial predictions of evapotranspiration are also shown which reflect the influence of soil moisture patterns on this process. The weakest component of the model is the representation of root zone evaporation and how this <b>pre-sets</b> the antecedent condition of the catchment during long dry periods...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of {{transcription}} {{during the}} cell-cycle {{is under the}} control of E 2 factors (E 2 Fs), often in cooperation with nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), a histone-like CCAAT-binding trimer. NF-Y is paradigmatic of a constitutive, ubiquitous factor that <b>pre-sets</b> the promoter architecture for other regulatory proteins to access it. We analyzed the recruitment of NF-Y, E 2 F 1 / 4 / 6, histone acetyltransferases, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 / 3 / 4 to several cell-cycle promoters by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in serum-starved and restimulated NIH 3 T 3 cells. NF-Y binding is not constitutive but timely regulated in all promoters tested, being displaced when promoters are repressed. p 300 association correlates with activation, and it is never found in the absence of NF-Y, whereas PCAF/hGCN 5 is often found before NF-Y association. E 2 F 4 and E 2 F 6, together with HDACs, are bound to repressed promoters, including the G(2) /M Cyclin B 2. As expected, an inverse relationship between HDACs association and histones H 3 /H 4 acetylation is observed. Blocking cells in G(1) with the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor R-roscovitine confirms that NF-Y is bound to G(1) /S but not to G(2) /M promoters in G(1). These data indicate that following the release of E 2 Fs/HDACs, a hierarchy of PCAF-NF-Y-p 300 interactions and H 3 -H 4 acetylations are required for activation of cell-cycle promoters...|$|R
