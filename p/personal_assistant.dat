40|$|Intelligent {{software}} <b>personal</b> <b>assistants</b> {{for human}} organizations are an active research area within the multiagent community. However, while many capabilities for these software <b>personal</b> <b>assistants</b> are imagined or already developed, {{there has been}} no quantification of how an organization’s performance is improved by software <b>personal</b> <b>assistants.</b> Moreover, while intuitively organizations will adapt {{to take advantage of the}} new technology, {{there has been no}} work looking at how organizations should or will change in response to the new technology. This paper presents a first step toward addressing this oversight. Specifically, a computational model of the working of an organization and how software <b>personal</b> <b>assistants</b> will affect that organization is developed that allows effects of software <b>personal</b> <b>assistants</b> to be modeled. By varying the potential capabilities of the software <b>personal</b> <b>assistants</b> and the structure of the organization, we can explore the impact of the technology.

The <b>personal</b> <b>assistants</b> view of the users could also be seen as both an obstacle but also a prerequisite for users to achieve self-determination and participation and influence the ability to achieve social citizenship. ...|$|R
