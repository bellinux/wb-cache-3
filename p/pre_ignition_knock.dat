Fuel efficiency {{is one of the}} major concerns for the users, the designers and the manufacturers of internal combustion (IC) engines, The effect of increasing the temperature of cylinder liner has the advantage of reducing the specific fuel consumption but it increases thermal stresses on piston head, challenges material properties such as high temperature yield strength, creep and high temperature fatigue, increases chances of <b>knocking</b> and <b>pre</b> <b>ignition</b> and decreases the volumetric efficiency. Coolants with specified fluid properties are circulated through inner channels in the cylinder blocks to maintain an optimum temperature.

It examines the impact of engine re cycled exhaust gas compounds on the control of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine. A series of experiments were performed in a highly diluted Jet Stirred Reactor (JSR) at pressures of 1 and 10 atm (1 atm = 101325 Pa). The chosen thermo chemical conditions were close to those characteristic of the <b>pre</b> <b>ignition</b> period in an HCCI engine. The influence of various additives, namely nitric oxide (NO), ethylene (C 2 H 4) and methanol (CH 3 OH), on the oxidation of a n heptane/toluene blend was studied over a wide range of temperatures (550 1100 K), including the zone of the Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC). A new detailed chemical kinetic reaction mechanism is proposed for the oxidation of the surrogate fuel. It includes reactions of NO, methanol (CH 3 OH) and ethylene (C 2 H 4) and is used to explain the obtained experimental data. The mechanism is further used to theoretically study the impact of other Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) compounds on the hydrocarbon oxidation, namely ethane (C 2 H 6), formaldehyde (HCHO) and carbon monoxide (CO) ...|$|R

In facts a nearly zero emission vehicle may be obtained through the hydrogen propulsion; {{in this case the}} only polluting agents are nitrogen oxides if an internal combustion engine is used. Though fuel cells are considered as the most promising solution in the long term, they are still in their prototypical phase {{and the use of the}} internal combustion engine use remains until today a relevant topic. It has been evident since the 80 s that direct injection is the only method to get a high specific power without <b>pre</b> <b>ignition</b> and back fire phenomena. However this technique shows a higher difficulty in getting a well-mixed charge. The process of mixing between air and fuel obviously depends upon many parameters, such as the injection pressure and timing, the location of the injectors and so on. In this study the effects of the injection parameters on combustion, engine performances, emissions and efficiency were analyzed. Commercial electro-injectors were considered in this paper, and one of the main issues of the described work was the analysis of the engine performances and emissions as a function of the engine rotating speed and load.

Tailored composite particles {{has been applied}} to tailor aluminum particle ignition and combustion. In this research, mechanical activated aluminum magnesium powders are synthesized, tested in both laser ignition using CO 2 and propellant. Prepared powders categorized into particle size that suitable for propellant application. Laser ignition tests showed that the prepared powder are more reactive than magnalium which has the same Al:Mg weight ratio. Agglomeration capturing showed that the prepared powder produce much less than neat aluminum or even similar physical mixture of aluminum and magnesium. The burning rate of propellant using the prepared powder is increased. ^ MA Al/Mg powders as long as with comparable physical mixture are applied in propellant formulation with AP/HTPB. In order to quantify the effect of changing Mg percent. Burning rate is measured from videos captured for strand burning in windowed pressure vessel, also the agglomeration was capturing using special setup. The results showed that MA powder increase burning rate and this increase reach maximum at 50 % Mg, while propellant using physical mixture of Al/Mg show constant or little decrease in burning rate. In addition, the MA powder show lower agglomeration size in comparison to neat aluminum propellant or physical mixture with the same Mg percent. The lowest agglomeration sizes were for MA 50. However, equilibrium calculation showed 4 sec losses in specific impulse, so MA 70 was chosen as a compromise between low agglomeration size at the minimum loss in specific impulse. ^ Magnalium is an alloy of aluminum and magnesium and it is known for its ease of ignition and high oxidation energy content. It {{has been used as a}} metal fuel to increase burning rates of composite modified double base (CMDB) and ammonium perchlorate (AP) composite propellants. However, the ignition temperature is larger than the comparable mechanically activated (MA) Al-Mg powder. ^ Mechanical milling was performed on magnalium powders and modifications of structure and morphology of the alloy during milling were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The prepared magnalium powder was used in a solid propellant, which showed higher burning rates than those containing as-received magnalium. Furthermore, milled magnalium showed higher agglomeration reduction than both as received magnalium as well as MA Al-Mg powders. ^ Extend the application of mechanical alloying of aluminum to other metals with extreme difference in melting/ boiling temperature, the first is Zirconium which is a long time candidate in solid propellant community. The ease of zirconium ignition and the micro-explosive behavior shown by neat zirconium particles promote its usage in agglomeration reduction effort. the other metal is Indium, which has very low melting point compared to other metal, this may open the possibility of earlier reaction of aluminum particles at or near propellant surface resulting in less <b>pre</b> <b>ignition</b> time which reduce agglomeration tendency. ^ MA of 90 % Aluminum and 10 % of Zirconium or 10 % Indium using High energy ball milling, particle characterization using SEM/FIB, XRD and DSC/TGA are performed, burning rate and agglomeration size analyses of solid propellant using sieved MA-powder are done. The results showed that the both MA Al-ZR and MA Al-In ignite in laser beam which verify change in reactivity from neat aluminum with its protective alumina coating. However, burning rate results show no change in burning rate from neat aluminum, also the prepared material shows no reduction in agglomeration sizes...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve fuel {{conversion}} efficiency, currently made spark-ignited engines are characterized by the adoption of gasoline direct injection, supercharging and/or turbocharging, complex variable valve actuation strategies. The resulting increase in power/size ratios is responsible for substantially higher average thermal loads on the engine components, which in turn result in increased risks of both thermo-mechanical failures and abnormal combustion events such as surface <b>ignition</b> or <b>knock.</b> The paper presents a comprehensive numerical methodology for the accurate estimation of knock tendency of SI engines, based on the integration of different modeling frameworks and tools. Full-cycle in-cylinder analyses are used to estimate the point-wise heat flux acting on the engine components facing the combustion chamber. The resulting cycle-averaged heat fluxes are then used in a conjugate heat transfer model of the whole engine in order to reconstruct the actual point-wise temperature distribution of the combustion chamber walls. The two simulation realms iteratively exchange information until convergence is met. Particularly, the effect of point-wise temperature distribution on the onset of abnormal combustion events is evaluated. In-cylinder analyses account for the actual autoignition behavior of the air/fuel mixture through a look-up table approach: the combustion chamber is treated as a two-zone region (burnt/unburnt), where ignition delay tabulation, generated off-line using a constant pressure reactor, {{is applied to the}} unburnt region to estimate cell-wise knock proximity. The methodology is applied to a high performance engine and the importance of an accurate representation of the combustion chamber thermal boundary conditions when aiming at precisely evaluating the surface ignition/knock tendency is highlighted...|$|R

Environmental pollution and uncertainty in cost of petroleum products are the principal driving forces for this movement. The major pollutants from an Diesel engine system are NOx, Smoke, particulate matter, Soot. Several alternative fuels were tried but all of them are carbon based fuels, therefore net carbon based pollutants cannot be reduced. One alternative to carbon-based fuels is hydrogen. Hydrogen a non-carbon fuel only can meet zero emission vehicles standards in future. Hydrogen can be commercially used as a fuel even though it is having a number of technical and economical barriers. Numerous techniques are available for use in C.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} different {{options to}} design a multi fuel engine retaining the power densities and efficiencies of the latest Diesel heavy duty truck engines while operating with various other fuels. In a first option, an igniting Diesel fuel is coupled to a main fuel that may have any Cetane or octane number in a design where every engine cylinder accommodates a direct Diesel injector, a glow plug and the multi fuel direct injector in a bowl-in-piston combustion chamber configuration. Alternatively, an igniting gasoline fuel replaces the Diesel fuel in a design where every engine cylinder accommodates a gasoline direct injector, the multi fuel direct injector and a jet <b>ignition</b> <b>pre</b> chamber also with a bowl-in-piston combustion chamber configuration.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an integrated methodology for the accurate {{characterization of the}} thermal behavior of internal combustion engines, with particular reference to a high performance direct injected SI engine for sport car applications. The engine is operated at full load and maximum power revving speed, which {{is known to be}} critical {{from the point of view}} of thermal stresses on the engine components. In particular, two different sets of 3 D-CFD calculations are adopted: on one side, full-cycle in-cylinder analyses are carried out to estimate the point wise thermal heat flux due to combustion on the engine components facing the combustion chamber. On the other side, full-engine multi-region CHT calculations covering the engine coolant jacket and the surrounding metal components are used to compute the point wise temperature distribution within the engine head, liner and block. An iterative procedure is then implemented in order to exchange relevant thermal data between the two modeling frameworks: at first, local gas temperatures and heat transfer coefficients from the in-cylinder simulations are applied as thermal loads to the CHT calculations; then, the resulting surface temperature maps are re-applied to the combustion chamber walls for the subsequent in-cylinder CFD analysis. The procedure is iteratively repeated until convergence is met in terms of thermal characterization of the engine. The procedure takes into account the non-uniform spatial distribution of both thermal loads from the combustion process and resulting temperature distribution on the combustion chamber walls, which are known to be particularly evident when considering direct injected stratified charged engines. The resulting thermal fields are compared to those deriving from a traditional approach for both the in-cylinder and CHT calculations, i. e. the application of uniform heat fluxes on the CHT side and the use of uniform wall temperatures on the in-cylinder side. The resulting differences are highlighted and critically discussed, with particular emphasis on those which could have a relevant impact on both the fatigue strength evaluation of the engine and the arising of local undesired phenomena such as surface <b>ignition</b> and <b>knocking...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{work was}} {{concerned}} with improving understanding of the chemical and physical trade-offs when employing transient over-fuelling to control auto-ignition in gasoline spark <b>ignition</b> engines under <b>knock</b> intensities not usually tolerated in optical engines. The single cylinder engine used included full bore overhead optical access capable of withstanding unusually high in-cylinder pressures. Heavy knock was deliberately induced by adopting inlet air heating and a primary reference fuel blend of reduced octane rating. High-speed chemiluminescence imaging and simultaneous in-cylinder pressure data measurement were {{used to evaluate the}} combustion events. Under normal operation the engine was operated under port fuel injection with a stoichiometric air-fuel mixture. Multiple centred auto-ignition events were regularly observed, with knock intensities of up to ~ 30 bar. Additional excess fuel was then introduced directly into the end-gas in short transient bursts. As the mass of excess fuel was progressively increased a trade-off was apparent, with knock intensity first increasing by up to 65 % before lower unburned gas temperatures suppressed knock under extremely rich conditions. This trade-off is not usually observed during conventional low intensity knock suppression via over-fuelling and has been associated with the competing effects of reducing auto-ignition delay time and charge cooling/ratio of specific heats. Overall, the results demonstrate the risks in employing excess fuel to suppress knock deep within a heavy knocking combustion regime (potentially including a Super-Knock regime) ...|$|R
40|$|Chemical kinetic {{factors of}} {{hydrocarbon}} oxidation are examined {{in a variety}} of ignition problems. Ignition is related to the presence of a dominant chain branching reaction mechanism that can drive a chemical system to completion in {{a very short period of}} time. Ignition in laboratory environments is studied for problems including shock tubes and rapid compression machines. Modeling of the laboratory systems are used to develop kinetic models that can be used to analyze ignition in practical systems. Two major chain branching regimes are identified, one consisting of high temperature ignition with a chain branching reaction mechanism based on the reaction between atomic hydrogen with molecular oxygen, and the second based on an intermediate temperature thermal decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Kinetic models are then used to describe ignition in practical combustion environments, including detonations and pulse combustors for high temperature <b>ignition,</b> and engine <b>knock</b> and diesel <b>ignition</b> for intermediate temperature ignition. The final example of ignition in a practical environment is homogeneous charge, compression ignition (HCCI) which is shown to be a problem dominated by the kinetics intermediate temperature hydrocarbon ignition.

40|$|Ethanol is {{receiving}} great interest {{as an alternative}} fuel. Methanol is another alcohol fuel {{that could serve as}} a replacement for gasoline. Although it is currently receiving much less attention, {{it has the potential to}} play an important role. Like ethanol, methanol also has the advantage of being a liquid fuel and it can be produced from gasification of a variety of feedstocks using well established thermal chemical technology. These feedstocks include coal, natural gas, biomass and various types of waste. This paper discusses the high effective octane number and efficiency advantages of methanol and ethanol when used in direct injection engines. Octane number represents the resistance of a spark <b>ignition</b> engine to <b>knock</b> (unwanted detonation which can damage the engine). The high intrinsic octane numbers of ethanol and methanol are well known. However, a much greater effective octane number can be effectively realized through the knock resistance provided by the high level of vaporization cooling that occurs when methanol or ethanol is directly injected into the engine cylinders. A computational model is used in this paper to determine the knock resistance and effective octane number of these alcohol fuels when they are directly injected. The model indicates that the effective octane numbers are around 160 for ethanol and 180 for methanol. The high compression ratio, high degree of turbocharging and aggressive engine downsizing enabled by the high effective octane number of methanol could provide an efficiency gain of 30 â€“ 35 % (for combined city-highway driving) relative to conventional port fueled gasoline engines. An additional gain of around 10 % can be obtained by using reforming of methanol to enable ultra lean operation at low loads. The combination of these gains could thus potentially provide an efficiency gain of 40 â€“ 45 % for direct injection methanol engines. This efficiency gain is significantly greater than the typical 25 â€“ 30 % gain of turbocharged diesel engines. 3 I...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Mechanical EngineeringThe {{maintenance}} and operational costs for light aircraft have escalated {{to such an}} extent, {{that it has become}} financially very difficult to obtain and maintain a private pilotâ€™s licence. Furthermore, the engine technology of light aircraft engines dates back to pre - 1962, which means the fuel consumption is unfavorable when compared to modern automotive engines. The use of modern automotive engine technology such as multipoint fuel injection, hot-wire air induction sensors, electronic <b>ignition</b> and <b>knock</b> control, can improve the performance, while reducing the operating and maintenance costs of light aircraft significantly. The aviation legislation in South Africa makes provision for this modification, on a noncommercial basis under the category LS/ 1 - type, for aircraft that need not qualify for a certificate of airworthiness. This dissertation describes how an utomotive engine was selected and converted for operation in a light aircraft. Emphasis was put on mass saving. After evaluating a number of automotive engines regarding availability, power to weight ratio and the cost of some spare parts, the Opel 200 iS engine was favoured. This engine develops a power of 95 kW at 5600 rev/min and a torque of 180 Nm at 4600 rev/min at sea level conditions. It was then tested and evaluated on a dynamometer on both automotive fuel as well as aviation gasoline. The decrease in power with increase in altitude up to 4000 m was also investigated. The power, torque and fuel consumption were then compared to that of the existing aircraft engine, which is a Continental O- 200 -A rated at 75 kW at 2750 rev/min at sea level. The aircraft for which this engine conversion was developed is a two seater Cessna 150 trainer aircraft with a gross weight of 715 kg and a top speed of 195 km/h at sea level. It has a service ceiling of 3962 m (13000 feet). Modifications which were made to the automotive engine includes moving the distributor to a different position, modifying the cooling and exhaust systems and converting the alternator for a vacuum supply for flight instruments. Furthermore, a reduction drive to couple a propeller onto the automotive engine was designed, manufactured and evaluated. An 8 -mm pitch High Torque Drive (HTD) synchronous belt was chosen for this reduction drive. The width of the belt is 116 mm and it runs over two aluminium pulleys of diameters 95, 39 mm and 187, 07 mm with their centers 332, 8 mm apart. This belt is used to reduce the maximum operational engine speed from 5200 rev/min to a propeller speed of 2700 rev/min, and to increase the engine output torque from 170 Nm to 310 Nm at the propeller. The need for a belt tensioner arose whilst the evaluations were done on the dynamometer. A rotating adjustable pulley tensioner was designed and installed onto the reduction drive, which proved to arrest any belt flutter as required. Endurance tests conducted with the complete adapted engine and reduction drive on the dynamometer provided excellent results. With this study, it was proved beyond any doubt that a modern automotive engine {{could be used as a}} reliable, cheaper and more economical alternative power supply to propel a light aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{energy is}} widely used since the 1900 s to satisfy the global {{increasing}} energy demand. However, combustion is a process releasing pollutants such as CO 2 and NOx. One of the major challenges of the 21 th century is to reduce these emissions and car manufacturers {{are involved in this}} race. To increase fuel efficiency of piston engines, some technical solutions are developed such as â€˜downsizingâ€™. It consists in reducing the engine size while maintaining its performances using a turbocharger to increase the trapped mass in the combustion chamber. Unfortunately, downsizing can lead to abnormal combustions: intense cycle to cycle variations can appear, the fresh mixture can auto-ignite (ignition before spark-plug <b>ignition)</b> leading to <b>knock</b> or rumble. Large Eddy Simulation {{has proven to be a}} reliable tool to predict these abnormal combustions in real engines. However, such computations are performed using models to predict the flame propagation in the combustion chamber. Theses models are generally based on correlations derived in cases where turbulence is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic. Defining theoretically or numerically such a turbulence is a simple task but experimentally it is more challenging. This thesis focuses on a apparatus used in most experimental systems: fans stirred vessel. The objective of this work is twofold: 1. characterize the turbulence generated inside the vessel to check wether it is homogeneous and isotropic or not, 2. finely characterize laminar and turbulent combustion in this setup in order to increase the knowledge in this field, and thereby improve models used. First, a laminar flame propagation study has been conducted to address both confinement and curvature effects on the laminar flame speed in a spherical configuration. The main difficulty to perform the simulation of the whole configuration consists in finding a numerical method able to compute accurately the flow generated by one fan and able to handle six fans simultaneously too. Two numerical methodologies have been tested. First an Immersed Boundaries method was implemented. Despite good results obtained on academic test cases, this method was shown to be unadapted to compute accurately the flow generated by one fan. On the other hand, a numerical approach, coming from turbomachinery calculations and based on code coupling (called MISCOG), demonstrates its ability to do it and it is used to compute the flow generated by the six fans inside the closed vessel. Non-reacting flow is first analyzed and reveals a zone at the vessel center of around 6 cm of diameter where mean velocity is near zero and turbulence is almost homogeneous and isotropic. After that, the premixed fresh mixture is ignited depositing a hot gases kernel at the vessel center and the turbulent propagation phase is analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the amount of energy deposited at ignition is a critical parameter...|$|R
