Two devices were developed, the first one using distal {{scanning}} associated to a double clad large mode area (LMA) air-silica microstructured fiber, the second one using <b>proximal</b> <b>scanning</b> of a miniature multicore image guide (30000 cores inside a 0. 8 mm diameter). In both cases, the main issue has been efficient linear and nonlinear distortion pre-compensation of excitation pulses. By inserting before the delivery fiber a compact (10 cm × 10 cm footprint) grisms-based stretcher (a grating {{in close contact with}} a prism) made of readily available commercial components, we achieved as short as 35 -femtosecond-duration pulses that were temporally compressed at the direct exit of a 2 -meter-long fiber. Interestingly, this femtosecond pulse fiber delivery device is also wavelength tunable over more than 100 nm inside the Ti: Sapphire emission band. With the help of distal scan system, those unique features allowed us to record elastin (through two-photon fluorescence) and collagen (through second harmonic generation) fibered network images. These images were obtained ex-vivo with only 15 mW @ 80 MHz of IR radiation delivered to the alveoli or bronchus tissues. 3 D imaging with 400 -μm-penetration depth inside the tissue was possible working with a 2 -meter-long LMA fiber.

We report here {{the development of a}} nonlinear fiber-optic spectrometer, compatible with an endoscopic use, primarily intended for the recording of second-harmonic generation (SHG) signal of collagen and two-photon excited fluorescence (2 PEF) of both collagen and elastin. Fiber dispersion is accurately compensated by the use of a specific grism-pair stretcher, allowing laser pulse temporal width around 70 fs and excitation wavelength tunability from 790 to 900 nm. This spectrometer was used to investigate the excitation wavelength dependence (from 800 to 870 nm) of SHG and 2 PEF spectra originating from ex vivo human lung tissue samples. The results were compared with spectral responses of collagen gel and elastin powder reference samples and also with data obtained using standard nonlinear microspectroscopy.

40|$|International audienceWith recent {{advances}} in computer and optics engineering, diagnostic endoscopy of the respiratory tract has now entered the era of microscopic imaging. Fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy (FCFM) {{is based on the}} principle of confocal microscopy, where the microscope objective {{has been replaced by a}} thin fiberoptic probe. FCFM has a lateral resolution of 3 µm, a field of view of 600 µm and produces real-time imaging at 9 frames per second in contact with the probe tip. FCFM has the capability to image in real time the epithelial and subepithelial layers of the proximal bronchial tree, as well as the more distal parts of the lungs, from the terminal bronchioles down to the alveolar ducts and sacs. Potential applications of FCFM include « optical biopsy » assessment of early bronchial cancers, bronchial wall remodelling evaluation, diffuse peripheral lung disease exploration as well as in-vivo diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules. The technique has also the potential to be coupled with fluorescence molecular imaging. This strategy may help in the future to enable early diagnosis, rapid typing of molecular markers and assessment of therapeutic outcome in many lung diseases. This paper reviews the capabilities and possible limitations of confocal microendoscopy for proximal and distal lung exploration with special focus on lung cancer imaging in-vivo. Introduction : Confocal microscopy allows in-vivo optical sectionning of cells and tissue with enhanced lateral and axial resolutions (1, 2). Translating the principles of confocal microscopy into the clinic for endomicroscopy is currently the subject of significant scientific efforts (1, 2), which recently ended in the availability of commercial systems for both animal (3 - 5) and human in vivo explorations (6 - 8). Confocal endomicroscopes aim at providing to the clinician « optical biopsies », i. e. in vivo microscopic imaging, of a living tissue during endoscopy (9, 10). Such systems have recently been applied to the in-vivo microscopic imaging of both the proximal (7) and distal respiratory systems (8). Current commercially available confocal endomicroscopy system for lung exploration (Cellvizio®, Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France) uses the principle of <b>proximal</b> <b>scanning</b> in which the illumination light scans the proximal part of a coherent fiber bundle or miniprobe. This bundle conducts the light back and forth from the imaged area at the tip of the miniprobe (11). This fiber bundle or catheter based system, also described as « fibered confocal fluorescent microscopy (FCFM) » uses very thin and flexible miniprobes (300 µm to 2 mm in diameter) that can contain up to 30, 000 compacted microfibers. Similar to conventional confocal microscopes, FCFM uses two rapidly moving mirrors to scan the microfibers across the coherent fiber bundle in a raster fashion. Each microfiber, which is scanned one at a time by the laser light, acts as a light delivery and collection system and is, in essence, its own pinhole. The main advantages of this design is the very small size and the flexibility of the probe that can reach the more distal part of the lungs (8), as well as the fast image collection speed that helps to avoid artifacts due to tissue movement. Specific miniprobes for bronchial and alveolar imaging have a diameter of 1 mm that can enter the working channel of any adult bronchoscope. These miniprobes are devoid of distal optics and have a depth of focus of 0 - 50 µm, a lateral resolution of 3 µm for a field of view of 600 x 600 µm. The system produces endomicroscopic imaging in real time at 9 to 12 frames / second. Two different wave lengths are currently available. The Cellvizio 488 nm is used for autofluorescence imaging of the respiratory tract as well as for fluorescein induced imaging of the GI tract (7, 8, 12). Another device at 660 nm excitation can be used for epithelial cell imaging after topical application of exogenous fluorophores such as methylene blue (13 - 15). The main limitations are related to the maximal imaging capabilities (30, 000 pixels) which restrict the lateral resolution to the fiber intercore distance (3 µm), and the fact that the focus point of the system cannot be adjusted. Interpretation of the data also relies on the fluorescence properties of the imaged tissue. Human In-vivo confocal microimaging of the normal lung using FCFM. FCFM imaging of the proximal bronchi. FCFM can easily be performed during a fiberoptic bronchoscopy under local anesthesia (7, 8). The technique of in-vivo bronchial FCFM imaging is simple : the miniprobe is introduced into the 2 mm working channel of the bronchoscope and the probe tip applied onto the bronchial mucosae under sight control. The depth of focus being 50 µm below the contact surface, the system can image the first layers of the bronchial subepithelial connective tissue, presumably the lamina densa and the lamina reticularis (7). At 488 nm excitation, FCFM produces very precise microscopic fluorescent images of the bronchial basement membrane zone (Figure 1). FCFM bronchial microimaging reveals a mat of large fibers mainly oriented along the longitudinal axis of the airways with crosslinked smaller fibers, as well as larger openings – 100 µm to 200 µm - corresponding to the bronchial glands origins. In vivo, the technique also makes it possible to record high resolution images of small airways such as terminal bronchioles, which are recognizable by the presence of the helicoidal imprint of the smooth muscle on the inner part of the bronchiole. (7) Fluorescence properties of the bronchial mucosae at 488 nm excitation are determined by the concentration of various cellular and extracellular fluorophores, including the intracellular flavins, that could originate from the epithelial cells, and specific crosslinks of collagens and elastin present in the subepithelial areas (1, 16, 17). Microspectrometer experiments coupled with FCFM imaging, have clearly demonstrated that the main fluorescence signal emitted after 488 nm excitation from both bronchial and alveolar human system originates from the elastin component of the tissue (7, 8, 18). Indead, flavin cellular autofluorescence appears too weak to allow imaging of the epithelial layer using 488 nm FCFM without exogenous fluorophore (19). Similarly, the collagen fluorescence does not significantly affect the FCFM image produced at 488 nm, the fluorescence yield of collagen at this wave length being at least one order of magnitude smaller than that of elastin. As a result, 488 nm excitation FCFM specifically images the elastin respiratory network that is contained in the basement membrane of the proximal airways and participates to the axial backbone of the peripheral interstitial respiratory system. In the future, it is possible that a modified FCFM device using several wavelengths (20), or devices based on a multiphoton approach (2) may enable imaging of collagen, elastin and flavins simultaneously. Distal lung FCFM imaging in-vivo : from the distal bronchioles down to the lung acini. In the acinus, elastin is present in the axial backbone of the alveolar ducts and alveolar entrances, as well as in the external sheath of the extra-alveolar microvessels (21, 22). FCFM acinar imaging is easily obtained by pushing forward the probe a few centimeters after the endoscope is distally blocked into a sub-segmental bronchi. When progressing towards the more distal parts of the lungs, the entry into the alveolar space is obtained by penetration through the bronchiolar wall. Alveolar fluorescence imaging in active smokers dramatically differs from imaging in non-smokers. The alveolar areas of smokers are usually filled with highly fluorescent cells corresponding to alveolar fluorescent macrophages, the presence of which appears very specific of active smoking. (8). In situ alveolar microspectrometric measurements have been performed in active smokers, which evidenced that the main fluorophore contributing to the FCFM alveolar signal corresponds to the tobacco tar by itself, explaining this difference (8, 18). Potential clinical applications of bronchoalveolar confocal imaging. Preliminary studies have shown that per endoscopic FCFM could be used to study specific basement membrane remodeling alterations in benign or malignant / premalignant bronchial alterations (7). The FCFM microstructure of the bronchial walls underlying premalignant epithelia is significantly altered. In these precancerous conditions, the elastic fibered pattern of the lamina reticularis is absent or disorganized in almost every preinvasive lesions (Figure 1). This supports the hypothesis of an early degradation of the basement membrane components in preinvasive bronchial lesions. However, while this observation shed some light on the origin of the autofluorescence defect in precancerous bronchial lesions, the absence of epithelial cell visualisation does not allow the technique to differentiate between the different grades of progression of the precancerous bronchial lesions such as metaplasia / dysplasia / carcinoma in situ. In order to be successfully applied to the exploration of precancerous / cancerous bronchial epithelial layer, the FCFM technique would need to be coupled with the use of an exogenous non toxic fluorophore. Ex-vivo studies have shown that the resolution of the system is not a limitation for nuclear or cellular imaging (7, 8). Exogenous fluorophores that could be activated at 488 nm such as Acriflavin - a putative mutagen agent - or fluorescein solution, which does not stain the nuclei (23) are not approved for intrabronchial use. Recently, Lane et al. have used a confocal microendoscope prototype at 488 nm excitation and topical physiological PH cresyl violet to provide cellular contrast in the bronchial epithelium both in-vitro and in-vivo (24). Methylene blue is a non toxic agent which is commonly used during bronchoscopy for the diagnostic of broncho-pleural fistulae. MB is also used in gastroenterology for chromo-endoscopic detection of precancerous lesions (25 - 27), as well as for in-vivo microscopic examination of the GI tract and bronchus using a novel endocytoscopic system (28, 29). MB is a potent fluorophore which enters the nuclei and reversibelly binds to the DNA, before being reabsorbed by the lymphatics. In order to give a fluorescent signal, MB needs to be excited around 660 nm, and is therefore accessible to FCFM intravital imaging using this excitation wave length. Preliminary study has demonstrated that Cellvizio 660 / topical methylene blue makes it possible to reproducibly image the epithelial layer of the main bronchi. Future studies using this technique could make it possible to differentiate normal, premalignant and malignant alterations at the microscopic level. If this strategy is successful, FCFM may become a very powerful technique for in vivo diagnostic of early malignant and premalignant conditions of the bronchial tree, allowing the analysis of both the epithelial and subepithelial layers during the same procedure. Coupled to electromagnetic navigation or radial EBUS, FCFM could also image microstructural and cellular patterns of peripheral solide lung nodules in-vivo at both 448 nm and 660 nm (14, 15) (figure 2). Until now, confocal microendoscopy of the airways has only used endogenous autofluorescence or simple fluorescent contrast agents to visualize the in-vivo cellular and interstitial organization of the airways and distal lung parenchyma. In the future, using molecular contrast coumponds, it will be possible to extend the range of biomarkers that may be imaged. Pilot studies exploring this strategy have recently been published, that provided specific confocal imaging of molecular probes in precancerous conditions of the oral cavity ex-vivo (30) and of colonic dysplasia in-vivo (31). Coupled to FCFM, molecular imaging may help in the future to enable early diagnosis, rapid typing of molecular markers and assessment of therapeutic outcome in many lung diseases...|$|E

Methods: Fifty one children (n = 23 boys and 28 girls; mean age 10. 1 years) participated in "Bounce at the Bell" which consisted of 10 counter-movement jumps 3 x per day (total ~ 3 min/day). Controls were 71 matched children who followed usual school practice.

Presentation of the caseWe report a false aneurysm of the calcified deep femoral artery after hip fracture and uneventful stabilization with a gamma nail, in an 85 year old woman. Three weeks after surgery there was swelling of the <b>proximal</b> thigh. Ultrasound <b>scan</b> revealed a false aneurysm of the deep femoral artery and plain X-ray showed a lesser trochanter fragment spiking the calcified deep femoral artery. Open repair of the pseudo-aneurysm with a vein patch was performed. DiscussionNowadays the preferred imaging of false aneurysms is by computed tomographic (CT) angiography but this involves high radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agents and may delay diagnosis. What made this a special case was the post-operative plain X-ray which showed a displaced fragment of the lesser trochanter spiking the calcified deep femoral artery, as confirmed on CT scanning. ConclusionSurgeons should pay attention to any displaced bone fragments close to calcified vessels, especially {{in the evaluation of}} routine x-rays following surgical treatment of fractures.

We assessed precision of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and used MRI, DXA, and hip structure analysis (HSA) to assess 7 -mo changes in bone structure at the femoral neck in 18 prepubertal girls. At baseline, girls were 10. 4 (0. 5) yr, 144. 0 (8. 2) cm, and 35. 2 (7. 0) kg, on average. Total bone and cortical cross-sectional area (ToA and CoA) were calculated from high-resolution T 1 -weighted MRI oblique axial images of the femoral neck. We used <b>proximal</b> femur DXA <b>scans</b> (Hologic QDR- 4500) and the HSA program to estimate bone cross-sectional area (CSA), and calculate section modulus. MRI precision was determined by scanning 10 volunteers (13 – 46 yr old) three times with and without repositioning. Precision (CVrms) was 2 % for ToA and 7 % for CoA. Significant correlations were observed between FN area and MRI-derived ToA (r = 0. 57, p = 0. 013) and CoA (r = 0. 47, p = 0. 050). There were significant positive changes over 7 mo by both methods.

40|$|A {{transitional}} or cortico-trabecular junctional zone {{exists at}} any location composed of both cortical and trabecular bones {{such as the}} metaphyses of tubular bones and short bones like the femoral neck. The transitional zone comprises the inner cortex adjacent to the medullary canal and trabeculae abutting against the cortex contiguous with the endocortical surface. This is a site of vigorous remodeling. Intracortical remodeling cavitates the inner cortex expanding this transitional zone {{at the price of}} compact-appearing cortex so that it contains porosity, cortical fragments that resemble trabeculae, and trabeculae abutting the eroding cortex. The porosity of the transitional zone is an important source of bone loss. It reduces bone strength exponentially and is a quantifiable `fingerprint 2 ̆ 7 of structural deterioration. A new automated method of segmentation of bone from background and bone into its compact-appearing cortex, transitional zone, and trabecular compartment is described, with a new approach to quantification of cortical porosity. Segmentation is achieved by automatically selecting attenuation profile curves perpendicular to the periosteal surface. Local bone edges are identified as {{the beginning and the end}} of the rising and falling S-shaped portions of the curve enabling the delineation of the compartments. Analyzing 3600 consecutive overlapping profiles around the perimeter of each cross-sectional slice segments the compartments.

A transitional or cortico-trabecular junctional zone exists at any location composed of both cortical and trabecular bones such as the metaphyses of tubular bones and short bones like the femoral neck. The transitional zone comprises the inner cortex adjacent to the medullary canal and trabeculae abutting against the cortex contiguous with the endocortical surface. This is a site of vigorous remodeling. Intracortical remodeling cavitates the inner cortex expanding this transitional zone {{at the price of}} compact-appearing cortex so that it contains porosity, cortical fragments that resemble trabeculae, and trabeculae abutting the eroding cortex. The porosity of the transitional zone is an important source of bone loss. It reduces bone strength exponentially and is a quantifiable `fingerprint' of structural deterioration. A new automated method of segmentation of bone from background and bone into its compact-appearing cortex, transitional zone, and trabecular compartment is described, with a new approach to quantification of cortical porosity. Segmentation is achieved by automatically selecting attenuation profile curves perpendicular to the periosteal surface. Local bone edges are identified as {{the beginning and the end}} of the rising and falling S-shaped portions of the curve enabling the delineation of the compartments. Analyzing ~ 3600 consecutive overlapping profiles around the perimeter of each cross-sectional slice segments the compartments. Porosity is quantified as the average void volume fraction of all voxels within each compartment. To assess accuracy at the distal radius and tibia, μCT images of cadaveric specimens imaged at 19 μm voxel size served as the gold standard. To assess accuracy at the <b>proximal</b> femur, <b>scanning</b> electron microscopy (SEM) images of specimens collected at 2. 5 μm resolution served as the gold standard. Agreement between HRpQCT and the gold standards for segmentation and quantification of porosity at the distal radius and tibia ranged from R(2) = 0. 87 to 0. 99, and for the proximal femur ranged from 0. 93 to 0. 99. The precision error in vivo for segmentation and quantification of porosity in HRpQCT images at the distal radius, given by the root mean square error of the coefficient of variation, ranged from 0. 54 % for porosity of the transitional zone to 3. 98 % for area of the compact-appearing cortex. Segmentation of the transitional zone minimizes errors in apportioning cortical fragments and cortical porosity to the medullary compartment and so is likely to allow accurate assessment of fracture risk and the morphological effects of growth, aging, diseases and therapies.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{efficacy}} of color flow duplex imaging (CFDI) in detecting proximal upper extremity venous outflow obstruction in hemodialysis patients was {{compared with that}} of traditional contrast venography. Methods: From 1993 through 1997, all hemodialysis patients who were evaluated for upper extremity venous outflow obstruction of the axillary, subclavian, or brachiocephalic veins with both CFDI and venography were identified. Medical history, hemodialysis access procedures, and indications for imaging were reviewed. The diagnostic accuracy of CFDI was {{compared with that of}} venography for proximal venous outflow obstruction, including focal stricture, partial obstruction, or complete occlusion. Results: Sixty upper extremities in 42 hemodialysis patients were imaged with both CFDI and venography. Previous ipsilateral intravenous dialysis catheters had been present in 33 (55 %) of the extremities imaged; current catheters were present in 16 (27 %) of the extremities imaged; and 28 (67 %) of the extremities imaged had a current ipsilateral arteriovenous (AV) shunt. Five (8 %) of the 60 duplex scans were nondiagnostic because of artifact from intravenous dialysis catheters (3) or incomplete visualization of the subclavian or brachiocephalic veins (2) and were excluded from further analysis. In the remaining 55 duplex <b>scans,</b> <b>proximal</b> venous outflow obstruction was found in 18 (33 %), compared with 21 (38 %) identified by means of venography (P = not significant [NS]). Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for CFDI were 81 %, 97 %, 94 %, and 89 %, respectively. Conclusion: CFDI is a reliable means of detecting proximal upper extremity venous outflow obstruction and should replace contrast venography as the initial imaging study in hemodialysis patients.

40|$|UNLABELLED: The {{relationship}} between early growth and adult femoral geometry {{has not been}} studied previously. In 333 adults, {{we were able to}} show that infant weight predicts femoral width and cross-sectional moment of inertia but not femoral neck length. These results support the hypothesis that growth in early life leads to persisting differences in proximal femoral geometry. INTRODUCTION: Both femoral geometry and bone mass have been shown independently to predict both hip strength and fracture risk. Whereas growth during intrauterine and early postnatal life has been shown to influence adult bone mass, the {{relationship between}} growth in early life and adult femoral geometry has not been described previously. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the relationship between growth during early life, adult hip geometry, and proximal femur bone mass in a sample of 333 men and women (60 - 75 years of age), for whom birth weight and weight at 1 year of age were recorded. Hip geometry was derived using Hip Structure Analysis software from <b>proximal</b> femur DXA <b>scans</b> (Hologic QDR 1000). RESULTS: There were significant (p < 0. 002) relationships between weight at age 1 year and measures of femoral width as well as intertrochanteric (IT) cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI), but not with femoral neck length. The relationships with measures of femoral width but not CSMI remained after adjusting for adult body weight and were independent of proximal femoral BMC. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that different patterns of growth in utero and {{during the first year of}} life lead to persisting differences in proximal femoral geometry, thereby mediating in part the effects of early growth on risk of hip fracture in adulthood...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to validate dual energy x-rays absorptiometry (DXA) -based Finite Element (FE) models to predict femoral strength in two loading configurations. Thirty-six pairs of fresh frozen human <b>proximal</b> femora were <b>scanned</b> with DXA and quantitative computed tomography (QCT). For each pair one femur was tested until failure in a one-legged standing configuration (STANCE) and one by replicating the positon of the femur in a fall onto the greater trochanter (SIDE).

The outcomes of the models were compared to standard DXA-based areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measurements. For the STANCE configuration the DXA-based FE models (R²= 0. 74, SEE= 1473 N) outperformed the best densitometric predictor (Neck_aBMD, R²= 0. 66, SEE= 1687 N) but not the QCT-based FE models (R²= 0. 80, SEE= 1314 N). For the SIDE configuration both QCT-based FE models (R²= 0. 85, SEE= 455 N) and DXA neck aBMD (R²= 0. 80, SEE= 502 N) outperformed DXA-based FE models (R²= 0. 77, SEE= 529 N). In both configurations the DXA-based FE model provided a good 1 : 1 agreement with the experimental data (CC= 0. 87 for SIDE and CC= 0. 86 for STANCE), with proper optimization of the failure criteria.

40|$|Dual-energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) is {{a widely}} used method for measuring bone mineral in the growing skeleton. Because scan analysis in children offers a number of challenges, we compared DXA results using six analysis methods at the total proximal femur (PF) and five methods at the femoral neck (FN), In total we assessed 50 scans (25 boys, 25 girls) from two separate studies for cross-sectional differences in bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and for percentage change over the short term (8 months) and long term (7 years). At the proximal femur for the short-term longitudinal analysis, there was an approximate 3. 5 % greater change in bone area and BMC when the global region of interest (ROI) was allowed to increase in size between years as compared with when the global ROI was held constant. Trend analysis showed a significant (p < 0. 05) difference between scan analysis methods for bone area and BMC across 7 years. At the femoral neck, cross-sectional analysis using a narrower (from default) ROI, without change in location, resulted in a 12. 9 and 12. 6 % smaller bone area and BMC, respectively (both p < 0. 001), Changes in FN area and BMC over 8 months were significantly greater (2. 3 %, p < 0. 05) using a narrower FN rather than the default ROI, Similarly, the 7 -year longitudinal data revealed that differences between scan analysis methods were greatest when the narrower FN ROI was maintained across all years (p < 0. 001), For aBMD {{there were no significant}} differences in group means between analysis methods at either the PF or FN, Our findings show the need to standardize the analysis of <b>proximal</b> femur DXA <b>scans</b> in growing children...|$|R
40|$|Background Chronic {{low-level}} {{exposure to}} cadmium may promote calcium loss via urinary excretion. We undertook a prospective population study {{to investigate whether}} environmental exposure to cadmium lowers bone density and increases risk of fractures. Methods We measured urinary cadmium excretion, a biomarker of lifetime exposure, in people from ten districts of Belgium, of which six districts bordered on three zinc smelters. We also measured cadmium in soil and in vegetables from the districts, and collected data on incidence of fractures and height loss. Bone density was measured at the forearm just above the wrist by single photon absorptiometry, and calculated as the mean of six proximal and four distal scans. Findings Mean cadmium excretion at baseline was 8. 7 nmol dairy. Across the ten districts, mean cadmium concentration in soil ranged from 0. 8 to 14. 7 mg/kg, and from 0. 1 to 4. 0 mg/kg dry weight in vegetables. Median follow-up was 6. 6 years. Mean forearm bane density in <b>proximal</b> and distal <b>scans</b> was 0. 54 g/cm(2) and 0. 43 g/cm(2) in men, and 0. 44 g/cm(2) and 0. 34 g/cm(2) in women, in postmenopausal women, a twofold increase in urinary cadmium correlated with 0. 01 g/cm(2) decrease in bone density (p < 0. 02). The relative risks associated with doubted urinary cadmium were 1. 73 (95 % CI 1. 16 - 2. 57; p = 0. 007) for fractures in women and 1. 60 (0. 94 - 2. 72, p = 0. 08) for height toss in men. Cadmium excretion in districts near smelters was 22. 8 % higher (p = 0. 001) than in other districts, with fracture rates of 16. 0 end 10. 3 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively, and a population-attributable risk of 35. 0 %. Interpretation Even at a low degree of environmental exposure, cadmium may promote skeletal demineralisation, which may lead to increased bone fragility and raised risk of fractures...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} rapid rise of Scanning Probe Microscopy, SPM, as a {{prominent}} and versatile approach for surface studies. SPM instruments are differentiated from the beam-based ones {{by the fact that}} they use solid proximal probes for localized analysis. The most commonly used SPM methodology is Atomic Force Microscopy, AFM. In its basic implementation, AFM provides topographical information with nanometer resolution. The most common modifications allow the magnetic, electrostatic, and specific chemical environment to be examined. However, there is no direct way today to perform general chemical analysis with AFM probes. Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy, NSOM, is another variation of SPM where sharp tapered optical fibers serve dual purposes, being proximal probes of sample topography, and providing the means for localized light delivery for optical studies with sub-wavelength spatial resolution. Again, NSOM itself does not have a general chemical contrast capability. However, the capability to deliver light to localized area opens the way to a multitude of experiments that can be devised using different aspects of light interaction with the sample. This thesis demonstrates several approaches for combined topographical and chemical investigations. Infrared spectroscopy is a sensitive molecular analysis tool. Without <b>scanning</b> <b>proximal</b> probe, IR microscopy has very poor spatial resolution. Enabling methodology for probe fabrication for Near-field Scanning Infrared Microscopy, NSIM, is presented. The efforts in combining NSOM with mass spectrometry, which is probably the most general chemical analysis tool, are outlined. We have demonstrated the possibility of simultaneous topographical and molecular imaging. Another variation of chemical imaging is the combination of SPM and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy, LIBS. In this method the elemental composition of samples is obtained by analyzing optical emissions from transient plasma plumes formed by intense laser pulses delivered through fiber probes. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. The instrument that we have developed is an attractive complementary tool for established methods of spatial elemental analysis, such as X-ray Fluorescence. Among its attractive features are operation in ambient conditions, minimal requirements for sample preparation, and ease of use...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess whether}} the {{transient}} stresses of foot impact {{with the ground}} {{are similar to those}} found during midstance loading and if the location of high stress correlate with the sites most commonly associated with mechanically induced osteoarthritis (OA). We compared impact stresses in subchondral bone between two subject-specific, three-dimensional, finite-element models of the equine metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint-one with advanced OA and one healthy, and with similar published data on the stresses that occur at midstance. Two right MCP joints (third metacarpal and <b>proximal</b> phalanx) were <b>scanned</b> using micro-computed tomography (μCT). Images were segmented, and meshed using modified 10 -node quadratic tetrahedral elements. Bone material properties were assigned based on the bone density. An impact velocity of 3. 55 m/s was applied to each model and contact pressures and stress distribution were calculated for each. In a separate iteration, the third metacarpal was loaded statically. A sampling grid of 160 equidistant points was superimposed over selected slices, and average peak stresses were calculated for 6 anatomical regions. Within-region maximal peak and average von Mises stresses were compared between healthy and OA bones in both midstance and impact loading. Average impact stresses across all regions, in both locations (palmar and dorsal) were greater in the OA model. Highest impact stresses were located in the dorsal medial condyle in the healthy (12. 8 MPa) and OA (14. 1 MPa) models, and were lowest in the palmar medial and lateral parasagittal grooves in the healthy (5. 94 MPa) and OA (7. 07 MPa) models. The healthy static model had higher peak (up to 49. 7 % greater) and average (up to 38. 6 % greater) stresses in both locations and across all regions compared to the OA static model. Under simulated footfall a trot, loading on the dorsal aspect of the third metacarpal at impact created stresses similar to those found during midstance. The high accelerations that occur under impact loading are likely responsible for creating the high stresses, as opposed to midstance loading where the high stresses are the result of high mass loading. Although the stress magnitudes were found to be similar among the two loading conditions, the location of the high stress loading occurred in sites that are not typically associated with osteoarthritic changes...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of assessing trabecular architecture together with bone mineral density to determine bone stiffness and fracture risk in osteoporosis {{has been well}} established. However, no imaging modalities are available to assess trabecular architecture at clinically relevant sites in the axial skeleton. Recently developed flat-panel CT devices, however, offer resolutions that are potentially good enough to resolve bone architecture at these sites. The goal {{of the present study}} was to investigate how accurate trabecular architecture and stiffness can be determined based on images from such a device (XperCT, Philips Healthcare). Ten cadaver human C 3 vertebrae, twelve T 12 vertebrae and 12 <b>proximal</b> femora were <b>scanned</b> with XperCT while mimicking in-vivo scanning conditions and compared to scans of the same bones with microCT. Standard segmentation and morphology quantification algorithms were applied as well as finite element (FE) simulation based on segmented and gray value images. Results showed that mean trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) and number (Tb. N) can be accurately determined at all sites. The accuracy of other parameters, however, depended on the site. For T 12 no other structural parameters could be accurately quantified and no FE-results could be obtained from segmented images. When using gray-level images, however, accurate determination of cancellous bone stiffness was possible. For the C 3 vertebrae and proximal femora, mean bone volume fraction (BV/TV), Tb. Sp, Tb. N, and anisotropy (C 3 only) could be determined accurately. For Tb. Th, structure model index (SMI, femur only), and anisotropy good correlations were obtained but the values were not determined accurately. FE simulations based on segmented images were accurate for the C 3 vertebrae, but severely underestimated bone stiffness for the femur. Here also, this was improved by using the gray value models. In conclusion, XperCT does provide a resolution that is good enough to determine trabecular architecture, but the signal to noise ratio is key to the accuracy of the morphology measurement. When the trabeculae are thick e. g. in the femur or the noise is low, e. g. cervical spine, architecture and stiffness could be determined accurately, but when the trabeculae are thin and the noise is high, e. g. thoracic spine, architecture could not be determined accurately and the connectivity was lost and hence no mechanical properties could be calculated directly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{reviewed}} {{the incidence of}} stent-graft migration after endovascular aneurysm repair in a prospective multicenter trial and identified factors that may predispose to such migration. MethodsAll patients who received treatment {{during the course of}} the multicenter AneuRx clinical trial were reviewed for evidence of stent-graft migration over 5 years, from 1996 to 2001. Post-deployment distance from the renal arteries to the proximal end of the stent graft and the proximal fixation length (length of the infrarenal neck covered by the stent graft) were determined in patients for whom pre-procedure and post-procedure computed tomography scans were measured in an independent core laboratory. ResultsStent-graft migration was reported in 94 of 1119 patients, with mean time after device implantation of 30 ± 11 months. Freedom from migration was 98. 6 % at 1 year, 93. 4 % at 2 years, and 81. 2 % at 3 years (Kaplan-Meier method). Subset (n = 387) analysis revealed that initial device deployment was lower in 47 patients with migration, as evidenced by a greater renal artery to stent-graft distance (1. 1 ± 0. 7 cm), compared with 340 patients without migration (0. 8 ± 0. 6 cm; P =. 006) on post-implantation computed tomography <b>scan.</b> <b>Proximal</b> fixation length was shorter in patients with migration (1. 6 ± 1. 4 cm) compared with patients without migration (2. 3 ± 1. 4 cm; P =. 005). There was significant variation in migration rate among clinical sites (P <. 001), ranging from 0 % to 30 % (median, 8 %), with a greater than twofold difference in migration rate between the lowest quartile (6 %) and the highest quartile (15 %) clinical sites. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that renal artery to stent-graft distance (P =. 001) and proximal fixation length (P =. 005) were significant predictors of migration, and that each millimeter increase in distance below the renal arteries increased risk for subsequent migration by 5. 8 % and each millimeter increase in proximal fixation length decreased risk for migration by 2. 5 %. Pre-implantation aortic neck length, neck diameter, degree of device oversizing, correct versus incorrect oversizing, device type (stiff vs flexible), placement of proximal extender cuffs at the original procedure, and post-procedure endoleak were not significant predictors of migration. Migration was treated with placement of extender modules in 23 patients and surgical conversion in 7 patients; 64 patients (68 %) with migration have required no treatment. ConclusionsStent-graft migration among patients treated in the AneuRx clinical trial appears to be largely related to low initial deployment of the device, below the renal arteries, and short proximal fixation length. Significant variation in migration rate among clinical sites highlights the importance of the technical aspects of stent-graft deployment. Advances in intraoperative imaging and deployment techniques that have been made since completion of the clinical trial facilitate precision of device placement below the renal arteries and should increase proximal fixation length. Whether this, together with increased iliac fixation length, will result in lower risk for migration remains to be determined in long-term follow-up studies...|$|R
