2500|$|On November 21, 2011, the U.S. {{government}} filed {{a lawsuit}} in Federal District Court in California against Hammer to obtain a court judgment on his unpaid taxes for years 1996 and 1997. In December 2011, this litigation {{was reported in the}} media. Hammer owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $779,585 in back taxes from his earnings dating back to 1996–1997 - during the years Hammer was believed to be facing his worst financial problems. After years of public and media ridicule regarding his financial problem, Hammer tried to assure fans and [...] "naysayers" [...] via Twitter, claiming that he had proof he had already taken care of his debt with the IRS. [...] "700k … Don't get too excited [...]. I paid them already and kept my receipt. Stamped by a US Federal Judge", Hammer tweeted from his account @MCHammer. However, the District Court ruled against Hammer. He appealed but, on December 17, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected Hammer's argument that because the government had not listed those taxes in the government's <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> filed with the Bankruptcy Court, the government should be [...] "estopped" [...] from collecting the taxes. [...] According to a 2017 episode of the Reelz TV series Broke & Famous, the situation was eventually resolved.|$|E

5000|$|A {{creditor}} is {{a person}} or entity that holds a claim against the debtor or the property of a debtor. The claim may have the status of an administrative claim, priority claim, a secured claim, or a general unsecured claim.

In most instances, a creditor must file a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> form with the clerk of the involved bankruptcy court.

5000|$|Stern v. Marshall, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that a {{bankruptcy}} court, as a non-Article III court (i.e. courts without full judicial independence) lacked constitutional authority under Article III of the United States Constitution to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor's <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim,</b> even though Congress purported to grant such statutory authority under [...] The case drew an unusual amount of interest because the petitioner was the estate of former Playboy Playmate and celebrity Anna Nicole Smith (whose legal name was Vickie Lynn Marshall).

5000|$|Every {{creditor}} {{must prove}} his claim and a creditor {{who does not}} prove his claim is not entitled to any distribution of the proceeds from bankrupt's estate. The claim must be delivered to the trustee in bankruptcy and the trustee in bankruptcy must examine every <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> and can request further proof. The trustee may disallow, {{in whole or in}} part, any claim of right to a priority under the BIA or security. Generally, the test of proving the claim before the trustee in bankruptcy is very low, and a claim is proved unless it is too [...] "remote and speculative". The rationale for such a low test is to discharge as many claims as possible to allow the bankrupt to make a fresh start after the discharge.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} a default judgment against her for sexual harassment, Smith petitioned for bankruptcy in California. Pierce filed a non-dischargeability claim and <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> against Smith based on public statements her lawyers {{made to the}} media shortly after her husband died, accusing Pierce of frustrating J. Howard's intentions {{to set up a}} new trust for Smith and isolating his father. Pierce alleged these statements were libelous, and he successfully sued Smith's attorneys on the same grounds in Texas State Court. Smith opposed the claims and countersued Pierce on the basis her statements were true and on tort claims she was already pursuing in Texas. The Bankruptcy Court dismissed the libel claim on summary judgment and did not allow the claim to proceed to trial. After being released from bankruptcy, Smith pursued her counterclaim against Pierce, alleging he interfered with his father's intention to set up a trust in favor of Smith.|$|E

5000|$|A § 1981 claim must {{therefore}} identify an impaired [...] "contractual relationship" [...] {{under which the}} plaintiff personally has rights, whether {{to make a contract}} not yet formed or to enforce one already made.

McDonald's argument that because he [...] "negotiated, signed, performed, and sought to enforce the contract," [...] Domino's could not insist that the contract was not his own, the Court believed [...] "makes light of the law of corporations and of agency," [...] and [...] "contradicts McDonald's own experience." [...] It noted that during JWM's bankruptcy, Domino's filed a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> against the corporation rather than McDonald personally.

5000|$|In a June 25, 2017 {{article in}} The Washington Post, {{journalist}} Adam Winkler observed {{that there has}} been a shift in Supreme Court decisions towards favoring corporations. In a May 15, 2017 ruling, the Supreme Court found in favor of Midland Funding, a debt collection company in the Johnson's Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. The Alabama Bankruptcy Court rejected Midland's lawsuit against Johnson for the credit-card debt of $1,879.71, which was a 'stale claim'. as Johnson was under bankruptcy protection. [...] "Johnson then sued Midland, [...] "seeking actual damages, statutory damages, attorney’s fees, and costs for a violation" [...] of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, claiming that its filing a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> on an obviously time-barred debt was 'false,' 'deceptive,' 'misleading,' 'unconscionable,' and 'unfair'. The Court claimed that collection agencies [...] "do not engage in a false, deceptive or unfair practice by filing stale, unenforceable claims against a person in bankruptcy — even though the whole point of those claims is to fool people into paying money they are not legally obligated to pay".|$|E
5000|$|Article III, § 1 of the Constitution vests [...] "the {{judicial}} {{power of}} the United States" [...] in life-tenured and salary-protected judges, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Non-Article III bankruptcy judges may not exercise the general judicial {{power of the}} United States and therefore may not finally resolve controversies that are not within the core Article I bankruptcy power Congress relied upon in creating {{the current system of}} bankruptcy jurisdiction. In Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982), a fractured plurality of the Court held that Article I bankruptcy courts could not constitutionally hear a state law breach of contract claim when the debtor was the plaintiff. The main question presented in Stern v. Marshall was whether a bankruptcy court could constitutionally enter a final judgment on an otherwise non-core tort cause of action asserted as a compulsory counterclaim to a creditor's nondischargeability complaint and <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> against the debtor. When the matter came before the 9th Circuit appellate court, it rendered the District Court's decision invalid on preclusion grounds since the Bankruptcy Court's decision was non-core.|$|E
