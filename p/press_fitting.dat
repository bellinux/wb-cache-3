The stators are traditionally press fitted into the housing. Tolerance rings can be used instead of <b>press</b> <b>fitting.</b> With their wavelike protrusions, tolerance rings generate a retention force when compressed between the housing and the stator. These protrusions act as springs and allow the mating components to expand and contract at different rates while still providing the required retention force.|$|E
40|$|An {{idealized}} axisymmetric {{finite element}} model of the acetabulum and acetabular implant was analyzed. The assembly strains induced in the bone by the press fit insertion of an oversized cementless acetabular implant were examined. The interaction between implant and bone was modeled as a nonlinear contact-coupled interface to simulate the actual process of <b>press</b> <b>fitting</b> the oversized implant into the prepared acetabular bone bed. INTRODUCTION Initial implant stability of the cementless acetabular implant is commonly achieved by <b>press</b> <b>fitting</b> oversized acetabular components. Implicit in this concept is "pre-straining" of the bone which must occur {{at the time of}} implantation. Assembly strains are expected to be very different in both magnitude and direction from the strains induced by normal joint forces, and can greatly change the mechanical environment and load transfer patterns.

Processes of pulsed forming are known to expand the capabilities of traditional stamping operations.

Mild contact model based on introduction of acting-in-vicinity forces repelling the surfaces to be in contact was employed.

40|$|Abstract. For the {{possibility}} of easy disassembly of a joint assisted by strain recovery, the joint is fabricated with a cold rolled circular polycarbonate (PC) disk embedded {{in the center of}} an aluminium or a PC disk. Also, a shaft and a hollow circular disk are assembled by compressing or <b>press</b> <b>fitting</b> a cold rolled PC ring into the gap between them. First, the cold rolled polycarbonate disk is heat treated and the change in geometry is examined. Secondly, in order to evaluate joint strength, shear force and torque of the assembled joints are discussed with regard to reduction in thickness, tool clearance and interference. Lastly, joints are heat treated and the disassembly is checked. The cold rolled disk is recovered with the temperature 190 °C for 20 min. In embedding, disk compression in addition to rolling reduction is effective in increasing joint strength. In fabricating the shaft/disk joint, deformation of polycarbonate was not effective due to the recovery in room temperature after joining, while <b>press</b> <b>fitting</b> of the polycarbonate ring could fabricate the assembly. Heat treatment helped the joint to be automatically disassembled. The directly joined parts became completely apart, but the shaft/disk joint was disassembled only between the ring and the disk...|$|E
40|$|Conventional joining {{techniques}} like <b>press</b> <b>fitting</b> or crimping {{require the}} application of mechanical forces to the parts which, {{in combination with the}} tolerances of both parts to be joined, lead to imprecision and poor tensile strength. In contrast, laser beam micro welding provides consistent joining and high flexibility and it acts as an alternative as long as <b>press</b> <b>fitting,</b> crimping, screwing or gluing are not capable of batch production. Different parts and even different metals can be joined in a non-contact process at feed rates of up to 60 m/min and with weld seam lengths from 0. 6 mm to 15. 7 mm. Due to the low energy input, typically 1 J to 6 J, a weld width as small as 50 mu m and a weld depth as small as 20 mu m have been attained. This results in low distortion of the joined watch components. Since the first applications of laser beam micro welding of watch components showed promising results, the process has further been enhanced using the SHADOW technique. Aspects of the technique such as tensile strength, geometry and precision of the weld seam as well as the acceptance amongst the -mostly conservative-watch manufacturers have been improved...|$|E

40|$|Failed {{brazed joints}} causing {{refrigerant}} leakage is a multi-billion dollar {{problem for the}} global HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R industry. Leaks are frequently caused due to mechanical fatigue from extreme pressure cycling, temperature cycling including exposure to freeze/thaw cycles, or vibrational wear induced from rotating electrical machinery. In this study, a new, cost-effective type of <b>press</b> <b>fitting</b> suitable {{for a wide variety}} of refrigerants and applications is investigated experimentally. Three tests to accelerate mechanical fatigue were devised to simulate real world extreme conditions to determine possible failure modes of refrigerant components and joining technologies. The first test is a combined thermal/pressure shock test designed to simulate abrupt temperature and pressure changes due to start/stop cycles and frost/defrost mode changes. Field failures of brazed joints have been detected due to water being trapped in tight spaces and expanding during freezing, causing high stress on brazed joints. The second test is a vibration test, designed to simulate vibrational loads induced from rotating components in the system. The third and final series of testing is a freeze/thaw cycling profile which simulates ice buildup and defrost observed during heat pump operation. The investigated press fittings are made from aluminum and utilize o-ring seals. Test specimen of six different sizes designed to connect to aluminum tubes having outer diameters between 9. 5 mm and 28. 5 mm were subjected to the accelerated tests described above. Pressure, temperature, strains and acceleration were measured and analyzed. At the end of each test the exposed specimen were carefully investigated for possible damage and leak tightness confirmed.

Besides the experience based definition of inspection intervals, the application of fracture mechanics tools is currently being introduced as an appropriate method. Basic fatigue crack growth data both {{in the range of}} stable crack propagation and near the threshold have been experimentally determined for the heat-treated railway axle steels 25 CrMo 4 (EA 4 T) and 34 CrNiMo 6 +QT under constant and variable amplitude loading at relevant stress ratios (predominantly fully reversed load cycles.
