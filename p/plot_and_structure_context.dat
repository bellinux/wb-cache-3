5000|$|The French scholar Roland Barthes {{designed}} {{a system of}} five major codes that function as tools to analyze narrative texts in ways that move beyond examinations of <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure,</b> thereby bringing to the surface the subtle ways a text becomes a literary narrative.|$|R

50|$|The play {{plays with}} the form of daytime radio serials, as its <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure,</b> with clearly defined heroes and antagonists, riffs off the {{suspense}} thrillers that were popular around the time the play is set. That it was originally written as a radio play positions it as an homage to the genre.|$|R

It is also divided into strata: astronomic, mythological, historical, philosophic. There are two special strata: cinematographic and dream. They influence the unique and rich metalogy of the poetry, the <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of the texts. The chronotop subordinates all other nature philosophic categories.

40|$|To date, {{document}} clustering by genres or authors {{has been}} performed mostly {{by means of}} stylometric and content features. With the premise that novels are societies in miniature, we build social networks from novels as a strategy to quantify their <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure.</b> From each social net-work, we extract a vector of features which characterizes the novel. We perform clus-tering over the vectors obtained, and the resulting groups are contrasted in terms of author and genre. ...|$|R
5000|$|Due to the cut-up method’s random {{approach}} to text, Burroughs repeatedly defended his writing style against critics, {{explaining that the}} cut-up method created possibilities for mixing text written by himself and other writers and helped deemphasize the traditional role of text. As a result, the novels {{that make up the}} trilogy are even more sporadic in <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> than Naked Lunch. Burroughs spoke of the trilogy as a [...] "sequel," [...] and [...] "mathematical extension" [...] of the themes and techniques of Naked Lunch.|$|R

50|$|Mantel {{states that}} {{the idea for the}} book came in two parts. In Botswana in 1977 she read law reports about {{medicine}} murders and the theft of children; later she heard of an 'apparently happily married couple who suddenly split up after doing all the hard work of bringing up a family'. Mantel brought these two parts of the story together to form the novel. She goes on to reveal that the novel was the most difficult she had ever written (as of 2010) as she struggled with its formal <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} operatic versions of Shakespeare's play, Salieri's Falstaff is notable for a general compression and streamlining of the original plot, note {{the absence of the}} two young lovers, Fenton and Anne, and the addition of a scene in which Mistress Ford pretends to be German to charm Falstaff (actually two such scenes exist, one in a separate score by Salieri was probably omitted from the original Viennese productions). Defranceschi moves the <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> away from Elizabethan drama and closer to the standard conventions of late 18th century opera buffa.|$|R

50|$|The {{chapters}} 14 to 20 {{are dedicated}} to <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of underlying text behind the performance art. These sections include the theory of Sanskrit prosody, musical meters and the language of expression. Chapter 17 presents the attributes of poetry and figures of speech, while chapter 18 presents the art of speech and delivery in the performance arts. The text lists ten kinds of play, presents its theory of <b>plot,</b> costumes, <b>and</b> make-up. The text dedicates several chapters exclusively to women in performance arts, with chapter 24 on female theater. The training of actors is presented in chapters 26 and 35 of the text.|$|R
5000|$|Comparing the {{unconventional}} <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of Oberon {{with that of}} The Magic Flute, Kobbé contends that 'Oberon is musically strong enough to {{stand on its own}} merits'. Grove notes that despite the [...] "unmitigated awfulness" [...] of the libretto, Weber was able to provide musical characterisation for the main characters, at the same time colourfully evoking the mood of the different scenes; the careful recurring use of the horn call motif helps to give the impression of tying the work together. The fairy strands of the opera are given in delicate, beautifully orchestrated music that often anticipates the fairy music of Mendelssohn.|$|R
5000|$|In 1831 Lermontov's poetry ("The Reed", [...] "Mermaid", [...] "The Wish") {{started to}} get less confessional, more ballad-like. The young author, having found taste for <b>plots</b> <b>and</b> <b>structures,</b> was trying {{consciously}} to rein in his emotional urge and master the art of storytelling. Critic and literature historian D.S. Mirsky regards [...] "The Angel" [...] (1831) as the first of Lermontov's truly great poems, calling it [...] "arguably the finest Romantic verse ever written in Russian." [...] At least two other poems of that period - [...] "The Sail" [...] and [...] "The Hussar" [...] - were later rated among his best.|$|R

50|$|Both Ercole and Contarino, {{recovered}} from their wounds, {{are present in}} the courtroom in disguise. Ercole reveals himself, and is arrested for killing Contarino; but he challenges Romelio, and a trial by combat is arranged. Julio is Romelio's second, while Ercole is seconded by the still-disguised Contarino. (This part of the plot makes little sense, the biggest of the <b>plotting</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> problems condemned by critics. Contarino senselessly neglects the obvious recourse of showing everyone that he's not dead.) A Capuchin friar comes to see and counsel Romelio, who grows tired of his preachiness and locks him away - preventing the friar from revealing that Contarino is still alive.|$|R

5000|$|Frank Rich {{reviewed}} the 1982 Roundabout production for The New York Times, writing: [...] " [...] 'The Chalk Garden' is extraordinarily modern {{for a high}} comedy set {{in the drawing room}} of a stuffy Sussex manor house: its <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> are elliptical; its witty lines aren't brittle but are instead redolent with what the author calls 'the shape and shadow of life.'... Bagnold's play is in part a journey to the bottom of Miss Madrigal's identity; it is also about the effect the woman has on her employer's household. Mrs. St. Maugham is a selfish, eccentric paragon of privilege who spends her days gardening but can't make anything grow." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{model for}} {{shows such as}} these had already been laid out by other western {{programs}} such as Gunsmoke, Lawman, and The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, so Wichita Town {{may not have been}} unique in its <b>plotting</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure.</b> The two most unusual features about the series were the presence of Joel McCrea, a favorite of Western movie audiences for his performance in such films as Union Pacific, Buffalo Bill, and Ramrod, and the fact that his real life son was in Wichita Town, but did not play his son. Wichita Town was produced by Mirisch Company and Joel McCrea's Production company for Four Star Television and aired for a single season.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a review}} in Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction Brian M. Stableford asserts that Bridge is an “incomplete” novel: [...] "Here, all together, we have beginning, middle and end (albeit mixed up a little), but {{all three are}} cut to the bone, {{revealing}} <b>plot</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> but hardly anything of flesh, with virtually no connective tissue."He characterizes Zelazny’s literary techniques as “flashy and aggressive.” These techniques allow “him to cut abruptly from scene to scene, building dazzling images and maintaining a furious pace. It makes his writing tremendously vigorous, and it makes reading him an exciting business.” However, the “fragmentary nature of the stories” permits him to make Bridge’s story “ridiculous” and “facile.” ...|$|R
