40|$|In {{calculating the}} {{performance}} of free-space optical communications links, the transmitter <b>pointing</b> <b>loss</b> {{is one of the}} two most important factors. It is shown in this paper that the traditional formula for the instantaneous <b>pointing</b> <b>loss</b> (i. e., for the transmitter telescope far-field beam pattern) is quite inaccurate. A more accurate and practical approximation is developed in which the <b>pointing</b> <b>loss</b> is calculated using a Taylor series approximation. The four-term series is shown to be accurate to 0. 1 dB for the theta angles not greater than 0. 9 lambda/D (wavelength/telescope diameter) ...|$|E

The instrument, although not primarily designed for precision antenna pointing applications, demonstrated an on-average 10 -hour tracking error of several millidegrees. The system-level instrument performance is shown by analysis to be sensor limited. Simulated instrument improvements show a tracking error of less than 1 mdeg, which would provide acceptable performance, i. e., low <b>pointing</b> <b>loss,</b> for the Deep Space Network 70 -m antenna subnetwork, operating at Ka-band (1 -cm wavelength) ...|$|E

The link is intended to demonstrate high rate downlink capability of rates up to 2. 5 Gbps. The design objective of tracking and pointing subsystem is to limit the <b>pointing</b> <b>loss</b> to within 4 dB to ensure the maximum downlink capability with 3 dB link margin.

40|$|The role of <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> for {{symmetrical}} relations introduced {{simultaneously with}} probe trials {{in the absence}} of original relations on all probe trial performances was evaluated. Training was completed after six conditional discriminations were established in two contexts. <b>Point</b> <b>loss</b> was introduced simultaneously with probe trials {{in the absence of}} original relations in the first context. Probe trials with no <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> in the absence of original relations were introduced in the second context. The simultaneous introduction of probe trials and the <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> contingency may in some cases prevent the emergence of an equivalence class in the context that contained the <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> {{as well as in the}} context where no <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> occurred...|$|R
40|$|During 50 -min sessions, 6 male human {{subjects}} could press either Button A or Button B available as nonreversible options. Button A presses were nonaggressive responses and earned points {{according to a}} fixed-ratio 100 schedule. Prior to the experiment subjects were instructed that every 10 (fixed-ratio 10) Button B presses (aggressive responses) subtracted a point from a fictitious 2 nd subject. A random-time schedule of <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> was used to engender aggressive responding. The instructions attributed these <b>point</b> <b>losses</b> to the Button B presses of the subject's fictitious partner. Aggressive responding either escaped or avoided <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> by initiating an interval free of <b>point</b> <b>loss.</b> The duration of the interval was varied systematically across sessions. Avoidance contingencies maintained {{a high rate of}} aggressive responding over 30 sessions in the absence of <b>point</b> <b>loss.</b> Escape contingencies also maintained aggressive responding across sessions, with rates of aggressive responding corresponding to rates of <b>point</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|R
40|$|Inaccurate {{instructions}} {{have been}} shown to interfere with or override the effects of otherwise effective behavioral contingencies. This effect may be mediated by such factors as the discriminability of current contingencies, histories with accurate and inaccurate instructions, and consequences associated with following instructions. The current experiment investigated the effects of instructions (both accurate and inaccurate) on response patterns when paired with feedback regarding correspondence between responding and instructions, feedback indicating potential <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> for non-correspondence, and <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> for non-correspondence. Inaccurate instructions produced only small and temporary disruptions in response patterns, as did the addition of feedback alone and feedback indicating potential <b>point</b> <b>loss.</b> The introduction of escalating <b>point</b> <b>losses</b> contingent on non-correspondence, ranging from 20 %- 50 % of points earned, produced changes in response patterns that corresponded to the inaccurate instructions. These outcomes indicate that the imposition of direct consequences for noncompliance may alter the effects of other contingencies. Depending on the point at which <b>point</b> <b>losses</b> disrupt responding, such effects may be interpreted in terms of <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> avoidance or, alternatively, maximizing point gains...|$|R
40|$|A deep-space optical {{communications}} {{channel is}} subject to fading losses due to pointing and tracking errors. Barron and Boroson [1] illustrated that these losses may be mitigated by introducing an interleaver that spreads a pointing-induced fade over many codewords of an error-correction code. Several approximations to determine the interleaver gain, which can be computationally prohibitive, are introduced in [1]. However, the methods are accurate only {{for a range of}} code rates and interleaver depths. We extend these methods, using a nonlinear fit to capacity, to allow the analysis of any code rate and fading depth. We also develop an efficient and accurate approximation of the finite-interleaving losses by an inversion of the Marcum Q-function, and provide expressions relating the interleaver memory to the finite-interleaver losses. The resulting expressions provide an accurate tool for a system engineer to size the interleaver memory {{as a function of the}} data rate and the allowable <b>pointing</b> <b>loss.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of X-band (8. 5 -GHz) and 32 -GHz telemetry links is compared {{on the basis}} of the total data return per DSN station pass. Differences in spacecraft transmitter efficiency, transmit circuit loss, and transmitting antenna area efficiency and <b>pointing</b> <b>loss</b> are not considered in these calculations. Thus, the performance differentials calculated in this memo are those produced by a DSN 70 -m station antenna gain and clear weather receiving system noise temperature and by weather. These calculations show that, assuming mechanical compensation of the DSN 70 -m antenna for 32 -GHz operation, a performance advantage for 32 GHz over X-band of 8. 2 dB can be achieved for at least one DSN station location. Even if only Canberra and Madrid are used, a performance advantage of 7. 7 dB can be obtained for at least one DSN station location. A system using a multiple beam feed (electronic compensation) should achieve similar results...|$|E
40|$|The Ka-Band Link Experiment was {{the first}} {{demonstration}} of a deep-space communications link in the 32 - to 35 -GHz band (Ka-band). It was carried out using the Mars Observer spacecraft while the spacecraft was in the cruise phase of its mission and using a 34 -meter beam-waveguide research and development antenna at the Goldstone complex of the DSN. The DSN has been investigating the performance benefits of a shift from X-band (8. 4 GHz) to Ka-band (32 GHz) for deep-space communications. The fourfold increase in frequency is expected to offer a factor of 3 to 10 improvement (5 to 10 dB) in signal strength for a given spacecraft transmitter power and antenna size. Until recently, the expected benefits were based on performance studies, {{with an eye to}} implementing such a link, but theory was transformed to reality when a 33. 7 -GHz Ka-band signal was received from the spacecraft by DSS 13. This article describes the design and implementation of the Ka-Band Link Experiment from the spacecraft to the DSS- 13 system, as well as results from the Ka-band telemetry demonstration, ranging demonstration, and long-term tracking experiment. Finally, a preliminary analysis of comparative X- and Ka-band tracking results is included. These results show a 4 - to 7 -dB advantage for Ka-band using the system at DSS 13, assuming such obstacles as antenna <b>pointing</b> <b>loss</b> and power conversion loss are overcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> for {{symmetrical}} probe performances on other performances of an observed equivalence class, on {{the emergence of}} equivalence performances, and on performances in other contexts were examined. After training six conditional discriminations in three contexts, probes (symmetry, transitivity, symmetrical transitivity) were introduced in contexts 1 and 2. In context 3, only trained conditional discrimination trials were delivered. After demonstrations of equivalence in contexts 1 and 2, <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> was placed on symmetrical performances {{in one of these}} contexts; probe trials and <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> for symmetrical performances were simultaneously introduced in context 3. <b>Point</b> <b>loss</b> for symmetrical performances may disrupt other probe performances of an observed equivalence class in that same context; does not necessarily disrupt the emergence of equivalence performances; and may disrupt probe performances in other contexts.

40|$|A concept using {{a closely}} packed array (cluster) of {{transmit}} antennas for space-craft applications that require high effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) is described and analyzed. The September 2003 baseline Jupiter Icy Moons Or-biter (JIMO) plan information provided {{to this study}} specifies that a data rate of 10 megabits per second (Mbps) be sent from Jupiter to Earth, at a maximum distance of 6. 25 AU using a 32 -GHz (Ka-band) downlink with a 3 -dB margin, to be received by {{the equivalent of a}} DSN 70 -m antenna. This requires a 250 -MW EIRP, to be delivered by power combined from four 150 -W power amplifiers into a 3 -m-diameter antenna. The JIMO mechanical pointing error was specified to be ± 0. 003 rad, which results in an EIRP loss of between 10 dB and 15 dB if a single 3 -m-diameter antenna is used without some additional form of beam steer-ing to correct for the mechanical pointing error. A cluster of four 1. 5 -m-diameter antennas can electronically steer a spatially combined beam to correct for the me-chanical pointing error and reduce the maximum <b>pointing</b> <b>loss</b> to 2. 7 dB. Pointing information for electronic beam steering may be obtained by tracking an uplink microwave signal with the cluster or from infrared or optical Earth, Sun, or star trackers mounted with the antenna cluster. The results of a trade study comparing the single-antenna approach with the antenna-cluster approach are given, using a cluster of four antennas. The system architecture and the high-EIRP cluster concept are described. Advantages of the cluster concept over a single antenna include electronic beam steering, reduced antenna mass, higher antenna efficiency, lower power density in the transmit system components, spatial power combining, and graceful degradation...|$|E
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{is one of}} NASA's most {{productive}} astronomical observatories. Launched in 1990, the HST continues to gather scientific data to help scientists around the world discover amazing wonders of the universe. To maintain HST in the fore front of scientific discoveries, NASA has routinely conducted servicing missions to refurbish older equipment {{as well as to}} replace existing scientific instruments with better, more powerful instruments. In early 2002, NASA will conduct its fourth servicing mission to the HST. This servicing mission is named Servicing Mission 3 B (SM 3 B). During SM 3 B, one of the major refurbishment efforts will be to install new rigid-panel solar arrays as a replacement for the existing flexible-foil solar arrays. This is necessary in order to increase electrical power availability for the new scientific instruments. Prior to installing the new solar arrays on HST, the HST project must be certain that the new solar arrays will not cause any performance degradations to the observatory. One of the major concerns is any disturbance that can cause <b>pointing</b> <b>Loss</b> of Lock (LOL) for the telescope. While in orbit, the solar-array temperature transitions quickly from sun to shadow. The resulting thermal expansion and contraction can cause a "mechanical disturbance" which may result in LOL. To better characterize this behavior, a test was conducted at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in the Large Space Simulator (LSS) thermal-vacuum chamber. In this test, the Sun simulator was used to simulate on-orbit effects on the solar arrays. This paper summarizes the thermal performance of the Solar Array- 3 (SA 3) during the Disturbance Verification Test (DVT). The test was conducted between 26 October 2000 and 30 October 2000. Included in this paper are: (1) brief description of the SA 3 's components and its thermal design; (2) a summary of the on-orbit temperature predictions; (3) pretest thermal preparations; (4) a description of the chamber and thermal monitoring sensors; and (6) presentation of test thermal data results versus flight predictions...|$|E

40|$|Electric-shock {{punishment}} produces stimulus-generalization gradients with animals. The {{purpose of}} the present experiments was to determine whether response-cost punishment produces similar gradients with humans. In Experiment 1, psychophysical procedures were used to generate a set of 10 horizontal lines that differ in length such that adjacent lines were indiscriminable, then reinforcement gradients were obtained with those lines to show that gradients can be produced with those stimuli. In Experiment 2, subjects pressed a lever for points exchangeable for money on a VI schedule in the presence of each stimulus, then points were lost immediately after each response in the presence of Stimulus 6 (the middle value). Response rate decreased in the presence of Stimulus 6, but it had a similar increase in the presence of all other stimuli. Those results suggest that <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> and not line length was the discriminative stimulus for further <b>point</b> <b>loss.</b> To minimize stimulus control exerted by immediate <b>point</b> <b>loss,</b> and thus enhance control by line length, in Experiment 3 points were lost only {{at the end of the}} component correlated with Stimulus 6, and in Experiment 4 <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> was arranged on VR and VI schedules. Neither delayed nor intermittent <b>point</b> <b>loss</b> produced gradients: Unpunished response rate was similar in the presence of all line lengths. The present results suggest that the technique of reinforcing responding in the presence of several stimuli during baseline then punishing responding in the presence of only one of those stimuli does not produce with humans and response-cost punishment the gradients obtained with pigeons and electric-shock punishment...|$|R
