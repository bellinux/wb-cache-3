5|$|Ao filed {{a motion}} before the Court of Appeal to un-freeze some of his {{personal}} bank accounts, {{on the grounds that}} those accounts were supposedly not linked to the corruption case, and were the actual accounts for receiving his salary. The motion was denied on 26 September 2008: according to the verdict of his corruption trial, all his money and <b>personal</b> <b>possessions,</b> even if purchased legally, now belonged to Macau.|$|E

5|$|Following this defeat, Ptolemy {{retreated to}} Egypt, and Menelaus {{was forced to}} {{surrender}} Salamis and its garrison, further increasing Demetrius' strength. Demetrius then moved {{to take over the}} rest of Cyprus, taking over the garrisons, some 16,000 infantry and 800 cavalry, into his own army as well. Menelaus and other relatives and friends of Ptolemy, however, who had been captured, were soon sent back to Egypt with their <b>personal</b> <b>possessions.</b>|$|E

5|$|Druitt's {{father died}} {{suddenly}} {{from a heart}} attack in September 1885, leaving an estate valued at £16,579 (equivalent to £ today). In a codicil, Druitt senior instructed his executors to deduct the money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of £500. Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's <b>personal</b> <b>possessions.</b> Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith and Ethel), and eldest son William.|$|E
5|$|On July 26, 1863, with Margaret at {{his bedside}} reading the 23rd Psalm to him, Houston died.

5|$|Other {{theories}} {{of foul play}} have suggested an attack by Riffian pirates, who were active {{off the coast of}} Morocco in the 1870s. Charles Edey Fay, in his 1942 account, observes that pirates would have looted the ship, yet the <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> of captain and crew, some of significant value, were left undisturbed. In 1925, the historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs, in a fit of a religious mania, had slaughtered all on board and then killed himself. In a later edition of his book Lockhart, who had by then spoken to Briggs's descendants, apologized and withdrew this theory.|$|E
5|$|The handcarts were {{modeled after}} carts used by street {{sweepers}} and were made {{almost entirely of}} wood. They were generally six to seven feet (183 to 213cm) long, wide enough to span a narrow wagon track, and could be alternately pushed or pulled. The small boxes affixed to the carts were three to four feet (91 to 122cm) long and eight inches (20cm) high. They could carry about 500 pounds (227kg), most of this weight consisting of trail provisions and a few <b>personal</b> <b>possessions.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the RUC {{arrived at}} the site they found five dead bodies, a seriously injured Stephen Travers, body parts, the {{smouldering}} remains of the destroyed minibus, debris from the bomb blast, bullets, spent cartridges, and the band members' <b>personal</b> <b>possessions,</b> including clothing, shoes, and {{a photograph of the}} group, strewn across the area. They also discovered a stolen white Ford Escort registration number 4933 LZ, which had been left behind by the gunmen, along with two guns, ammunition, green UDR berets and a pair of glasses later traced to James McDowell, the gunman who had ordered the shootings.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{targets of}} the {{operation}} were the <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> and documents of Jacobo Árbenz and those of Carlos Enrique Díaz (who had been chief {{of the armed forces}} under Árbenz, and briefly his successor as president), as well as the headquarters of the Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT), and the offices of trade unions, known front organizations, and police agencies. The results of the initial searches were disappointing for the CIA; many of the offices had already been plundered both by the Guatemalan army and by other looters. The CIA were particularly interested in finding documents that mentioned the Árbenz's government's purchase of weapons from Czechoslovakia, but they were unsuccessful. They were also unsuccessful in finding any evidence that the Soviet Union had controlled the communist movement in Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Captain Thomas Thompson on Leander {{initially}} {{tried to}} escape the much larger French ship, but it rapidly became clear that Généreux was faster than his vessel. At 09:00 the ships exchanged broadsides, the engagement continuing until 10:30, when Captain Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille made an unsuccessful attempt to board Leander, suffering heavy casualties in the attempt. For another five hours the battle continued, Thompson successfully raking Généreux at one stage but ultimately being outfought and outmanoeuvered by the larger warship. Eventually the wounded Thompson surrendered his dismasted ship by ordering his men to wave a French tricolour on a pike. As French sailors took possession of the British ship, Lejoille encouraged systematic looting of the sailors' <b>personal</b> <b>possessions,</b> even confiscating the surgeon's tools {{in the middle of}} an operation. Against the established conventions of warfare, he forced the captured crew to assist in bringing Leander safely into Corfu, and denied them food and medical treatment unless they co-operated with their captors.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{operation}} began soon after Árbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954, with several agents being dispatched to Guatemala beginning on July 4. These included agents of the CIA and the Office of Intelligence Research (OIR). The first phase involved the collection of 150,000 documents from sources including Árbenz's <b>personal</b> <b>possessions,</b> trade union offices, and police agencies. The ruling military junta led by Carlos Castillo Armas aided these efforts. Following a presentation made to US President Dwight Eisenhower on July 20, a decision was taken to accelerate the operation, and the number of people working in Guatemala was increased. The new team members posed as unaffiliated with the US government to maintain plausible deniability. The operation helped set up the Guatemalan National Committee of Defense Against Communism, which was covertly funded by the CIA: agents of the committee became involved in PBHistory. The team studied over 500,000 documents in total, and finished processing documents on 28 September 1954.|$|E
50|$|By 912, it {{was said}} that Gao was {{beginning}} to contemplate making Jingnan his own <b>personal</b> <b>possession,</b> and therefore, after receiving approval to do so, added a second layer to Jiangling's city walls to add to its defensive capabilities.|$|R
50|$|In September 1768 France {{began its}} conquest of Corsica. France gained full {{military}} {{control of the}} island following the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769, and until the French Revolution, the island was considered the <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> of the King.|$|R
50|$|The single faithful, in consequence, {{is invited}} to acquire {{the faith of the}} Church, as assiduously as possible, into his <b>personal</b> <b>possession,</b> {{nevertheless}} being aware of the insufficiency of isolated cogitation and listening to the common voice of the Church.|$|R
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was finally {{completed}} in 1840, and in July the Preston and Wyre Railway opened. The following year St Peter's Church was finished, and Hesketh-Fleetwood appointed as vicar the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey of Hilgay in Norfolk. Also in 1841, the North Euston {{was the fourth}} hotel {{to open in the}} town. Steamer services opened to the Isle of Man, Whitehaven, Ardrossan and Belfast. Fleetwood initially flourished, but Hesketh-Fleetwood had run out of money and was compelled to take out mortgages. He lost the £75,000 he had invested in the Preston and Wyre Railway Company owing to a lack of accounts. Kemp claimed that Hesketh-Fleetwood owed him money, but Kemp refused to explain his book-keeping. In the face of enormous debts Hesketh-Fleetwood sold his estates at Blackpool, Southport, Meols Hall, and Tulketh Hall. Charles bought the Churchtown estate, where {{he and his wife had}} been living, from his brother. In 1844 Hesketh-Fleetwood auctioned off his <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> from Rossall Hall and left Lancashire. The Rev. St. Vincent Beechey had set up the Northern Church of England School for boys. Close to bankruptcy, Hesketh-Fleetwood leased the buildings at Rossall Hall to the school for six years, with the option to buy it after nine for £7,000. Thereafter, the school was called Rossall School.|$|E
5|$|Inman {{had lost}} all his <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> in the {{destruction}} of Lark and was forced to replace his uniform from his own wages when the Navy refused to provide compensation. Returning to Britain in the frigate HMS Pearl, Inman was promoted to lieutenant in 1780 and returned to the Americas in HMS Camel, transferred soon afterwards into HMS Santa Monica in the West Indies. Shortly after his arrival however, Inman was once again shipwrecked when Santa Monica grounded off Tortola. Although the crew reached the shore in small boats, the ship broke up rapidly and once again Inman lost all of his possessions. Remaining on shore service in the West Indies for the next two years, Inman was again employed {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of the Saintes, appointed to the prize crew of the captured French vessel Hector for the journey to Britain. Hectors masts and hull had been seriously damaged in the battle, requiring lighter spars to be fitted and 22 of her 74 guns removed to make her more seaworthy. As the fleet could not spare men to man her, the 223-strong prize crew was made up of men pressed in the Caribbean, principally invalids unfit for frontline service.|$|E
25|$|The <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> of Haarmann's victims would {{typically}} {{be retained}} for the personal use of Haarmann or his lover, Hans Grans, or be {{sold on the}} black market through criminal contacts both men had established at Hanover Central Station, although the <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> of some victims were sold to legitimate retailers. In several instances, both Haarmann and Grans are known to have given possessions belonging to various victims to acquaintances as gifts.|$|E

50|$|It {{is presumed}} that crowns {{would have been}} {{believed}} to have magical properties.
