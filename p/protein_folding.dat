5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate <b>protein</b> <b>folding,</b> but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as <b>protein</b> <b>folding</b> is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a {{distributed}} computing project for disease research that simulates <b>protein</b> <b>folding,</b> computational drug design, {{and other types}} of molecular dynamics. The project uses the idle processing resources of thousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms of <b>protein</b> <b>folding,</b> which is the process by which proteins reach their final three-dimensional structure, and to examine the causes of protein misfolding. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for medical research into Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and many forms of cancer, among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to predict a protein's final structure and determine how other molecules may interact with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at Stanford University, under the direction of Prof. Vijay Pande, and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Motivation <b>Protein</b> <b>fold</b> {{space is}} a {{conceptual}} framework where all possible <b>protein</b> <b>folds</b> exist and ideas about protein structure, function and evolution may be analyzed. Classification of <b>protein</b> <b>folds</b> in this space is commonly achieved by using similarity indexes and/or machine learning approaches, each with different limitations. Results We propose a method for constructing a compact vector space model of <b>protein</b> <b>fold</b> space by representing each protein structure by its residues local contacts. We developed an efficient method to statistically test for the separability of points in a space and showed that our <b>protein</b> <b>fold</b> space representation is learnable by any machine-learning algorithm.

5|$|Linus Pauling is {{credited}} with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding, an idea first put forth by William Astbury in 1933. Later work by Walter Kauzmann on denaturation, based partly on previous studies by Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang, contributed an understanding of <b>protein</b> <b>folding</b> and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are an {{essential}} component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within biological cells. They often act as enzymes, performing biochemical reactions including cell signaling, molecular transportation, and cellular regulation. As structural elements, some proteins act {{as a type of}} skeleton for cells, and as antibodies, while other proteins participate in the immune system. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. <b>Protein</b> <b>folding</b> is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state. Thus, understanding <b>protein</b> <b>folding</b> is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of computational biology. Despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may misfold, that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of <b>protein</b> <b>folding,</b> misfolding, and aggregation.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} the number of <b>protein</b> <b>folds</b> is steeped in {{controversy}} despite its significance for understanding evolu-tion and predicting protein structure from amino acid sequence. Using various assumptions, several research groups have tackled this problem with very different results. In the present study, a more rigorous statistical approach is used to address this question. From three different data sets, the total number of <b>protein</b> <b>folds</b> is estimated to be about 650. A detailed theoretical analysis suggests that (i) a random sample of non-transmembrane protein families has been selected for crystallization and structural determination, (ii) except for about 40 <b>folds,</b> most <b>protein</b> <b>folds</b> occurring in nature contain about the same number of different protein families.

In other words, Folding@home's strength is modeling the process of <b>protein</b> <b>folding,</b> while Rosetta@home's strength is computing protein design and predicting protein structure and docking.|$|E
5|$|Protease {{inhibition}} by serpins controls {{an array}} of biological processes, including coagulation and inflammation, and consequently these proteins are the target of medical research. Their unique conformational change also makes them {{of interest to the}} structural biology and <b>protein</b> <b>folding</b> research communities. The conformational-change mechanism confers certain advantages, but it also has drawbacks: serpins are vulnerable to mutations that can result in serpinopathies such as protein misfolding and the formation of inactive long-chain polymers. Serpin polymerisation not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor, but also leads to accumulation of the polymers, causing cell death and organ failure.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of biological information from protein sequences {{is important for}} the study of cellular functions and interactions, and <b>protein</b> <b>fold</b> recognition {{plays a key role in}} the prediction of protein structures. Unfortunately, the prediction of <b>protein</b> <b>fold</b> patterns is challenging due to the existence of compound protein structures. Here, we processed the latest release of the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP, version 1. 75) database and exploited novel techniques to impressively increase the accuracy of <b>protein</b> <b>fold</b> classification. The techniques proposed in this paper include ensemble classifying and a hierarchical framework, in the first layer of which similar or redundant sequences were deleted in two manners; a set of base classifiers, fused by various selection strategies, divides the input into seven classes; in the second layer of which, an analogous ensemble method is adopted to predict all <b>protein</b> <b>folds.</b> To our knowledge, it is the first time all <b>protein</b> <b>folds</b> can be intelligently detected hierarchically. Compared with prior studies, our experimental results demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieved a success rate of 74. 21 %, which is much higher than results obtained with previous methods (ranging from 45. 6 % to 70. 5 %). When applied to the second layer of classification, the prediction accuracy was in the range between 23. 13 % and 46. 05 %.

5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated <b>protein</b> <b>folding</b> inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home is {{also used}} to study protein chaperones, heat shock {{proteins}} which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the crowded and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in chemotherapy resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for <b>Protein</b> <b>Folding</b> Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme Src kinase, and some forms of the engrailed homeodomain: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer.

40|$|While the {{repertoire}} of <b>protein</b> <b>folds</b> that exists today underlies most of life’s capabilities, our mechanistic picture of <b>protein</b> <b>fold</b> origination is incomplete.

These peptides are called pluripotent to emphasize their capacity to evolve into numerous folds transiently available to them. As evidence, the paper will discuss previous simulation work on the superior fold evolvability of oily peptides, trace (“fossil”) evidence within proteomes seen today, and a general relationship between protein dynamism and evolvability. Aside from implications on the origination of <b>protein</b> <b>folds,</b> the hypothesis implies that the vanishing utility of a random peptide in protein origination may be relatively exaggerated, as some random peptides with a certain composition (e. g., oily) may fare better than others.

5|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>folding</b> {{does not}} occur in one step. Instead, {{proteins}} {{spend most of their}} folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, waiting in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein's energy landscape. Through a process known as adaptive sampling, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a Markov state model (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are discrete-time master equation models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on GPUGRID) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear parallelization, leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's phase space (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.|$|E
