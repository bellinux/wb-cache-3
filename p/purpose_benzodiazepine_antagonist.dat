40|$|The {{addition}} of a <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> to the dental anesthesiologist's armamentarium should provide added safety for conscious sedation using benzodiazepines. A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of flumazenil, the first available <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist,</b> was performed to evaluate its safety and efficacy following conscious sedation induced by diazepam and fentanyl. Flumazenil was found to reverse rapidly much of {{the central nervous system}} depression induced by fentanyl and diazepam conscious sedation. Flumazenil appears to be a valuable adjunct for dentists who administer intravenous benzodiazepines for conscious sedation...|$|R

40|$|Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine, is {{the first}} <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> and {{is being used to}} reverse the adverse {{pharmacological}} effects of benzodiazepine. There have been a few reports on the central nevous system side effects with its use. We report a patient with generalized ballism following administration of flumazenil. The mechanism through which flumazenil induced this symptom is unknown.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist,</b> Ro 15 - 1788 on ethanol {{withdrawal}} convulsions were investigated in rats. The study originated from recent reports of benzodiazepine binding activity in urine of alcoholics during withdrawal. No alleviation of convulsions was found with Ro 15 - 1788. This suggested that this component of the withdrawal syndrome is not due to endogenous production of a benzodiazepine inverse agonist (contragonist), as Ro 15 - 1788 prevents the action {{of this type of}} compound...|$|R

40|$|The {{actions of}} {{nicotinamide}} and inosine were investigated on rat cerebellar Purkinje cells using ionophoretic and extracellular recording techniques. Ionophoretic application of nicotinamide or inosine showed {{that they were}} potent inhibitors of Purkinje cell firing. This inhibition differed from that induced by benzodiazepines {{in that it was}} not reversed by the GABA antagonists bicuculline methiodide and picrotoxin. RO 15 - 1788, the specific <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist,</b> did not reverse the effects of nicotinamide. Chlordiazepoxide has been shown to increase significantly social interaction between pairs of male rats and this increase can be reversed by RO 15 - 1788, 20 mg kg- 1 i. p. Nicotinamide also caused a small increase in social interaction but this effect was not reversed by the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist.</b> Inosine did not increase social interaction. [3 H]-flunitrazepam binding studies showed that nicotinamide and inosine have only low affinities for the benzodiazepine binding site. These results suggest that while nicotinamide may exert some neuronal depressant and anxiolytic activity, its site of action appears not {{to be associated with the}} benzodiazepine receptor site. Similarly, inosine exerts a neuronal depressant effect dissimilar from that of benzodiazepines...|$|R
50|$|Unlike benzodiazepines, {{etifoxine}} {{appears to}} produce its anxiolytic effects by activating β2 and β3 subunit containing channels of the GABAA receptor complex (a different binding site than benzodiazepines), and by stimulating {{the production of}} GABA(A) active neurosteroids that act in conjunction with etifoxine's direct effects. This difference in binding means that etifoxine can be used alongside benzodiazepines to potentiate their effects without competing for binding sites; however, {{it also means that}} the effects of etifoxine are not reversed by the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> flumazenil.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 40 {{patients}} receiving intravenous midazolam for surgical removal of impacted wisdom teeth {{were randomly assigned}} to recover either spontaneously or undergo reversal by the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> flumazenil.

50|$|ZK-93426 (ethyl-5-isopropoxy-4-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) {{is a drug}} {{from the}} beta-carboline family. It acts as a weak partial inverse agonist of {{benzodiazepine}} receptors, meaning that it causes the opposite effects to the benzodiazepine class of drugs and has anxiogenic properties, although unlike most <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonists</b> {{it is not a}} convulsant and actually has weak anticonvulsant effects. In human tests it produced alertness, restlessness and feelings of apprehension, and reversed the effect of the benzodiazepine lormetazepam. It was also shown to produce nootropic effects and increased release of acetylcholine.|$|R
40|$|In an open, randomized, {{parallel}} group {{study of}} 84 adult patients undergoing elective day-case urological surgery the specific <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> flumazenil {{was shown to}} reverse effectively subjective postoperative sedation due to midazolam and enabled 83 % of patients to recover and be ready for potential discharge within 15 min of surgery (control group 24 % p less than 0. 001). The significantly shorter recovery time has benefits in terms of increased patient cooperation and reduced demands on postoperative nursing care. The implications of these findings for day-case surgery are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDiazepam {{in vitro}} {{produced}} a concentration-dependent increase of membrane fluidity in crude synaptic membranes from rat hippocampus, but not cerebellum. Similar effects were obtained with higher concentrations of Ro 15 – 1788 and PK 11195, while zopiclone was completely inactive. In vivo acute treatment with diazepam and Ro 15 – 1788 gave results {{similar to those}} in vitro. The specific <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> also significantly increased membrane fluidity and was not able to reverse diazepam's effect. The data are discussed in terms of a possible role of protein kinase inhibition by the drugs not mediated by the ‘central’ or ‘peripheral’ type of benzodiazepine receptors...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} with nitrous oxide analgesia {{of drugs that}} act at the benzodiazepine receptor was evaluated in the rat tail flick model. Nitrous oxide produced dose-related analgesia, which was potentiated by diazepam, a benzodiazepine agonist, antagonized by noreleagnine, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist. Pretreatment with the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> Ro 15 - 1788 blocked the effects of both diazepam and noreleagnine on nitrous oxide analgesia. Subanesthetic doses of sodium pentobarbital and chloral hydrate produced nonsignificant trends to reduce the analgesic action of nitrous oxide. These data provide evidence {{for the presence of}} specific benzodiazepine receptors capable of modulating the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide...|$|R

40|$|A {{combination}} of 0. 35 mg/kg midazolam and 5 mg/kg ketamine, administered orally for pediatric sedation, {{resulted in a}} severe decreases in blood oxygen saturation postoperatively. The patient, a 2 -yr-old child, {{did not respond to}} command or mild physical stimulation in the recovery room 60 min after receiving the drugs. The <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist,</b> flumazenil (0. 01 mg/kg), was administered intravenously to reverse the action of midazolam. No adverse effects were observed thereafter, and the postoperative recovery was uneventful. Combining different classes of drugs may result in less variability in patients response, but there is a greater potential for drug-induced side effects and drug interactions...|$|R
40|$|HE {{management}} of acute pain and anxiety in children undergoing therapeutic and diagnos-tic procedures outside {{the operating room}} has developed substantially in the past 15 years. The wide-spread availability of noninvasive monitoring, short-acting opioids and sedatives, and specific opioid and <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonists</b> has enabled clinicians to administer sedation safely for procedures in diverse settings. The goal of procedural sedation is the safe and effective control of pain, anxiety, and motion so as to allow a necessary procedure to be performed and to provide an appropriate degree of memory loss or decreased awareness.

40|$|In a pre {{previous}} study, it {{was found}} that positive, palatability-dependent consummatory reactions in rats to intraorally infused tastes were facilitated by chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg). In contrast, the rats' more neutral or aversive reactions to these tastes were not facilitated by chlordiazepoxide. This suggested that chlordiazepoxide might selectively enhance the positive palatability of tastes. This effect was replicated in the present experiment, and in addition, the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonists</b> Ro 15 - 1788 and CGS 8216 were found to counteract the enhancement of positive ingestive reactions produced by chlordiazepoxide. These antagonist effects generally suggest that the benzodiazepine receptor complex may be involved in making tastes more palatable after chlordiazepoxide administration...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{effects of}} acute administration of chrysin, contained in Passiflora incarnata, were studied in rats. The data demonstrate {{that in our}} experimental conditions, chrysin was able to reduce locomotor activity when injected in rats at a minimal effective dose of 25 mgrkg. However, chrysin exhibited a clear anxiolytic effect when injected at the dose of 1 mgrkg,. The sedative effect of the flavonoid cannot be ascribed to an interaction with GABA]benzodiazepine receptors, since it was not counteracted by the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> Flumazenil. To the contrary, the anxiolytic effect of chrysin, which was blocked by the injection of Flumazenil, could be linked to an activation of the GABAA receptor unit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{paradigm}} for assessing benzodiazepine r-ceptor sensitivity was developed using intravenous mid-azolam in normal volunteers. After administration of incremental doses of midazolam, alterations in saccadic eye movement parameters and psychological self ratings were assessed. Significant changes included dose-depen-dent slowing of peak velocity, peak acceleration, peak deceleration, reduced saccade acceleration/deceleration ratio and saccade accuracy, and increased sedation self-ratings. Changes in saccade variables and sedation ratings were significantly correlated, and also correlated with plasma midazolam concentrations. No significant changes {{were seen in}} saccade latency or anxiety self-ratings. Pharmacological specificity of these changes was demonstrated by their reversal with the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> flumazenil.

The drug was administered at two easily recognizable time {{points in the}} course of the encephalopathy: first, when the righting reflex was disturbed, and second, when the animal could no longer achieve to the sitting position. The response after flumazenil did not differ from that after the placebo, as measured by clinical evaluation and automated EEG analysis. Furthermore, the progression of the encephalopathy, as measured by the survival time after the first injection, was not affected by flumazenil...|$|R
40|$|Methods A double-blind, randomized, placebo {{controlled}} {{trial of}} the efficacy of flumazenil was conducted in 22 consecutive patients admitted for bronchoscopy.

Post bronchoscopy, patients received up to 1 mg of the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> flumazenil (Anexate(R)) or placebo intravenously. Clinical scores for the degree of sedation, orientation in time and space, co-operation and antergrade amnesia were used. These, together with three psychometric tests were performed twice prior to bronchoscopy and on eight occasions in the following 24 h.

40|$|Following {{a single}} {{intravenous}} dose of 0. 1 mg/kg, the pharmacokinetics of Ro 15 - 1788, a specific <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist,</b> {{have been investigated}} in 20 healthy male volunteers.

The rapid elimination of the antagonist could be characterized by an elimination half-life between 0. 9 to 1. 4 h and a total plasma clearance of 727 to 1440 ml/min.

40|$|Purpose: The natural {{products}} resveratrol and trans-ε-viniferin {{have been reported}} to have many beneficial effects, which include the enhancement of cognition and memory. There have been no studies which have reported the effects of these compounds on the different GABAA receptor subtypes and this study aimed to address this. Methods: The effects of both resveratrol, and its dimer, trans-ε-viniferin, have been investigated on different GABAA receptor subtypes expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Results: Resveratrol induced a current of 22 ± 3. 53 nA in the α₁β₂γ₂L subtype of the GABAA receptor (but not in the α₅β₃γ₂L and α₂β₂γ₂L subtypes) when applied alone. It also positively modulated the GABA-induced current (IGABA) in α₁β₂γ₂L receptors, in a dose-dependent manner (EC₅₀ 58. 24 μM). The effects of resveratrol were not sensitive to the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> flumazenil. trans-ε-Viniferin exhibited a different pattern of activity to resveratrol; it alone had no effect on any of the subtypes, but it did negatively modulate the GABA-induced current (IGABA) in all three subtypes. The greatest inhibition was found in the α₁β₂γ₂L subtype (IC₅₀ 5. 79 μM), with the inhibition in the α₂β₂γ₂L (IC₅₀ of 19. 08 μM) and α₅β₃γ₂L (IC₅₀ of 21. 05 μM) subtypes being similar. The effects of trans-ε-viniferin in α₁β₂γ₂L and α₂β₂γ₂L receptors were also not sensitive to the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> flumazenil while, in the α₅β₃γ₂L subtype the effect was not sensitive to the inverse agonist L- 655, 708, indicating different binding sites for this molecule. Conclusions: The {{results of the present study}} indicate that both resveratrol and trans-ε-viniferin modulate the GABA-induced current in different ways, and that trans-ε-viniferin may be a lead compound for the discovery of agents which selectively inhibit the GABA-induced current in α₁-containing subtypes. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} the present study was to study y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -A {{receptor}} function in alcohol-dependent subjects during withdrawal, using the <b>benzodiazepine</b> <b>antagonist</b> flumazenil. In particular, we wanted to examine the hypotheses that an endogenous inverse agonist ligand at the GABA-A benzodiazepine receptor (GBzR) is active during withdrawal (in which case flumazenil should be anxiolytic), or whether chronic alcohol intake results in a shift in sensitivity of the receptor in the inverse agonist direction (in which case flumazenil should be anxiogenic). Results from 15 alcohol-dependent subjects in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study showed that flumazenil was neither anxiolytic nor anxiogenic, although withdrawal scores were reduced during the course of the study. The fact that flumazenil was not anxiogenic, as it is in panic disorder, suggests that the GBzR is functioning differently in these two clinically similar conditions...|$|R
