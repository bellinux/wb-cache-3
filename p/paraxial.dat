25|$|In 1840, Gauss {{published}} his influential Dioptrische Untersuchungen, {{in which he}} gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a <b>paraxial</b> approximation (Gaussian optics). Among his results, Gauss showed that under a <b>paraxial</b> approximation an optical system can be characterized by its cardinal points and he derived the Gaussian lens formula.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} {{important}} class of <b>paraxial</b> wave modes in cylindrical coordinates in which the complex amplitude is proportional to a confluent hypergeometric function.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} that is described below uses the <b>paraxial</b> approximation of ray optics, {{which means that}} all rays {{are assumed to be}} at a small angle (θ in radians) and a small distance (x) relative to the optical axis of the system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paraxial</b> (Gaussian) optics is assumed, and technically, the {{formulas}} {{are valid}} only for rays that are infinitesimally {{close to the}} lens axis. However, Gaussian optics usually is more than adequate for determining DOF, and non-paraxial formulas are sufficiently complex that requiring their use would make determination of DOF impractical in most cases.|$|E
25|$|Members of Mesothelae have <b>paraxial</b> chelicerae, {{two pairs}} of coxal glands on the legs, eight eyes grouped on a nodule, {{two pairs of}} book lungs, and no endites {{on the base of}} the pedipalp. Most have at least seven or eight spinnerets near the middle of the abdomen. Lateral spinnerets are multi-segmented.|$|E
25|$|Gaussian beam {{propagation}} is {{a simple}} <b>paraxial</b> physical optics model for the propagation of coherent radiation such as laser beams. This technique partially accounts for diffraction, allowing accurate calculations of {{the rate at which}} a laser beam expands with distance, and the minimum size to which the beam can be focused. Gaussian beam propagation thus bridges the gap between geometric and physical optics.|$|E
25|$|Segmentation is a {{basic process}} of {{embryogenesis}} occurring in most invertebrates and all vertebrates by which the body is initially divided into functional units. In the segmented regions of the embryo, cells begin to present biochemical and morphological boundaries at which cell behavior is drastically different – vital for future differentiation and function. In the hindbrain, segmentation is a precisely defined process. In the <b>paraxial</b> mesoderm, however, development is a dynamic and adaptive process that adjusts according to posterior body growth. Various Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed in these regions, and, through functional analysis, it has been determined that Eph signaling is crucial for the proper development and maintenance of these segment boundaries. Similar studies conducted in zebrafish have shown similar segmenting processes within the somites containing a striped expression pattern of Eph receptors and their ligands, which is vital to proper segmentation - the disruption of expression resulting in misplaced or even absent boundaries.|$|E
2500|$|Fgf {{from the}} <b>paraxial</b> {{mesoderm}} {{has been suggested}} {{as a source of}} neural crest inductive signal. [...] Researchers have demonstrated that the expression of dominate-negative Fgf receptor in ectoderm explants blocks neural crest induction when recombined with <b>paraxial</b> mesoderm. Our current understanding of the role of BMP, Wnt, and Fgf pathways on neural crest specifier expression remains incomplete.|$|E
2500|$|Geometric optics {{is often}} {{simplified}} {{by making the}} <b>paraxial</b> approximation, or [...] "small angle approximation". The mathematical behaviour then becomes linear, allowing optical components and systems to be described by simple matrices. This leads to the techniques of Gaussian optics and <b>paraxial</b> ray tracing, which are used to find basic properties of optical systems, such as approximate image and object positions and magnifications.|$|E
2500|$|Substituting this {{solution}} into the wave equation above yields the <b>paraxial</b> approximation to the scalar wave equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|... pump. In the <b>paraxial</b> approximation, {{the complex}} field of pump in the {{cladding}} behaves {{like a wave}} function in the quantum billiard.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to decompose a coherent <b>paraxial</b> beam using the orthogonal set of so-called Hermite-Gaussian modes, any of which are given by {{the product of a}} factor in x and a factor in y. Such a solution {{is possible}} due to the separability in x and y in the <b>paraxial</b> Helmholtz equation as written in Cartesian coordinates. Thus given a mode of order (l,m) referring to the x and y directions, the electric field amplitude at x,y,z may be given by: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gaussian beam is a {{transverse}} electromagnetic (TEM) mode. The mathematical {{expression for}} the electric field amplitude {{is a solution}} to the <b>paraxial</b> Helmholtz equation. Assuming polarization in the x direction and propagation in the +z direction, the electric field in phasor (complex) notation is given by: ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{gaussian}} beam model uses the <b>paraxial</b> approximation, it fails when wavefronts are tilted {{by more than}} about 30° from the axis of the beam. From the above expression for divergence, this means the Gaussian beam model is only accurate for beams with waists larger than about [...]|$|E
2500|$|Using {{this form}} {{along with the}} <b>paraxial</b> approximation, [...] can then be {{essentially}} neglected. Since solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation only hold for polarizations which are orthogonal to the direction of propagation (z), we have {{without loss of generality}} considered the polarization to be in the x direction so that we now solve a scalar equation for u(x,y,z).|$|E
2500|$|Since this {{solution}} {{relies on the}} <b>paraxial</b> approximation, it is not accurate for very strongly diverging beams. In most practical cases (where w0>>λ) the above form is valid. Then the wave's associated magnetic field is everywhere directly proportional to the electric field and perpendicular to it. Since the electric field is taken to be polarized in the x direction, the magnetic field is polarized in the y direction according to: ...|$|E
2500|$|Theoretical work, {{along with}} {{numerical}} simulations, {{began in the}} early 2000s on the abilities of DNG slabs for subwavelength focusing. The research began with Pendry's proposed [...] "Perfect lens." [...] Several research investigations that followed Pendry's concluded that the [...] "Perfect lens" [...] was possible in theory but impractical. One direction in subwavelength focusing proceeded with the use of negative-index metamaterials, but based on the enhancements for imaging with surface plasmons. In another direction researchers explored <b>paraxial</b> approximations of NIM slabs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Paraxial</b> optical systems {{implemented}} {{entirely with}} thin lenses and propagation through free space and/or graded index (GRIN) media, are quadratic phase systems (QPS); these were [...] known before Moshinsky and Quesne (1974) {{called attention to}} their significance in connection with canonical transformations in quantum mechanics. [...] The effect of any arbitrary QPS on an input wavefield can be described using the linear canonical transform, a particular case of which was developed by Segal (1963) and Bargmann (1961) in order to formalize Fock's (1928) boson calculus.|$|E
2500|$|... where c is {{the speed}} of light in the medium, and [...] could either refer to the {{electric}} or magnetic field vector, as any specific solution for either determines the other. The Gaussian beam solution is valid only in the <b>paraxial</b> approximation, that is, where wave propagation is limited to directions within a small angle of an axis. Without loss of generality let us take that direction to be the +z direction in which case the solution U can generally be written in terms of u which has no time dependence and varies relatively smoothly in space, with the main variation spatially corresponding to the wavenumber k in the z direction: ...|$|E
2500|$|Arbitrary {{solutions}} of the <b>paraxial</b> Helmholtz equation can {{be expressed}} as combinations of Hermite–Gaussian modes (whose amplitude profiles are separable in x and y using Cartesian coordinates) or similarly as combinations of [...] Laguerre–Gaussian modes (whose amplitude profiles are separable in r and θ using cylindrical coordinates). At any point along the beam z these modes include the same Gaussian factor as the fundamental Gaussian mode multiplying the additional geometrical factors for the specified mode. However different modes propagate with a different Gouy phase {{which is why the}} net transverse profile due to a superposition of modes evolves in z, whereas the propagation of any single Hermite–Gaussian (or Laguerre–Gaussian) mode retains the same form along a beam.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{modelling}} {{of optical}} {{systems such as}} telescopes or fibre telecommunications devices, the Wigner function is used {{to bridge the gap}} between simple ray tracing and the full wave analysis of the system. [...] Here [...] is replaced with [...] in the small angle (<b>paraxial)</b> approximation. [...] In this context, the Wigner function is the closest one can get to describing the system in terms of rays at position [...] and angle [...] while still including the effects of interference. [...] If it becomes negative at any point, then simple ray-tracing will not suffice to model the system. That is to say, negative values of this function are a symptom of the Gabor limit of the classical light signal and not of quantum features of light associated with [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{striking}} segmented {{pattern of}} the spine is established during embryogenesis when somites are rhythmically added to the posterior of the embryo. Somite formation begins around the third week when the embryo begins gastrulation and continues until around 52 somites are formed. The somites are spheres, formed from the <b>paraxial</b> mesoderm {{that lies at the}} sides of the neural tube and they contain the precursors of spinal bone, the vertebrae ribs and some of the skull, as well as muscle, ligaments and skin. Somitogenesis and the subsequent distribution of somites is controlled by a clock and wavefront model acting in cells of the <b>paraxial</b> mesoderm. Soon after their formation, sclerotomes, which give rise to some of the bone of the skull, the vertebrae and ribs, migrate, leaving the remainder of the somite now termed a dermamyotome behind. This then splits to give the myotomes which will form the muscles and dermatomes which will form the skin of the back. [...] Sclerotomes become subdivided into an anterior and a posterior compartment. This subdivision {{plays a key role in}} the definitive patterning of vertebrae that form when the posterior part of one somite fuses to the anterior part of the consecutive somite during a process termed resegmentation. Disruption of the somitogenesis process in humans results in diseases such as congenital scoliosis. So [...] far, the human homologues of three genes associated to the mouse segmentation clock, (MESP2, DLL3 and LFNG), have been shown to be mutated in cases of congenital scoliosis, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in vertebral segmentation are conserved across vertebrates. In humans the first four somites are incorporated in the base of the occipital bone of the skull and the next 33 somites will form the vertebrae, ribs, muscles, ligaments and skin. The remaining posterior somites degenerate. During the fourth week of embryogenesis, the sclerotomes shift their position to surround the spinal cord and the notochord. This column of tissue has a segmented appearance, with alternating areas of dense and less dense areas.|$|E
2500|$|Gaussian {{beams of}} any beam waist w0 satisfy this wave equation; {{this is most}} easily {{verified}} by expressing the wave at z {{in terms of the}} complex beam parameter q(z) as defined above. There are many other solutions. As solutions to a linear system, any combination of solutions (using addition or multiplication by a constant) is also a solution. The fundamental Gaussian happens to be the one [...] that minimizes the product of minimum spot size and far-field divergence, as noted above. In seeking <b>paraxial</b> solutions, and in particular ones that would describe laser radiation that is not in the fundamental Gaussian mode, we will look for families of solutions with gradually increasing products of their divergences and minimum spot sizes. Two important orthogonal decompositions of this sort are the Hermite–Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian modes, corresponding to rectangular and circular symmetry respectively, as detailed in the next section. With both of these, the fundamental Gaussian beam we have been considering is the lowest order mode.|$|E
2500|$|Practical laser {{resonators}} {{may contain}} {{more than two}} mirrors; three- and four-mirror arrangements are common, producing a [...] "folded cavity". Commonly, a pair of curved mirrors form one or more confocal sections, {{with the rest of}} the cavity being quasi-collimated and using plane mirrors. The shape of the laser beam depends on the type of resonator: The beam produced by stable, <b>paraxial</b> resonators can be well modeled by a Gaussian beam. [...] In special cases the beam can be described as a single transverse mode and the spatial properties can be well described by the Gaussian beam, itself. [...] More generally, this beam may be described as a superposition of transverse modes. [...] Accurate description of such a beam involves expansion over some complete, orthogonal set of functions (over two-dimensions) such as Hermite polynomials or the Ince polynomials. [...] Unstable laser resonators on the other hand, have been shown to produce fractal shaped beams.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the <b>paraxial</b> inequalitiy stated above, the ∂2u/∂z2 term is {{neglected}} {{in comparison with}} the k·∂u/∂z term. This yields the <b>paraxial</b> Helmholtz equation. Substituting [...] then gives the <b>paraxial</b> equation for the original complex amplitude A: ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>paraxial</b> ray is a ray {{that makes}} a small angle to the optical axis of the system, and lies close to the axis {{throughout}} the system. Such rays can be modeled reasonably well by using the <b>paraxial</b> approximation. When discussing ray tracing this definition is often reversed: a [...] "paraxial ray" [...] is then a ray that is modeled using the <b>paraxial</b> approximation, not necessarily a ray that remains close to the axis.|$|E
50|$|A {{particular}} kind of tissue deriving from the <b>paraxial</b> mesoderm is the head mesoderm. This tissue derives from the unsegmented <b>paraxial</b> mesoderm and prechordal mesoderm. Tissues derived from the head mesoderm include connective tissue and {{the muscles of the}} face.|$|E
50|$|The general {{equations}} of motion originate from relativistic Hamiltonian mechanics, in almost all cases using the <b>Paraxial</b> approximation. Even {{in the cases of}} strongly nonlinear magnetic fields, and without the <b>paraxial</b> approximation, a Lie transform may be used to construct an integrator {{with a high degree of}} accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The {{mesoderm}} forms at {{the same}} time as the other two germ layers, the ectoderm and endoderm. The mesoderm at either side of the neural tube is called <b>paraxial</b> mesoderm. It is distinct from the mesoderm underneath the neural tube which is called the chordamesoderm that becomes the notochord. The <b>paraxial</b> mesoderm is initially called the “segmental plate” in the chick embryo or the “unsegmented mesoderm” in other vertebrates. As the primitive streak regresses and neural folds gather (to eventually become the neural tube), the <b>paraxial</b> mesoderm separates into blocks called somites.|$|E
