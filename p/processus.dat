25|$|The typical head of Temnodontosaurus had {{a robust}} long snout with an antorbital constriction. They {{also had an}} {{elongated}} maxilla, a long cheek region and a long post orbital segment. The carotid foramina in the basisphenoid in the skull is paired and is separated by the parasphenoid. Also, the parasphenoid has a <b>processus</b> cultriformis. The largest T. platyodon skulls can range from 1m to 1.5m long.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} an early Upper Paleolithic modern human from Peștera Muierilor (Romania) of 35,000 years BP shows a {{morphological}} pattern of European early modern humans, but possesses archaic or Neanderthal features, suggesting European early modern humans' admixture with Neanderthals rather than a full replacement of Neanderthals. These features include a large interorbital breadth, a relatively flat superciliary arches, a prominent occipital bun, an asymmetrical and shallow mandibular notch shape, a high mandibular coronoid <b>processus,</b> the relative perpendicular mandibular condyle to notch crest position, and a narrow scapular glenoid fossa.|$|E
25|$|The scapula {{had a large}} {{rectangular}} acromion, with a sharp upper corner, on {{the lower}} front edge. The more narrow coracoid had a rounded lower edge. Both the upper arm and ulna and radius (lower arm bones) are also {{comparable to those of}} Stegosaurus. The tuberosity of the rear humerus serving as attachment for the musculus triceps brachii is well-developed but the vertical ridge running from it to below is not. In the pelvis, the pubic bone had a deep front part, the <b>processus</b> praepubicus, with a little upward projecting process as seen in Dacentrurus; the rear shaft had a lightly expanded tip.|$|E
25|$|The jaws were {{apparently}} operated by relatively weak muscles. Ouranosaurus had only small temporal openings behind the eyes, {{from which the}} larger capiti-mandibularis muscle {{was attached to the}} coronoid process on the lower jaw bone. Small rounded horns in front of its eyes made Ouranosaurus the only known horned ornithopod. The back of the skull was rather narrow and could not compensate for the lack of a greater area of attachment for the jaw muscle, that the openings normally would provide, allowing for more power and a stronger bite. A lesser muscle, the musculus depressor mandibulae, used to open the lower jaws, was located {{at the back of the}} skull and was connected to a strongly projecting, broad and anteriorly oblique <b>processus</b> paroccipitalis. Ouranosaurus probably used its teeth to chew up tough plant food. A diet has been suggested of leaves, fruit, and seeds as the chewing would allow to free more energy from high quality food; the wide beak on the other hand indicates a specialisation in eating large amounts of low quality fodder. Ouranosaurus lived in a river delta.|$|E

25|$|Of the Roman processions, {{the most}} {{prominent}} {{was that of the}} Triumph, which had its origin in the return of the victorious army headed by the general, who proceeded in great pomp from the Campus to the Capitol to offer sacrifice, accompanied by the army, captives, spoils, the chief magistrate, priests bearing the images of the gods, amidst strewing of flowers, burning of incense and the like (Ovid, Trist. iv. 2, 3 and 6). Connected with the triumph was the pompa circensis, or solemn procession that preceded the games in the circus. It first came into use at the Ludi Romani, when the games were preceded by a great procession from the Capitol to the Circus. The praetor or consul who appeared in the ponipa circensis wore the robes of a triumphing general (see Mommsen, Staatsrec/zt I. 397 for the connection of the triumph with the ludi). Thus, when it became customary for the consul to celebrate games {{at the opening of the}} consular year, he came, under the empire, to appear in triumphal robes in the <b>processus</b> consularis, or procession of the consul to the Capitol to sacrifice to Jupiter.|$|E
2500|$|Some people treat {{process as}} if it belonged to this class, pronouncing {{processes}} [...] instead of standard [...] Since the word comes from Latin <b>processus,</b> whose plural in the fourth declension is <b>processūs</b> with a long u, this pronunciation is by analogy, not etymology.|$|E

2500|$|A {{petition}} {{was then}} presented asking remissorial letters for the bishops outside of Rome (in partibus), authorizing them to set on foot, by Apostolic authority, the inquiry (<b>processus)</b> {{with regard to}} the fame of sanctity and miracles in general. This permission was granted by rescript, and such remissorial letters were prepared and sent to the bishops by the Postulator General. In case the eyewitnesses were of advanced age, other remissorial letters were usually granted for the purpose of opening a process known as [...] "inchoative" [...] concerning the particular virtues of miracles of the person in question. This was done in order that the proofs might not be lost (ne pereant probationes), and such inchoative process preceded that upon the miracles and virtues in general.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To study {{fluorodeoxyglucose}} (FDG) {{deposition in}} different vascular beds {{and in the}} large joints of patients with isolated polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and to investigate {{whether there is a}} relation between FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) results and risk of relapse. Methods. All consecutive patients with isolated PMR underwent a FDG–PET scan before treatment with steroids was started and—if logistics allowed—at 3 and 6 months. PET scans were scored at seven different vascular areas and a total vascular score (TVS) was calculated, ranging from 0 to 21. FDG uptake in the shoulders, the hips and the <b>processi</b> spinosi of the vertebrae was scored as 0 (no uptake), 1 (moderate uptake) or 2 (intense uptake). Results. Thirty-five patients entered the study. At diagnosis, vascular FDG uptake was noted in 11 patients (31 %), predominantly at the subclavian arteries. Mean TVS was low. FDG uptake in the shoulders was noted in 94 % of patients, in the hips in 89 % and in the <b>processi</b> spinosi of the vertebrae in 51 %. The intensity of FDG uptake in the large vessels or in the shoulders, hips or <b>processi</b> spinosi did not correlate with the risk of relapse. Conclusions. Only one in three patients has an (moderately) increased vascular FDG uptake, especially in the subclavian arteries. The vast majority has inflammation of shoulders and hips, and half of them have increased FDG-uptake at the <b>processi</b> spinosi. Results of FDG–PET scans in patients with PMR did not correlate with their risk of relapse. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{historian}}s have viewed Ginzburg's ideas as being related to Murray's; Hungarian historian Gábor Klaniczay stated that [...] "Ginzburg reformulated Murray's often fantastic and very inadequately documented thesis about {{the reality of}} the witches' Sabbath" [...] and thus the publication of I Benandanti in 1966 [...] "reopened the debate about the possible interconnections between witchcraft beliefs and the survival of pagan fertility cults". Similarly, Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade commented that while Ginzburg's presentation of the benandanti [...] "does not substantiate Murray's entire thesis", it did represent a [...] "well-documented case of the <b>processus</b> through which a popular and archaic secret cult of fertility is transformed into a merely magical, or even black-magical practice under the pressure of the Inquisition." [...] Historian of witchcraft Michael D. Bailey suggested that Ginzburg's work [...] "somewhat revived" [...] Murray's [...] "discredited notion of witchcraft representing an ancient fertility religion".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the pelvis}} the ilium {{is short and}} flat with a {{slightly}} convex upper profile. The back end is rectangular, the front edge has an appending hook-shaped point and near its top a circular notch, a trait that is usually considered a synapomorphy of the Tyrannosauroidea. The pubic bone points almost vertically downwards and is thus [...] "mesopubic" [...] or [...] "orthopubic". It is relatively short with about {{two thirds of the}} length of the femur. It has a short [...] "foot" [...] shaped like a golf club. The ischium has three quarters the length of the pubis, set at an angle of 54° to it. It ends in a small expansion. On the front of its shaft a large hatchet-shaped obturator process is present, the attachment for the Musculus puboischiofemoralis externus, that lacks a small circular notch between its lower edge and the shaft, though this lack is normally associated with the possession of a lower triangular <b>processus</b> obturatorius.|$|E
2500|$|The {{preparation}} of the inquiries (<b>processus)</b> {{all of which were}} carried on by the ordinary episcopal authority. They were of three kinds: (a) Informative inquiries regarded the reputation for sanctity and miracles of the servants of God, not only in general, but also in particular instances; there might be several such inquiries if the witnesses to be examined belonged to different dioceses. (b) Processes de non cultu were instituted to prove that the decrees of Pope Urban VIII regarding the prohibition of public veneration of servants of God before their beatification had been obeyed; they were generally conducted by the bishop of the place where the relics of the servant of God were preserved. (c) Other inquiries were known as [...] "processiculi diligentiarum" [...] and had for their object the writings attributed to the person whose beatification was in question; they varied in number according to the dioceses where such writings were found, or were thought likely to be found, and might not be judicially executed before an [...] "instruction" [...] was obtained from the Promotor of the Faith by the Postulator General and by him sent to the bishop in question.|$|E
