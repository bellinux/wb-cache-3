We also know that nursing <b>personnel</b> exposed to <b>manual</b> patient handling activity report high number of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The objective of our study was to evaluate the relationships between work and musculoskeletal disorders in <b>personnel</b> exposed to <b>manual</b> patient handling activity. 160 health care workers of an hospice exposed to patient handling were compared to a control group of 172 people not exposed to the handling risk. In our study we considered only subject with pathology already diagnosed, withdrawing people with disturbs but without clinical trials. The statistical evaluation using the chi 2 test has not shown any meaning in the comparison between the two groups, we have calculated the Odds Ratio risk for discal hernia and protrusion finding a risk between low and modest (1. 52). We think that the least prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders to the back in the group exposed to manual patient handling activity, could be explained partly with the "healthy worker" effect and partly with the workplace improvement. That is demonstrated also with the M. A. P. O. index scoring between 0 and 1. 5 (negligible risk) ...|$|R

Their main products are copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver. To make it easier to standardize the procurement process and introduce new lead-buyers, Boliden has decided to create a procurement manual. The primary purpose of the Manual is to provide an overview of Bolidens procurement operations, procurement processes and procurement information systems. As such, this Manual provides an awareness of mandatory requirements, policy considerations, guidelines, procedures and best practices. The manual will contain job descriptions for all roles involved in procurement, instructions on how to handle communications, purchasing ethics and policies and detailed descriptions of the procurement process and its sub processes. In this project this manual is created through interviews and workshops with relevant <b>personnel.</b> The <b>manual</b> is adopted for presentation at the company intranet. In the process of creating this manual five main processes are identified: Governance and administration, strategic sourcing, contracting, operative procurement and supplier management.

40|$|This revised {{handbook}} updates {{the minimum}} {{provisions of the}} agency-wide Grievance System and applies to NASA Headquarters and field installations. All grievances initiated on or after June 15, 1981, will be processed under these provisions. NASA recognizes and endorses the importance of bringing to light and adjusting grievances promptly and of treating all employees reasonably and fairly. Achieving these objectives requires great competence, mature judgment, and true willingness to reach a satisfactory solution. Provisions of the NASA Grievance System are directed to this purpose. Grievances and misunderstandings can arise in almost any working situation. It follows then that an employee's initiation of a grievance in good faith should not cast any reflection on the employee's standing {{with his or her}} supervisor or loyalty and importance to the organization. At the same time, the initiation of a grievance should not automatically be considered as a reflection on the employee's supervisor or on the general management of the activity. This handbook should be used in conjunction with Office of Personnel Management regulations in 5 CFR Part 771 and Chapter 771 of the Federal <b>Personnel</b> <b>Manual.</b> Installations may issue implementing instructions, e. g. specifying when fact-finding is required or when an unresolved grievance must be referred to a higher level of authority...|$|E
