The proposed scheme {{is an extension}} of a recently reported subspace-based blind channel estimation algorithm in cyclic prefix systems which requires very few received blocks. The semi-blind estimation algorithm is devised by using the information obtained both from the blind channel estimation method and a pure pilot-assisted method. The proposed algorithm uses a small amount of received data and can be applied to any types of communication constellations. Simulation results show that, with the same number of <b>pilot</b> <b>samples,</b> the semi-blind algorithm has a clear improvement in system performance over the pure pilot-assisted method.

There are various methods for IS with multiple proposals, including Hesterberg's stratified IS estimator, Owen and Zhou's regression estimator, and Tan's maximum likelihood estimator. For the problem of efficiently allocating samples to different proposals, it is natural to use a <b>pilot</b> <b>sample</b> to select the mixture proportions before the actual sampling and estimation. However, most current discussions are in an empirical sense for such a two-stage procedure.

By our simulation studies, these two-stage estimators can outperform estimators with naive choices of mixture proportions.

40|$|Background: External pilot or {{feasibility}} studies {{can be used}} to estimate key unknown parameters to inform the design of the definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT). However, there is little consensus on how large pilot studies need to be, and some suggest inflating estimates to adjust for the lack of precision when planning the definitive RCT. Methods: We use a simulation approach to illustrate the sampling distribution of the standard deviation for continuous outcomes and the event rate for binary outcomes. We present the impact of increasing the <b>pilot</b> <b>sample</b> size on the precision and bias of these estimates, and predicted power under three realistic scenarios. We also illustrate the consequences of using a confidence interval argument to inflate estimates so the required power is achieved with a pre-specified level of confidence. We limit our attention to external pilot and {{feasibility studies}} prior to a two-parallel-balanced-group superiority RCT. Results: For normally distributed outcomes, the relative gain in precision of the pooled standard deviation (SD p) is less than 10 % (for each five subjects added per group) once the total sample size is 70. For true proportions between 0. 1 and 0. 5, we find the gain in precision for each five subjects added to the <b>pilot</b> <b>sample</b> is less than 5 % once the sample size is 60. Adjusting the required sample sizes for the imprecision in the pilot study estimates can result in excessively large definitive RCTs and also requires a <b>pilot</b> <b>sample</b> size of 60 to 90 for the true effect sizes considered here. Conclusions: We recommend that an external pilot study has at least 70 measured subjects (35 per group) when estimating the SD p for a continuous outcome. If the event rate in an intervention group needs to be estimated by the pilot then a total of 60 to 100 subjects is required. Hence if the primary outcome is binary a total of at least 120 subjects (60 in each group) may be required in the pilot trial. It is very much more efficient to use a larger pilot study, than to guard against the lack of precision by using inflated estimates. © 2014 Teare et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Sample size {{justification}} is {{an important}} consideration when planning a clinical trial, {{not only for the}} main trial but also for any preliminary pilot trial. When the outcome is a continuous variable, the sample size calculation requires an accurate estimate of the standard deviation of the outcome measure. A pilot trial can be used to get an estimate of the standard deviation, which could then be used to anticipate what may be observed in the main trial. However, an important consideration is that pilot trials often estimate the standard deviation parameter imprecisely. This paper looks at how we can choose an external <b>pilot</b> trial <b>sample</b> size in order to minimise the sample size of the overall clinical trial programme, that is, the pilot and the main trial together. We produce a method of calculating the optimal solution to the required <b>pilot</b> trial <b>sample</b> size when the standardised effect size for the main trial is known. However, as it may not be possible to know the standardised effect size to be used prior to the pilot trial, approximate rules are also presented.
