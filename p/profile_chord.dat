50|$|Interestingly, for an {{aerodynamic}} profile {{the reference}} length {{depends on the}} analysis. In fact, the <b>profile</b> <b>chord</b> is usually chosen as the reference length also for aerodynamic coefficient for wing sections and thin profiles in which the primary target is to maximize the lift coefficient or the lift/drag ratio (i.e. as usual in thin airfoil theory, one would employ the chord Reynolds as the flow speed parameter for comparing different profiles). On the other hand, for fairings and struts the given parameter is usually the dimension of internal structure to be streamlined (let us think for simplicity it is a beam with circular section), and the main target is to minimize the drag coefficient or the drag/lift ratio. The main design parameter which becomes naturally also a reference length is therefore the profile thickness (the profile dimension or area perpendicular to the flow direction), rather than the <b>profile</b> <b>chord.</b>|$|E
50|$|For common flows (the ones {{which can}} usually be {{considered}} as incompressible or isothermal), the kinematic viscosity is everywhere uniform over all the flow field and constant in time, {{so there is no}} choice on the viscosity parameter, which becomes naturally the kinematic viscosity of the fluid being considered at the temperature being considered. On the other hand, the reference length is always an arbitrary parameter, so particular attention should be put when comparing flows around different obstacles or in channels of different shapes: the global Reynolds numbers should be referred to the same reference length. This is actually the reason for which most precise sources for airfoil and channel flow data specify the reference length at a pedix to the Reynolds number. The reference length can vary depending on the analysis to be performed: for body with circle sections such as circular cylinders or spheres, one usually chooses the diameter; for an airfoil, a generic non-circular cylinder or a bluff body or a revolution body like a fuselage or a submarine, it is usually the <b>profile</b> <b>chord</b> or the profile thickness, or some other given widths that are in fact stable design inputs; for flow channels usually the hydraulic diameter) about which the fluid is flowing.|$|E

The plasma is sustained in a 28 mm internal diameter fused quartz tube which penetrates perpendicularly through the wide walls of a tapered and shorted WR- 284 (72 x 17 mm cross-section) waveguide. A study {{has been made of}} the effects of power and airflow on the electronic excitation temperature, Texc. Abel inversion of radial <b>profile</b> <b>chord</b> averaged Fe I emission lines in the 370 to 377 nm range have been used to obtain localized profile measurements of Texc inside the waveguide excitation region. In general, temperature profiles peak on axis with no evidence of a skin effect in the large diameter (10 mm FWHM emission intensity) plasmas. A maximum central Texc of 6550 K ± 350 K is observed at an airflow rate of 28 lpm. When maintaining a constant flow rate of 14 lpm, a 55 % increase in microwave power from 0. 9 to 1. 4 kW causes a ~ 100 % increase in plasma volume without any noticeable effect on the central Texc value. At a constant microwave power of 1. 4 kW, an increase in total flow rate from 11 to 28 lpm decreases the volume of the plasma by ~ 25 % and increases the central Texc by ~ 13 %.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{illustrate}} a new wing morphing concept and to compare its performance with the conventional wing-flap configuration. While there is no formal definition for the word "morphing", it is usually considered to mean large shape change or transfiguration. In the field of aeronautics, "shape morphing" {{has been used to}} identify those aircraft that undergo significant geometrical changes to enhance or adapt to their mission profiles. This investigation aims {{to find out more about}} non conventional solutions over the classical wing structural design. The main goal in this research is to replace the ordinary wing structure adopted on a model aircraft with a new morphing wing. In this way, aerodynamic performances during different flight conditions may be improved thanks to the prevention of typical aerodynamic losses caused by geometrical discontinuities in conventional designs. The ability of a wing surface to change its geometry during flight has interested researchers and designers over the years as this reduces the design compromises required. Conventional flap systems inevitably contain discontinuous sections that cause aerodynamic losses, and this is the point where using a morphing technology that would prevent those aerodynamic losses makes sense. Wing morphing concepts can be classified into three major shape changing types: planform alternation, out-of-plane transformation, and airfoil adjustment. An example of planform alteration is wing span resizing through telescopic structures. The morphing wing in the telescopic designs is sectioned longitudinally to form several segments with reducing cross sectional area, such that each segment can be accommodated in the adjacent inner segment with a minimum sliding clearance. Given the required length change, the number of segments can be determined. Neal et al. designed and demonstrated a variable planform aircraft capable of such wing span resizing. Airfoil profile adjustment has been the less explored way of morphing. Austin et al. examined variable length trusses to reshape the airfoil. They attached linear displacement actuators inside the wing section in a diagonal manner. The airfoil shape could therefore be modified by the expansion or contraction of the actuators. Although the idea of changing the wing camber was born with the first airplanes, it is far from simple to design devices capable of achieving the necessary deformation and suitable control systems. Airfoil adjustment is mainly concerned with camber variation, although there is also some research concerned with thickness change. In this research, a new morphing mechanism using rapidly prototyped structural elements and a bio-inspired geometry is proposed to perform an out of plane transformation through <b>profile</b> <b>chord</b> wise bending. A rotating mechanism created by means of a rod connected to a linear actuator positioned at the root of the wing, led each rib to de ect at least up to 40 degrees.

The wings were each tested on a shaker-table in a cantilever position undergoing 1 g (ft/s 2) acceleration sinusoidal frequency sweep from 10 - 2000 Hz. The 1 st bending mode was excited at 190 Hz and the 2 nd bending mode was excited at 900 Hz. After the pre-impact vibrational testing each wing was impacted, excluding the control group. To verify the experimental results, a finite element model of the wing was created in ABAQUS. The frequency and impact numerical results and the experimental results were in good agreement with a percent error for both the 1 st and 2 nd mode at around 10 %...|$|R
40|$|PhDThis {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the automatic transcription of chords from audio, with an emphasis on modern popular music. Musical context such as the key and the structural segmentation aid the interpretation of chords in human beings. In this thesis we propose computational models that integrate such musical context into the automatic chord estimation process. We present a novel dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) which integrates models of metric position, key, chord, bass note and two beat-synchronous audio features (bass and treble chroma) into a single high-level musical context model. We simultaneously infer the most probable sequence of metric positions, keys, chords and bass notes via Viterbi inference. Several experiments with real world data show that adding context parameters results in a significant increase in chord recognition accuracy and faithfulness of chord segmentation. The proposed, most complex method transcribes chords with a state-of-the-art accuracy of 73 % on the song collection used for the 2009 MIREX Chord Detection tasks. This method is used as a baseline method for two further enhancements. Firstly, we aim to improve chord confusion behaviour by modifying the audio front end processing. We compare the effect of learning <b>chord</b> <b>profiles</b> as Gaussian mixtures to the effect of using chromagrams generated from an approximate pitch transcription method. We show that using chromagrams from approximate transcription results in the most substantial increase in accuracy. The best method achieves 79 % accuracy and significantly outperforms the state of the art. Secondly, we propose a method by which chromagram information is shared between repeated structural segments (such as verses) in a song. This can be done fully automatically using a novel structural segmentation algorithm tailored to this task. We show that the technique leads to a significant increase in accuracy and readability. The segmentation algorithm itself also obtains state-of-the-art results. A method that combines both of the above enhancements reaches an accuracy of 81 %, a statistically significant improvement over the best result (74 %) in the 2009 MIREX Chord Detection tasks...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a brief theory of aeroelastic flutter of airfoils and the relevant algorithm {{for the development}} of a computer code in FORTRAN for dynamic coupling of the airfoil structure, in the time domain, to a two-dimensional subsonic aerodynamic flow, so that the aeroelastic motion can be simulated in the time domain and the flutter boundary be determined for a typical rigid airfoil (of heave and pitch degrees of freedom) in the subsonic flow. The relevant computer code with fluid structure coupling has been developed at the Structural Technologies Division (STTD) for the purpose. The present work starts with a brief introduction to the fundamental concepts of airfoil flutter. The relevant equations of motion of the airfoil in subsonic airflow have been derived from the first principles. First, the classical method, based on the eigenvalue approach is used to solve the equations of motion and to determine the flutter boundary of the airfoil in the subsonic flow regime. A symmetric NACA 0012 airfoil <b>profile</b> of unit <b>chord</b> and width is chosen for analysis, with suitable spring stiffness and inertia values so that flutter instability can occur in the subsonic regime. Results from the panel code for steady flow conditions over the NACA 0012 confirm the validity of the code. For the purpose of time domain flutter simulation the panel code with the Prandtl-Glauert compressibility correction factor is suitably coupled to the airfoil through a Newmark's implicit time integration scheme. Unsteady motion in the fluid-structure system is numerically simulated through the code with small initial conditions. Flutter boundary is indicated by the critical free stream flow speed (and dynamic pressure) beyond which oscillation amplitudes show divergence in time. Flutter frequencies and flutter velocities obtained by the various methods are then compared, and good agreement is observed. Present analysis with a simple airfoil coupled to a 2 D subsonic flow (simulated by the panel method) indicate that it is possible, in principle, to simulate flutter even in the transonic and supersonic regimes, using more sophisticated aerodynamic codes (Navier Stokes) ...|$|R
