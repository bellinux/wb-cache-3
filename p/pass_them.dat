5|$|On 3 January 2009, Yousafzai's first entry {{was posted}} to the BBC Urdu blog. She would hand-write notes and then <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> on to a {{reporter}} who would scan and e-mail them. The blog records Yousafzai's thoughts during the First Battle of Swat, as military operations take place, fewer girls show up to school, and finally, her school shuts down.|$|E
5|$|When cricket resumed {{after the}} war, few bowlers {{maintained}} the tactic, which was unpopular with spectators owing to its negativity. Fred Root, the Worcestershire bowler, used it regularly and with considerable success in county cricket. Root later defended {{the use of}} leg theory—and Bodyline—observing that when bowlers bowled outside off stump, the batsmen were able to let the ball <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> without playing a shot.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
5000|$|The record (a metal {{book written}} on sheets of gold) was passed through generations.

5|$|In 1956, Radford {{proposed}} protecting several military {{programs from}} funding cuts by reducing numbers of conventional forces, but {{the proposal was}} leaked to the press, causing an uproar in Congress and among U.S. military allies, and the plan was dropped. In 1957, after the other Joint Chiefs of Staff again disagreed on how to downsize force levels amid more budget restrictions, Radford submitted ideas for less dramatic force downsizing directly to Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, who agreed to <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> along to Eisenhower.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, a Florida {{judge ordered}} Jack to stop selling nude {{photographs}} of Runnels. Runnels filed suit, accusing Jack of making libelous comments {{about her and}} requested that a court ban him from distributing sexually-explicit photographs of her. Jack said that he took the photos, that they belonged to him {{and that he should}} be free to <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> on to whoever he pleases. A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Runnels ahead of a hearing.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy {{that he is}} dating Squeaky Fromme {{and says}} {{that she is a}} handful. Fromme {{is a member of the}} Manson Family, and was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E

5|$|In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York {{worked to}} expand telegraphic {{communication}} through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a telegraph line he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new telegraph {{was an instant}} hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the New York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand this new technology with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to <b>pass</b> <b>them.</b> This new system would relieve this issue.|$|E
5|$|In the English Civil War, the Parliamentary Army built a {{blockhouse}} at East Mersea in 1648, {{with the}} aim of blockading the River Colne during the Siege of Colchester. Some ruins of this blockhouse remain and are known as the Block House Stone, which is legally protected by English Heritage as a scheduled monument. Fishing grew in importance on the island during this time, with numerous fish weirs being installed. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Dutch and French settlers arrived on the island. Some locals supplemented their income from the oyster trade by smuggling, which remained popular until the mid-19th century. Smugglers favoured the Peldon Rose, immediately north of the Strood, where they would store contraband in the pond alongside the inn. In the early 19th century, the increased demand for oysters despite a limited supply from the Strood and Pyefleet Channel led traders to get oysters from other places and <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> off as native to the island.|$|E
5|$|While his {{selections}} {{provided the}} album's {{country and western}} foundation, the musical arrangements represented its contemporary influence. Eager to display his big band ensemble in studio, Charles enlisted premier jazz arrangers Gerald Wilson and Gil Fuller, while Marty Paich, who {{was active in the}} West Coast jazz scene, was hired to arrange the lush strings and chorus numbers. Despite enlisting a roster of professional arrangers and musicians, Charles intended to control the artistic direction of the recordings. To indicate specific licks he wanted emphasized for certain songs, Charles would put together voice-and-piano demos and <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> along to the arrangers, informing them of {{what he wanted to do}} with specific sounds. According to Feller, at one point during recording, Charles rewrote an entire botched arrangement and dictated the parts to each of the 18 backing musicians.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping <b>pass</b> <b>them,</b> {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher slides into a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E
25|$|Harvesting of dead-and-down timber {{by local}} logging {{companies}} also caused considerable resentment. Although the logging companies {{paid for the}} timber they harvested, the value was often underestimated and payments were frequently late. In addition, some unscrupulous loggers purposely set fire to healthy trees in order to damage them and <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> off as dead timber.|$|E
25|$|Damage of {{any sort}} (e.g., holes, edge dents, repairs, cleaning, re-engraving or gouges) can {{substantially}} reduce {{the value of a}} coin. Specimens are occasionally cleaned or polished in an attempt to <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> off as higher grades or as uncirculated strikes. Because of the substantially lower prices for cleaned or damaged coins, some enthusiasts specialize in their collection.|$|E

The changes were passed in parliament in late April and early May 2010 with over 330 votes, below the two-thirds majority of 367 votes needed to <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> directly, but enough {{to send them to}} a referendum within sixty days after President Abdullah Gül signs the law.|$|E
25|$|Foreign body is {{an object}} {{foreign to the}} body that becomes lodged in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract (or {{other part of the}} dog). Dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due to their ability to swallow relatively large objects and <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> through the esophagus. Foreign bodies most commonly become lodged in the stomach because of the inability to pass through the pyloric sphincter, and in the jejunum.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of the centuries the {{residents}} of the municipality lived in relative stability, in which the major changes in European and Swiss history seemed to <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> by.

25|$|Freight trains use the {{existing}} loop to allow passenger trains to <b>pass</b> <b>them</b> {{on the main}} line. Steam locomotives on special charters that are not stopping in the station also use the loop as a water stop because nearby road access can allow a water tender to reach the line. It also prevents such trains from blocking the main line or a platform at Newbury. All continuing trains using the loop at the racecourse must also travel through the loop on the down platform at Newbury to rejoin the main line.|$|E
25|$|Aix-les-Bains {{is again}} {{mentioned}} in sources from the 9th century, in 867, and in 1011 through charters.

This Charter tells us that Aix {{is a small town}} with a church and agricultural areas. Bishop Hugues of Grenoble then donated it to the monastery of Saint-Martin de Miserere, {{at the beginning of the}} 12th century. The church erected a new priory under the name of Sainte Marie.|$|E
