40|$|The {{performance}} of a direct <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> {{for the detection of}} toxoplasma specific IgG immunoglobulin was compared with that of the latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test.</b> The direct <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was less sensitive but more specific than the latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test.</b> Quantitative results were not directly comparable, reflecting the different antibody profiles detected in each assay. The direct <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> represents an alternative to the latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> as a screening test for toxoplasmosis. Patients at risk of life threatening infection require detailed serological examination using additional assays...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{preparation}} anti-D immunoglobulin is {{an important}} therapy for both treatment and protection. Titer of anti-D immunoglobulin preparation {{is an important}} factor to determine the dose of treatment. Many methods are used to evaluate the titer of anti-D immunoglobulin preparation. One of the new methods developed recently is column <b>agglutination</b> <b>test.</b> To evaluate the BioVue column <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> it was compared to conventional tube <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> using anti-D immunoglobulin preparations from three different producers, ten lots each. Results showed that the BioVue column <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> is comparable to conventional tube <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> but with much ease. In conclusion, the BioVue column <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> is accurate and easy to use in determination of anti-D titer for quality control purposes...|$|R
40|$|One {{group of}} 28, 714 bovine sera were tested {{by both the}} {{brucellosis}} tube serum <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> and the brucellosis card test. The tube serum <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> confirmed 99. 8 % of the negative brucellosis card test results. The brucellosis card test identified 63 % of the tube serum <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> reactors. In a second group of 496 sera reacting to either the tube serum <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> complement fixation <b>test,</b> plate serum <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> or acid antigen serum <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> the brucellosis card test identified 99. 1 % of the complement fixation test positive sera and 91. 3 % of the sera reacting {{to any of the}} other serological tests. The brucellosis card test showed satisfactory agreement with both the complement fixation test and tube serum <b>agglutination</b> <b>test.</b> It appears to be a useful screening test in operations involving large numbers of animals since under these conditions the reactors can be quickly identified and isolated...|$|R

40|$|Background: Single Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> {{rather than}} blood culture, is {{commonly}} employed to diagnose typhoid fever in Nigeria. We took {{another look at}} the Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> as a preferred option for diagnosis of typhoid fever by determining the specificity and sensitivity of Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> in febrile adult patients. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and seventy-one blood samples from consecutive adults (> 18 years) with febrile illness attending the General Practice Clinic of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital were tested using the Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> blood culture, and malaria parasite test on each sample to establish the diagnosis of typhoid fever. Results: Of the 271 blood samples 124 (45. 76 %) were positive following a Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> 60 (22. 10 %) blood samples grew Salmonella organisms on blood culture while 55 (20. 29 %) blood samples showed a co-infection of typhoid fever and malaria. A sensitivity of 35 %, specificity of 51 %, positive predictive value of 17 %, and a negative predictive value of 73 % were observed for Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> as a diagnostic modality for typhoid fever infection. Conclusion: A single Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> is not a valid diagnostic option for typhoid fever while co-infection with malaria parasite is the preponderant microbiological finding in typhoid fever infections. The severity of malaria parasitemia is associated with positive titers on Widal test...|$|R

40|$|One hundred sera from 49 {{patients}} with glandular toxoplasmosis were examined by a latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> the dye test, an indirect haemagglutination test, and a double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antitoxoplasma IgM. The results support previous findings that the dye test, indirect haemagglutination <b>test,</b> and latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> measure different antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. In early glandular toxoplasmosis, when specific IgM was detected, the titres {{of both the}} latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> and the indirect haemagglutination test were lower than the dye test. Repeat specimens from 11 of the patients showed four {{cases in which the}} latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> titres never exceeded 1 / 256, whereas both the dye test and the indirect haemagglutination test showed significant titres and specific IgM was detected in every case. We conclude that the latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> should not be used as a substitute for the dye test in the serological diagnosis of glandular toxoplasmosis. All sera giving a positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> result should be referred for further tests.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{prepare and}} assess the {{sensitivity}} and specificity of a latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> specific for the serotype of antigen in diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia in Gambian children. DESIGN [...] Comparison of <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> specific for serotype with culture of blood and lung aspirates, countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis, and commercial latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> in diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia. Cross reaction studies and investigation of 102 control children to determine specificity of <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> specific for serotype. SETTING [...] General medical ward of Medical Research Council laboratories, The Gambia. PATIENTS [...] 101 Gambian children aged between 2 months and 10 years admitted with severe pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS [...] Serum samples were boiled and treated with edetic acid, and urine samples were boiled and concentrated 25 times before testing. END POINT [...] A latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> specific for the serotype of pneumococcal antigen that is sensitive and highly specific for detecting pneumococcus in the urine of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Concentrated urine samples from 16 of the 21 children (76 %) with pneumococcal pneumonia established by results of culture of blood or lung aspirates gave a positive result with the <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> specific for serotype, whereas only four of the 102 urine samples obtained from control children without pneumonia gave positive results. The serotypes of antigens detected in the urine of children with pneumococcal pneumonia and the serotypes of pneumococci isolated from cultures of blood or lung aspirates were the same in all cases. CONCLUSIONS [...] When performed on urine samples the <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> specific for serotype has a high specificity and is more sensitive than culture of blood or lung aspirates, commercial <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests,</b> or countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis in identifying pneumococcal pneumonia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of the direct <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> and rK 39 dipstick for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, citation tracking, January 1986 to December 2004. Selection criteria Original studies evaluating the direct <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> or the rK 39 dipstick with clinical visceral leishmaniasis as target condition; adequate reference classification; and absolute numbers of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative observations available or derivable from the data presented. RESULTS: 30 studies evaluating the direct <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> and 13 studies evaluating the rK 39 dipstick met the inclusion criteria. The combined sensitivity estimates of the direct <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> and the rK 39 dipstick were 94. 8 % (95 % confidence interval 92. 7 % to 96. 4 %) and 93. 9 % (87. 7 % to 97. 1 %), respectively. Sensitivity seemed higher and more homogenous in the studies carried out in South Asia. Specificity estimates were influenced by the type of controls. In phase III studies carried out on patients with clinically suspected disease, the estimated specificity of the direct <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was 85. 9 % (72. 3 % to 93. 4 %) and of the rK 39 dipstick was 90. 6 % (66. 8 % to 97. 9 %).

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} the Pastorex aspergillus antigen latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> for {{the diagnosis of}} invasive aspergillosis in patients undergoing liver or bone marrow transplantation. METHODS [...] Serum samples were taken at least twice weekly post-transplant and tested for Aspergillus antigen. Latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> results were compared with microbiological examination of respiratory, urine and bile specimens. Serum samples from liver transplant patients were also tested for antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus by counter immunoelectrophoresis. RESULTS [...] Eight of the 91 patients studied developed invasive aspergillosis. Positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> were obtained in eight of 187 (4. 3 %) serum samples from four of these eight patients. The other four patients with invasive aspergillosis gave consistently negative latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests.</b> A positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was the first indication of invasive aspergillosis in two patients; these patients were already on amphotericin B. Positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> were the only evidence of invasive aspergillosis in one patient who subsequently died of the infection. False positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> were obtained in five of 83 (6 %) patients with no evidence of invasive aspergillosis and misleading positive cultures seen in nine of 83 (10. 8 %). No antibodies were detected in three of four liver transplant patients with invasive aspergillosis. Conversely, antibodies were detected in 63 of 262 (24 %) serum samples from 43 liver transplant patients with no evidence of invasive aspergillosis; one of these patients had an antibody titre of 1 : 2 on four separate occasions. CONCLUSIONS [...] The Pastorex aspergillus antigen latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> when used alone, lacks sensitivity and specificity for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. A diagnosis was made in all patients with invasive aspergillosis when both culture and antigen tests were performed although using these criteria a false positive diagnosis would {{have been made in}} 13 of 83 (15. 6 %) patients. Microbiological and serial serological investigations for antigen should both be performed and the results considered in conjunction with radiological and clinical evidence...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the search toward a fast and reliable strategy {{to detect and}} confirm the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in screening samples. First, we evaluated the sensitivities and specificities of oxacillin resistance screening agar (ORSA) with enrichment (tryptic soy broth [TSB] and ORSA [TSB-ORSA]) and without enrichment (ORSA), MRSA ID (MRSA_ID) plates, and CHROMagar MRSA (C_MRSA) plates, {{all of which were}} inoculated with equal volumes of a suspension made by emulsifying screening swabs. Whereas the sensitivities after 48 h were similar for all media tested (77 % for MRSA_ID and ORSA; 73 % for C_MRSA and ORSA after enrichment [TSB-ORSA]), the specificities of MRSA_ID (98 % after 24 h and 94 % after 48 h) and C_MRSA (98 % after 24 h and 90 % after 48 h) were superior to the specificities of ORSAs (92 % after 24 h and 83 % after 48 h) and TSB-ORSA (86 % after 24 h and 81 % after 48 h). Subsequently, the performance of the Pastorex Staph-Plus <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> with presumptive MRSA isolates taken directly from chromogenic agars (direct_Pastorex agglutination) was compared to that of the Pastorex Staph-Plus <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> with isolates from blood agar subcultures (conventional_Pastorex agglutination). When the direct_Pastorex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> on MRSA_ID plates was combined with Gram staining, the direct_Pastorex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> with samples from MRSA_ID plates was as reliable as the conventional_Pastorex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> with samples from blood agar subcultures from MRSA_ID plates. In contrast, the direct_Pastorex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> with samples from C_MRSA plates gave false-negative results. Finally, we calculated the processing times of the four different strategies, namely, (i) enrichment in TSB supplemented with NaCl, subsequent culture on ORSA, and the conventional_Pastorex agglutination test; (ii) direct inoculation of ORSA combined with conventional_Pastorex agglutination test; (iii) direct inoculation of MRSA_ID plates combined with Gram staining and the direct_Pastorex agglutination test; and (iv) direct inoculation of C_MRSA plates combined with Gram staining and the direct_Pastorex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test.</b> We concluded that the use of MRSA_ID in combination with Gram staining and the direct_Pastorex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> is faster and more specific than the other strategies tested...|$|R
