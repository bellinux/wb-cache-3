However, the linear type has no restriction in one dimension, because it can roll. Its wheels must not slip, because the movement must be constrained to a straight line.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} moment planimeters, {{which are}} mechanical devices with {{which is it}} possible to locate the centre of mass of an irregular plane shape by mechanical and graphical methods. They are a type of analogue computing device. In addition to this they may be used to find the static moment (first moment) and moment of inertia (second moment) of a shape about a fixed line. Moment planimeters, sometimes called integrometers or integrators, are direct developments of the planimeter which is a mechanical device used to directly measure the area of a plane shape. While planimeters are reasonably well known, linear planimeters are less common than the <b>polar</b> <b>planimeters</b> of Amsler. Hence in this article we explain how planimeters work through the example of a linear planimeter, and then consider how these may be adapted to find the centre of mass. More detailed comparisons between other types of area measuring planimeters may be found in the comprehensive survey article of [2]. 1 Area and centre of mass Consider the region enclosed by the closed curve in Figure 1, through which we have drawn the x-axis. We consider the area to be split into two regions by this axis, and these regions are described by the the two functions, f 1 (x) and f 2 (x). Since a general plane shape cannot be described in thi...|$|R

(1979). The area was measured using mechanical <b>polar</b> <b>planimeter</b> (model series 20). The mean of the right and left cross sectional areas were taken as a rib-eye muscle area measurement. Edible offal (EO) component was taken as the sum of blood, liver, reticulo-rumen, omasum, abomasum, large and small intestine, kidneys and kidney fat, omental fat, heart, tongue and tail. Non-edible offal component (NEO) was computed as the sum of spleen, pancreas, head without tongue, skin and feet, testis and penis, lung, trachea, esophagus and gut content. Usable product (UP) was taken as the sum of hot carcass weight, EO and skin.|$|E

Of {{particular interest to}} her recently has been the mathematics of mechanical devices such as astrolabes and planimeters, which are also great fun to collect. When not doing math, she enjoys cycling and sewing stuffed dragons for her daughter. A classic example of Green’s theorem in action is the planimeter, a device that measures the area enclosed by a curve. Most familiar may be the <b>polar</b> <b>planimeter</b> (see Figure 1), for which a nice geometrical explanation {{can be found in}} the book by Jennings [4] and a direct constructive proof using Green’s theorem is given by Gatterdam [2]. Other types include the rolling planimeter, which is particularly suited to a vector calculus course for both ease of use and simplicity of proof, and radial planimeters that integrate functions plotted on circular charts (that is, the function is in polar form, r = f(θ)). In this article, we present simple proofs using Green’s theorem for the rolling and polar planimeters, followed by an analysis of how to design radial planimeters that calculate a desired integral, such as that of the square root of a function marked on a circular chart. These proofs are suitable for use in a vector calculus course and avoid the awkward trigonometric and algebraic calculations required by proofs like that in [2]. While the proofs in this article are probably not new (though the author has not seen them elsewhere), they are not readily available, and so these planimeter proofs are presented with the aim of providing calculus instructors a wonderful supplement for their courses. Other planimeter proofs can be found on the web. For example, see [6] for a geometric analysis and [5] for a vector analysis of the <b>polar</b> <b>planimeter,</b> and see [1] for an explanation of the radial planimeter. Both rolling and polar planimeters are available in mechanical and electronic versions for commercial use (a quick web search will reveal several manufacturers). For classroo...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Currently, no {{specific}} method exists to measure arterio-venous malformation (AVM) nidus size, a requirement {{in assessing the}} success of treatment. Additionally, the commonly used evaluation provides only a linear one-dimensional measure-ment of this three-dimensional entity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to devise an improved method for measuring AVM nidus size, an irregularly shaped radiologic entity, that provides objective and reproducible results. METHODS: The procedure involved digitizing angiograms obtained before and after treat-ment, making the gray scale uniform, printing images on standard bond paper, delineating the nidus area, measuring the nidus area with a <b>polar</b> <b>planimeter,</b> and finally, correcting for geometric magnification. Three observers made the measurements. The corrected nidus areas were tabulated, and the mean, standard deviation, interobserver variability, and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: On both anteroposterior and lateral views, the Kendall coefficient of concordance (a measure of interobserver variability) was equal to 0. 97, signifying excellent agreement. Additionally, these values were within the 95 % CIs; this result showed that they were unlikel...|$|E
40|$|Changes {{in heart}} size {{have been studied}} by means of intra {{ventricular}} gages, serial roentgenography and cinefluoiographic angiocardiography. Evidence is presented that {{the area of the}} cardiac sil-houette and the area and diameter of the left ventricle all diminish in response to thoracotomy and during recovery return toward the pre-operative dimensions. Since fundamental concepts of cardiac function and control are based largely on investigation of exposed hearts, these concepts must be re-examined in intact, unanesthetized animals and man. I T T L E is known concerning changes in the absolute volume or linear dimen-sions of the individual ventricular chambers in intact, unanesthetized animals or man. Since the fundamental concepts of cardiac function and control are based prin-cipally on controlled experiments on anes-thetized, thoracotomized animals, their appli-cation to man implies that cardiac function is essentially identical under the two conditions. For this reason, the response of the heart to anesthesia and thoracotomy assumes great importance in evaluating many basic concepts as applied to intact animals and man. METHODS Continuous measurements of the left ventricular diameter during recovery from operative procedures were obtained from variable inductance gages by methods described in a previous report. 1 In the course of these experiments, serial roentgenograms were obtained before anesthesia, after anesthesia, after thoracotomy, immediately after surgical repair of the thoracotomy wound, and a few days after operation in 14 animals. The complete series was obtained in five animals and three or more roent-genogiams in the remainder. The area of the cardiac silhouette on each roentgenogram was measured by a <b>polar</b> <b>planimeter.</b> No special efforts were directed toward making the exposure in either s'stole or diastole and it was impossible to distinguish the in...|$|E
40|$|Standard radio {{telemetry}} techniques via triangulation {{were used}} to determine coyote locations and to construct maps of coyote movement patterns in Curlew Valley (Utah and Idaho). Home range sizes were determined by establishing corresponding boundaries drawn on the basis of location, density and relative number of visitations (contour method), and then tracing the boundaries with a compensating <b>polar</b> <b>planimeter.</b> Mean home range sizes were determined directly for only those animals with home range values that reached an asymptote when plotted against corresponding time periods. This asymptotic value was considered the best estimate of the actual home range size. Four adult females and one adult male were in this category, with mean values of 18. 3 km 2 and 14. 5 km 2 respectively. The asymptote was estimated for home ranges which did not stabilize (mean values of 20. 2 and 17. 8 km for adult females and males respectively) using a home range estimator; validation of the estimator is discussed. Since no juvenile animal 2 ̆ 7 s home range appeared to reach an asymptote, no asymptotic estimates were made. Various methods of constructing home range boundaries, their advantages and disadvantages, are listed. Standardization in the home range concept is necessary if meaningful comparisons are to be made between studies. Home ranges are dynamic, and must be considered in terms of specific time frames. Guidelines for adequate description of the home range are discussed with emphasis on quantity of data, time requirements and recognition of seasonal shifts in the home range. Map analysis suggested three general patterns with regard to home ranges; namely, animals with contiguous home range areas, those with disjunct home ranges, and wandering individuals. Fifty percent of the coyotes were trapped more than 0. 5 km outside home range boundaries while an additional 42 percent were trapped {{on the periphery of the}} home range. Only 8 percent, all juveniles, were trapped within their home range. None of the 21 animals killed by hunters or trappers died well within their respective home ranges. Twenty-nine percent were killed on the periphery of their home ranges and 71 percent were killed an average of 11 km outside their home range n·· rl Ties. Several movement patterns other than home range were discernible, including brief excursions away from the home range (sallies), dispersals, and total area utilized. Mean dispersal distances for adul t males, juvenile males and females respectively were 56, 9 and 54 km; no adult female was known to disperse. Juvenile females had the greatest tendency to disperse with 53 percent involved; juvenile males, 33 percent and adult males, 30 percent. Sallies were analyzed according to distance, duration and frequency, with adult females having the longest (4. 9 km) and the greatest number of sallies (7. 9 per month), and adult males spending the most time per sally (16. 2 hours) as well as time per month (72. 9 hours) in sally activity. The total area utilized by coyotes is discussed in terms of size and measurement. Mean values for total areas utilized are 138 km 2 for adult females, 90 km 2 for adult males, 68 km 2 for juvenile males and 46 km 2 for juvenile females. Home range configuration is discussed in terms of importance and variability in form, with the majority of shapes being ameboid in character. Linearity may be a function of the method used to establish home range boundaries and use of baseline data from fixed radio telemetry stations...|$|E
