5000|$|... "Commutation provision" [...] means {{a verbal}} or written agreement, {{whether or not}} {{formally}} incorporated into an insurance or reinsurance policy, that allows the policyholder to commute the policy, usually implying that all liabilities and rights created by that contract are extinguished {{in return for the}} balance of an experience account. Generally provisions such as [...] "profit sharing" [...] or [...] "low claims bonus," [...] which also produce a return of premium that can be reduced by claims payments, are not considered Commutation Provisions if they do not extinguish the contract. Loss-based return and additional <b>premium</b> <b>provisions</b> in conventional loss-based rating plans, e.g., incurred loss retrospectively rated insurance and so-called [...] "retention plans" [...] used commonly in insuring US Workers' Compensation, are generally not considered Commutation Provisions for much the same reason.|$|R

40|$|This {{informal}} paper explores {{models of}} competitive insurance market equilibrium when individuals of initially similar apparent risk experience divergence in risk levels over time. The information structure is modeled in three alternative ways: all insurers and insureds know risk {{at any point}} in time, current insurer and insured know risk, and only the individual knows risk. Insurers always know the average risk. It is shown that some models lead to “backloading” of premiums in which initial premiums are less than initial period expected expense, and that other models lead to “frontloading” of <b>premiums</b> and policy <b>provisions</b> of “guaranteed renewability. ” Finally, it is shown that guaranteed renewability greatly reduces the possibility of adverse selection. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} effort-aversion {{moral hazard}} in banks. When the evaluation and monitoring of loans requires private management effort, monitoring efforts {{are sensitive to}} the intensity of competition in the credit market. Equilibrium loan rates incorporate an oligopoly <b>premium</b> and a <b>provision</b> for bad loans. While competition reduces the oligopoly premium it also reduces monitoring incentives. Therefore, in line with recent evidence from Switzerland, loan provisions increase under deregulation, leaving the overall effect on firms' cost of finance ambiguous. Capital adequacy regulation tends to increase effort-aversion moral hazard. Furthermore it is shown that capital standards may amplify business cycles and, counter-productively, increase systemic risk. The model suggests a certain degree of complementarity between prudential and structural regulation for the banking industry. ...|$|R

The new scheme retains the high accuracy and wide applicability of the MVA method for aggregated traffic while avoiding the high computational complexity in a direct application of the original MVA analysis in real time. This makes it suitable for online measurement applications such as network performance monitoring and measurement-based admission control. Comment: 5 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

50|$|There are {{complaints}} that the standards relating to paying of price <b>premiums,</b> minimum prices, <b>provision</b> of credit, etc. by importers in rich countries are not enforced. In particular importers can demand {{to get a}} higher quality at the same official Fairtrade price, or withhold other services, threatening to buy from another Fairtrade supplier if the exporter did not agree to this kickback, or if the supplier complains that a kickback is demanded. De Janvry, McIntosh and Sadoulet have quantified this for {{a large group of}} Fairtrade coffee cooperatives in South America over a dozen years. They found that this kickback was 10c a pound over a period when the official price premium was 5c or 10c a pound, and this, plus the certification fee, meant that the cooperatives made a loss in years when a premium was payable, and were paid substantially less than the official minimum prices in years when a minimum price was payable. These should have been identified and rectified by the certification agency.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been withholding Medicare premiums from beneficiaries' Social Security payments since the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) program was first enacted in 1965. Beginning in 2006, premium withholding became a payment option for the Medicare Advantage program (Part C) and the new program for Prescription Drug Coverage (Part D). These changes were authorized by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Two federal agencies play critical roles in the premium withholding process: the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and SSA. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) also {{plays an important role}} by disbursing the adjusted Social Security payments to beneficiaries. Premium withholding can make paying premiums easier for both beneficiaries and the insurance plans. However, following implementation of the <b>premium</b> withholding <b>provisions</b> under MMA in 2006, there were numerous reports of beneficiaries not having the correct Parts C and D premiums withheld. Also, about 231, 000 beneficiaries had their premiums refunded erroneously because they were mistakenly identified as having paid excess premiums. As a result, you requested that we review efforts to ensure that the correct Medicare premiums are being withheld from beneficiaries' Social Security payments. Specifically, we sought answers to the following key questions: 1. How do the processes for withholding premiums from Social Security payments compare for the various parts of Medicare? 2. What problems, if any, have been identified with the premium withholding process? 3. What steps have SSA and CMS taken to address these problems?...|$|R
5000|$|The plaintiffs-appellants {{bring this}} suit {{challenging}} {{the validity of}} an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) final rule implementing the <b>premium</b> tax credit <b>provision</b> of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA” or “Act”). The final rule interprets the ACA as authorizing the IRS to grant tax credits to individuals who purchase health insurance on both state-run insurance “Exchanges” and federally facilitated “Exchanges” created and operated by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). The plaintiffs contend that the IRS’s interpretation {{is contrary to the}} language of the statute, which, they assert, authorizes tax credits only for individuals who purchase insurance on state-run Exchanges. For reasons explained below, we find that the applicable statutory language is ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations. Applying deference to the IRS’s determination, however, we uphold the rule as a permissible exercise of the agency’s discretion. ....Rejecting all of the plaintiffs' arguments as to why Chevron deference is inappropriate in this case, for the reasons explained above we are satisfied that the IRS Rule is a permissible construction of the statutory language. We must therefore apply Chevron deference and uphold the IRS Rule....|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} statistical techniques in credit portfolio management, with emphasis on actuarial and risk theoretic pricing and reserving measures. The bank corporate loan portfolio is envisaged as an insurance collective, with margins charged for credit risk forming <b>premium</b> income, <b>provisions</b> made forming claims outgo, and variation over time in provisioning and profitability producing a need for reserves. The research leads to the computation of portfolio specific measures of risk, and suggests that a value-at-risk (VAR) based reserve computation has several advantages over current regulatory reserving methodology in bank capital adequacy regulation (CAR) with respect to non-residential private sector loan portfolios. These latter, current CAR practices are invariably used by banks to compute the respective capital adequacy backing required on loans. A loan pricing model is developed that allocates capital required by reference to observed provisioning rates across a total of 64 differing combinations of rating factors. This represents a statistically rigorous return on risk adjusted capital (RORAC) approach to loan pricing. The suggested approach is illustrated by reference to a particular portfolio of loans. The reserving and pricing measures computed are portfolio specific, but the methodology developed and tested on the specific portfolio (dataset) of loans has a wider, more general applicability. A credit market comprising portfolios which are both more and less risky than the original particular portfolio is hypothesised, and existing regulation is compared to VAR regulation {{in the context of}} the hypothesised credit market. Fewer insolvencies are observed using the VAR framework than under existing regulation, and problem portfolios are identified earlier than under existing regulation. For the particular portfolio of loans, existing algorithm-based loan pricing is compared with the proposed loan pricing model. Significant differences are observed in loan pricing by reference to gearing and collateral, and the elimination of observed inefficiencies in pricing is recommended. Although the proposed model has some limitations, it is argued to be an improvement on existing regulatory and banking practice...|$|R

40|$|Historians of {{industrial}} financing have often adopted a single-firm or single issue approach, emphasising prominent {{companies that have}} bequeathed documentary riches on which detailed studies can be based. However, historians concede that such firms were untypical, as most businesses disappeared leaving liftle trace. Even so, all too little consideration {{has been given to}} the source material that is available, especially to assess the ability of partnerships to generate company finance, whilst aspects of the demand for capital that arose from urbanisation and transport development also remains under-researched. Concentrating on textile Lancashire, this thesis researches lesser-known entrepreneurs between 1770 and 1850 from little-used primary material, studying partnerships as important suppliers of capital. This original approach demonstrates the growing importance of partnerships, particularly amongst non-family firms, exploring the sources of funding they tapped, and comparing share allocations they made. Consideration is also given to investments partnerships made in establishing related enterprises and how they coped with capital withdrawal on a partner's retirement. Investment in Lancashire's infrastructure is analysed partly in relation to the construction and improvement of turnpike roads, matters of considerable importance to manufacturers in transporting products and raw materials and which required high levels of financing. It examines the levels of finance needed for improvements, the sources from which it was drawn, and the role of businessmen in financial management of turnpike trusts. Infrastructural development is also addressed in relation to the construction of the numerous handloom weavers' cottages that were built by terminating building societies. Identifying the membership of these societies reveals that they were not self-help schemes for artisans, but rather that they offered opportunities for those with surplus income to invest in tenanted properties {{at a time when the}} skills of the handloom weaver were at a <b>premium.</b> This <b>provision</b> was vital to Lancashire's burgeoning economy, and offered subscribers an additional source of income. In drawing together the threads of the discussion, new insights are presented to show that the kinds of associations open to them provided a range of investment opportunities for people at different levels of society, who can all be regarded as members of Lancashire's investing classes...|$|R
