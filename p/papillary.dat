5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary <b>papillary</b> renal cancer (<b>papillary</b> renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E
5|$|The valves {{between the}} atria and ventricles {{are called the}} {{atrioventricular}} valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three <b>papillary</b> muscles named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. It {{is also known as}} the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two <b>papillary</b> muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} semilunar valves sit at {{the exit}} {{of each of the}} ventricles. The pulmonary valve is located {{at the base of the}} pulmonary artery. This has three cusps which are not attached to any <b>papillary</b> muscles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. The semilunar aortic valve is at the base of the aorta and also is not attached to <b>papillary</b> muscles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta.|$|E
5|$|A {{second type}} are the intraductal <b>papillary</b> mucinous {{neoplasms}} (IPMNs). These are macroscopic lesions, which {{are found in}} about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to ~10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have KRAS gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, there remains a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.|$|E
5|$|Higher-staged cancers {{are more}} likely to recur, as are those that have invaded the myometrium or cervix, or that have metastasized into the lymphatic system. <b>Papillary</b> serous {{carcinoma}}, clear cell carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma are the subtypes at the highest risk of recurrence. High-grade histological subtypes are also at elevated risk for recurrence.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{lives in}} Worcester with his wife, Lisa Murray McGovern, {{a former aide}} to U.S. Representative Gerry Studds. They have two children, Patrick and Molly. He has two sisters, who are {{teachers}} in the Worcester public school system. In November 2010 he underwent surgery to remove his thyroid gland after being diagnosed with <b>papillary</b> thyroid cancer, from which he has recovered.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{experimental}} therapies for endometrial cancer under research, including immunologic, hormonal, and chemotherapeutic treatments. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), an antibody against the Her2 protein, {{has been used}} in cancers known to be positive for the Her2/neu oncogene, but research is still underway. Immunologic therapies are also under investigation, particularly in uterine <b>papillary</b> serous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|In early 2002, Ebert was {{diagnosed}} with <b>papillary</b> thyroid cancer which was successfully removed in February. In 2003, he underwent surgery for cancer in his salivary gland, which was followed up by radiation treatment. He was again afflicted with cancer in 2006. In June of that year, he had surgery to remove cancerous tissue near his right jaw. A week later he had a life-threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site. He was confined to bed rest {{and was unable to}} speak, eat, or drink for a period of time, necessitating the use of a feeding tube.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and <b>papillary</b> renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are <b>papillary,</b> followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E
5|$|Serous {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied endometrium and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as omental caking) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, <b>papillary</b> structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.|$|E
5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the <b>papillary</b> dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E
5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and <b>papillary</b> renal cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old and men are more likely to develop kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E
25|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} causes MI by the {{combination}} of ischemic dysfunction of the <b>papillary</b> muscles, and the dilatation of the left ventricle. This {{can lead to the}} subsequent displacement of the <b>papillary</b> muscles and the dilatation of the mitral valve annulus.|$|E
25|$|The U wave {{represents}} <b>papillary</b> muscle repolarization.|$|E
25|$|Hereditary {{factors have}} a minor impact on {{individual}} susceptibility with immediate relatives {{of people with}} RCC having a two to fourfold increased risk of developing the condition. Other genetically linked conditions also {{increase the risk of}} RCC, including hereditary <b>papillary</b> renal carcinoma, hereditary leiomyomatosis, Birt–Hogg–Dube syndrome, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, familial <b>papillary</b> thyroid carcinoma, von Hippel–Lindau disease and sickle cell disease.|$|E
25|$|CD10+ differentiates mucinous cystic {{neoplasms}} (CD10+/CK20+) from intraductal <b>papillary</b> mucinous neoplasm of {{branch duct}} type (CD10−/CK20-).|$|E
25|$|It is {{a closely}} related {{condition}} to inflammatory <b>papillary</b> hyperplasia, but the appearance and location differs.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} that miR-181a and miR-181c are overexpressed in <b>Papillary</b> Thyroid Carcinoma tumors, {{sufficiently}} to successfully predict cancer status.|$|E
25|$|Histologically, {{embryonal}} carcinoma appears {{similar to the}} embryonic disc, made up of epithelial, anaplastic cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and <b>papillary</b> structures.|$|E
25|$|When {{the tumor}} cells start {{to move in}} a {{different}} direction — vertically up into the epidermis and into the <b>papillary</b> dermis — cell behaviour changes dramatically.|$|E
25|$|The dermis is {{structurally}} {{divided into}} two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the <b>papillary</b> region, and a deep thicker area known as the reticular region.|$|E
25|$|Acute MI is {{most often}} caused by endocarditis, mainly S. aureus. Rupture or {{dysfunction}} of the <b>papillary</b> muscle are also common causes in acute cases, dysfunction, which can include mitral valve prolapse.|$|E
25|$|The dermis is tightly {{connected}} to the epidermis through a basement membrane and is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the <b>papillary</b> region, and a deep thicker area known as the reticular region.|$|E
25|$|Cholangitis. CD {{also found}} at higher than {{expected}} frequencies in autoimmune cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. CD is frequently linked to pancreatitis {{but also to}} <b>papillary</b> stenosis and, in India, tropical calcific pancreatitis appears also {{to be associated with}} CD.|$|E
25|$|EIN {{should not}} be {{confused}} with an unrelated entity, serous intraepithelial carcinoma ("serous EIC"), which is an early stage of a different tumor type known as <b>papillary</b> serous adenocarcinoma that also occurs in the same location within the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Once suspected, {{analgesic}} nephropathy {{can be confirmed}} with relative accuracy using computed tomography (CT) imaging without contrast. One trial demonstrated that the appearance of <b>papillary</b> calcifications on CT imaging was 92% sensitive and 100% specific for the diagnosis of {{analgesic nephropathy}}.|$|E
25|$|Radioactive Iodine-131 {{is used in}} {{patients}} with <b>papillary</b> or follicular thyroid cancer for ablation of residual thyroid tissue after surgery and {{for the treatment of}} thyroid cancer. Patients with medullary, anaplastic, and most Hurthle cell cancers do not benefit from this therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{scarring}} of {{the small}} blood vessels, called capillary sclerosis, is the initial lesion of analgesic nephropathy. Found in the renal pelvis, ureter, and capillaries supplying the nephrons, capillary sclerosis is thought to lead to renal <b>papillary</b> necrosis and, in turn, chronic interstitial nephritis.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of renal epithelial tumours was debated for decades. The {{debate was}} initiated by Paul Grawitz when in 1883, he published his {{observations on the}} morphology of small, yellow renal tumours. Grawitz concluded that only alveolar tumours were of adrenal origin, whereas <b>papillary</b> tumours were derived from renal tissue.|$|E
25|$|The reticular region lies {{deep in the}} <b>papillary</b> {{region and}} is usually much thicker. It is {{composed}} of dense irregular connective tissue, and receives {{its name from the}} dense concentration of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that weave throughout it. These protein fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity.|$|E
25|$|Wearing lenses {{designed}} for daily wear overnight has {{an increased risk}} for corneal infections, corneal ulcers and corneal neovascularization—this latter condition, once it sets in, cannot be reversed and will eventually spoil vision acuity through diminishing corneal transparency. The most common complication of extended wear is giant <b>papillary</b> conjunctivitis (GPC), sometimes associated with a poorly fitting contact lens.|$|E
25|$|By overall cancer staging into stages I to IV, the 5-year {{survival}} rate is 100% at stage I, 98% at stage II, 81% at stage III and 28% at stage IV. The prognosis of MTC is poorer {{than that of}} follicular and <b>papillary</b> thyroid cancer when it has metastasized (spread) beyond the thyroid gland.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} kidney injuries {{induced by}} analgesics are renal <b>papillary</b> necrosis and chronic interstitial nephritis. They appear {{to result from}} decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidney, rapid consumption of antioxidants, and subsequent oxidative damage to the kidney. This kidney damage may lead to progressive chronic kidney failure, abnormal urinalysis results, high blood pressure, and anemia. A small proportion of individuals with analgesic nephropathy may develop end-stage kidney disease.|$|E
25|$|High risk: atrial {{fibrillation}} and paroxysmal {{atrial fibrillation}}, rheumatic {{disease of the}} mitral or aortic valve disease, artificial heart valves, known cardiac thrombus of the atrium or ventricle, sick sinus syndrome, sustained atrial flutter, recent myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial infarction together with ejection fraction <28 percent, symptomatic congestive heart failure with ejection fraction <30 percent, dilated cardiomyopathy, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, Marantic endocarditis, infective endocarditis, <b>papillary</b> fibroelastoma, left atrial myxoma and {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors include}} {{radiation}} exposure {{at a young}} age, having an enlarged thyroid, and family history. There are four main types – <b>papillary</b> thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Diagnosis is often based on ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Screening people without symptoms and at normal risk for the disease is not recommended as of 2017. Fukushima, Kyshtym, and Windscale nuclear disasters. Thyroiditis and other thyroid diseases also predispose to thyroid cancer.|$|E
