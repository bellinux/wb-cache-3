In {{order to}} reduce the random noise {{influence}} on local wave decomposition(LWD), the original data is adaptively denoised by lifting wavelet transform to strain mode aliasing in LWD, avoid the <b>pseudo</b> <b>mode</b> functions in LWD and improve the quality of LWD. Local wave marginal spectrum is employed to analyze vibration signal for extracting the characteristics information. Intrinsic mode functions obtained by LWD, the instantaneous frequency and amplitude can be calculated by the Hilbert transform. The improved local wave analysis can offer a measure of the energy distribution of vibration signal from its instantaneous frequency. Analysis and experimental result demonstrate the validity of the proposed method...|$|E

The atomic transitions are coupled to a discrete set of (cavity) quasimodes, which are also coupled to a continuum set of (external) quasimodes with slowly varying coupling constants. Each pseudomode corresponds to a cavity quasimode, and the original reservoir structure is obtained in expressions for the equivalent atom-true mode coupling constants. Cases of multiple excitation of the reservoir are now treatable via Markovian master equations for the atom-discrete quasimode system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present work {{deals with}} Rayleigh surface {{acoustic}} waves in ZnO, piezoelectric material widely used {{in the development of}} varied electronic devices. It is about applying the method ODE “ordinary differential equation” to determine the features of the answer of ZnO to a particular excitation, in absence and in presence of piezoelectricity. The piezoactive mode is put thus in evidence. The representation of the stress field and of the density of the different implied energy forms according to the depth permits the appreciation of the piezoelectric effect. The obtained results are compared to the accessible coupling coefficient by application of the electrical and mechanical limit conditions. This study is achieved for several configurations where the sixth fold axis occupies a variable position in relation to the sagittal plane. The configuration for which the Rayleigh velocity is the highest is put in evidence, the investigation of the <b>pseudo</b> <b>mode</b> is excluded of this work...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA spontaneously broken global {{discrete}} symmetry {{may have}} <b>pseudo</b> Goldstone <b>modes</b> {{associated with the}} spontaneous breaking of the approximate continuous symmetry of the low dimension terms in the Lagrangian. These provide natural candidates for an inflaton that can generate slow-roll inflation. We show that, {{in the case of}} a non-Abelian discrete symmetry, the <b>pseudo</b> Goldstone <b>modes</b> readily couple to further scalar fields in a manner that the end of inflation is determined by these additional scalar fields, generating hybrid inflation. We give a simple parameterisation of the inflationary potential in this case, determine the inflationary parameters resulting, and show that phenomenological successful inflation is possible while keeping the scale of symmetry breaking sub-Planckian. Unlike natural inflation the inflation scale can be very low. We construct two simple hybrid inflation models, one non-supersymmetric and one supersymmetric. In the latter case no parameters need be chosen anomalously small...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} more {{complete}} description of the design process of the Center Support Quadruple Mass Gyroscope (CSQMG), a gyro expected to provide breakthrough performance for flat structures. The operation of the CSQMG is based on four lumped masses in a circumferential symmetric distribution, oscillating in anti-phase motion, and providing differential signal extraction. With its 4 -fold symmetrical axes pattern, the CSQMG achieves a similar operation mode to Hemispherical Resonant Gyroscopes (HRGs). Compared to the conventional flat design, four Y-shaped coupling beams are used in this new pattern in order to adjust mode distribution and enhance the synchronization mechanism of operation modes. For the purpose of obtaining the optimal design of the CSQMG, a kind of applicative optimization flow is developed with a comprehensive derivation of the operation mode coordination, the <b>pseudo</b> <b>mode</b> inhibition, and the lumped mass twisting motion elimination. The experimental characterization of the CSQMG was performed at room temperature, and the center operation frequency is 6. 8 kHz after tuning. Experiments show an Allan variance stability 0. 12 °/h (@ 100 s) and a white noise level about 0. 72 °/h/√Hz, {{which means that the}} CSQMG possesses great potential to achieve navigation grade performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of using topology optimization {{as a tool}} to optimize the passive constrained layer damping (PCLD) layouts with partial coverage on flat plates is investigated. The objective function is defined as a combination of several modal loss factors solved by finite element-modal strain energy (FE-MSE) method. An interface finite element is introduced to modeling the viscoelastic core of PCLD patch to save the computational space and time in the optimization procedure. Solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method is used as the material interpolation scheme and the parameters are well selected to avoid local <b>pseudo</b> <b>modes.</b> Then, the method of moving asymptote (MMA) is employed as an optimizer to search the optimal topologies of PCLD patch on plates.

We solve the Schrödinger equation for cubic lattices with two different dots per unit cell: i) two different circular dots and ii) two elliptical dots, which are rotated by 90 ^o relative to each other. The interaction between the dots is considered in dipole approximation and long [...] wavelength excitation spectra including FIR intensities are calculated. The energy spectrum of the first case can be expressed as a superposition of two noninteracting dots with an effective confinement frequency, which includes the effect of dot interaction. Only in the second case a splitting of degenerate absorption lines (versus magnetic field) occurs, which is a qualitative indication for interdot interaction.

Most BCIs employ a machine-learning algorithm which analyzes brain data in real time and provides users with feedback.

40|$|We {{argue that}} the origin of Poincaré gauge gravity (PGG) {{may be related to}} {{spontaneous}} violation of underlying spacetime symmetries involved and appearance of gauge fields as vector Goldstone bosons. In essence, we start with an arbitrary theory of some vector and fermion fields which possesses only global spacetime symmetries, such as Lorentz and translational invariance, in flat Minkowski space. The two vector field multiplets involved are assumed to belong, respectively, to the adjoint (Aμij) and vector (eμi) representations of the starting global Lorentz symmetry. We propose that these prototype vector fields are covariantly constrained, AμijAijμ=±MA 2 and eμieiμ=±Me 2, that causes a spontaneous violation of the accompanying global symmetries (MA,e are their presumed violation scales). It then follows that the only possible theory compatible with these length-preserving constraints is {{turned out to be the}} gauge invariant PGG, while the corresponding massless (<b>pseudo)</b> Goldstone <b>modes</b> are naturally collected in the emergent gauge fields of tetrads and spin-connections.

Pseudo continuous {{operation of the}} SFE system was validated by producing clove volatile oil at 40 degrees C and 15 MPa. To obtain tocotrienols, the system was operated in <b>pseudo</b> continuous <b>mode</b> at 40 degrees C, 20 MPa and CO 2 flow rate of 20. 7 g/min. The extraction time, from a technical perspective, was set to 60 min, according to kinetic parameters obtained from an overall extraction curve (OEC) with processing time of 360 min. OECs were initially measured in batch mode (BM) and the kinetic parameters for the constant extraction rate (CER) period were determined to be lengths of the CER period (t(CER)) equal to 43 +/- 11 and 42 +/- 2 min for E- 1 and E- 2, respectively; mass transfer rates (M-CER) of 0. 22 +/- 10. 01 g/min for both E- 1 and E- 2; and total yields (R-CER) of 50 +/- 1 and 49 +/- 1 g of extract/ 100 g of extractable mass for E- 1 and E- 2, respectively. No differences were observed between each group of kinetic parameters (t(CER); M-CER; R-CER) obtained in BM. Following the measurement of OECs, the SFE system was operated in <b>pseudo</b> continuous <b>mode</b> for four extraction stages of 60 min each with the extractors organized in parallel. This organization improved the productivity of the process. We also proposed the integration of SFE with low-pressure solvent extraction (LPSE) using water and ethanol as solvents to remove bixin from the defatted annatto seeds. LPSE conditions were: 60 degrees C and solvent mass to feed mass ratio (S/F) of 8 gsolvent/g annatto for ethanol and 50 degrees C and S/F of 8 gsolvent/g annatto for water. LPSE assays were performed in an agitated bed over a 95 min time period. Using partially defatted annatto seeds as the feedstock for LPSE resulted in increased bixin extraction. LPSE with ethanol was found to increase the bixin content in the extract. Thus, the proposed process integration appears to be useful, mainly due to three aspects: (1) the initial removal of the oil layer via supercritical CO 2 favors bixin extraction, (2) LPSE is a low-cost methodology for extracting bixin and (3) the cost of raw material in the second step is null.

The most interesting peculiarity, the existence of two compressional waves, was first predicted by Biot [1] in 1956. It was not until 1980 that Plona [2] experimentally observed the additional slow compressional bulk wave in a water-saturated porous solid composed of sintered glass spheres. Even more recently, Feng and Johnson [3] have extended the Biot theory to numerically predict the velocities of a new surface mode {{as well as the}} expected pseudo Rayleigh and <b>pseudo</b> Stoneley <b>modes</b> at fluid-porous solid (i. e. fluid/fluid-saturated porous solid) interface. The expected modes are either below the fluid velocity, so that energy will not leak into the fluid at all, or just above it so that energy leaks at such a high angle, in which case simple phase-matching techniques are not applicable for excitation and detection. In a recent paper [4], the authors suggested the application of a slightly corrugated periodic surface, since, in this case every surface mode becomes somewhat “leaky” in certain directions at particular resonant frequencies.
