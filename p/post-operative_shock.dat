5000|$|Peter Purves Smith was hospitalised in 1948, {{and later}} drafted to the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital for major lung surgery. He died of <b>post-operative</b> <b>shock</b> the next day, 23 July 1949, and was cremated. Despite his small [...] {{of less than}} 100 {{paintings}} and posthumous descent into relative obscurity, Purves Smith emerged as a celebrated artist—influencing many of his contemporaries—and has been recognised as [...] "the first of the young modern artists to look inquiringly at the Australianness of country life". His use of surreal elements, colloquial themes and at times biting satire set precedent {{for the work of}} the Melbourne-based Angry Penguins in the mid to late 1940s. Two retrospective exhibitions were held in Melbourne: one at the Stanley Coe Gallery in 1950, and the other at the Joseph Brown Gallery in 1976. A touring exhibition of his work commenced in 2001 following the publication of Mary Eagle's biography Peter Purves Smith: A Painter in Peace and War.|$|E
30|$|The {{demographics}} studied include age, gender, race, Deyo index, {{and type}} of insurance {{as reported in the}} NIS dataset. Using ICD- 9 procedure codes, patients that underwent either ORIF (79.31) or arthroplasty (reverse 81.88, total 81.80, partial 81.81) following open proximal humerus fractures were grouped into the corresponding subset. In-hospital complications were grouped based on related sets of diagnoses as follows: infection, post-hemorrhagic anemia, cardiac complications, respiratory complications, device-related complications, <b>post-operative</b> <b>shock,</b> hematoma formation, pulmonary insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and any complication. Any complication was defined as the occurrence of at least one complication. Length of hospital stay, total cost of stay, and mortality were also reported.|$|E
30|$|Results: A {{total of}} {{respectively}} 889 (6.9  %) over 85  yrs. and 11966 [*]<[*] 85  yrs patients were found. The 30 th day overall mortality was 4.3  % {{higher in the}} over 85  yrs. Same difference was confirmed after stratifying patients according type of HS, particularly in case of combined and aorta surgery. A Cox´s proportional model found the following variables (out the 32 considered) as predictors of 30 th day death: (i) pre-operative chronic renal failure [HR: 1.826, (95  % CI: 1.141 - 2.933) p[*]=[*] 0.012]; (ii) vasculopathy [HR: 2.088, (95 %CI: 1.396 - 3.125) p[*]<[*] 0.0001]; (iii) aorta disease [HR: 2.512, (95  % CI: 1.489 - 4.238) p[*]=[*] 0.001)]; (iv) pre-operative cardiogenic shock [HR: 7.654, (95  % CI: 2.327 - 25.17) p[*]=[*] 0.001]; (v) <b>post-operative</b> septic <b>shock</b> [HR: 5.410 (95  % CI: 2.459 - 11.90) p[*]<[*] 0.0001]. Surprisingly age ≥ 85 [HR 1.576, (95  % CI: 0.843 - 2.915) p[*]=[*] 0.156] was not confirmed as a variable significantly affecting the mortality. The age interaction with the predictors was tested without finding any statistical significance or model modifications.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 106 - 112). Measures of {{the severity}} of metabolic acidosis (base excess) and of {{the severity of}} the underlying acid-base derangements (levels of lactate, chloride, albumin, and strong ion gap) have been used to differentiate survivors from nonsurvivors in various types of adult critical illness, including states of severe hamodynamic compromise following cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and in septic shock. prognostic studies of acid-base data for critically ill children in the settings of <b>post-operative</b> cardiogenci <b>shock</b> and septic shock are relatively scarce. It has been suggested that hyperchloraemia migh be a benign phenomenon that should not prompt escalation of therapy. Although it is recognised that hypoalbuminaemia is associated with adverse outcome, and obscrues the extent of underlying metabolic acidosis, the significance of 'unmeasured' anions estimated from the strong ion gap remains controversial. It has been suggested that the admission lactate level is strongly predictive of paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) outcome in both shock states, but it is not known whether calculation of the lactate: pyruvate ratio would add prognostic value in children with either post-operative cardiogenic, or septic shock...|$|R
40|$|The {{immediate}} {{objective of}} these experiments {{is the best}} possible substitute or supplement for plasma or whole blood as used in the clinic to combat <b>shock,</b> <b>post-operative</b> difficulties, and lack of absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract. The long term objective is {{a better understanding of}} the utilization and replacement of the blood proteins and their interrelation with other body proteins. We prefer to think of a body protein pool which includes blood proteins, cell proteins, and reserve store proteins, a poolwithin which there is constant interchange, the plasma protein acting as an active intermediary. It is well established (2, 7) that plasma protein as whole plasma given by vein to the dog can supply all the protein requirements of the body over considerable periods of time. Therefore, it is logical to test these anemic andhypoproteinemic dogs with plasma by vein and with serum digests (Table 1). Assuming that whole plasma is the very best material to supply protein to the human body tissues whether normal or abnormal (shock, tissue injury, etc.), this human plasma is limited as to supply and is costly. It should be possibl...|$|R
30|$|Descriptive {{analysis}} was used to characterize the open proximal humerus fracture population. Patients were stratified based on the surgical repair; ORIF patients comprised the first group, while total, hemi, and reverse arthroplasty patients were combined into a second group. Independent sample t-tests were employed to evaluate variation of continuous variables such as age, Deyo index, and total hospital cost between the two groups. Accordingly, chi-square {{analysis was}} used to evaluate the potential association between gender, race, insurance type, and surgical procedure. In evaluating complications between patients that underwent ORIF or arthroplasty, Chi-square analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential variation between the surgical groups on the basis of infection, post-hemorrhagic anemia, cardiac complications, respiratory complications, device-related complications, <b>post-operative</b> <b>shock,</b> hematoma formation, pulmonary insufficiency, DVT, any in-hospital complication and mortality.|$|E
40|$|Micafungin is an {{antimycotic}} {{drug and}} represents an important {{addition to the}} available therapies {{for the treatment of}} systemic fungal infections. Micafungin is used in the treatment of invasive candidiasis, oesophageal and prophylaxis of Candida infections. It inhibits, in a non-competitive way, the synthesis of 1, 3 -b-D-glucan, a component of fungal cell wall and is rapidly distributed into the tissues. It has a high-rate bond with respect to plasma protein; the above mentioned bond is independent from the concentration of the drug. It is metabolized through the liver, being not subject to intense metabolic transformations until the excretion. There is no evidence of systemic accumulation after repeated use and the steady-state is reached in 4 - 5 days. Medical records examined at the State Hospital Pharmacy of Marsala, highlights that, from 01. 06. 2014 to 01. 08. 2014, in this hospital 12 vials were used by the patients hospitalized in the department of Intensive Care: 8 patients are aged between 75 and 83 and have a body weight higher than 40 kg; 3 patients are aged between 40 and 60 and have a body weight higher than 40 kg and 1 patient has an age equal to 17 years and has a body weight equal to 40 kg. Two patients need a dose increase, for the others 10 patients the first dose resulted sufficient. Mycamine was used for the treatment of hypovolemic <b>post-operative</b> <b>shock.</b> The most frequently recorded adversereactions were anaemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, phlebitis, nausea, liver problems. Given the different weight of the subjects, the dosage was different...|$|E
