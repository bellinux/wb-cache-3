5|$|The {{political}} corruption which had grown considerably during Brezhnev's tenure {{had become a}} major <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s. In response, Andropov initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign. Andropov believed that the Soviet economy could possibly recover if the government were able to increase social discipline amongst workers. Brezhnev was seen as very vain and self-obsessed, but was praised for leading the Soviet Union into an unprecedented age of stability and domestic calm.|$|E
5|$|This caused Blamey to {{despatch}} {{a medical}} mission headed by Fairley to the United States and the United Kingdom in September 1942 {{to present the}} Army's case for a more adequate and equitable share of anti-malarial supplies. The mission was successful. Fairley was able to secure supplies and expedite the delivery of those that were already on order but held up for lack of shipping or priority. In bringing the <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of the highest allied military and civil authorities overseas, he lifted the global profile and priority of malaria control measures.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} {{has been}} introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park, street or garden. These include the United States, Canada, Australia (Victoria and Tasmania), Chile and New Zealand, Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores. At {{the time of its}} introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds might one day cause a <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landscape as it spread and out-competed native species. The tree is now considered to be an environmental weed in some parts of Australia (Yarra Ranges, Victoria) and also Mount Macedon, near Daylesford, parts of the Dandenong Ranges, where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests. The sycamore is also scattered in north-eastern Tasmania and also at Taroona, near the Derwent River, in southern Hobart. It is considered to be an invasive species in New Zealand, Norway, and environmentally sensitive locations in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Åland is a {{collection}} of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between Sweden and Finland. The islands are almost exclusively Swedish-speaking, but in 1809, the Åland Islands, along with Finland, were taken by Imperial Russia. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution, Finland declared its independence, but most of the Ålanders wished to rejoin Sweden. The Finnish government considered the islands {{to be a part of}} their new nation, as the Russians had included Åland in the Grand Duchy of Finland, formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created. In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.|$|E

25|$|A similar <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> one {{considered}} {{appears in}} the physics of normal-metal superconductor interfaces. Quasiparticles are scattered at the pair potential which in the simplest model may be assumed to have a step-like shape. The solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation resembles that of the discussed Heaviside-step potential. In the superconductor normal-metal case this gives rise to Andreev reflection.|$|E
25|$|The Ammonites {{presented}} a serious <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pharisees because many marriages between Israelite men and Ammonite (and Moabite) women {{had taken place}} in the days of Nehemiah.

The legitimacy of David's claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from Ruth, the Moabite.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{differential}} equations are solved by first discretizing the equation, bringing {{it into a}} finite-dimensional subspace.

This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours.|$|E
