25|$|A study {{performed}} by Maclean and colleagues introduced pure vaporized salvinorin-A to four subjects demonstrated a {{relative lack of}} dysphoric effects and increased presence of dose-related positive effects that contrasts with previous research with kappa agonists such as enadoline, as well as Salvia Divinorum itself. However, this {{could be due to}} the small sample size, the relative <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience</b> of the subjects, or the route of administration.|$|E
25|$|The Castalia Foundation hosted weekend retreats on {{the estate}} where people paid to undergo the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience</b> without drugs, through meditation, yoga, and group therapy sessions. The Castalia Foundation adopted some of the mystic teachings of Gurjieff for their non-drug workshops. During 1965 Castalia Foundation members collaborated with artists, {{including}} the media art collective USCO (The Company of US), to reproduce the LSD experience in improvised audio-visual psychedelic shows in Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|Hypnodelic therapy, as {{the name}} suggests, was {{developed}} with the goal to maximize the power of hypnotic suggestion by combining it with the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience.</b> After training the patient to respond to hypnosis, LSD would be administered, and during the onset phase of the drug the patient would be placed {{into a state of}} trance. Levine and Ludwig found the combination of these techniques to be more effective than the use of either of these two components separately.|$|E
25|$|For {{this video}} work, Andreyev uses audio and visual {{representations}} of her canine companion Tom {{to speculate on}} his subjective and emotional experience traveling in a car by examining {{the notion that a}} canine's sense of smell is a locus for heightened sensitivity and empirical intelligence. The visuals refer to a <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience,</b> metaphorically representing Tom's experience. The visuals are accompanied by a soundscape constructed from studio recordings of Tom's voice and car engine sounds to create connotative rhythmic and harmonic modes.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} Greenwich Village in New York City and Berkeley, California {{anchored}} the American folk music circuit. Berkeley's two coffee houses, the Cabale Creamery and the Jabberwock, sponsored performances by folk music artists in a beat setting. In April 1963, Chandler A. Laughlin III, {{co-founder of the}} Cabale Creamery, established a kind of tribal, family identity among approximately fifty people who attended a traditional, all-night Native American peyote ceremony in a rural setting. This ceremony combined a <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience</b> with traditional Native American spiritual values; these people went on to sponsor a unique genre of musical expression and performance at the Red Dog Saloon in the isolated, old-time mining town of Virginia City, Nevada.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante's tenth solo album, The Empyrean, was {{released}} on January 20, 2009 through Record Collection. The record—a concept album—was in production between December 2006 and March 2008. The Empyrean features an array of musicians including Frusciante's ex-Chili Peppers bandmate Flea, friends Josh Klinghoffer and former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, as well as guest musicians including Sonus Quartet and New Dimension Singers. Frusciante stated: [...] "I'm really happy with [...] and I've listened to it {{a lot for the}} <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience</b> it provides," [...] suggesting the album is [...] "to be played as loud as possible and is suited to dark living rooms late at night." ...|$|E
500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was {{promoted}} with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience.</b> Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people [...] "thought we were on a trip when we made it... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask us what we were on." [...] The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping. Fantasia was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.|$|E

500|$|John Lennon {{wrote the}} song in January 1966, with lyrics adapted from the book [...] by Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert, and Ralph Metzner, which was in turn adapted from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Although Peter Brown {{believed}} that Lennon's source for the lyrics was the Tibetan Book of the Dead itself, which, he said, Lennon had read whilst {{under the influence of}} LSD, George Harrison later stated that the idea for the lyrics came from Leary, Alpert, and Metzner's book; Paul McCartney confirmed this, stating that when he and Lennon visited the newly opened Indica bookshop, Lennon had been looking for a copy of The Portable Nietzsche and found a copy of The <b>Psychedelic</b> <b>Experience</b> that contained the lines: [...] "Whenever in doubt, turn off your mind, relax, float downstream".|$|E
500|$|After Bryant and Scott {{departed}} the project, director Philip Kaufman {{tried to}} re-write the story, with the resulting treatment heavily inspired by Olaf Stapledon's books Last and First Men and Star Maker. He later described this version as being [...] "less 'cult-ish' {{and more of}} an adult movie, dealing with sexuality and wonders rather than oddness". He intended this version to feature Spock facing off against a Klingon nemesis, A role for whom Kaufman wanted Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Kaufman explained {{that it would have}} featured the two undergoing a <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience</b> and summed it up by saying that [...] "I'm sure the fans would have been upset, but I felt it could really open up a new type of science fiction." [...] While Povill had felt that Bryant and Scott's treatment was unsuccessful, he thought that Kaufman's was worse.|$|E
500|$|Taylor later {{expressed}} amusement at {{how some}} commentators interpreted [...] "don't be long" [...] as meaning [...] "don't belong" [...] – {{a message to}} Western youth {{to opt out of}} society – and at how the line [...] "And my friends have lost their way" [...] supposedly conveyed the idea that [...] "a whole generation had lost direction". With regard to whether Harrison was telling contemporary listeners not to [...] "belong", Inglis writes, this [...] "alternative reading" [...] of the song aligned with Timothy Leary's catchphrase for the 1960s American <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience,</b> [...] "Turn on, tune in, drop out". In Gould's opinion, the continual repetition of the line at the end of [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] transforms the words into [...] "a plea for nonattachment – 'don't belong'". Rather than attaching any countercultural significance to this, however, Gould views it as the Beatles repeating the wordplay first used in the chorus of Lennon's 1963 song [...] "It Won't Be Long".|$|E
5000|$|At {{this time}} he {{had a series of}} <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experiences</b> that helped to shape his further goals and research, the first of which was brought on by mescaline."I first {{explored}} mescaline in the late '50s.... Three-hundred-fifty to 400 milligrams. I learned {{there was a great deal}} inside me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Leary's {{terminology}} {{influenced the}} understanding and {{description of the}} effects of psychedelics. Various reports by hippies of their <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experiences</b> describe states of diminished consciousness which were labelled as [...] "ego death", but do not match Leary's descriptions. Panic attacks were occasionally also labeled as [...] "ego death".|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{distinctly}} gnosis-like quality to <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experiencing,</b> it is {{a learning experience}} that elevates consciousness and makes a profound contribution to personal development. For this reason, the plant sources of some psychedelic drugs such as ayahuasca and psilocybin mushrooms are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "plant teachers".|$|R
500|$|Although Yellow Submarine has {{attained}} {{the status}} of a classic children's animated film, many Beatles biographers consider the band's post-Sgt. Pepper 1967 recordings to be substandard work. Among these authors, Mark Hertsgaard cites Martin's view that the soundtrack album was made up of [...] "bottom of the barrel" [...] material and dismisses [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] as [...] "little more than formless shrieking". Ian MacDonald also holds the track in low regard, describing it as a [...] "protracted exercise in drug-mesmerised G-pedal monotony". Discussing the lyrics, particularly the line [...] "Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea", MacDonald considers the song to be [...] "the locus classicus of English psychedelia" [...] and he comments that in Britain, unlike in America, [...] "tradition, nature, and the child's-eye-view were the things which sprang most readily to the LSD-heightened Anglo-Saxon mind." [...] Author and journalist Graham Reid highlights the same line as being the British equivalent of [...] "Tune in, turn on, drop out", the phrase coined by Timothy Leary that came to define the American <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Californian-based folk acts {{followed}} the Byrds into folk-rock, bringing their psychedelic influences with them, {{to produce the}} [...] "San Francisco Sound". The San Francisco music scene developed in the city's Haight-Asbury neighborhood in 1965 at basement shows organised by Chet Helms of the Family Dog; and as Jefferson Airplane founder Marty Balin and investors opened The Matrix nightclub that summer and began booking his and other local bands, such as the Grateful Dead, The Steve Miller Band and Country Joe & the Fish. Helms and San Francisco Mime Troupe manager Bill Graham in fall of 1965 organised larger scale multi-media community events/benefits featuring the Airplane, the Diggers and poet Alan Ginsberg. By early 1966 Graham had secured booking at The Fillmore, and Helms at the Avalon Ballroom, where in-house psychedelic-themed light shows replicated the visual effects of the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience.</b> Graham would become a major figure {{in the growth of}} psychedelic rock, attracting most of the major psychedelic rock bands of the day to The Fillmore.|$|E
500|$|Many {{fans and}} the press {{interpret}} the song as referring to a <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience</b> due to lines such as [...] "purple haze all in my brain" [...] and [...] "'scuse me while I kiss the sky". [...] However, Hendrix and those closest to him never discussed any connection between psychedelic drugs and the song, although Shapiro admits that, at the time, {{to do so would}} have been [...] "professional suicide". Chandler, who claimed he was present when Hendrix wrote it, later denied suggestions that Hendrix did so while under the influence of psychedelics. [...] Commenting on the lyrics, Shadwick concludes [...] "the music [...] to tell the larger story. [...] Poised effectively between the twin intoxicants of drugs and desire, they could be interpreted to the listener's taste". [...] In concert, Hendrix sometimes substituted lyrics for comic effect; [...] "'scuse me while I kiss the sky" [...] was rendered [...] "'scuse me while I kiss this guy" [...] (while gesturing towards Mitchell), [...] "'scuse me while I kiss that policeman" [...] (at a near riot in Los Angeles), or [...] "'scuse me while I fuck the sky" [...] (during a downpour in Seattle).|$|E

50|$|Set {{and setting}} {{describes}} {{the context for}} psychoactive and particularly psychedelic drug experiences: one's mindset (shortened to 'set') and the physical and social environment (the setting) in which the user has the experience.

The term was coined by Norman Zinberg, and became widely accepted by researchers in psychedelic therapy.|$|R
500|$|The {{combination}} of blues rock with psychedelic rock and acid rock formed {{much of the}} original basis for heavy metal. The variant or subgenre of psychedelic rock often known as [...] "acid rock" [...] was particularly influential on heavy metal; acid rock is often defined as a heavier, louder, or harder variant of psychedelic rock, or the more extreme side of the psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and heavily distorted guitar-centered sound. Acid rock {{has been described as}} psychedelic rock at its [...] "rawest and most intense," [...] emphasizing the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience</b> rather than only the idyllic side of psychedelia. American acid rock garage bands such as the 13th Floor Elevators epitomized the frenetic, heavier, darker and more psychotic sound of acid rock, a sound characterized by droning guitar riffs, amplified feedback, and guitar distortion, while the 13th Floor Elevators' sound in particular featured yelping vocals and [...] "occasionally demented" [...] lyrics. Frank Hoffman notes that: [...] "Psychedelia was sometimes referred to as 'acid rock'. The latter label was applied to a pounding, hard rock variant that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage-punk movement. ... When rock began turning back to softer, roots-oriented sounds in late 1968, acid-rock bands mutated into heavy metal acts." ...|$|E
500|$|Almendra {{was formed}} in the Porteño barrio of Núñez in Buenos Aires. Luis Alberto Spinetta and Emilio del Guercio became friends while {{attending}} the San Román high school in Belgrano. They published a magazine, La costra degenerada, with their own articles and drawings and shared common interests and points of view about music, sex, power and religion. Spinetta was {{a fan of the}} Beatles, but del Guercio was more interested in folk music. They were inspired by surrealism and the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience,</b> although they had not used drugs at that point. Edelmiro Molinari and del Guercio were in a band called Los Sbirros — making cover versions of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Shadows and Los Teen Tops — along with Ángel del Guercio, Ricardo Miró, Santiago [...] "Chago" [...] Novoa and Eduardo Miró (later replaced by del Guercio). [...] Spinetta had joined Los Larkins, where Rodolfo García was the drummer. Spinetta and García then joined Los Masters, a band led by Guido Meda; the group had a succession of names, including Los Beadniks, Los Beatniks and Los Mods. The groups merged, although Meda disliked the idea and stepped aside. Almendra was ready to start playing, but García had to serve in the military and they waited a year until he returned. At this embryonic stage Spinetta had composed [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] and [...] "Zamba", a song he would record in 1982 as [...] "Barro tal vez".|$|E
2500|$|Terence McKenna {{advocated}} {{the exploration of}} altered states of mind via the ingestion of naturally occurring psychedelic substances; for example, and in particular, as facilitated by the ingestion of high doses of psychedelic mushrooms, ayahuasca, and DMT, which he believed was the apotheosis of the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} practitioner in {{this field}} is Stanislav Grof, who pioneered the use of LSD in psychotherapy. Grof characterised <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experiencing</b> as [...] "non-specific amplification of unconscious mental processes", and he analysed the phenomenology of the LSD experience (particularly the experience of psychospiritual death and rebirth) in terms of Otto Rank's theory of the unresolved memory of the primal birth trauma.|$|R
5000|$|Alan Watts had a {{profound}} influence on the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experiences</b> of the beats and the early hippies. His opening statement on mystical experiences in This Is It draws parallels with Richard Bucke's Cosmic Consciousness, describing the [...] "central core" [...] of the experience as ... the conviction, or insight, that the immediate now, whatever its nature, is the goal and fulfillment of all living.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1990s, Rick Strassman and {{his colleagues}} {{conducted}} a five year long DMT study at the University of New Mexico. The results provided insight {{about the quality of}} subjective <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experiences.</b> In this study participants received the DMT dosage intravenously via injection and the findings suggested that different <b>psychedelic</b> <b>experiences</b> can occur, depending on the level of dosage. Lower doses (0.01 and 0.05mg/kg, read [...] "mg DMT per kg body weight") produced somaesthetic and emotional responses, but not hallucinogenic experiences (e.g., 0.05mg/kg had mild mood elevating and calming properties). In contrast, higher doses (0.2 and 0.4mg/kg) researchers labeled as [...] "hallucinogenic" [...] that elicited [...] "intensely colored, rapidly moving display of visual images, formed, abstract or both". Comparing to other sensory modalities the most affected was visual domain. Participants reported visual hallucinations, less auditory hallucinations and specific physical sensation progressing to a sense of bodily dissociation, as well as experiences of euphoria, calm, fear, and anxiety.|$|R
