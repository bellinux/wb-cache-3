40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{what are}} the possible interactions between antidumping and competition policies within Mercosur given the main objectives and challenges of the regional agreement. Taking into account the respective advantages and drawbacks of the analysed models it proposes a method for the progressive elimination of antidumping duties within Mercosur through the gradual insertion of competition policy principles in national antidumping proceedings. The topic is particularly important since the application of antidumping duties in a customs union is incompatible with the main objectives {{of this type of}} regional agreement, with provisions set forth in the World Trade Organisation and because they essentially represent a <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practice</b> with unsound economic justification. Furthermore, the use of these trade measures represents a recurrent source of tension between Brazil and Argentina, given its widespread use by the latter country against the former...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the influence of lobbies on the choice of a country’s trade policy. The existence of several illegal financings of electoral campaigns has led us to ask questions about the proliferation of <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices.</b> Indeed, there are sources of illegal financing such as bribes for granting a commitment to a tariff protection of a lobby’s interests. A new conception attempts to show that the political players are the main responsible for the adoption of a <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policy: the political players, who are financed by companies during their electoral campaigns, should keep their promises vis-à-vis these companies by raising excise duties or adopting unfair trade policies such as export subsidies. Lobbying is able to disrupt international trade negotiations by exerting pressure on its government and obliging it to take a decision that does not comply with the rules of international trade. International trade negotiations taking place within the GATT are often disturbed by political issues: the political and social pressures have continued ravaging the international trade negotiations. The best known example is the problem of agricultural subsidies between the EU and the United States. To solve the problems related the control of political spending, we assumed the existence of a monitoring body that is called (ICCERGI) (Independent Commission for the Control of Elections and Research of General Interest) which plays the role of "Principal". The aim of the latter is to control the operations that take place between political parties and interest groups, that we called the "Agents". </p...|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, {{in eastern}} Tennessee, a car {{accident}} involving two Japanese-made vehicles leads {{to the deaths of}} six people. Revelations about manufacturing and shipping errors that led to the deaths stir long-standing resentment against Japan's <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policies. As trade negotiations between the United States and Japan grind to a halt, Congress passes a law enabling the U.S. to mirror the <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> of the countries from which it imports goods. The bill is immediately used to reciprocate Japan's non-tariff barriers, cutting off the U.S. export markets upon which the Japanese economy depends.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{evolution}} of thought regarding <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policies in developed and in developing countries is examined and contrasted. In the developing countries distrust of markets and {{a belief in the}} infant industry argument led to highly <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> regimes. The consequences were so negative that thinking about interventions has changed markedly. The lessons from this experience for the policy implications of the "new trade theory" are then examined. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine whether}} <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> {{policies}} {{lead to increased}} bureaucratic corruption. Using multiple measures of corruption and trade policies, we find strong evidence that corruption is significantly higher in countries with <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policies. These results are robust to endogeneity concerns. Next, a panel-data-based GMM methodology is used to estimate a dynamic model of corruption. This estimator controls for country-specific effects, potential endogeneity of trade policy, and existence of measurement errors afflicting the corruption data. The paper strengthens the case for trade liberalization and argues that trade reforms may lead to improvements in governance. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{main issue}} was the Conservatives' wish to {{introduce}} <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policies.

In order to preserve the Liberals within the National Government, the government itself did not endorse a policy but appealed for a [...] "Doctor's Mandate" [...] to do whatever was necessary to rescue the economy.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how the WTO agreement {{deals with}} the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to trade and environmental policies. As the use of traditional export subsidies and other <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policies are now strongly restricted in the WTO, many countries will try to find other ways to increase competitiveness. One way of doing this is to use lax environmental taxation or regulation as indirect subsidies (i. e. 'environmental dumping'). If this is done, the reduced possibilities of using traditional <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policies could harm the environment, thus reducing the overall welfare gain from trade liberalization. Environmental countervailing tariffs have been suggested {{as a way of}} reducing incentives for environmental dumping. The WTO rules are examined in order to analyse the feasibility of the uses of environmental countervailing tariffs in the current and future framework of WTO, and the incentives and welfare consequences are analysed under different market scenarios.

40|$|The Great Depression {{was marked}} by a severe {{outbreak}} of <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policies. But contrary to the presumption that all countries scrambled to raise trade barriers, there was substantial cross-country variation in the movement to protectionism. Specifically, countries that remained on the gold standard resorted to tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls {{to a greater extent}} than countries that went off gold. Just as the gold standard constraint on monetary policy is critical to understanding macroeconomic developments in this period, exchange rate policies help explain changes in trade policy. he Great Depression of the 1930 s {{was marked by}} a severe outbreak of <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policies. Governments around the world imposed tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls to restrict spending on foreign goods. These trade barriers contributed to a sharp contraction in world trade in the early 1930 s beyond the economic collapse itself, and to a lackluster rebound in trade later in the decade, despite the worldwide economic recovery. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{investigate}} how government ideology affects trade policy. The prediction of a partisan, ideology-based model (within a two-sector, two-factor Heckscher-Ohlin framework) is that left-wing governments will adopt more <b>protectionist</b> <b>trade</b> policies in capital rich countries, but adopt more pro-trade policies in labor rich economies than right-wing ones.
