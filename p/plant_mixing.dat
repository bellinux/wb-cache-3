60|$|At the {{termination}} of the second week, Mark and Betts held a council {{on the subject of}} their future proceedings. At this consultation it was decided {{that it would be better}} to finish the picking up of a considerable plot of ground, one of at least half an acre in extent, that was already commenced, within the crater, scatter their compost over it, and spade all up together, and <b>plant,</b> <b>mixing</b> in as much of the sea-weed as they could conveniently spade under. Nothwithstanding their success in finding the loam, and this last discovery of a means of getting sea-weed in large supplies to the Reef, Mark was not very sanguine of success in his gardening. The loam appeared to him to be cold and sour, as well as salt, though a good deal freshened by the rain since it was put in the crater; and he knew nothing of the effects of guano, except through the somewhat confused accounts of Bob. Then the plain of the crater offered nothing beside a coarse and shelly ashes. These ashes were deep enough for any agricultural purpose, it is true, for Mark could work a crowbar down into them its entire length; but they appeared to him to be totally wanting in the fertilizing principle. Nor could he account for the absence of everything like vegetation, on or about the reef, if the elements of plants of any sort were to be found in the substances of which it was composed. He had read, however, that the territory around active volcanoes, and which was far enough removed from the vent to escape from the destruction caused by lava, scoriæ and heat, was usually highly fertile, in consequence of the ashes and impalpable dust that was scattered in the air; but seeing no proofs of any such fertility here, he supposed that the adjacent sea had swallowed up whatever there might have been of these bountiful gifts. With these impressions, it is not surprising that Mark was disposed to satisfy himself with a moderate beginning, in preference to throwing away time and labour in endeavouring to produce resources which after all would fail them.|$|E

Lower <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> temperatures mean reduction in fuel consumption and lower emissions, what may contribute to diminish health and odour problems and to decrease costs. During this work, two commercial additives (Sasobit® and Cecabase®) were used to produce WMAs, which were compared with a conventional HMA. Initially, the mixtures were designed, the amount of additive was selected (based on the binder characterization) and the mixing temperatures of the WMAs were chosen by means of EN 12697 - 10 compactability comparison. Then, a road trial was built and test specimens were collected (both of HMA and WMAs) for volumetric composition and mechanical behaviour assessment.

The objective of this research was to provide both sufficient concrete protection performance and acceptable workability for ready mix concrete systems by using the suggested hybrid fibers. To evaluate the field applicability of fresh properties, a sufficient workability was evaluated with an appropriate range of slump and air content, and to evaluate the protection performance, the impact test using a high velocity projectile was executed. Additionally, to evaluate the applicability of FRC for a ready-mix concrete system and on-site placing, regarding the actual construction project, the determined mixture with hybrid fibers was applied to the ready-mixed concrete system. Hybrid fibers made success possible in this research. Furthermore, an actual example of applying FRC to a ready-mix concrete system is provided.|$|E

The conductivity method is used to determine of the blending (homogenization) time of miscible liquids in pilot <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> equipment with standard radial baffles. For the given homogeneity degree (98 %) a three-blade pitched blade impeller is tested with various off-bottom clearances, vessel/ impeller diameter ratios and various impeller pitch angles. The experimental results show in accordance with theoretical data from the literature, that the greatest effect on the dimensionless blending time is exhibited by the vessel/ impeller diameter ratio and the impeller pitch angle. The number of total circulations necessary for reaching the chosen homogeneity degree depends on the impeller pitch angle and amounts more than three. Finally, the energetic efficiency of the blending process is calculated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the mutual dynamic relation between the impeller discharge flow of a standard Rushton turbine impeller and a standard radial baffle at the wall of a cylindrical mixing vessel under turbulent regime of flow of an agitated liquid. A portion of the torsional moment of the baffle corresponding to the region of the force interaction of the impeller discharge stream and the baffle is calculated under the assumption of constant angular momentum in the flow region between the impeller and the baffles. This theoretically obtained quantity is compared with the torsional moment of the baffles calculated from the experimentally determined distribution of the peripheral (tangential) component of dynamic pressure along the height of the radial baffle in pilot <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> equipment. It follows from the results of our calculations that for both investigated impeller off-bottom clearances the theoretically determined transferred torsional moment of the baffles in the area of interference between the impeller discharge flow and the baffles agrees fairly well with experimentally determined data and, moreover, that more than 2 / 3 of the transferred torsional moment of the baffles as a whole is located in the above mentioned interference area...|$|E

This limits the value proposition of the compost and its potential for cost recovery to maintain the compost stations. One way to enhance the compost value is to enrich it with nutrients. Given the increasing attention to fecal sludge (FS) management from septic tanks and latrines, co-composting of both waste streams could be a win-win option to increase the compost nutrient value. To assess the current situation of MSW composting and opportunities and acceptance of co-composting in Sri Lanka several field surveys were conducted including a study of 13 MSW compost plants and current septage management practices in 41 local authorities (LA), a detailed case study of an existing <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> MSW and FS, {{and a willingness to}} pay study among 257 farmers in proximity of a designated pilot co-composting station.

The stiffness of pavement cores is measured using Simple Shear Tester to obtain shear stiffness |G*| of mix and strength is measured using indirect tensile strength testing. The asphalt mixture will meet the criteria if it meets both the stiffness and strength requirements.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of the coagulant dosage, suspension pH, mixing intensity and time on the suspended solids particle size distribution during coagulation, flocculation and filtration of dilute suspensions. The coagulation/flocculation investigation consisted of laboratory experiments utilizing the jar test apparatus as well as a pilot <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> tank. Filtration experiments were conducted using 3 -six inch inside diameter glass columns with different media sizes. The data generated were used to compute the distribution slope of the particles in each sample. The distribution slope was used as the pretreatment performance indicator. The distribution slope is influenced by both chemical and physical treatment parameters and it can be used in the treatment of dilute suspensions to optimize the coagulant dosage, mixing intensity, and mixing time. Both the total number of particles and the distribution slope of flocculated suspensions were found to follow a second order polynomial equation due to floe breakage after the optimum mixing time. The coagulant dosage was found to affect both the head loss development and the effluent quality of granular media filters. The mixing intensity and time were found to influence mostly the head loss development and not the effluent quality. The effluent quality improved with the increase in the coagulant dosage and mixing time and deteriorated with the increase in the mixing intensity.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{fractionated}} recycled asphalt pavement (FRAP) materials, the Illinois Tollway, working through its contractors and consultants, developed and conducted a {{project on the}} applicability and feasibility of using increased RAP contents through FRAP. The goal {{of the program was}} to answer two main questions: ??? Can the Tollway design, produce, and construct high-quality HMA pavements with high FRAP content mixes? ??? Will these materials provide the same or better pavement performance as the standard mixes used by the Tollway and Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), and with performance that is consistent with pavement design procedures? In the summer of 2007, a construction contract was awarded for advance pavement work on the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (I- 90) in the Rockford area. The timing, scope, and circumstances of the I- 90 project provided a rare opportunity to evaluate several different HMA concepts directly via <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> and field trials. This is a summary report of the field trial production mixes containing high quantities of FRAP sponsored by the Illinois Tollway. The results of these field trials show that the Tollway can design, produce, and construct high-quality HMA pavements with high FRAP content mixes. Further, the laboratory evaluation of these mixes shows that their performance is expected to be similar to currently used materials and consistent with current pavement design procedures.

Two aims of the study were defined: the dependence of the rate of the erosion process of the impeller blades on impeller frequency of revolution and {{on the size of the}} mixing equipment. Experiments were carried out on pilot <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> equipment of two sizes (geometrically similar) made of stainless steel (diameters of cylindrical vessels T 1 = 200 mm and T 2 = 300 mm, diameters of impellers D 1 = 100 mm and D 2 = 66. 7 mm, impeller off bottom clearances h 1 = 100 mm and h 2 = 66. 7 mm, respectively) equipped with four radial baffles (width b 1 = 30 mm, b 2 = 20 mm, respectively) and an impeller with four inclined plane blades (pitch angle α = 30 °, 45 °, relative blade with W/D = 0. 2) made of rolled brass (Brinnel hardness 40 - 50 BM) always pumping the liquid downwards towards the float vessel bottom. The wear of the impeller was described by an analytical approximation in exponential form with two parameters (the wear rate constant k and the geometrical parameters of the worn blade C) calculated by the least squares method from the experimentally found profile of the worn leading edge of the impeller blades. While the wear rate constant exhibits a monotonous dependence on the pitch angle only, the geometric parameter is dependent both on the pitch angle and in linear form on the impeller tip speed. Thus in the procedure for scaling up the rate of erosion wear of the pitched blade impellers in a suspension of higher solid particle hardness, the decision process parameters are the impeller blade pitch angle and the impeller tip speed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2017. Coal fly ash waste {{produced}} from the coal combustion process {{is becoming an}} ever increasing concern. It is produced in such abundance due to not only South Africa, but {{the whole of the}} world relying mainly on coal combustion for the main source of energy production. With the growing rate of the human population this energy production is ever increasing. The current methods of disposal of this fly ash is not sustainable, it is being dumped in ash dumps, and poses a risk to the surrounding environment and human population. Therefore, processes need to be developed to take this waste and turn it into useful materials. This would not only solve the problem of its disposal but also create useful products that can be applied to further protect the environment. It was discovered that one of the useful materials that can be synthesised from fly ash are zeolites. These nano-porous structures have a wide variety of uses. Therefore, many studies have been conducted around optimising the synthesis of various zeolites from coal fly ash. More recently these studies have focused on the scale-up conditions needed to synthesise these zeolites on the large industrial scale, regarding the sheer volume of fly ash produced annually. The most robust and widely used technique for zeolite synthesis involves a pre-synthesis fusion of the fly ash with sodium hydroxide at a temperature of 550 0 C. This would not be feasible to scale-up to industrial scale because of the energy intensity. Therefore, alternative pre-synthesis techniques have been proposed. One of those techniques involves using a sonochemical treatment as a pre-synthesis. It can be argued that this technique {{may not be able to}} be easily scaled. To solve this problem, another alternative technique was investigated within this study. It involves the use of a jet loop pilot <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> system, which can be scaled-up very readily to industrial scale...|$|E

Experiments were carried out on pilot <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> equipment made of stainless steel (diameter of cylindrical vessel T= 390 mm, diameter of impeller D= 100 mm, impeller off-bottom clearance h= 100 mm) equipped with four wall radial baffles (width b= 39 mm) and an impeller with four inclined plane blades (pitch angle α = 20 °, 30 °, 45 °, relative blade width W/D= 0. 2) made either of rolled brass (Brinell hardness 40 – 50 BH) or of structural steel (Brinell hardness 100 – 120 BH) always pumping the liquid downwards towards the flat vessel bottom. Two erosion process mechanisms appear, depending on the hardness of the solid particles in the suspension: while the particles of gypsum (lower hardness) generate a uniform sheet erosion over the whole surface of the impeller blade, the particles of silicious sand (higher hardness) generate wear of {{the leading edge of the}} impeller blades, together with a reduction of the surface of the worn blade. The hardness of the impeller blade also affects the rate of the erosion process: the higher the hardness of the impeller blade, the lower the wear rate of the blade. This study consists of a description of the kinetics of the erosion process of both mechanisms in dependence on the pitch angle of the tested impellers. While the wear of the leading edge of the blade exhibits a monotonous dependence on the pitch angle, the sheet erosion exhibits the maximum rate within the interval of the pitch angles tested α ϵ . However, generally the pitch angle α = 45 ° seems to be the most convenient angle of blade inclination when both investigated mechanisms of the blade erosion process are considered at their minimum rate...|$|E

40|$|Forested {{areas are}} {{important}} in arid and semi-arid regions primarily to combat desertification, but also to increase carbon sinks. To reverse the land degradation processes, restoration in the Mediterranean Basin had been frequently obtained by planting indigenous and exotic conifers, {{but it has been}} demonstrated that shrubs are nurse species for tree seedlings. Furthermore, planting indigenous shrubs is more efficient than allochthonous in restoring degraded soils. The aims of this work were: 1) to illustrate an experimental area in Sardinia used as a test-site to build up afforestation and reforestation activities in arid and semi-arid areas with autochthonous shrub species; 2) to show the results on plant survival and biomass one year after plantation trying to explain the role of different densities and specific compositions; 3) to hypothesize some trends of C accumulation of this &# 8220;artificial&# 8221; Mediterranean semi-arid shrubland by comparison with data found in the literature. The area is located in North West Sardinia, and is characterized by a Mediterranean climate. The revegetation was set up in February 2006, planting local species (Juniperus phoenicea, Pistacia lentiscus and Rosmarinus officinalis). Three densities and three specific compositions (monospecific plots with P. lentiscus, monospecific plots with J. phoenicea and mixed plots with the three cited species) were combined. One month after plantation, almost all plants were alive, but mortality increased after summer, independently of the treatments, likely due to summer drought. During the first year, no differences among the densities and the specific compositions were observed. Total above-ground biomass was in the range of 0. 8 - 3. 0 g m- 2. Below-ground biomass was in the range of 0. 9 - 1. 7 g m- 2. A significant lower biomass was measured in October, especially in the Pistacia plots. Higher densities and <b>plant</b> <b>mixing</b> seemed to better perform, allowing establishment of species with a strong pioneer behaviour and aridity resistant characteristics.
