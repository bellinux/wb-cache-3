5|$|At 7:45am local time, the ladle in {{question}} {{separated from the}} overhead iron rail that connected it to the blast furnace while it was being positioned over a worktable in preparation to <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> its contents. All 30 tons of liquid steel, which was at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), was spilled. This liquid steel then burst through the windows and door of an adjoining room five meters away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.|$|E
5|$|Clifford E. Trafzer's A Chemehuevi Song: The Resilience of a Southern Paiute Tribe retells {{the story}} of Sinawavi (Coyote)'s love for Poowavi (Louse). Her eggs are sealed in a basket woven by her mother, who gives it to Coyote, instructing him not to open it before he reaches home. Hearing voices coming from it, however, Coyote opens the basket and the people, the world's first human beings, <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> of it in all directions.|$|E

5|$|I beseech you, Holy Spirit of the Father and Son: {{for when}} the holy throng re-echoes its songs, may I then with humble voice be able to ascend quickly as I leave the grave, bearing then the holy prayers of the saints who already have scorned this present world of dust with their learned outpourings, and may I fearlessly be able to <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> my glorious song to the triune (God).|$|E
5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant is viewed as less {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Rose deduces {{that she}} and Mickey were kept alive because their touch can {{activate}} the Genesis Ark. Dalek Sec explains that they cannot open the Ark because it is stolen Time Lord technology. He demands that Rose open it, but she refuses and mocks the Daleks until the Doctor arrives. The Doctor realises that these Daleks are the enigmatic Cult of Skaro, and uses his sonic screwdriver to allow the Cybermen into the sphere chamber. As the Cybermen attack the Daleks, Mickey accidentally activates the Ark while escaping. The Daleks battle the Cybermen and Dalek Sec takes the Ark outside. The Doctor and his companions flee into the tower. Along the way, Pete saves Jackie from the Cybermen and the two embrace. The Doctor then takes everyone to the control room where they witness the Genesis Ark open and millions of Daleks that were imprisoned during the Time War <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> and begin engaging the Cybermen firing on them from below, though humanity is {{caught in the crossfire}} and many are killed while running for cover.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E
5|$|Most Iridomyrmex {{species are}} {{aggressive}} ants that will attack anything which attacks or disturbs their nests or trails they forage on. This is noticeable with particular member {{species of the}} I. purpureus species group, where they will <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> of their nest and attack and kill all intruders. Even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm out of their nests to bite and spray iridomyrmecin, a defensive chemical found in the genus. Because of their large numbers, aggression, and activeness, Iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in Australia, and several species are known to obtain exclusive possession to food sources and prevent other insects from using them. These ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1830s, Smith was {{teaching}} that a further endowment was necessary, this time requiring {{the completion of}} the Kirtland Temple as a house of God where God could <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> his Holy Spirit. Upon {{the completion of the}} Kirtland Temple after three years of construction (1833–1836), the elders of the church gathered for this second promised endowment in early 1836. The Kirtland endowment included a ritual ceremony involving preparatory washings and anointings with oil, followed by a gathering in the temple in which many reported spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and visions.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the Cave of Bats (Cueva de Río Murciélagos) lies 75meters to the northwest of the BatPalace. Although relatively dry in the dry season, after rainfall water can <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> through the cave mouth {{at a rate of}} 8m³/second, creating enough noise to be heard in the main plaza 500meters away. Although the seasonal flow of water has washed away almost all archaeological remains from the cave, archaeologists consider that the Cave of Bats was of ceremonial importance to the inhabitants of DosPilas due to the dramatic torrent that flows through it in the wet season.|$|E

500|$|Early on September17, {{the storm}} made {{landfall}} near West Palm Beach, Florida, with winds of 145mph (233km/h). In the city, more than 1,711homes were destroyed. Elsewhere in Palm Beach County, impact was severest around Lake Okeechobee. The storm surge caused water to <b>pour</b> <b>out</b> {{of the southern}} edge of the lake, flooding hundreds of square miles as high as [...] above ground. Numerous houses and buildings were swept away in the cities of Belle Glade, Canal Point, Chosen, Pahokee, and South Bay. At least 2,500people drowned, while damage was estimated at $25million. While crossing Florida, the system weakened significantly, falling to Category1 intensity late on September17. It curved north-northeastward and briefly re-emerged into the Atlantic on September18, but soon made another landfall near Edisto Island, South Carolina with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Early on the following day, the system weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical over North Carolina hours later. Overall, the system caused $100million in damage and at least 4,079deaths.|$|E
