40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{theoretical}} foundations of the <b>professional</b> secret and <b>confidentiality</b> in Social Work and Social Education in order to propose an alternative approach to the issue which does not reduce the professional secret to a utilitarian device designed to increase the success of social services.

Understood this way, the professional secret should be regarded as a cornerstone of democracy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To obtain {{information}} about the actual use of health care facilities by undocumented women and to identify obstacles they experience in accessing health care facilities. METHODS: A mixed methods study, with structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, was chosen to obtain a complete understanding. One-hundred undocumented women were recruited. Diversity was sought according to age, origin and reason for being undocumented. RESULTS: Undocumented female immigrants have unmet health care needs (56 %) and low health care utilisation. Sixty-nine per cent of the women reported obstacles in accessing health care facilities. These included many personal obstacles such as shame, fear and/or lack of information. Poor language proficiency (OR 0. 28;. CI 0. 09 - 0. 90) reduces utilisation of primary health care services. CONCLUSION: Health care utilisation of undocumented women is low. Undocumented women refrain from seeking health care because of personal obstacles.

40|$|Genetics {{can pose}} special {{challenges}} {{to the principle of}} confidentiality within the health professional-patient relationship, since genetic information is by its nature both individual and familial. Most <b>professional</b> guidelines allow <b>confidentiality</b> to be broken in rare circumstances, where it will prevent a 'serious', 'imminent' and 'likely' harm. We argue that the types of harms that may result from genetic medicine are particularly diverse. Using clinical examples, we explore ethical issues that arise when balancing individual and family member interests. As genetic testing becomes more, widespread situations will arise where clinicians are faced with a choice between preserving the confidentiality of one patient and preventing harm to another. Professionals need to incorporate the notion of familial implications in their counseling of individuals. Since such dilemmas have been relatively rare in the pre-genetic age, we call for a wider debate on the balance between confidentiality and harm to others...|$|R

This project is based on two pillars: a protected server (PCF-server) containing paediatric core files (PCF), with important clinical data that should be available for the physician in order to quickly get a clear insight into the relevant clinical medical history of the child, and secondly, the possibility to provide feedback to the attending physician about the findings recorded during the on-call duty. The permanent availability of health data on the PCF-server and the possibility to provide feedback represent together the PCF-EXEM-project.

40|$|Under Quebec law, {{the members}} of thirty-nine {{regulated}} professions are bound by statute to professional secrecy. This obligation is reinforced by section 9 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. It protects patients and clients against the extrajudicial disclosure of confidential information but it also operates as an evidentiary privilege which the courts must enforce ex officio in all proceedings of a non-criminal nature. According to the authors, this statutory equation of <b>professional</b> <b>confidentiality</b> with privilege necessarily leads to the overgrowth of privilege or to the atrophy of confidentiality. The rule interferes excessively with the administration of civil justice and compels the courts to adopt result-oriented interpretations detrimental to the coherence of the law. The article first describes {{the relationship between the}} applicable legislation and the several codes of professional ethics defining the scope of professional secret. A second part explores the possible justifications for legal duties of confidentiality and evidentiary privilegesÂ ; most of these rationales are compatibles with a distinction between in-court and out-of-court requirements of secrecy. The authors then review in a third part various cases in which Quebec courts have dealt with objections based on professional secret. Three conflicting interpretations were adopted in these cases. All three interpretations restrict the scope of professional privilege, sometimes at the expense of legitimate claims for out-of-court confidentiality. It therefore appears desirable to re-establish in the legislation a distinction between the judicial and extrajudicial aspects of professional secret. The conclusion contains suggestions for a reform of the law of professional secret in Quebec...|$|E

40|$|In genetic medicine, a patient's {{diagnosis}} {{can mean}} {{their family members}} are also at risk, raising a question about how consent and confidentiality should function in clinical genetics. This question is particularly pressing when {{it is unclear whether}} a patient has shared information. Conventionally, healthcare <b>professionals</b> view <b>confidentiality</b> at an individual level and âdisclosure without consentâ as the exception, not the rule. The relational joint account model, by contrast, conceptualises genetic information as confidential at the familial level and encourages professionals to take disclosure as the default position. In this study, we interviewed 33 patients about consent and confidentiality and analysed data thematically. Our first theme showed that although participants thought of certain aspects of genetic conditionsâfor example, the way they affect day-to-day healthâas somewhat personal, they perceived genetic informationâfor example, the mutation in isolationâas familial. Most thought these elements were separable and thought family members had a right to know the latter, identifying a broad range of harms that would justify disclosure. Our second theme illustrated that participants nonetheless had some concerns about what, if any, implications there would be of professionals treating such information as familial and they emphasised the importance of being informed about the way their information would be shared. Based on these results, we recommend that professionals take disclosure as the default position, but make clear that they will treat genetic information as familial during initial consultations and address any concerns therein...|$|R
