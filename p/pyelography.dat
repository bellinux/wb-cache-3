40|$|A case of serous {{papillary}} adenocarcinoma of the ovary initially suspected {{to be an}} uretero-vaginal fistula is reported. The {{patient was}} a 57 -year-old female with the complaint of urinary leakage from the vagina. Because she had undergone a supravaginal hysterectomy for myoma uteri 10 years earlier, a uretero-vaginal fistula was initially suspected. However, the fistula was not recognized from the findings of excretory and retrograde <b>pyelographies.</b> Chemical analysis of the vaginal discharge was similar to serum rather than urine. Gynecological examination showed {{the presence of an}} ovarian tumor. Right oophorectomy and extirpation of remaining cervix combined with partial resection of rectum was performed. From the pathological finding that the tumor consisted of serous papillary adenocarcinoma, the vaginal discharge was confirmed to originate from the tumor. Ovarian tumors with serous discharge from the vagina seem to be very rare...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 4 years 18 {{children}} were observed at the La Timone-Enfants Hospital in Marseille with renal lesions consequent to nonpenetrating abdominal traumas. Hematuria {{was reported in}} 14 cases (7 macroscopic and 7 microscopic) and all cases suffered from abdominal and/or lumbar pain. In relation to the diagnostic iter used: 18 echographies, 15 urographies, 13 TAC, 2 ascendant <b>pyelographies,</b> 2 scintigraphies with DMSA, 1 echo-Doppler and one angiography were performed. Renal lesions were classified as: 8 type 1, 5 type 2, 4 type 3, 1 type 4. Four cases were operated and one case underwent percutaneous drainage of an urohematoma. Following an analysis of these case and a revision of the literature, the authors emphasise that the evolution and progress in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} this important aspect of traumatic pathology in children enables an almost complete recovery of kidney function in almost all cases...|$|R
40|$|Conray 400 was {{examined}} {{as to its}} contrast ability and side effects on 67 excretory <b>pyelographies</b> with intravenous injection of 40 ml, and the following results were obtained. Diagnostic pyelograms were observed in 125 out of 132 kidneys (94. 7 %). In 58. 3 %, more than {{one third of the}} whole length of the ureter or the ureter above the obstruction was also clearly visualized. And in 55 out of 67 cases (82. 1 %), it was possible to make diagnosis without other urographies. Side effects were observed in 44. 8 %, among which pain in the blood vessel was most frequent. All of them, however, were slight and serious side effects were not experienced. Characteristically, Conray 400 is easy to inject intravenously owing to the low viscosity, hax excellent contrast ability and gives clear and detailed image. It was emphasized that the pre-treatment of intestines was almost not required for 40 ml-injection method and that Conray 400 was easy to inject, giving a natural image of the urinary tract without need of a pressure bandage over the ureter...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 90 {{dyestuff}} {{workers who were}} engaged {{in the production of}} aromatic amines during the post-war period after the 2 nd world war have been examined since 1967 by exfoliative cytologic examination. Those identified as class- 3 or over by this first screening test were then submitted to a second screening which consisted of periodic cystoscopic examination and 1 or 2 intravenous <b>pyelographies</b> per year. This system of mass screening has been used for the past 20 years, and we have discovered 23 cases of bladder tumor, a case of asynchronous bilateral ureteral tumor and a case of ureteral tumor. Out of the 13 cases, bladder tumors were discovered in 6 cases within 3 months after a positive exfoliative cytology result and in 5 cases within 1 year. The presence of a tumor was confirmed in 85 % of those patients within 1 year and in all of them in about 3 years. Periodic examinations have revealed all the tumors when they were about 5 mm in size and in stage 0 through A, demonstrating the usefulness of systematic examination. Treatment included intravesical instillation of anticancer agents, mostly mitomycin C, for 7 cases transurethral resection (TUR) for 8 cases and partial cystectomy was performed in one case. One patient with an asynchronous bilateral ureteral tumor was treated first by right total nephro-ureterectomy with cuff resection of bladder, and later by ureter excision and nephrostomy. This patient died of ileus in the 7 th year of treatment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Dilation of {{urinary tract}} occurs without the {{presence}} of obstruction. Diagnostic methods that depend on renal function may elicit mistaken diagnosis. Whitaker (1973) proposed the evaluation of urinary tract pressure submitted to constant flow. Other investigators proposed perfusion of renal pelvis under controlled pressure, making the method more physiological and reproducible. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the results of the anterograde pressure measurement (APM) of the urinary tract of children with persistent hydronephrosis after surgery suspected to present persistent obstruction. Materials and Methods: Along 12 years, 26 renal units with persistent hydronephrosis after surgery (12 PUJ and 14 VUJ) were submitted to evaluation of the renal tract pressure in order to decide the form of treatment. Previous radionuclide scans with DTPA, intravenous <b>pyelographies</b> and ultrasounds were considered undetermined in relation to obstruction in 10 occasions and obstructive in 16. APM was performed under radioscopy through renal pelvis puncture or previous stoma. Saline with methylene blue + iodine contrast was infused under constant pressure of 40 cm H 2 O to fill the urinary system. The ureteral opening pressure was measured following the opening of the system and stabilization of the water column. Results: Among the 10 cases with undetermined previous diagnosis, APM was considered non-obstructive in two and those were treated clinically and eight were considered obstructive and were submitted to surgery. Among the 16 cases previously classified as obstructive, nine confirmed obstruction and were submitted to surgery. Seven cases were considered non-obstructive, and were treated clinically, with stable DMSA and hydronephrosis. Conclusions: APM avoided unnecessary surgery in one third of the cases and was important to treatment decision in 100 %. We believe that this simple test is an excellent diagnostic tool when selectively applied mainly in {{the presence of}} functional deficit...|$|R

50|$|Acetrizoate was {{developed}} by V.H. Wallingford of Mallinckrodt, and introduced in 1950; it was employed as a contrast agent for several radiographic studies, including <b>pyelography,</b> angiography of the brain, carotid arteries and the aorta, and cholecystography. It was soon found to be highly toxic to the kidneys and nervous system—work urging caution in its administration was published as early as 1959, after reports of adverse reactions ranging from hypersensitivity to brain damage—and was eventually replaced by other agents with higher efficacy and lower toxicity, such as sodium diatrizoate, a closely related compound.|$|E
50|$|Imaging studies, {{such as an}} {{intravenous}} urogram (IVU), ultrasound, CT or MRI, {{are also}} important investigations in determining the presence and/ or cause of hydronephrosis. Whilst ultrasound allows for visualisation of the ureters and kidneys (and determine the presence of hydronephrosis and / or hydroureter), an IVU is useful for assessing the anatomical location of the obstruction. Antegrade or retrograde <b>pyelography</b> will show similar findings to an IVU but offer a therapeutic option as well.

By this technique better urograms were obtained than those by routine intravenous <b>pyelography.</b> Fine urograms could be obtained even in cases with ureteral obstruction, in post-operative cases of uretero-vesical anastomosis or in cases of children. This was quite helpful because retrograde <b>pyelography</b> was impossible {{in any of these}} cases. Diagnostic urograms were obtained in about 50 per cent of the cases with unilateral renal disease in which visualization was unsatisfactory or absent by routine intravenous <b>pyelography,</b> and in 43 per cent of the cases with renal impairment with BUN less than 40 mg/dl. In these cases, therefore, retrograde <b>pyelography</b> was omitted. Regarding safety, there were no severe side effects and the influence on pulse, blood pressure, BUN, serum electrolytes and renal function was slight. Particularly it was relatively safe in the cases with renal insufficiency.

30|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} if water-enhanced antegrade magnetic resonance (MR) <b>pyelography</b> can be an alternative to conventional antegrade <b>pyelography</b> in pregnant patients who require percutaneous nephrostomy placement for urosepsis and/or obstructive uropathy. The pregnant patient was placed supine in a 1.5 -T MRI scanner seven days after percutaneous nephrostomy placement using ultrasound. Serial axial and coronal T 2 -weighted echo-planar fast spin-echo sequences were performed before and after injection of the catheter. The right nephrostomy catheter hub was sterilised using chlorhexidine. Sixty millilitres of sterile water were slowly injected. No Gd-based contrast agent was utilised due to safety concerns for the foetus. MR antegrade <b>pyelography</b> demonstrated the level of ureteric obstruction and the absence of renal calculi using sterile water as a contrast medium injected through a percutaneous nephrostomy followed by T 2 -weighted imaging. Air bubbles in the injected solution were differentiated from calculi due to their mobility on serial scans and their anti-dependent position. Water-enhanced antegrade MR <b>pyelography</b> was a safe and effective method of imaging the pregnant patient.
