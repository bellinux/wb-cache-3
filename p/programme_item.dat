40|$|Radio is the {{preferred}} extension medium for disseminating agricultural information in Fiji and other Pacific islands, where it enjoys almost 100 % penetration in rural areas. To enhance the content of rural radio programmes, a workshop was organised in Suva, Fiji, from 6 to 16 April 1999 by CTA and IRETA, with a course consultant from Wrenmedia. The emphasis of the course was to increase the 'sense of place' in a programme by bringing the action closer to the listener. A <b>programme</b> <b>item</b> can be made more vivid, by breaking away from the usual practice of recording interviews in the studio or in formal settings, and instead talking to interviewees in their workplace. The course was reported on national radio in several countries and was the topic of a 'Farming World' programme broadcast on the BBC World Service in late April. Fourteen participants from seven countries attended the workshop: Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu. Their work really started after the course: in addition to using materials produced during the course for their national broadcasts, they have the task of producing two sample programmes and distributing them {{to all the other}} participants by September 1999. workshop was organised in Suva, Fiji, from 6 to 16 April 1999 by CTA and IRETA, with a course consultant from Wrenmedi...|$|E
40|$|The perceptual {{characteristics}} of a microphone are not always clear from its technical specification. This thesis documents a first step towards creating more perceptually relevant measures. Consideration of relevant criteria revealed that the most appropriate method for recording stimuli for perceptual microphone comparisons is to use all microphones under test simultaneously. Experiments determined that a maximum array size of 150 mm will ensure that the perceptual differences between the recorded stimuli are predominantly due to the {{characteristics of}} the microphones and not artefacts of the spacing between them. It was established that there are eight standard physical differences that exist between microphones which may impact the perceived {{characteristics of a}} recording. These differences, supplemented with expert opinions, indicated that recording five programme items with eight studio and two MEMS microphones would allow for determination of the most prominent inter-microphone perceptual differences. A combination of indirect and direct elicitation experiments on the resulting 50 recordings identified a hierarchy of 40 perceptual attributes that describe the differences between microphones. A novel attribute contribution experiment conducted on the 31 lowest-level attributes in the hierarchy showed that brightness contributes the most overall to the inter-microphone difference. The spectral centroid and ratios comparing the relative level of high frequencies were previously used to predict brightness; however, these metrics did not predict subjective ratings of microphone-related brightness as well as a newly proposed combination metric: the product of the spectral centroid above 3 kHz, and the ratio of energy above 3 kHz compared to all energy. This model performed well on training data (r = 0. 909). Validating it on independent microphones and programme items suggested that improvements may be necessary for error-free prediction of programme-related aspects of brightness, but showed good correlation with each <b>programme</b> <b>item</b> and overall (r = 0. 854), indicating that the model predicts microphone-related brightness well...|$|E

40|$|Surveys on “cultural consumption” (e. g. {{reading of}} books and newspapers, {{listening}} to the radio, watching the TV) pose a difficult problem of validity and reliability of research techniques applied. In view of a widespread tendency of respondents to overstate their cultural consumption (due {{to the influence of}} the positive model of a “cultured citizen”), it is necessary to formulate the questions {{in such a way as}} to minimize the bias. As a rule the researcher has at his disposal two alternative manners of formulation: he may choose either closed (pre-categorized) or open-ended questions. Very frequently the decision depends on researcher’s intuition. To ascertain the differences in answers obtained by means of both kinds of questions 50 respondents selected from among a sample of 298 persons were re-interviewed. Chosen were respondents with low educational level, interviewed by interviewers who did over 3 interviews daily, for it was suspected that in these cases the bias was most likely. In the first interviews which related to reading {{of books and}} newspapers, radio listening and TV watching, closed questions (with a cafeteria) were used. In the repeated interviews which took place two weeks later four open-ended questions on the same topics were asked from the same respondents. To secure their cooperation the interviewers explained to them that the interviewing was necessitated by the need to obtain some supplementary information. No refusals were ascertained. Main results of the comparison were as follows: 1. 	With regard to the question concerning desirability of subscription as a form of acquisition of newspapers, it was ascertained that 50 % answers to the open-ended version were identical with those obtained by means of a closed version; 16 % of respondents approving earlier of subscription expressed, in the open-ended version, their negative opinion about it. Furthermore, it turned out that 10 respondents were answering to the closed question automatically, i. e. without exactly understanding what the word “subscription” meant. 2. 	Answers to the questions with a series of pre-categorized alternatives embracing various elements of the contents read in the local newspaper were compared with the answers to the analogous open-ended question with intensive probing. The main difference was that despite very similar ranking of the content elements named by respondents in both questions the percentages of the reading declarations relating to each element were much lower in the open-ended version. The only exception to this rule was much higher rank of the “other” category (59 %) in the open-ended version (with a zero in the pre-categorized one). This means that the “other” category in pre-categorized version did not ensure against serious omissions in answers of respondents. It is proposed to demonstrate in interviews a newspaper copy with simultaneous asking about the contents elements read, which procedure helps respondent’s memory. 3. 	The closed question about book reading within the last two months has brought less affirmative answers than its open-ended version because of the difference in the two wordings; in addition, in 30 % of cases the answers were contradictory in both interviews. Respondents were also asked whether they considered it possible to recall the books read within the last year. Their opinions differed, depending on how many books they had read themselves. The conclusion is that questions about book reading must aim at helping respondent’s memory and not to refer to excessively long periods. 4. 	Answers to two cafeteria questions concerning the reception of the TV and radio programmes were compared with answers to their corresponding open-ended versions. Main conclusions were that: (1) the more popular was the <b>programme</b> <b>item</b> the more reliable were the answers of the respondent, (2) answers to the open-ended questions were scanty and too superficial, (3) "liking” in the pre-categorized questions meant just listening or watching while in the open-ended ones it meant an actual fancy, (4) the reliability level of answers turned out to be rather low, which fact points to the need of further methodological research in this direction...|$|E

In the study both primary and secondary data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations from 68 employees of DRH and 80 patients. Findings were analysed through qualitative techniques in which explanations were drawn, and the summary was drawn in frequency and percentage tables and figures with the use of SPSS and Excel programs. The results show that at DRH there are no fixed pre-established stock levels, order quantities, and ordering time for non-vertical <b>programme</b> <b>items,</b> and stock records are mainly kept in paper files.

Direct elicitation and panel discussions on the seventeen pairs identified a hierarchy of 40 perceptual attributes.

40|$|A multiple-microphone-sphere-based {{localisation}} {{model has}} been developed that predicts source location by modelling the cues given by head movement. In order to inform improvements to this model, a series of experiments was devised to investigate the impact of head movement cues on the localisation response accuracy of human listeners. It was shown that head movements improve elevation localisation response accuracy for noise sources. When pinna cues are impaired the significance of head movement cues increases. The improved localisation resulting from head movement is due to dynamic cues available {{during the period of}} movement, and not to improved static cues available once the head is turned to face the sound source. Head movements improve elevation localisation to a similar degree for band- limited sources with differing centre frequencies (500 Hz, 2 kHz and 6 kHz), which indicates that both dynamic ILDs and dynamic ITDs are used.

40|$|Abstract. Data Mining, or Knowledge Discovery {{as it is}} also known, is {{becoming}} increasingly useful {{in a wide variety}} of applications. In the following paper, we lookat its use in combating some of the traditional issues faced with recommender systems. We discuss our ongoing workwhich aims to enhance the performance of PTV, an applied recommender system working in the TV listings domain. This system currently combines the results of separate user-based collaborative and case-based components to recommend programs to users. Our extension to this idea operates on the theory of developing a case-based view of the collaborative component itself. By using data mining techniques to extract relationships between <b>programme</b> <b>items,</b> we can address the sparsity/maintenance problem. We also adopt a unique approach to recommendation ranking which combines user similarities and item similarities to provide more effective recommendation orderings. Experimental results corroborate our ideas, demonstrating the effectiveness of data mining in improving recommender systems by providing similarity knowledge to address sparsity, both at user-based recommendation level and recommendation ranking level. ...|$|R
40|$|Yaw {{movements}} {{are the most}} frequently occurring and largest head movements a listener makes when localising; however, previous research has not resolved whether yaw-based head {{movements are}} used in elevation localisation. A series of experiments was devised to investigate the impact of head movement on the elevation localisation response accuracy (LRA) of human listeners. The experiments were conducted using a laser-guided pointing response method, as this was found to allow listeners to more accurately and consistently report a perceived source location than either verbal or graphical methods. 2 kHz low-pass filtered noise with and without a 6 kHz half-octave bandpass component were both shown to suppress pinna cues, and were therefore used to more clearly separate the effect of head movements. Head movements were found to improve azimuth and elevation LRA for noise sources. Depending on stimulus and situation, head movements were shown to make an improvement of up to 8. 5 ˚ in elevation LRA. Head movement improved LRA more for the 2 kHz/ 6 kHz filtered noise than it did for broadband noise; when pinna cues are impaired the significance of head movement cues increases. Both forced yaw movements and free movements significantly improved the elevation LRA. Further experimentation was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} improvement in elevation LRA with head movement was caused by greater accuracy when a source is positioned in the listener’s median plane (a static cue), or by the act of moving the head (a dynamic cue). It was found that the static cue did not provide greater accuracy for sources close to the median plane, and hence it was concluded that dynamic cues increased the elevation LRA for yaw head rotations. For octave and half-octave bandwidth sources, static elevation LRA is lower when the listener has turned to face the source. Yaw head movement improved elevation LRA for high frequency continuous signals, which suggests that dynamic interaural level differences are utilised. Head movements do not improve elevation LRA for <b>programme</b> <b>items</b> with less than an octave bandwidth. For octave <b>programme</b> <b>items,</b> head movements significantly improve elevation LRA, while static LRA shows no improvement; head movement cues are effective at narrower bandwidths than pinna cues. By detailing the nature of head movement cues, one can better inform the localisation model, creating a more accurate representation of the human localisation system...|$|R

Those general and widely supported goals marginalised the differences and alternative ideas emerging in the discussions of different Christian Democrat leaders.

40|$|Anger {{is a key}} {{long-term}} outcome from trauma exposure, {{regardless of}} trauma type, and it is implicated as a moderator of response to treatment. It therefore seems important that anger is assessed in both epidemiological studies of trauma sequelae and in intervention evaluation research. This study explored the measurement properties of a recently investigated anger scale, the Dimensions of Anger Reactions (DAR) Scale. In our previous study, the DAR {{was found to be}} a measure of trait anger, but although brief, the nine response categories per item may have confused respondents, suggesting fewer response categories may work equally well. Additionally, our previous analysis suggested there were two redundant items within the DAR. Three samples of Australian veterans were used to investigate the psychometric properties associated with alterations to the response categories of the DAR; veterans who participated in the DAR validation study, those participating in group therapy programmes for post-traumatic stress disorder, and veterans participating in lifestyle <b>programmes.</b> <b>Item</b> response theory analysis was used to explore the internal properties of competing DAR models, and models were assessed against external criteria. The results showed that the number of item responses in the DAR exceeded channel capacity, and that response bias occurred {{in the second half of}} the instrument. We hypothesized that this was due to respondents not discriminating among the many response categories. Based on a modelling exercise in which we reduced the number of DAR items from 7 to 5 and the number of response categories from 9 to 5, validation tests showed that there was no loss of sensitivity, reliability or validity. To avoid confusion with the DAR, we have referred to the revised version of the DAR as the DAR 5. We conclude that the DAR 5, which abbreviates the original DAR to half its original length, has similar psychometric properties and is therefore to be preferred especially for use with persons who are under stress, cognitively impaired or less mature.
