Dry matter (DM) {{accumulation}} {{was dependent on}} the duration of crop growth which {{was influenced by the}} time of sowing. Autumn sown crops which flowered latest had a longer duration of vegetative growth and consequently produced the highest dry matter yields. In the establishment year, autumn sown crops produced up to 17. 5 t DM/ha for balansa, 12. 5 t DM/ha for Persian, 11. 0 t DM/ha for gland and 9. 4 t DM/ha for arrowleaf at physiological maturity (P< 0. 05). Crops that were sown in winter produced the lowest yield, because reproductive development commenced earlier and therefore they matured earlier. ‘Bolta’ balansa clover had the highest radiation use efficiency of 2. 1 g DM/MJ photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed followed by gland (1. 6 g DM/MJ PAR), arrowleaf and Persian (1. 3 g DM/MJ PAR) clovers. In the second year, regenerated dry matter production at full flower was up to 11. 6 t/ha in balansa, 8. 3 t/ha in Persian, 2. 9 t/ha in gland but only 0. 5 t/ha in arrowleaf clover (P< 0. 05). Thus, over the two years ‘Bolta’ balansa and ‘Mihi’ <b>Persian</b> <b>clovers</b> were the highest yielding and easiest to regenerate from seed in monocultures. ‘Cefalu’ arrowleaf failed to regenerate in the second year due to low population of seedling emergence. ‘Prima’ gland clover was low yielding because it flowered and matured without fully utilising the growing season...|$|R

40|$|Temperate {{species and}} {{tropical}} crop silage {{are the basis}} for forage production for the dairy industry in the Australian subtropics. Irrigation is the key resource needed for production, with little survival of temperate species under rain-grown conditions except for lucerne. Annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), fertilised with either inorganic nitrogen or grown with clovers, is the main cool season forage for the dairy industry. It is sown into fully prepared seedbeds, oversown into tropical grasses, especially kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) or sown after mulching. There has been a continual improvement {{in the performance of}} annual and hybrid ryegrass cultivars over the last 25 years. In small plot, cutting experiments, yields of annual ryegrass typically range from 15 to 21 t DM/ha, with equivalent on-farm yields of 7 to 14 t DM/ha of utilised material. Rust (Puccinia coronata) remains the major concern although resistance is more stable than in oats. There have also been major improvements in the performance of perennial ryegrass (L. perenne) cultivars although their persistence under grazing is insufficient to make them a reliable forage source for the subtropics. On the other hand, tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and prairie grass (Bromus willdenowii) cultivars perform well under cutting and grazing, although farmer resistance to the use of tall fescue is strong. White clover (Trifolium repens) is a reliable and persistent performer although disease usually reduces its performance in the third year after sowing. <b>Persian</b> (Shaftal) annual <b>clover</b> (T. resupinatum) gives good winter production but the performance of berseem clover (T. alexandrinum) is less reliable and the sub clovers (T. subterraneum) are generally not suited to clay soils of neutral to alkaline pH. Lucerne (Medicago sativa), either as a pure stand or in mixtures, is a high producing legume under both irrigation and natural rainfall. Understanding the importance of leaf and crown diseases, and the development of resistant cultivars, have been the reasons for its reliability. Insects on temperate species are not as serious a problem in the subtropics as in New Zealand (NZ). Fungal and viral diseases, on the other hand, cause many problems and forage performance would benefit from more research into resistance...|$|R

Dry mass accumulation tests for both species were conducted during the following wheat growth stages (BBCH) : leaf development (12 – 14), tillering (21 – 23), stem elongation (31 – 32), inflorescence development (54 – 56), and ripening (87 – 89). Based on the results obtained, the biomass growth rate for both species in question was also determined. It was shown that the mass of shoots of spring wheat cultivated as mixed crop was {{lower than that of}} wheat shoots grown as pure crop during the stem elongation and ripening stages.

We determined the effects of various dietary treatments on whole grain and starch loss in the faeces of Angora goats. In Experiment 1 there were 4 replicates of the factorial design: (a) 2 grain types (barley, oats); (b) whole grain or processing (milled barley or rolled oats); (c) 2 roughage qualities (<b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> hay, barley straw); and (d) 2 feeding levels (level 1, 150 g/d of grain, 250 g/d of roughage; level 2, 250 g/d of grain, ad libitum roughage). In Experiment 2, which immediately followed Experiment 1, and aimed to detect carry over effects of previous feeding of barley straw and grain processing, feed levels were either 650 g/d grain or 400 g/d grain with 550 g/d <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> hay. Data were analysed by ANOVA. In Experiment 1, processing {{had no effect on}} digestible dry matter intake. The number of whole grains lost per 100 g of fresh faeces and whole grains loss as the % of grain dry matter intake were affected by an interaction between processing and roughage quality. Whole grain fed with <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> hay had greater grain loss than all other diets. Whole grain loss was greater with whole grain than with processed grain. Level of feeding had no effects on grain loss. In Experiment 2, more whole grains were lost in fresh faeces when fed with <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> hay than when fed without hay, an effect of previous feeding with barley straw reduced whole grain excretion, and more barley grains were lost than oat grain. Faecal starch was affected, with higher levels when whole barley grain was fed, particularly with <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> hay, or when previously fed barley straw at a high level. Feeding grain at 650 g/d did not increase grain or starch excretion. Whole grains represented a small loss of grain dry matter intake in faeces, averaging 0. 8 % with a maximum recorded of 2. 6 %.

40|$|Crop {{rotation}} has a {{key role}} in improving the soil and increasing the yield. Crop rotation with legumes, recycling of crop residues and the application of organic manure must form the basis of nutrient management in organic farming. Presence of legumes in rotation may serve as the primary source of nitrogen for subsequent crops. Most deficiencies in the soil are directly linked to low organic matter content. Organic matter has a very crucial significance for soil fertility improvement. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of some plants used in animal feeding on soil organic matter (SOM). For this purpose some certain plants have been selected and tested in two different rotation systems. This study was carried out in Menemen Plain, in Aegean Region, Izmir, Turkey during a period of 5 years between 2012 and 2016. Trial was set up in a randomized block design with four replications. According to the results of soil analysis, organic fertilizer containing 2 % N, 2. 5 % P 2 O 5, 2. 5 % K 2 O, 60 % organic matter and 9 / 12 C/N was given to the plots. Fertilization was carried out so as not to exceed 170 kg / ha nitrogen as stated in the organic farming law.

Based on measurements of dry matter in the aboveground parts and roots conducted at the wheat growth stages (BBCH) such as: leaf development (12 – 14), tillering (21 – 23), stem elongation (31 – 32), inflorescence emergence (54 – 56), and ripening (87 – 89), calculations of indicators such as: relative yield, relative yield total, competitive balance index and relative efficiency index, were performed. Competition between spring wheat and <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> continued from the wheat tillering stage until the end of vegetation. The strongest interactions were at the stem elongation stage (the plants competed for 95 % of the growth factors), while at the end of vegetation the competition decreased slightly (it concerned 85 % of the resources). The aboveground parts influenced one another with higher intensity than the roots. This was visible particularly well during the inflorescence emergence stage, during which the plants accumulated only 8 % of the resources in the aboveground parts, while 89 % was accumulated in the roots.

For this reason, yields of some plants suitable for Aegean Region conditions have been examined in 2 different rotation systems. In this study carried out in Menemen Plain, in Aegean Region, Izmir, Turkey during a period of 4 years between 2013 and 2016 the effect of two different rotation systems on the roughage, energy and protein feed yields in organic feed cultivation was studied.

We used a complete randomized blocks, with six replications. Defoliation was performed by grazing with lactating cows of the Jersey breed, under rotational stocking. The variables analyzed included: rate of leaf appearance, phyllochron, number of live leaves, dead and senescent, sward height and plant, length of branches / tillers, dry matter production, leaf area, leaf area index and rate dry matter accumulation. Higher rates of leaf appearance were found in shorter intervals between defoliation for both clover and for ryegrass. For <b>persian</b> <b>clover</b> larger intervals provided greater number live leaves. As for ryegrass, greater live leaves found in shorter intervals between defoliation. The leaf area index of pasture and <b>persian</b> <b>clover</b> was higher in the interval of 5, 5 leaves in the years 2009 and 2010.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} morphogenesis, structural and forage production of <b>persian</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium resupinatum L.) intercropped with ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) in the field, subjected to different heights and cutting intervals. The experiment was conducted during 2009 in the area ceded by Embrapa Clima Temperado in Cap??o do Le??o, RS. Sowing was done by throwing in plots of 8 m 2, with a density of 10 kg ha- 1 of <b>persian</b> <b>clover</b> and 15 kg ha- 1 of ryegrass. The design was randomized complete block design in a 3 x 3 factorial design with five replicates, totaling 45 experimental units. We used three cutting height, 4 cm, 8 cm and 12 cm and three cutting intervals, corresponding to the accumulation of heat 320, 420 and 520 GD. Technique was used in the branches / tillers marked and made ratings weekly in clover on count the number of leaves (open living, senescent, dead, emerged), number of nodes, plant height and length of branching, and in ryegrass on count the number of leaves (fully expanded, growing, senescent fully expanded, growing senescent dead), plant height and length of the tiller. On the occasion of the cuts was made that production of dry matter and botanical separation.

40|$|Field crop landraces are {{valuable}} genetic sources. Twenty populations of <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium resupinatum L.) collected from {{different areas of}} Iran were used in this study. DNA extractions were carried out using minipreparation method with equal amount of leaves from 30 plants of each population. DNA samples from 20 clover populations were evaluated using semi-random (ISJ) markers. Ten primers out of 30 which used IT (intron-targeting) and ET (exon-targeting) primers produced repeatable bands. Cluster analysis was conducted using NTSYS software and UPGMA method based on Jaccard's similarity matrix. Primers totally produced 111 bands, of which 93 bands (% 93) were polymorphic among clover genotypes. The greatest and least amplification fragments belonged to IT 15 - 31 and ET 18 - 4 primers, respectively. Average band number per primer was estimated 11. 1 bands. Furthermore, IT primers produced more polymorphic DNA fragments with higher resolution. Based on cluster analysis and cutting dendrogram in 0. 8 similarity coefficients, clover populations were divided into five groups in which Kazerun and Kermanshahi (1) individually formed a separate cluster. According to similarity matrix, the least similarity (% 42) belonged to Alvijan and Kazerun and the highest similarity belonged to Chegeni and Haftchin Hamedan. Clustering based on semi-specific PCR method almost substantiated the grouping based on geographical origin.

The experimental design was split-plots design with three replications. Row distances were 20, 30 and 40 cm and the herbicides were imazethapyr, imazamox and bentazone. Imazethapyr is not a suitable herbicide for weed control in <b>Persian</b> <b>clover.</b> Bentazone must be used for broad-leaved weeds such as Anagallis caerula, Matricaria chamomilla, Polygonum aviculare, Sinapis arvensis and Stellaria media.

In case of presence of wild oat (Avena sterilis) and some broad-leaved weeds such as Sinapis arvensis, Anagallis caerula, Polygonum aviculare and Stellaria media, it is thought that imazamox is useful to achieve a satisfactory seed yield. The row distance had an effect on the number of lateral branches per plant and 1000 seed weight. Herbicide applications affected the number of lateral branches per plant, the number of heads per plant and seed yield. The highest seed yields were obtained from the control, imazamox and bentazone applications and the yields were 799, 733 and 712 kg ha - 1, respectively.

In this study, the synthesis of gold nanoparticles using <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> seed extract as a natural source of both reducing and stabilizing agents, was investigated. Methods: Change {{of the color of}} clover seed extract immediately after treatment with hydrogen gold tetrachloride showed the first visible sign of the synthesis of gold nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterizeed using UV visible spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and transmission electron imaging (TEM). Results: The broad and strong peak of UV visible spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 534 nm indicated the formation of gold nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed the formation of crystalline structure of gold nanoparticles. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the involvement of aromatic, amine, and carboxyl groups exist in <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> seed extract in the synthesis of gold nanoparticles.

40|$|A {{series of}} field and {{controlled}} environment experiments aimed to quantify development and growth characteristics of arrowleaf, balansa, gland and Persian clovers for introduction to New Zealand dryland pastures. Thermal time requirements for germination were higher for arrowleaf (34 °Cd) than balansa (32 °Cd), gland (28 °Cd) and Persian (25 °Cd) clovers. <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> had an optimum germination temperature (Topt) of 33 °C {{and a maximum}} temperature (Tmax) of 45 °C, while all the other species had Topt between 16 - 20 °C and Tmax of ~ 34 °C. In field and controlled environment experiments, arrowleaf and gland clovers emerged after 90 and 96 °Cd respectively. Balansa and Persian clovers took ~ 89 °Cd to emerge when sown at soil temperatures below 12 °C. Above 12 °C, they emerged quicker at 75 °C d for balansa and 55 °C d for <b>Persian</b> <b>clover.</b> Arrowleaf clover produced its first (spade) leaf after 196 °Cd compared with balansa (169 °Cd), gland (175 °Cd) and Persian (154 °Cd) clover. Throughout all sowing dates, phyllochron was the fastest for gland (33 - 91 °Cd/leaf) and slowest for arrowleaf (53 - 116 °Cd/leaf) compared with balansa (44 - 82 °Cd/leaf) and Persian (61 - 93 °Cd/leaf) clovers. Crops sown into a decreasing photoperiod had a longer phyllochron than those sown into an increasing photoperiod. The influence of photoperiod in modification of the phyllochron affected time to axillary leaf production. A slower phyllochron resulted in longer time to the first axillary leaf. Autumn sown crops that emerged into a decreasing photoperiod had a longer thermal time requirement to flower than spring sown crops and produced more vegetative growth. Therefore, autumn sowing is recommended to maximise dry matter production. The time to flower became shorter with increasing photoperiod until the longest {{day of the year}} before it began to slow down as photoperiod decreased towards autumn. All species are long day plants, which only flower when photoperiod increases above 11. 3 hours for arrowleaf, 12. 6 hours for balansa, 10. 3 hours for gland and 15. 4 hours for <b>Persian</b> <b>clover.</b> Gland clover flowered earlier (500 – 1216 °Cd) compared with balansa (600 - 1733 °Cd), arrowleaf (940 - 1834 °Cd) and Persian (1047 - 2610 °Cd) clovers. The differences in flowering time suggests the suitability of gland clover to be grown in areas that dry out quickly in late spring, balansa clover in areas of wet winter and dry summer, and arrowleaf and Persian clovers in areas that receive high spring rainfall. In the establishment year, these annual clovers produced dry matter up to 17. 5 t/ha for balansa, 12. 5 t/ha for Persian, 11. 0 t/ha for gland and 9. 4 t/ha for arrowleaf clover. Balansa clover had the highest radiation use efficiency of 2. 1 g DM/MJ PAR absorbed followed by gland clover (1. 6 g DM/MJ PAR) then arrowleaf and Persian clovers (1. 3 g DM/MJ PAR). In the second year, regenerated dry matter production at full flower was up to 11. 6 t/ha in balansa, 8. 3 t/ha in Persian, 2. 9 t/ha in gland and 0. 5 t/ha in arrowleaf. Maximum seed production of balansa and gland clovers was 2309 and 2370 kg/ha, respectively in contrast to arrowleaf and Persian clovers which only yielded 914 and 814 kg/ha seeds. In the second year, the percentage seedling emergence from the seed population was 23 % for balansa, 19 % for Persian, 14 % for gland and 10 % for arrowleaf clover.

40|$|Weeds often form a {{major problem}} in weakly {{competitive}} vegetable crops, particularly in low input systems. Undersown cover crops can be used to suppress weeds, but often put too high a competitive pressure on the main crop. Cover crop selection is one of the potential means {{that can be used to}} design or optimize these intercropping systems. The objective of the current research was to investigate the variability among a range of clover species in morphological and physiological traits that are considered relevant for interplant competition. To this purpose, field experiments with pure stands of eight clover species (2001) and a selection of three clover species (2002) were conducted, in which regular observations and periodic harvests were taken. Clear differences in the time in which full soil cover was obtained, total accumulated biomass, growth duration, height development and N-accumulation were observed. <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium resupinatum L.) and subterranean clover (T. subterraneum L.) were the two most contrasting species in this study, particularly differing in the period in which full soil cover was obtained. Persian clover's faster soil cover could not be attributed to a single trait, but resulted from a number of intrinsic characteristics, like light extinction coefficient, light use efficiency and specific leaf area that together determine the relative growth rate. The study also demonstrated the importance of differences in relative starting position, caused by, for instance, seed size, seeding rate and fraction establishment, for the analysis of early growth characteristics. Alsike clover (T. hybridum L.), berseem clover (T. alexandrinum L) and crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.) developed slower than <b>Persian</b> <b>clover,</b> but all produced a higher amount of accumulated dry matter, due to a longer growing period. Clear differences in height and height development between species were observed. These differences were not associated with dry matter accumulation, as the tallest (red clover; 80 cm) and the shortest species (subterranean clover; 12 cm) produced similar amounts of dry matter. A strong positive correlation between early soil cover development and N-accumulation was observed.

These experiments were undertaken at the Animal and 'Irrigated Pastures Institute, Kyabram in northern Victoria in the period, 1982 to 1985. Eighteen annual species (38 lines) of the genus Trifolium were sown in 1982 as nursery plots to evaluate their potential under irrigation. A wide range of plant habit, plant growth and flowering time was observed both within and between species. This experiment was used to select species for further agronomic evaluation; those selected were T. balansae CPI 45856 (balansa clover), T. purpureum cv. Paratta (purple clover), T. resupinatum cv. Maral (<b>persian</b> <b>clover)</b> and the subterranean clover species T. brachycalycinum cv. Clare, T. subterraneum cv. Woogenellup and T. yanninicum cv. Trikkala. Pure swards of balansa clover, <b>persian</b> <b>clover</b> and a mixture of subterranean clover cultivars were sown at five times in 1983. The first four times were established by irrigation on 7 February, 28 February, 21 March and 11 April; the fifth was sown 20 June. Purple clover was included at 28 February and 20 June establishment times. Establishment was low (35 % of germinable seed sown) at the first two times of establishment when temperatures and evaporation were high. Early establishment increased the productivity of all species, by increasing autumn - winter production. Spring productivity of <b>persian</b> <b>clover</b> was superior to all other species. Irrigating into early summer maintained the growth of <b>persian</b> <b>clover</b> but not the other species. On the basis of autumn - winter growth no species demonstrated any production advantage over moderately dense sowings (50 kg of seed/ha) of the subterranean clover mixture. <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> offers a potential alternative to subterranean clover in northern Victoria. However, {{due to a lack of}} germination inhibitors, its late flowering habit and rapid germination at a wide range of temperatures, self-regeneration of <b>persian</b> <b>clover</b> is poor. A three x two factorial experiment of irrigation treatments was imposed on pure swards of subterranean clover from autumn 1982 to autumn 1985. Equal quantities of cultivars Clare, Woogenellup and Trikkala were sown. Irrigation treatments were; three times of initial irrigation, 1 February (Feb), 1 March (Mar) and 1 April (Apr), with two times of final irrigation, mid October (Oct) and mid November (Nov). Density of plants established in the regenerating years 1983, 1984 and 1985 increased as the time of initial irrigation was delayed. Within a time of initial irrigation the Nov final irrigation increased density by up to 100 %. Herbage yield was increased by early irrigation with average yields of 11. 1, 10. 3 and 9. 1 t DM/ha. year achieved for Feb, Mar and Apr treatments respectively. The Nov time of final irrigation when compared with the Oct treatment increased yield by 0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 6 t DM/ha in 1982, 1983 and 1984 respectively, with 0. 4 and 0. 9 t of this extra yield being the result of increased autumn growth in the regenerating years 1983 and 1984. In autumn 1985, the average yield advantage of the Nov treatment over the Oct treatment was 0. 5 t DM/ha for the first 40 days growth. Increased autumn growth within a time of initial irrigation was directly related to increased density of establishment. Quality of feed produced in autumn was lower than that produced in winter (In vitro dry matter digestibility (DMD) of 68 % compared with 75 %) but compared favourably with published DMD values for paspalum pastures during autumn. Digestibility in spring declined rapidly from 75 % in September, to approximately 50 % in early December. The timing of the first irrigation in autumn had no effect on the amount of seed present in mid December which averaged 5, 495, 5, 671 and 7, 818 seeds/m 2 in 1982, 1983 and 1984 respectively. Time of final irrigation in spring had a large influence on the amount of seed present in mid December with a three year average of 4, 167 for the Oct treatment and 8, 488 seeds/m 2 for the Nov treatment. Seed burial in 1982 was increased from 34 to 53 % by the Nov treatment, with no effect in either 1983 or 1984. Rainfall in summer and early autumn was the only factor to reduce the amount of seed present beween. December and the initial irrigation. There was no grazing during this peroid. Seed, present in late winter, or residual seed averaged. 20 % of the seed present in mid December. This seed was mostly 'located below ground and the amount recovered was not affected by irrigation treatment. Cultivar content was influenced by time of final irrigation, with the earlier maturing cv. Trikkala contributing a greater proportion of the seed present in the Oct than the Nov treatment. The size of seed of all cultivars was increased by both seed burial and extending the spring irrigations until mid November. When rain did not fall in the summer the proportion of permeable seed increased from approximately 20 % in mid December to 40, 60 and 70 % in Feb, Mar and Apr respectively. The level of hardseed present in late summer - early autumn provides the first limit to,achieving high densities of seedlings established in a subsequent season. However, less than 30 % of permeable seed established as seedlings at Feb and Mar times of initial irrigation. This low recovery of permeable seed poses a major limit to subterranean clover performance. Improved cultivar selection for irrigated areas may be needed to overcome these limits to early season establishment. The germination of permeable seed was measured at both 15 and 30 C in 1983 - 4 and 1984 - 5. Rates of germination of the seed of each cultivar collected in mid December of each cultivar was slow at 15 C and further depressed at 30 C. All seed collected in autumn 1984, after rainfall in January, germinated rapidly, with no effects of temperature or embryo dormancy. Rate of germination and total germination of seed collected in autumn 1985 was affected by cultivar, time of sampling and temperature. The ability of the three cultivars (Clare, Woogenellup and Trikkala) of subterranean clover to establish early in the season was assessed by placing seed either above ground or 10 mm below ground in mid February and mid April 1984. Establishment of seedlings was similar for all cultivars. In mid February, 20 % of the above ground seed and 59 % of the below ground seed appeared as seedlings. The corresponding values in mid April were 54 and 80 %. Irrigation management as it influenced seed yield, hardseededness, embryo dormancy, seed placement and the soil environment are discussed as factors limiting the establishment of subterranean clover in late - summer, early - autumn in northern Victoria. Factors influencing production of irrigated annual pastures are discussed with reference to the current limitations to pasture performance.

In general, seed germination of the weed species declined progressively with increasing concentration of the clover extracts. It was found that wild mustard exhibited the greatest sensitivity to both the legume extracts. Compared with aqueous extract, methanolic extract caused more decline in seed germination of the weeds. In addition, compared to <b>Persian</b> <b>clover,</b> Berseem clover was stronger inhibitor of seed germination. Therefore, the amounts of allelochemicals may be different in these clovers.

Forage was sampled twice at regular three to four day intervals leading up to harvest and a third time on the day of harvest. Fresh and wilted material was analyzed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Higher levels (p < 0. 05) of isoflavones biochanin A (3. 697 mg·g − 1 of dry weight) and formononetin (4. 315 mg·g − 1 of dry weight) were found in red clover than in other species. The highest isoflavone content was detected in red clover, reaching 1. 001 % of dry matter (p < 0. 05), representing a risk for occurrence of reproduction problems and inhibited secretion of animal estrogen. The phytoestrogen content was particularly increased in wilted forage. Significant isoflavone reduction was observed over three to four day intervals leading up to harvest...|$|E
40|$|The current {{dissatisfaction with}} low {{productivity}} of annual medic (Medicago spp.) pastures has highlighted {{the need to}} seek alternative legumes to provide efficient N 2 fixation in low rainfall, alkaline soil environments of southern Australia. Clover species adapted to these environments will have limited N 2 fixation if effective rhizobia are not present in sufficient quantities. A survey of 61 sites was conducted across South Australia to determine the size, distribution and effectiveness of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii (clover rhizobia) populations resident in these low rainfall, alkaline soil environments. Clover rhizobia were detected at 56 of the sites, with a median density of 230 – 920 rhizobia/g soil. Most rhizobial populations were poor in their capacity to fix nitrogen. Rhizobial populations from fields provided 11 – 89 % and 10 – 85 % of the shoot biomass of commercial reference strains when inoculated onto host legumes T. purpureum (purple clover) and T. resupinatum (<b>persian</b> <b>clover),</b> respectively. Rhizobial population size was correlated negatively to pH {{and the percentage of}} CaCO 3 in the soil, and was significantly increased in the rhizospheres of naturalised clover, found at 17 sites. Management options for rhizobial populations to improve legume diversity and productivity are discussed in terms of rhizobial population dynamics and likely soil constraints to successful rhizobial colonisation...|$|E
40|$|Tillage and {{semiarid}} Mediterranean {{climatic conditions}} accelerate {{soil organic matter}} losses in Spanish vineyards. Previous studies showed that cover crops can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) in Mediterranean vineyards. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the influence of two different cover crops in the short term on soil C sequestration in a semiarid vineyard and to study the potential use of both β–glucosidase enzimatic activity (GLU) and the GLU/SOC ratio in order to assess the SOC increase. The experiment was carried out in a cv. Tempranillo (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard on a Oxyaquic Xerorthent soil in Rioja winegrowing region (NE, Spain). The experimental design was established in 2009 with three treatments: conventional tillage; sown barley cover crop (Hordeum vulgare, L.); sown <b>Persian</b> <b>clover</b> cover crop (Trifolium resupinatum L.). Carbon in the aboveground biomass with each cover crop was monitored. Soil was sampled in June 2011 and June 2012, and SOC, GLU and the GLU/SOC ratio were determined. After 3 years both cover crops increased SOC at soil surface with C sequestration rates of 0. 47 and 1. 19 t C ha- 1 yr- 1 for BV and CV respectively. GLU and GLU/SOC ratio increased in both cover crops at 0 - 5 cm soil depth. The C sequestration rates and GLU were related to the cover crops aboveground biomass. In consequence, in semiarid vineyards under cover crops GLU could be an appropriate indicator to asses the increase of SOC and the soil quality improvement in the short-term (2 - 3 years) ...|$|E
