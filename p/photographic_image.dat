To this end, we describe a method for differentiating between photorealistic and <b>photographic</b> <b>images.</b> Specifically, we show that a statistical model based on first- and higher-order wavelet statistics reveals subtle but significant differences between photorealistic and <b>photographic</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

25|$|JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format {{can produce}} a smaller file than PNG for {{photographic}} (and photo-like) images, since JPEG uses a lossy encoding method specifically designed for <b>photographic</b> <b>image</b> data, which is typically dominated by soft, low-contrast transitions, and an amount of noise or similar irregular structures. Using PNG instead of a high-quality JPEG for such images {{would result in a}} large increase in filesize with negligible gain in quality. In comparison, when storing images that contain text, line art, or graphics – images with sharp transitions and large areas of solid color – the PNG format can compress image data more than JPEG can. Additionally, PNG is lossless, while JPEG produces noticeable visual artifacts around high-contrast areas. Where an image contains both sharp transitions and photographic parts, a choice must be made between the two effects. JPEG does not support transparency.|$|E

When her father is murdered {{on the street and}} leaves behind numerous debts, she refuses an arranged marriage to an older suitor, declaring that she will work to support her family, even if she has to take to the stage like her aunt, who is a renowned singer. She decides to use her classical education and advertise her services as a governess, transforming herself into Mary Blackchurch - a Protestant of partial Italian descent - in order to conceal her heritage. She quickly accepts a position as governess for a Scottish family living on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides. Patriarch Charles Cavendish is a man of science intent on solving the problem of retaining a <b>photographic</b> <b>image</b> on paper, while his pretentious wife flounders in a sea of ennui.

500|$|During the Victorian period, {{the art of}} book {{illustration}} gained popularity, supported {{through the}} work of wood engravers. Woodcut extended back centuries in Europe and further in Asia. Typically the parts to be printed in black were left in relief by the carver, allowing illustrations to be printed along with the text. Thomas Bewick developed the technique in the 18th century and [...] "perfected the process that was used extensively throughout the 19th century, which necessitated the use of hardwood blocks and tools for metal engraving". The preferred method of relief engraving had been {{to work with the}} grain on the plank side of a block; however Bewick worked {{the end of the block}} and carved against the grain using a burin. Bewick passed his techniques to apprentices, including Landells, who in turn passed them to Evans.

Comedy Central was required to pay royalties to the photographer of the picture used for Hasselhoff's head, but was not required to pay Hasselhoff himself. [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] displayed notable improvements in South Parks animation, which was gradually improving throughout the first season and settling into the defined look the series has maintained throughout the years. One of the exterior scenes in [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] featured the first perspective angle of a street, which were previously only shown sideways or straight angles. Additionally, the simulated rain during a scene with Wendy watching Ms. Ellen and Stan from outside a restaurant was far more sophisticated than any such animation in previous episodes.|$|E
40|$|Distinguishing between natural {{photography}} and photorealistic computer graphics] © BRAND X PICTURES Given {{the ability of}} photorealistic computer graphics (photorealistic CG) to emulate <b>photographic</b> <b>images,</b> as seen in movies and the print media today, {{there is little doubt}} that uninformed viewers can easily mistake photorealistic computer- generated graphics for <b>photographic</b> <b>images.</b> In fact, there was already evidence 20 years ago [1] that to the naked eye certain computer graphics were visually indistinguishable from <b>photographic</b> <b>images.</b> Such convincing photorealism qualifies computer graphics as a form Digital Object Identifier 10. 1109 /MSP. 2008. 931077 of image forgery that can be unscrupulously exploited.

In the subproblem to which the widest path problem applies, two images have already {{been transformed into a}} common coordinate system; the remaining task is to select a seam, a curve that passes through the region of overlap and divides one of the two images from the other. Pixels {{on one side of the}} seam will be copied from one of the images, and pixels on the other side of the seam will be copied from the other image. Unlike other compositing methods that average pixels from both images, this produces a valid <b>photographic</b> <b>image</b> of every part of the region being photographed. They weight the edges of a grid graph by a numeric estimate of how visually apparent a seam across that edge would be, and find a bottleneck shortest path for these weights. Using this path as the seam, rather than a more conventional shortest path, causes their system to find a seam that is difficult to discern at all of its points, rather than allowing it to trade off greater visibility in one part of the image for lesser visibility elsewhere.|$|E
