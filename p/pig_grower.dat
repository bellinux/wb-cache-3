50|$|In 2007, {{when the}} first issue of Prijatelji (comics) was re-printed, {{character}} of Mile Betmen was added to the crew. He was more than obvious parody to DC Comics's Batman with big beer belly and role of masked avenger and <b>pig</b> <b>grower.</b> His appearance brought another value to the series, but when second issue of Prijatelji (comics) appeared in the same year, entitled Harmonija u zemlji bedaka (''''Harmony in the Land of bummer''''), on its pages were more improvement, both in drawing style and story telling. What is interesting with this publication is that the amount of characters has expanded and so the stories gain more than just fights and pranks among the characters. Female characters are also brought in, and series started to gets more on emotional bases, but clashes and animosities that featured in the first issue were still present but crafted with more taste and moderation.|$|E

Both Jett and sugarcane final molasses (SFM) were used in combination as an energy source in the diets. Dietary inclusion levels of Jett/SFM g. kg- 1 DM for treatments were: 100 / 100, 200 / 0, 259 / 259, and 517 / 0 labeled, T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4, respectively. A commercial <b>pig</b> <b>grower</b> feed was used as the control (labeled T 0) representing the standard cereal based diet fed. The five treatments were replicated four times. These treatments were randomly allocated to the twenty pens in a complete randomized design. There were significant differences (P 0. 858), hot carcass weight (P> 0. 065), dressing % (P> 0. 118) and loin eye area (P> 0. 883) among treatments. No significant differences (P> 0. 454) was observed among treatments for haemoglobin, MCHC, and white blood cell count. Glucose (P< 0. 023), ALT (P< 0. 028), total protein (P< 0. 049) and blood urea (P< 0. 048) showed significant treatments effects. The values obtained for ALT, AST and Alkaline phosphate indicated that there was normal functioning of the spleen, kidney, and liver for all treatments.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the bacterial and fungal flora of dust deposits in a newly built <b>pig</b> <b>grower</b> finisher building. Viable bacterial counts and microbial species found in a barn which had never housed pigs were compared with those in a barn housing 144 pigs. METHODS [...] The quantitative streak plate method was used to measure viable bacterial counts on nutrient agar or sheep blood agar. Viable bacterial counts of the dust deposits were expressed as the number of colony forming units (CFUs) /mg of dust. Gram positive cocci and Gram negative bacilli were identified by an automated system. Identifications with a confidence interval > 90 % were accepted at the species level. Fungi were identified to the genus level with slide culture preparations on cereal agar. RESULTS [...] The lowest viable bacterial count (4. 8 x 10 (4) /mg of dust) was found in the barn with no pigs. In the barn with pigs the highest viable bacterial count (2. 1 x 10 (6) /mg of dust) was in dust from the top of a partition close to pig activity. Six species of bacteria or fungi were found in dust from the room with no pigs, whereas 22 different microorganisms were detected in dust from the room with pigs. With the exception of Enterobacter agglomerans no other species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was found in dust deposits in this new pig building. Twelve species of Gram positive bacteria were found in the room housing pigs. CONCLUSIONS [...] The pig is not only a source but also a disperser of airborne bacteria in pig buildings. Speciation of the microbial flora in dust from the pig building suggests that many of the microorganisms were either of human or environmental origin. Nevertheless as some of these microorganisms are known opportunistic pathogens or allergens and because of the documented increased incidence of chronic respiratory symptoms in pig workers, precautions to reduce inhalation of microbial or dust particles by pig workers seem prudent...|$|E

They become viremic for approximately 2 weeks and if infected in the last trimester of gestation, the virus crosses the placenta to infect the fetuses. Pigs, in utero, develop a prolonged viremia resulting in poor viability and death. Affected sows often farrow mummified, stillborn, weak-born, and normal pigs around days 107 - 109 of gestation. Weak-born piglets are usually born viremic and remain viremic for 3 or more weeks. Becausesows and gilts may be infected early in the last trimester and viremia in adults is transient, they may not be viremic at farrowing. 2) On endemically infected farms where reproduction has returned to pre-PRRSlevels, the primary clinical problems occur in the nursery and <b>grower</b> <b>pigs.</b> z, 3 Mostpiglets will not be born viremic, but may contact the virus when commingled with viremic nursery or <b>grower</b> <b>pigs.</b> Mild to moderate respiratory distress with minimal coughing in nursery and <b>grower</b> <b>pigs</b> is the most common clinical sign in uncomplicated endemic PRRS.

Pathology in the affected spinal cords {{and to a lesser}} extent in the brainstem was characterised by pronounced inflammation and neuronophagia in the grey matter. Molecular investigation using a pan-virus microarray identified a virus related to porcine sapelovirus (PSV) in the spinal cord of the two affected pigs examined. Analysis of 802 nucleotides of the virus polymerase gene showed the highest homology with those of viruses in the genus Sapelovirus of Picornaviridae. This PSV, strain G 5, shared 91 - 93 %, 67 - 69 % and 63 % nucleotide homology with porcine, simian and avian sapeloviruses, respectively.

The average daily gain (ADG) and selected blood parameters were not affected by the addition to basal diet of either acids and tannin or of organic acids alone. Selected blood parameters remained within the reference range before and after the feeding trial, with the exception of total serum proteins that were below the lower value of reference range at both times. The significant changes (paired t-test) observed in individual groups before and after the feeding trial are related to the growth of pigs. Conclusion Diet with acids and tannin did not improve the growth performance of <b>grower</b> <b>pigs</b> but had no deleterious effects on selected blood parameters. The possibility of beneficial effects of adding acids and tannin in diets on growth performance over a longer period, however, could not be excluded. </p...|$|R
40|$|Changing {{demand for}} {{livestock}} products has motivated {{transformation in the}} structure of agrifood systems to efficiently deliver products with the desired attributes. Consumers of food from animal-sources are increasingly concerned about food safety, due to recent food scares from food-borne diseases or zoonoses. In cases where there are weak or nonexistant public standards to regulate food safety compliance along the supply chain for animal-source foods (eg by farmers, traders, processors, retailers) private standards have emerged. Private standards by definition are voluntary, but they may in practice become de facto mandatory standards where compliance is required for entry into certain markets. Using insights from available literature and empirical evidence from case studies on the pig sectors in Vietnam and the Philippines, this paper looks at private standards and the role they play in improving the delivery of safe, good quality, pork. The specific case of contract farming is used to illustrate how this form of market organisation and coordination can facilitate the innovation of processes for upgrading smallholders and enhance their competitiveness in an increasingly consumer demand-driven food system. The main focus of private standards is management of food safety risk along the value chain in order to achieve a higher level of assurance in terms of regulatory compliance, and to capture price premiums and market share of the ‘certified’ product. In most cases, private standards are implemented at the production and processing stage. However, the cost of implementing these standards is considerably high and as such may not be economically viable for small farm businesses. Contract farming is a form of market organisation that acts as a mechanism for establishing and implementing private standards to produce products with the attributes desired by consumers. In the developing country context, suppliers of products (eg <b>pig</b> <b>growers)</b> are required to follow specific process (eg specific types of inputs used, adhering to specific production practices, etc) and performance standards (eg feed-conversion ratio, mortality rates, etc). Non-compliance will result in penalties such as price discounts for pigs. The use of private standards is seen as a potentially effective strategy to jumpstart local innovation for the adoption and adaptation of new norms to enhance food safety and improve product quality...|$|R
40|$|Fifty {{crossbred}} (Large White x Landrace x Duroc) female finisher pigs {{were used}} to determine the effect of nutritional manipulations on intramuscular fat deposition. The main nutritional treatments were (i) Control (pigs fed a commercial grower diet), (ii) - 15 % P:DE (pigs fed a 15 % reduced protein:digestible energy diet during the grower phase), (iii) - 30 % P:DE (pigs fed a 30 % reduced P:DE diet during the grower phase), (iv) + 6 % Fat (pigs fed diet supplemented with 6 % additional fat during the grower phase), and (v) -Vit A (pigs fed a control diet with no supplemented Vit A in the mineral vitamin premix during the grower and finisher phase). Pigs fed the 30 % reduced P:DE diet had an inferior feed to liveweight gain (feed conversion ratio, FCR) for the combined grower and finisher growth period (P = 0. 036) compared with the other dietary treatments. There {{were no significant differences in}} average daily gain (ADG) or voluntary feed intake (VFI) for the grower, finisher, and the combined grower and finisher phases, or liveweight at slaughter between the dietary treatments. Pigs fed the 15 % (1. 9 %) and 30 % (2. 7 %) reduced P:DE diet, and the Vit A-restricted diet (2. 0 %), had significantly higher intramuscular fat (IMF) levels compared with pigs fed the other diets. Pigs fed the control diet had higher (P = 0. 002) carcass dressing percentage compared with pigs fed the other diets. There were no significant dietary effects on total fat tissue (P = 0. 661), total lean muscle tissue (P = 0. 637), and total bone mineral (P = 0. 367) content. In conclusion, these data indicate that feeding <b>pigs</b> <b>grower</b> diets with 15 % and 30 % reduced P:DE, and grower and finisher diets restricted in Vit A, improved the IMF levels in the Longissimus muscle. The increase in IMF levels in pigs fed the 15 % reduced P:DE diet, and grower and finisher diets restricted in Vit A, improved the IMF levels without having a detrimental effect on growth performance and carcass quality...|$|R
40|$|A {{serological}} {{survey of}} pig sera from six regional areas throughout New Zealand indicated that 60 % had titres to Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona and 13 % to serovar tarassovi. Pig sera from the North Island districts had higher titres to pomona {{than those from}} the South Island districts, however the converse was true for titres to tarassovi. A serological survey of bacon weight pigs at slaughter revealed that 60 % had titres to pomona, 53 % to bratislava, while titres to tarassovi were undetectable. There was no significant linear association between the magnitude of corresponding pomona and bratislava titres. Pomona was isolated from 53 % of pigs kidneys, however attempts to isolate bratislava were unsuccessful. The median prevalence of infection in bacon pigs from farms with endemic pomona infection, {{at the time of}} slaughter was 80 %. A retrospective study of farming practices revealed that vaccination of breeding pigs had no effect on the infection status of their <b>grower</b> <b>pigs</b> at slaughter. It was also found that farms which reared their <b>grower</b> <b>pigs</b> to pork weight for slaughter were free of leptospiral infection, as were farms with less than fifty breeding sows. Cross sectional serological and cultural prevalence studies of <b>grower</b> <b>pigs</b> on farms with endemic pomona infection revealed that pigs less than ten weeks of age were not leptospiruric and had low or undetectable titres to pomona. Pigs between ten and twenty weeks of age showed an increasing prevalence of both leptospiruria and pomona titres. Further prospective studies indicated that piglets acquire passive immunity from their dams, which has a half life of around sixteen days. The majority of pigs less than fourteen weeks of age appear to be resistant to infection, thereafter the level of their passive immunity wanes and they become infected and leptospiruric. The weekly incidence of leptospiruria for pigs in an infected grower house was usually between 10 % and 20 %. Following infection, the intensity of leptospiruria was greatest in the first three to four weeks and it lasted for at least six weeks. Infection is believed to occur by both direct and indirect transmission of leptospires between infected and susceptible pigs. It was shown that <b>grower</b> <b>pigs</b> are at the centre of the endemic cycle of infection which is perpetuated by the transmission of infection from older infected pigs to younger susceptible pigs. This cycle of endemic infection can persist independently of the breeding herd. Experimental evidence following the artificial exposure of <b>grower</b> <b>pigs</b> to either serovar pomona or bratislava supported an hypothesis that the occurrence of bratislava titres were associated with early infection of pigs with serovar pomona. The heterologous titres were believed to be a serological cross reaction with homologous IgM antibody to which pigs had been exposed. Experimental evidence demonstrated that leptospires could survive in droplets of less than 50 um, however hamsters exposed to a leptospiral aerosol containing droplets of less than 50 um failed to become infected. Infection via the intranasal route in both hamsters and pigs showed that the infective dose of pomona was between 104 and 106 leptospires, indicating the intranasal route as a natural route for infection. Transmission of infection could therefore occur directly by infective droplets lodging in the nasal cavity. The vaccination of pigs, commencing at ten weeks of age on a farm with endemic pomona infection, revealed that multiple inoculations of a commercially available bacterin can be used to control the level of endemic infection within a <b>grower</b> <b>pig</b> herd. There was evidence to suggest that persistent passive immunity in young pigs could interfere with the efficacy of vaccination. A computer simulation model of endemic pomona infection in a pig herd [Simulated Leptospiral Infection within a Pig herd, SLIP 89] was developed using the results of investigations described in this thesis by sequentially breaking down the cycle of endemic pomona infection into a series of logical events. The model repeats a number of predetermined independent and dependant events for each pig within a simulated herd. The outcome of each event is randomly determined from an appropriately selected probability distribution. Each cycle of repetition represents one week in time. The outcome generated by the simulation can be used to observe varying patterns of infection which are due to either the element of chance or the alteration of key variables within the model. The results generated by the SLIP 89 must be viewed with the structure and limitations of the model in mind...|$|R

40|$|Antibiotic usage {{in animals}} as a growth {{promoter}} is considered as public health issue {{due to its}} negative impact on consumer health and environment. The present study aimed to evaluate effectiveness of herbal residue (ginger, Zingiber officinale, dried rhizome powder) and prebiotic (inulin) {{as an alternative to}} antibiotics by comparing fecal microflora composition using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. The <b>grower</b> <b>pigs</b> were offered feed containing antibiotic (tetracycline), ginger and inulin separately and un-supplemented group served as control. The study revealed significant changes in the microbial abundance based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among the groups. Presumptive identification of organisms was established based on the fragment length of OTUs generated with three restriction enzymes (MspI, Sau 3 AI and BsuRI). The abundance of OTUs representing Bacteroides intestinalis, Eubacterium oxidoreducens, Selonomonas sp., Methylobacterium sp. and Denitrobacter sp. was found significantly greater in inulin supplemented pigs. Similarly, the abundance of OTUs representing Bacteroides intestinalis, Selonomonas sp., and Phascolarcobacterium faecium was found significantly greater in ginger supplemented pigs. In contrast, the abundance of OTUs representing pathogenic microorganisms Atopostipes suicloacalis and Bartonella quintana str. Toulouse was significantly reduced in ginger and inulin supplemented pigs. The OTUs were found to be clustered under two major phylotypes; ginger-inulin and control-tetracycline. Additionally, the abundance of OTUs was similar in ginger and inulin supplemented pigs. The results suggest the potential of ginger and prebioticsto replace antibiotics in the diet of <b>grower</b> <b>pig...</b>|$|R

In 1998, 6 single-site farrow-to-finish swine farms with at least 100 sows, identified previously at slaughter as having a high prevalence of Salmonella infection, were selected for study. Between March and October 1998, each farm was visited 4 times. On each visit, 60 - 150 pigs were sampled, from various age groups (pre-weaning <b>pigs,</b> nursery, <b>grower,</b> finisher, sows). Overnight trapping was conducted to collect rodents, cats, and arthropods. Fecal samples were obtained from pigs, rodents and cats. Environmental samples of water, feed, boots and pen floor material were also obtained. Samples were cultured for Salmonella using tetrathionate broth, followed by Rappaport 2 ̆ 7 s medium for enrichment. Salmonella was detected in every reservoir for which at least 20 samples were available. Salmonella was detected in the feces of sows and finishing pigs on each farm, and in pen floor samples on 5 of the 6 farms. The overall prevalence of Salmonella in swine fecal samples was 2. 8...|$|R

Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material. Alternatively, a straw-lined shed may house a larger group (i.e. not batched) in age groups.|$|R
