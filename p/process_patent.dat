25|$|Between 1933 and 1934 {{not only}} Haworth and Edmund Hirst had {{synthesized}} vitamin C, but also, independently, Tadeus Reichstein succeeded in synthesizing the vitamin in bulk, {{making it the}} first vitamin to be artificially produced. The latter process made possible the cheap mass-production of semi-synthetic vitamin C, which was quickly marketed. Only Haworth was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize in Chemistry in part for this work, but the Reichstein process, a combined chemical and bacterial fermentation sequence still used today to produce vitamin C, retained Reichstein's name. In 1934 Hoffmann–La Roche, which bought the Reichstein <b>process</b> <b>patent,</b> became the first pharmaceutical company to mass-produce and market synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name of Redoxon.|$|E

40|$|Under {{the open}} {{innovation}} paradigm, technology transfer of <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> {{is one of}} the most important mechanisms for manufacturing companies to implement process innovation and enhance the competitive edge. To achieve promising technology transfers, we need to evaluate the feasibility of <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> and optimally select the most appropriate patent according to the actual manufacturing situation. Hence, this paper proposes an optimal selection method of <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> using multiple criteria decision-making and 2 -tuple fuzzy linguistic computing to avoid information loss during the processes of evaluation integration. An evaluation index system for technology transfer feasibility of <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> is designed initially. Then, fuzzy linguistic computing approach is applied to aggregate the evaluations of criteria weights for each criterion and corresponding subcriteria. Furthermore, performance ratings for subcriteria and fuzzy aggregated ratings of criteria are calculated. Thus, we obtain the overall technology transfer feasibility of patent alternatives. Finally, a case study of aeroengine turbine manufacturing is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|This article first {{traces the}} origins of and legal {{developments}} concerning <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> leading {{up to this point}} and examine the rationales for distinct approaches to various kinds of innovation in biomedical processes. Analysis of the evolution of judicial and statutory standards relevant to <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> demonstrates how courts have created and altered analytical frameworks to adapt to advances in biomedical innovation. It shows how new questions arising from biotechnology patents revitalized the centuries-old natural phenomenon doctrine as a final resort for reining in increasingly expansive patentability standards for biomedical processes. In doing so, this paper examines the applicability of Mayo v. Prometheus to Myriad. It argues that the evolution of laws controlling <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> have converged on subject-matter eligibility in a way that no longer requires a distinction between product and <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> in the field of biotechnology. After demonstrating that the requirements for biomedical <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> have gradually narrowed after a widely criticized expansion, and that the legal and public policy rationales for limiting such patents are inseparably related to some biomedical product patents in general and gene patents specifically, the article concludes that the legal status of gene patents and similar biotechnology should adequately account for the controlling law on diagnostic <b>process</b> <b>patents.</b> Once the Supreme Court issues its ruling, the conclusion will be updated with an analysis of the ruling’s implications for diagnostic biotechnology moving forward, considering how the Court’s ruling might be implemented {{in a way that is}} mindful of the narrowing product-process distinction described...|$|R

40|$|Approximately {{a decade}} ago, the Swedish {{research}} institutes transformed to private corporate entities {{due to a}} decision from the Swedish government. The purpose of the thesis is to investigate the role that <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> can play during this transformation for the pulp and paper research sector. For this, we have focused our analysis on the relation and dependence between the business strategy and the patent strategy to enable such a transformation. The results indicate that <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> are problematic tools for business strategies to facilitate the transformation due to the difficulty in monitoring and proving infringement. The conclusion of the thesis is that <b>process</b> <b>patents</b> are not sufficient tools for business strategies to enable a good transformation; {{there is also a}} necessity for a close connection between the patent strategy and the business strategy combined with additional strategies to protect and extract value from surrounding knowhow.

Dawson did not stop engaging in this business after the patent issued, and it sold propanil in packages labeled with instructions to use it as described in the patent. Accordingly, Rohm & Haas sued Dawson for contributory infringement and active inducement of infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(c)-(d).
