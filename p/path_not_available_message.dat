However, links in mmWave networks are highly susceptible to blocking and may suffer from rapid variations in quality. Connectivity to multiple cells - both in the mmWave and in the traditional lower frequencies - is thus considered essential for robust connectivity. However, {{one of the challenges}} in supporting multi-connectivity in the mmWave space is the requirement for the network to track the direction of each link in addition to its power and timing. With highly directional beams and fast varying channels, this directional tracking may be the main bottleneck in realizing robust mmWave networks.

Furthermore, in increasingly heterogeneous and multi-modal DTNs with a plethora of name spaces, a message source {{may not always be}} able to pre-determine the specific network address for a destination (as with DNS) or the mode of communication to reach it. In this paper, we describe a disruptiontolerant architecture and use cases for persistent message delivery to descriptively named destinations. We propose an intentional naming scheme that allows destinations to be described by their attributes (e. g., roles, services, or location) and predicates on them rather than by specific network identifiers. An intentional name denotes, in essence, a query on one or more namespaces which can result in specific endpoint identifiers (EID) of appropriate destination nodes. In our architecture, since it may not be possible to bind an intentional name to specific EID(s) at source, its resolution is deferred until the message is routed to one or more nodes that can successfully complete the process. We present a distributed progressive resolution procedure called GRAIN that persistently delivers messages to intentional names with geographic and role attributes, e. g., ”First responders within a kilometer of a specified location”.
