25|$|Given the well-recognized role of {{cholesterol}} in cardiovascular disease, {{some studies have}} shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes. In the Framingham Heart Study, in subjects over 50 years of age, they found an 11% increase overall and 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1mg/dL per year drop in total cholesterol levels. The researchers attributed this phenomenon {{to the fact that}} people with severe chronic diseases or cancer tend to have below-normal cholesterol levels. This explanation is not supported by the Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and <b>Promotion</b> <b>Programme,</b> in which men of all ages and women over 50 with very low cholesterol were likely to die of cancer, liver diseases, and mental diseases. This result indicates the low-cholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents, contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts of older people that this is a proxy or marker for frailty occurring with age.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Health {{problems}} {{emanating from}} sexual behaviour include HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections among adolescents are considered high in South Africa. Also, {{the burden of}} unplanned pregnancies has wider implications in society. These problems occur {{in spite of a}} number of different sexual health <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes.</b> The aim {{of the study was to}} view the perception of high school teenagers to sexual health <b>promotions</b> <b>programmes</b> as well as their response to these programmes. The objectives of the study were: 1. To explore the perceptions of local teenagers regarding the content and materials used in local health <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> 2. To explore the perceptions of local teenagers regarding the communication strategies and style used in local health <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> 3. To explore the perceptions of local teenagers regarding the impact of local health <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> on their behaviour Method This was a qualitative study. The study population was high school teenagers from the Whittlesea townships in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Fourteen purposefully selected teenagers from the seven high schools were individually interviewed. Analysis was done using the framework method. Results The study showed that the content of sexual health <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> to which high school teenagers in Whittlesea were exposed to composed of sexual health education and the building of life skills. Perception of the messages in these contents was influenced by lack of communication on sexual matters within individual families and religious beliefs of participants. The programmes were considered to be practical and helpful. Methods that involved teenagers’ participation or interaction were generally preferred and the communication style was perceived as facilitating behavioural/attitudinal change. Conclusion In order for adolescent sexual health <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> to be effective, they should employ methods that involve participation and human interaction. The involvement of parents, role models, religious groups and community services in sexual health promotion could be helpful in promoting sexual health education and lifestyle change amongst teenagers...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (International Commerce)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Internationalisation has {{required}} companies to look outside their domestic markets and also utilize opportunities internationally. Companies {{are engaging in}} export activities to pursue greater market share and growth in profits. Countries also benefit from increased exports by earning more foreign exchange and creating more employment opportunities. Therefore governments and other private entities are providing export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> which are designed to encourage companies to promote the exports {{of goods and services}} in foreign markets. When assistance to promote exports is provided, it is important to evaluate how effectively the limited government resources are spent and applied. Such evaluation of export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> will enable public policy-makers to expand those programmes that are more effective. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the Return on Investment (ROI) of some of the export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> provided by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The relationship between the total cost of export assistance and actual export sales for national pavilions and trade missions were evaluated. These two programmes are the largest in the DTl's Export Marketing and Investment Assistance (EMIA) scheme. Evaluation measures or criteria which have been successfully implemented by four other countries were examined in order to make practical recommendations to the DTI on how to implement appropriate criteria for the evaluation of these export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes.</b> The results of this study yielded that the ROI per sector for national pavilions and trade missions produced positive results. For sustainable export growth, however, the DTI will have to develop new criteria for the evaluation of export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes.</b> It should also focus more on the manufacturing and services industries to increase the export volumes and obtain higher ROI of government spending in export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes.</b> Master...|$|R

40|$|Export {{marketing}} support services {{offered by the}} government and other agencies, particularly in developing countries, seem well-suited to exporting firms for their involvement in foreign markets. The effects of governmental export {{marketing support}} on firms' exporting activity is found a limited researched issue in international marketing, particularly the measurement of the effects of export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> (EPPs). Such programmes specifically are directed at assisting exporters' export market entry.;The study addresses the role and effectiveness of export marketing support as the acquisition of such support is influenced by management's orientation and information search and use behaviour (Reid, 1984; Katiskeas and Piercy, 1993). The analysis involves:; 1 - A comparison of the sample groups of programmes' users (UEP) and programmes' non-users (NUEP).; 2 - A detailed investigation of the export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> (EPPs) in export market entry.;Overall, the thesis findings suggest that certain behavioural differences exist between firms using export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> (EPPs) in their export market entry and the firms not using EPPs. But no difference was found as far as export performance of both sample groups is concerned. However, users of programmes seem more organised and proactive in export marketing activity.;Measurement of the effectiveness of export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> (EPPs), however, appears complicated by a variety of factors which could not be clearly attributed to the use of EPPs. Such programmes are seen as having a lasting effect on the exporting firms' export market involvement.;Although the role of export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> must be seen as complementary to firms' export marketing efforts in general, these are accorded importance in export market entry...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the network promotion role of export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> in driving small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs) export performance. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on a dual institutional and network-based approaches to internationalisation, the study tests an integrative model that explores the mediating role of SMEs’ relationships in the link between government export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> (both informational and experiential forms) and export performance. The model was tested using a sample of 160 UK small and medium exporter firms. The data were analysed through a structural equation modelling technique. Findings The study finds that whilst both informational and experiential export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> improved all forms of SMEs’ relationships, only experiential forms had an indirect effect on export performance. Further, only relationships with foreign buyers had a positive impact on export performance. Research limitations/implications The results of this research provide directions for export promotion organisations in targeting their network support provision and for SMEs in utilising such a support. The study calls for similar research in different contexts to validate the proposed model. Originality/value This study brings novel findings to the extant literature by conceptualising and validating the importance of the “network promotion” element of export <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Health Promoting Schools concept helps {{schools to}} promote health in a {{sustainable}} and long-term fashion. However, developing {{the capacity to}} promote health in this way can be challenging when a busy teaching curriculum must be fulfilled.

Semi-structured qualitative interviews were audio-taped with primary school teachers in one Irish county and transcribed verbatim. The resulting transcripts were analysed using content analysis. Thirty-one teachers were interviewed. The factors which may adversely affect the acceptability of health <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> include the: attitude of teachers towards an additional extra-curricular workload; lack of confidence amongst teachers to lead health promotion; and different organisational cultures between schools. When health <b>promotion</b> <b>programmes</b> under the Health Promoting Schools concept are being implemented, it’s important to consider: the readiness for change amongst teachers; the resources available to increase staff capacity to promote health; {{and the ability of}} a programme to adapt to the different organisational cultures between schools...|$|R
