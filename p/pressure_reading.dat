5|$|The 1846Havana {{hurricane}} {{was likely}} of Category5 intensity, {{the earliest known}} tropical cyclone of its strength to strike Cuba. In 1993, the weather historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás analyzed an anomalous atmospheric pressure of 916mbar (27.06inHg) measured at Havana upon the vessel Thames, deeming it to be abnormally low and evaluating its true value {{to be closer to}} 938mbar (27.70inHg), making the hurricane the most intense in recorded history at the time. The exceptionally low <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> in Cuba surpassed a previous record of 948mbar (28.00inHg) set by an 1844storm, with the new record eventually exceeded by the 1924 Cuba hurricane, which featured a manually recorded <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> of 932mbar (27.52inHg).|$|E
5|$|Dan {{crossed over}} the island and emerged into the South China Sea, having lost its eye feature and {{weakened}} back into a tropical storm. Convection soon redeveloped as the storm moved northwestward through warm waters. The JTWC reports that Dan reattained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on October 12, although it according to the JMA it did so 24 hours earlier. The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph). The JMA indicates that Dan peaked slightly afterward, with 10-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a minimum barometric <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> of 960 millibars.|$|E

5|$|The area of {{disturbed}} {{weather that}} would soon become Chantal began in a large envelope of low pressure {{on the morning of}} September 10. The disturbed weather, nested off the coast of Bermuda, was one of the remnants of an old frontal trough that had extended from Hispaniola to the central north Atlantic Ocean. This particular area of disturbed weather become part of the northeast portion of a low-pressure system. On September 10, a reconnaissance aircraft found sustained winds of 30mph (50km/h) and a 1010millibar (29.83inHg) <b>pressure</b> <b>reading.</b> This reading indicated the system developed into the fifth tropical depression of the 1983 season.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Fourteen was {{the last}} {{tropical}} depression of the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season and was the third most destructive storm of the year. The depression formed on October 31, 1987 in the Caribbean Sea, heading along a northward path into the southern Gulf of Mexico and into Florida until the system was absorbed on November 4. The path and damage from the depression followed a similar path to Hurricane Floyd earlier in October. The depression peaked in intensity with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h) on November 1 with a minimal barometric <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> of 1004millibars (29.65 inHg). However, certain barometric readings have considered that the depression may have become a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a hurricane on September13, Odile began to accelerate towards the north-northwest {{in the direction of}} the Baja California Peninsula under the influence of both a strengthening mid-level ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and an upper-level low to the northwest. Following the formation of an eye, Odile began a phase of rapid intensification. Odile attained Category 2 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 00:00UTC on September14. Six hours later, the cyclone had reached Category4 intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 918mbar (hPa; 27.11inHg), a pressure typical for a Category 5 hurricane. At the time, this <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> was tied for the sixth-lowest on record for an east Pacific hurricane. Even though additional deepening was forecast, strengthening leveled off thereafter as an eyewall replacement cycle, common in intense hurricanes, began to run its course. Despite the leveling off in intensity, a United States Air Force aircraft reconnaissance flight observed a barometric pressure of 922mbar (hPa; 27.23inHg); this measurement was the lowest <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> officially measured throughout Odile's existence. Nonetheless, the eroding of the hurricane's inner core due to the eyewall replacement cycle resulted in gradual weakening after peak intensity. Still maintaining its north-northwesterly course with little deviation, Odile made landfall near Cabo San Lucas at 04:45UTC on September15 with winds of 125mph (205km/h) and a central pressure of 941 mbar (hPa; 27.79 inHg). The wind estimates tie Odile with Hurricane Olivia in 1967 as the strongest tropical cyclone to move ashore Baja California Sur in the satellite era.|$|E
5000|$|Speed shear is less critical, {{but should}} be {{relatively}} uniform. The wind speed difference between the surface and vertical height at which the <b>pressure</b> <b>reads</b> [...] should be no greater than 40 kn so as to prevent the upper portions of the band from shearing off.

30|$|The {{concept of}} multifactor utility {{functions}} {{has been used}} before in opportunistic routing protocols, for example, [11]. The general idea {{is that it is}} possible to get a better solution by taking more information into account, which is normally true. There is another equally important advantage, in that it allows easy customization of the algorithm to the specific usage setting. For instance, in an underwater WSN equipped with barometric sensors, the <b>pressure</b> <b>read</b> is related to each sensor's depth. If messages are to be routed to the surface, a lower pressure may indicate a good forwarder.|$|R
50|$|There {{is another}} way of {{creating}} a sealed gauge reference and this is to seal a high vacuum on the reverse side of the sensing diaphragm. Then the output signal is offset so the <b>pressure</b> sensor <b>reads</b> close to zero when measuring atmospheric pressure.|$|R
5|$|After being {{classified}} as a hurricane, Karl gradually strengthened, and its circulation became more distinguished from the surrounding cloudiness. A trough that emerged from North America steered the hurricane eastward, and on November 26, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a central barometric <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Karl maintained this strength for approximately 18 hours until beginning to weaken slightly as it accelerated towards the northeast. On November 27, the storm's eye became more ragged as the cyclone passed within 230miles (370km) of the Azores and started {{to show signs of}} deterioration. The trough over the North Atlantic developed into the dominant low pressure area, and Karl turned northward around its periphery. It merged with another approaching system and was declared dissipated by November 28.|$|E
5|$|Once in the Gulf of Mexico on August 28, the {{hurricane}} moved northwest on a nearly linear path towards the Texas coast as it steadily intensified. By 0600 UTC on August 29, the storm reached Category 3 intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h)–this {{would be the}} storm's maximum intensity. However, {{the hurricane}} weakened back down to Category 1 strength before making landfall just after midnight on August 30 near Matagorda and Palacios, Texas. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), with hurricane-force winds extending out 150mi (240km) from the storm's center of circulation. The hurricane's minimum central pressure at landfall was estimated at 950mbar (hPa; 28.06inHg), though a <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> of 952mbar (hPa; 28.16inHg) in Seadrift, Texas marked the lowest recorded pressure. Once inland, the storm quickly weakened, and degenerated to tropical storm strength at 1200UTC on August30 while located near Hallettsville, Texas. Weakening to a tropical depression the following day, it dissipated at 1200UTC on August30 near Sweetwater, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} intensity, the strongest Atlantic hurricanes have all {{attained}} Category5 classification. Hurricane Opal, the strongest Category4 hurricane recorded, intensified {{to reach a}} minimum pressure of 916mbar (hPa; 27.05inHg), a pressure typical of Category5 hurricanes. Nonetheless, the pressure remains too high to list Opal {{as one of the}} ten strongest Atlantic tropical cyclones. Presently, Hurricane Wilma is the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, after reaching an intensity of 882mbar (hPa; 26.05inHg) in October2005; this also made Wilma the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide outside of the West Pacific, where seven tropical cyclones have been recorded to intensify to lower pressures. However, this was later superseded by Hurricane Patricia in 2015 in the east Pacific, which had a <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> of 872 mbar. Preceding Wilma is Hurricane Gilbert, which had also held the record for most intense Atlantic hurricane for 17years. The 1935 Labor Day hurricane, with a pressure of 892 mbar (hPa; 26.34 inHg), is the third strongest Atlantic hurricane and the strongest documented tropical cyclone prior to 1950. Since the measurements taken during Wilma and Gilbert were documented using dropsonde, this pressure remains the lowest measured over land.|$|E

The best estimate is that for every 2-inch pitch increase equal wide-opens thrust increase step of approximately 400 RPM.

5|$|Pressure {{readings}} from John's peak are not consistently available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John {{one of the}} most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both Hurricane Emilia and Hurricane Gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central Pacific earlier in the 1994 season, but with lower wind speeds. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds). John was also only the fourth Category5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994), and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175mph (280km/h). Since 1994, only one Category5 hurricane, Hurricane Ioke, has formed in or entered into the Central Pacific; Ioke, like Emilia and Gilma, had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than John. However, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph; there is no <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> when it had winds of 175mph, so it could have been stronger than Emilia, Gilma or Ioke. John was the first Eastern Pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon, a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014.|$|E

25|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator is a {{differential pressure gauge}} with the <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or stagnation pressure, and the static pressure. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|E

50|$|As {{discussed}} above, supercharging {{can cause}} a spike in temperature, and extreme temperatures will cause detonation of the fuel-air mixture and damage to the engine.

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{potential}} physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American Framingham Heart Study demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a blood chemical linked to heart disease. A 2006 study conducted by the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the University of Chicago found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by John Cacioppo from the University of Chicago, is that doctors report providing better medical care to patients who have a strong network of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs cognition and willpower, alters DNA transcription in immune cells, and leads over time to high blood pressure. Lonelier {{people are more likely to}} show evidence of viral reactivation than less lonely people. Lonelier people also have stronger inflammatory responses to acute stress compared with less lonely people; inflammation is a well known risk factor for age-related diseases.|$|E
25|$|In later October 2006, a cut-off extratropical cyclone {{over the}} central north Pacific moved over {{an area of}} ocean with sea surface {{temperatures}} as high as 2 °C above normal, at 16– 18°C (60.8– 64.4°F), and stalled there for two days. By October 31, the system had acquired convection, a warmer-than-normal core, and an eye-like feature. During this time it had moved east, then northeast, and then northwest. On November 1, the system reached its peak intensity, and had estimated winds of 100km/h (60mph) and its most developed convection. After that, it slowly weakened, looped counter-clockwise, and headed east towards {{the west coast of}} North America. This system's center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1. The buoy's lowest <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> was 989mb/hPa. Other buoys indicated that a rather large area of low pressure was associated with the system. Buoy 46637 was not at the system's center of circulation, so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured. On November 2, wind shear started taking its toll, and all convection was gone by the next day, when it was located roughly 520mi (840km) off the coast of Oregon. On November 3, the storm made landfall on the Olympic Peninsula in the State of Washington, bringing tropical storm-like conditions to the Pacific Northwest, including sustained winds at 40 mph and wind gusts up to 60 mph. Following its landfall, the storm rapidly weakened and dissipated on the next day.|$|E
500|$|After {{emerging}} from Puerto Rico, the hurricane had weakened to winds of about 140mph (240km/h), {{based on a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>reading</b> of [...] at Isabela.

On September15, it passed within 35mi (55km) of Grand Turk, by which time the winds increased to 155mph (250km/h). The storm continued through the Bahamas as a strong Category 4 hurricane, passing near Nassau at 10:00UTC on September16. Initially, Richard Gray of the U.S. Weather Bureau was optimistic that the storm would spare South Florida. However, at 00:00UTC on September17, the large hurricane made landfall in southeastern Florida near West Palm Beach, with estimated winds of 145mph (230km/h).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Previous {{research at the}} Naval Postgraduate School addressed the aerodynamic effects that caused the altitude determination errors in the Service Aircraft Instrumentation package (SAIP). This thesis builds on the previous work and focused on establishing a correction for the SAIP using both aerodynamic and atmospheric corrections to the Extended Area Test System (EATS) system evaluator program. By using a quadratic function of Mach number to estimate the Cp, the aerodynamic errors {{can be reduced to}} enable the SAIP to measure altitude correctly to within 100 ft for velocities up to Mach 0. 8. This correction is used to modify the static <b>pressure</b> <b>read</b> by the SAIP. Further flight tests will have to be accomplished to determine the correction for a range of altitudes and aircrafts. The atmospheric errors can be corrected by analyzing the sounding data generated by the Geophysics Department at Pt.
