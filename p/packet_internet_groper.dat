40|$|The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet-switched {{enhancement}} of existing Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks. It is developed to allow {{large amounts of}} data to be sent over cellular networks at speeds {{three to four times}} greater than conventional GSM systems. Because GSM is the most widely used mobile system in the world for most operators, GPRS is the easiest and most logical way of offering customers fast simultaneous data services, such as multimedia messaging, gaming, entertainment, and news. The success or otherwise of GPRS will be dependent on its ability to deliver the data speeds and services that the industry has been promising the subscriber. In order to measure the performance of GPRS, as seen by the subscriber, would then depending on many different factors. Thus, the aim of this project is to analyse the performance of GPRS services that network operators are promising to the subscribers and to discuss the measurement results of GPRS end-user application performance subject to various channel conditions.

40|$|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks {{can be so}} {{powerful}} that they can easily deplete the computing resources or bandwidth of the potential targets, by flooding massive <b>packets.</b> <b>Internet</b> infrastructures and network applications, including social services and communication systems for emergency management, are under {{the threat of the}} DDoS problem.

Dealing with DDoS attacks is challenging, due to their multifaceted properties: dynamic attack rates, various kinds of targets, big scale of botnets, etc. Multifaceted nature of DDoS attacks justifies the need for multifaceted defense. Thus we address the DDoS problems from different aspects. In particular, in the thesis we present an adaptive port-hopping method to address application-level DDoS problems. The method enables multiparty applications to communicate via ports changed periodically. Thus, the adversary cannot effectively attack the communication ports of the targets.

The ongoing evolution from packet based networks to hybrid networks in Research & Education (R&E) networks, or what are the fundamental reasons behind this fundamental paradygm shift and the resulting growing gap between commercial and R&E Internet networks? As exemplified by the Internet 2 HOPI initiative, the new GEANT 2 backbone, the GLIF 1 initiative and projects such as Dragon and Ultralight, National Research and Education Network (NREN) infrastructures are undergoing several very fundamental evolutions moving from conventional <b>Packet</b> based <b>Internet</b> networks to Hybrid networks while also moving from commercial Telecom Operator networks to Customer Empowered, dark fiber based, networks.

40|$|The {{commuter}} and freight railroad {{industry is}} required to implement Positive Train Control (PTC) by 2015 (2012 for Metrolink), a challenging network communications problem. This paper will discuss present technologies developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to overcome comparable communication challenges encountered in deep space mission operations. PTC {{will be based on}} a new cellular wireless <b>packet</b> <b>Internet</b> Protocol (IP) network. However, ensuring reliability in such a network is difficult due to the "dead zones" and transient disruptions we commonly experience when we lose calls in commercial cellular networks. These disruptions make it difficult to meet PTC s stringent reliability (99. 999 %) and safety requirements, deployment deadlines, and budget. This paper proposes innovative solutions based on space-proven technologies that would help meet these challenges: (1) Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) technology, designed for use in resource-constrained, embedded systems and currently in use on the International Space Station, enables reliable communication over networks in which timely data acknowledgments might not be possible due to transient link outages. (2) Policy-Based Management (PBM) provides dynamic management capabilities, allowing vital data to be exchanged selectively (with priority) by utilizing alternative communication resources. The resulting network may help railroads implement PTC faster, cheaper, and more reliably...|$|R

40|$|Understanding how packets are routed in Internet is {{significantly}} important to Internet measurement and modeling. The conventional solution for route simulation {{is based on}} the assumption of unweighted shortest path. However, it has been found and widely accepted that a <b>packet</b> in <b>Internet</b> is usually not transmitted along the unweighted shortest path between its source and destination. To better simulate the routing behavior of a packet, we thoroughly explore the real-world Internet routes and present a novel local information based simulation model, with a tuning parameter, which assigns weights to links based on local information and then simulates the Internet route with weighted shortest path. Comparisons with baseline approaches show its capability in well replicating the route length distribution and other structural properties of the Internet topology. Meanwhile, the optimal parameter of this model locates in the range of (0, 2), which implies that a <b>packet</b> inside the <b>Internet</b> inclines to move to nodes with small degrees. This behavior actually reflects the design philosophy of Internet routing, balancing between network efficiency and traffic congestion. Comment: 12 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
