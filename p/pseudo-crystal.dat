40|$|Studying of {{properties}} of quantum rings (nano-scaling and mesoscoping ring structures) in {{a magnetic field}} is one of directions on which there are interesting results (see, for example, [1]). Quantum transitions in such structures are accompanied by radiation on border of infra-red light, and interest is caused by periodic structures in which quantum rings are cooperate with neigh calls in <b>pseudo-crystal.</b> In the given work results of calculations of such structure in two-dimension statement (periodicity is provided with decomposition of the solution in Fourier series on both spatial coordinates) are presented.

40|$|Crystals are the {{materials}} {{which can be}} described by uniform periodic lattices. Traditionally, only the 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 - and 6 -fold rotation symmetries are allowed in crystals because other n-fold rotation symmetries are forbidden by the fully periodic translation symmetry. Materials containing rotation symmetries forbidden in crystals can be optionally described as quasicrystals with aperiodicity. The theoretical predictions and experimental discoveries of quasicrystals have enriched the knowledge of crystallography and topology, and expanded the capability of growing novel materials. Mathematically, one can fill the whole space with quasi-uniform lattices through divisional translations and arbitrary n-fold central rotations, including the 5 -fold symmetry. However, it is unknown if such <b>pseudo-crystals</b> with 5 -fold symmetry exist in reality. Here we propose a generalized crystal-prediction-method {{which can be used}} to search for potential <b>pseudo-crystals</b> possessing both arbitrary n-fold rotation symmetry and divisional translation symmetry. Successful examples with 5 -fold central rotation symmetry based on the group 14 elements are discussed. We expect timely experimental explorations on such peculiar structures, especially on the very promising clathrate phases of the group 14 elements with only slightly larger binding energies compared with the diamond phases.

40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} colloidally sus-pended in {{a carrier}} liquid, so-called ferro-fluids, are smart materials which are in-creasingly finding broad application in me-chanical engineering {{as well as}} medicine [1]. The unusual physical properties of fer-rofluids are a consequence of their super-paramagnetic behavior under external magnetic fields and gradients. In systems with strong dipole-dipole (DD) interactions their response to external fields bears self-assembly phenomena such as formation of field-aligned chains, columns and <b>pseudo-crystals,</b> which have large impact on the magnetorheological properties of the ferro...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{simulation}} investigations of primary casting’s structure made of hypoeutectic Al-Si alloy using the Calcosoft system with CAFE 3 D (Cellular Automaton Finite Element) module are presented. CAFE 3 -D module let {{to predict the}} structure formation of complete castings indicating the spatial distribution of columnar and equiaxed grains. That simplified model concerns only hypoeutectic phase. Simulation investigations of structure concern the useful casting of camshaft which solidified in high-insulation mould with properly chills distribution. These conditions let to apply the expedient locally different simplified the grains blocs geometry which are called by the authors as <b>pseudo-crystals.</b> The mechanical properties in selected cross-sections of casing are estimated...|$|R
40|$|CTB-MPR is {{a fusion}} protein between the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) and the membrane-proximal region of gp 41 (MPR), the transmembrane {{envelope}} protein of Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1), and {{has previously been}} shown to induce the production of anti-HIV- 1 antibodies with antiviral functions. To further improve the design of this candidate vaccine, X-ray crystallography experiments were performed to obtain structural information about this fusion protein. Several variants of CTB-MPR were designed, constructed and recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. The first variant contained a flexible GPGP linker between CTB and MPR, and yielded crystals that diffracted to a resolution of 2. 3  Å, but only the CTB region was detected in the electron-density map. A second variant, in which the CTB was directly attached to MPR, was shown to destabilize pentamer formation. A third construct containing a polyalanine linker between CTB and MPR proved to stabilize the pentameric form of the protein during purification. The purification procedure was shown to produce a homogeneously pure and monodisperse sample for crystallization. Initial crystallization experiments led to <b>pseudo-crystals</b> which were ordered in only two dimensions and were disordered in the third dimension. Nanocrystals obtained using the same precipitant showed promising X-ray diffraction to 5  Å resolution in femtosecond nanocrystallography experiments at the Linac Coherent Light Source at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The results demonstrate the utility of femtosecond X-ray crystallography to enable structural analysis based on nano/microcrystals of a protein for which no macroscopic crystals ordered in three dimensions have been observed befor...|$|R
