40|$|The {{effect of}} up to six {{cumulative}} exposures to thermal spikes, each of 10 s duration, on Kevlar 49 fibers has been analyzed. X-ray data show that exposures to spikes corresponding to T's not less than 400 C cause changes {{at the level of}} the crystal lattice. At and above 500 C, severe surface damages such as introduction of longitudinal openings, <b>peel-offs</b> and extraneous material are found to occur. The tensile properties of the spike-exposed fibers manifest changes which conform well with the structural changes. As in the case of prolonged thermal exposures, the spike-induced effects are also controlled by two parameters, viz., the temperature and the duration of the cumulative exposure. The data from spike exposed fibers indicate that the thermally induced changes in the structural and tensile characteristics get initiated at the very early stages of thermal exposure viz., of the order of 10 s...|$|R

Especially in the case of small chip devices, the tape waste material weighs several times more than the packaged components. Moreover, there is additional cost for placing small inexpensive components in tape.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a clean room mat is to keep sterile the areas that require {{ultimate}} protection from dirt, bacteria and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, non slip mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. <b>Peel-off</b> mats {{are made up of}} multiple sheets of polyethylene film coated with acrylic adhesive that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign pollution elements. This goal is achieved by a sticky surface that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is sticky surface mat. Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot bath floor mats. The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot bath bottom is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The main form of {{interfacial}} bond stress between prestressed CFRP sheets and the beams of steel reinforced concrete(SRC) are interfacial shear and <b>peel-off</b> stress. The effective transfer of adhesive stress {{is the fundamental}} to ensure the structure bearing capacity improved after strengthened. According {{to the principle of}} minimum potential energy and combining with the mechanical behavior of prestressed CFRP sheets and the beams of SRC, the calculated formulas of interfacial shear and <b>peel-off</b> stress are deduced under symmetry concentrated loads. The influences of initial strain and the layer of CFRP sheets are discussed. The calculation results show that the effective availability of CFRP sheets is increased with the initial strain increasing under the load. And the interfacial shear and <b>peel-off</b> stress of beam-end are increased simultaneously with the initial strain and the layers of CFRP sheets increasing, which lead to the ends of beams occurred <b>peel-off</b> failure easily...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the {{adhesion}} mechanism of a viscoelastic thin-film on a substrate, peeling experiment of a viscoelastic polyvinylchloride (PVC) thin-film on a rigid substrate (glass) is carried out. The effects of peeling rate, peeling angle, film thickness, surface roughness and the interfacial adhesive on the <b>peel-off</b> force are considered. It is found that both the viscoelastic properties of the film and the interfacial adhesive contribute to the rate-dependent <b>peel-off</b> force. For a fixed peeling rate, the <b>peel-off</b> force decreases with the increasing peeling angle. Increasing film thickness or substrate roughness leads to an increase of the <b>peel-off</b> force. Viscoelastic energy release rate in the present experiment can be further predicted by adopting a recently published theoretical model. It is shown that the energy release rate increases {{with the increase of}} peeling rates or peeling angles. The results in the present paper should be helpful for understanding the adhesion mechanism of a viscoelastic thin-film...|$|E

40|$|Fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) {{materials}} have been recognised as new innovative materials for concrete rehabilitation and retrofit. Since concrete is poor in tension, a beam without {{any form of}} reinforcement will fail when subjected to a relatively small tensile load. Therefore, {{the use of the}} FRP to strengthen the concrete is an effective solution to increase the overall strength of the structure. The attractive benefits of using FRP in real-life civil concrete applications include its high strength to weight ratio, its resistance to corrosion, and its ease of moulding into complex shapes without increasing manufacturing costs. The speed of application minimises the time of closure of a structure compared to other strengthening methods. In this paper, a simple theoretical model to estimate shear and <b>peel-off</b> stresses is proposed. Axial stresses in an FRP-strengthened concrete beam are considered, including the variation in FRP plate fibre orientation. The theoretical predictions are compared with solutions from an experimentally validated finite element model. The results from the theory show that maximum shear and <b>peel-off</b> stresses are located in the end region of the FRP plate. The magnitude of the maximum shear stress increases with increases in the amount of fibres aligned in the beam's longitudinal axis, the modulus of an adhesive material and the number of laminate layers. However, the maximum <b>peel-off</b> stress decreases with increasing thickness of the adhesive layer. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in the flexural capacity of RC beams obtained by externally bonding FRP composites to their tension side is often limited by the premature and brittle debonding of the external reinforcement. An in-depth understanding of this complex failure mechanism, however, {{has not yet been}} achieved. With specific regard to end-debonding failure modes, extensive experimental observations reported in the literature highlight the important distinction, often neglected in strength models proposed by researchers, between the <b>peel-off</b> and rip-off end-debonding types of failure. The <b>peel-off</b> failure is generally characterized by a failure plane located within the first few millimetres of the concrete cover, whilst the rip-off failure penetrates deeper into the concrete cover and propagates along the tensile steel reinforcement. A new rip-off strength model is described in this paper. The model proposed is based on the Chen and Teng <b>peel-off</b> model and relies upon additional theoretical considerations. The influence of the amount of the internal tensile steel reinforcement and the effective anchorage length of FRP are considered and discussed. The validity of the new model is analyzed further through comparisons with test results, findings of a numerical investigation, and a parametric study. The new rip-off strength model is assessed against a database comprising results from 62 beams tested by various researchers and is shown to yield less conservative results...|$|E
40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} studies on {{reversible}} adhesion mechanisms of geckos and insects, we investigate {{the effect of}} pre-tension on the orientation-dependent adhesion strength of an elastic tape adhering on a substrate. Our analysis shows that the pre-tension can significantly increase the <b>peel-off</b> force at small peeling angles while decreasing it at large peeling angles, leading to a strongly reversible adhesion. More interestingly, we find that there exists a critical value of pre-tension beyond which the <b>peel-off</b> force plunges to zero at a force-independent critical peeling angle. We further show {{that the level of}} pre-tension required for such force-independent detachment at a critical angle can be induced by simply dragging a spatula pad along a substrate at sufficiently low angles. These results provide a feasible explanation of relevant experimental observations on gecko adhesion and suggest possible strategies to design strongly reversible adhesives via pre-tension...|$|E
