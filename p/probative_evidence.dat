25|$|Corby's lawyers {{argued that}} she had no {{knowledge}} of the cannabis until customs officials at the airport found it. Her defence centred on the theory {{that she had}} become an unwitting drug courier for what {{was supposed to have been}} an interstate shipment of drugs between Brisbane and Sydney in Australia. Her legal defence suggested that airport baggage handlers had put the drugs in Corby's bag, but they could not provide substantive <b>probative</b> <b>evidence</b> of this. According to her lawyers, the cannabis was meant to have been removed in Sydney. These claims were later supported when the former head of operations for the Australian Federal Police's internal investigation unit, Ray Cooper, claimed that it was well known within the AFP that some passengers were unwittingly being used to transfer drugs between domestic airports in Australia. In a June 2008 documentary, , Corby's former lawyer, Robin Tampoe, said that he fabricated the defence theory that Australian baggage handlers could have planted the drugs in Corby's luggage and apologised to them, and said that former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer told him he suspected Corby's brothers were behind the convicted drug smuggler's crime. Tampoe was subsequently struck off for misconduct.|$|E
500|$|Over time, a split of {{authority}} grew among lower courts {{with regard to}} whether the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception allowed officers to always conduct warrantless blood tests on individuals suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol because evidence of alcohol was being destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes. States that recognized this per se exigency argued that [...] "nce police arrest a suspect for drunk driving, each passing minute eliminates <b>probative</b> <b>evidence</b> of the crime." [...] In 2012, the Court granted review in Missouri v. McNeely to resolve this question. In a 5–4 opinion, the Court rejected the theory that the natural dissipation of blood alcohol constituted a per se exigency. Instead, the court affirmed the basic principle from Schmerber that absent [...] "an emergency that justifie acting without a warrant," [...] police may not conduct warrantless blood testing on suspects. Consequently, exigency in drunk driving cases [...] "must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstances." ...|$|E

Some digital fingerprinting is volatile by its nature. Alternatively, once the power of computing devices is no longer sustainable, these digital traces could disappear forever.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{as to whether}} to admit evidence of past sexual assaults {{in cases where the}} accused presents a defense of consent to a current sexual assault charge. The consent defense presents a unique situation where, due to the <b>probative</b> value of <b>evidence</b> that suggests propensity to rape, a strong justification can be made to admit this information as evidence. However, critics of this opinion have argued that admitting propensity evidence about the accused in a rape case is inconsistent with the rape shield rule which excludes propensity evidence about the victim. This argument is flawed {{in the sense that it}} does not properly take into account the full purpose of rape shield laws, nor does it acknowledge that evidence of a victim 2 ̆ 7 s sexual history is less <b>probative</b> than <b>evidence</b> regarding the history of the accused...|$|R
500|$|Forensic archaeologists employ their {{knowledge}} of proper excavation techniques to ensure that remains are recovered in a controlled and forensically acceptable manner. When remains are found partially or completely buried the proper excavation of the remains will ensure that any evidence present on the bones will remain intact. [...] The difference between forensic archaeologists and forensic anthropologists is that where forensic anthropologists are trained specifically in human osteology and recovery of human remains, forensic archaeologists specialize more broadly in the processes of search and discovery. In addition to remains, archaeologists are trained to look for objects contained {{in and around the}} excavation area. These objects can include anything from wedding rings to potentially <b>probative</b> <b>evidence</b> such as cigarette butts or shoe prints. [...] Their training extends further to observing context, association and significance of objects in a crime scene and drawing conclusions that may be useful for locating a victim or suspect. A forensic archaeologist must also be able to utilize a degree of creativity and adaptability during times when crime scenes can not be excavated using traditional archaeological techniques. For example, one particular case study was conducted on the search and recovery of the remains of a missing girl who was found in a septic tank underground. This instance required unique methods unlike those of a typical archeological excavation in order to exhume and preserve the contents of the tank.|$|E

5000|$|Because Rule 403 contemplates a {{balancing}} test, the Court {{then had to}} describe how to conduct that balancing. Two possibilities arose for doing so. First, [...] "an item of evidence might {{be viewed as an}} island," [...] such that its probative value and danger for unfair prejudice would be assessed in a vacuum. Second, the item of evidence in question could be measured in relation to [...] "the full evidentiary context of the case as the court understands it when the ruling must be made." [...] Under the first approach, the party offering the evidence would have an incentive to organize its case around the most unfairly prejudicial evidence it can find that is highly probative, and leave out equally <b>probative</b> <b>evidence</b> that is less prejudicial. Thus, even if the trial court were to exclude the proffering party's preferred evidence, that party would still have equally <b>probative</b> <b>evidence</b> to fall back on. Thus, the Court reasoned that an assessment of prejudice must be conducted with reference to all the other actually available evidence {{in the hands of the}} proffering party.|$|E

50|$|The {{rules on}} {{admissibility}} of evidence {{are meant to}} be the only standards for admitting evidence. All relevant evidence is admissible, and all evidence against a defendant is prejudicial against the defendant, but the evidence is inadmissible if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value. The other rules, including the rule about similar acts evidence, are intended to limit the purpose for which otherwise <b>probative</b> <b>evidence</b> may be admitted. The text of these rules does not require any other preliminary showing before admitting the evidence. Congress did not intend to superimpose another level of judicial oversight onto the admissibility rules; rather, it intended to ensure that no artificial barriers stood in the way of admitting <b>probative</b> <b>evidence.</b> The rules require the trial court to make threshold determinations on admissibility, including whether evidence is relevant, and whether it is not unfairly prejudicial. The Court's power to make these determinations is sufficient to guard against the danger of unfair prejudice that might result from admitting similar acts evidence.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Supreme Court, in Nix v.

40|$|As {{a way to}} make medical decisions, Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) has failed. EBM's failure {{arises from}} not being founded on {{real-world}} decision-making. EBM aspires to a scientific standard for the best way to treat a disease and determine its cause, but it fails to recognise that the scientific method is inapplicable to medical and other real-world decision-making. EBM also wrongly assumes that evidence can be marshaled and applied according to an hierarchy that is determined in an argument by authority to the method by which it has been obtained. If EBM had valid theoretical, practical or empirical foundations, there would be no hierarchy of evidence. In all real-world decision-making, evidence stands or falls on its inherent reliability. This has to be and can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis applying understanding and wisdom against the background of all available facts—the “factual matrix. ” EBM's failure is structural and was inevitable from its inception. EBM confuses the inherent reliability and <b>probative</b> value of <b>evidence</b> with the means by which it is obtained. EBM is therefore an ad hoc construct and is not a valid basis for medical decision-making. This is further demonstrated by its exclusion of relevant scientific and <b>probative</b> real-world decision-making <b>evidence</b> and processes. It draws upon a narrow evidence base that is itself inherently unreliable. It fails to take adequate account of the nature of causation, the full range of evidence relevant to its determination, and differing approaches to determining cause and effect in real-worl...|$|R

However, many contentious cases have centred on findings that issues such as the burdens of proof, the admissibility of evidence, and statutes of limitations are procedural rather than substantive, because these rules can change the outcome of a case.|$|R
