HpCDD is the dibenzo-p-dioxin which is chlorinated at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. It is a polycyclic heterocyclic organic compound, since HpCDD contains multiple cyclic structures (two benzene rings connected by a 1,4-dioxin ring) in which two different elements (carbon and oxygen) are members of its rings. HpCDD has molecular formula C12HCl7O2 and is an off-white powder, which is insoluble in water.|$|E

The calculation of the emission <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-p-dioxins</b> and <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzofurans from metallurgical processes located in the town of Sisak took into account annual outputs of sinter, pig iron, steel blooms and steel billets, as well as steel casts.
