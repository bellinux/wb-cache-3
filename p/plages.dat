2500|$|Active regions involve all the {{phenomena}} {{directly linked to}} the magnetic field, which occur at different heights above the Sun's surface: sunspots and faculae, occur in the photosphere, spicules, Hα filaments and <b>plages</b> in the chromosphere, prominences in the chromosphere and transition region, and flares and coronal mass ejections happen in the corona and chromosphere. If flares are very violent, they can also perturb the photosphere and generate a Moreton wave. On the contrary, quiescent prominences are large, cool dense structures which are observed as dark, [...] "snake-like" [...] Hα ribbons (appearing like filaments) on the solar disc. Their temperature is about 5000–8000K, {{and so they are}} usually considered as chromospheric features.|$|E

40|$|Properties of {{transient}} horizontal {{magnetic fields}} (THMFs) in both <b>plage</b> and quiet Sun regions are obtained and compared. Spectro-polarimetric observations with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on the Hinode satellite {{were carried out}} with a cadence of about 30 seconds for both <b>plage</b> and quiet regions located near disk center. We select THMFs that have net linear polarization (LP) higher than 0. 22 %, and an area larger {{than or equal to}} 3 pixels, and compare their occurrence rates and distribution of magnetic field azimuth. We obtain probability density functions (PDFs) of magnetic field strength and inclination for both regions. The occurrence rate in the <b>plage</b> region is the same as for the quiet Sun. The vertical magnetic flux in the <b>plage</b> region is ~ 8 times larger than in the quiet Sun. There is essentially no preferred orientation for the THMFs in either region. However, THMFs in the <b>plage</b> region with higher LP have a preferred direction consistent with that of the plage-region's large-scale vertical field pattern. PDFs show that there is no difference in the distribution of field strength of horizontal fields between the quiet Sun and the <b>plage</b> regions when we avoid the persistent large vertical flux concentrations for the <b>plage</b> region. The similarity of the PDFs and of the occurrence rates in <b>plage</b> and quiet regions suggests that a local dynamo process due to the granular motion may generate THMFs all over the sun. The preferred orientation for higher LP in the <b>plage</b> indicates that the THMFs are somewhat influenced by the larger-scale magnetic field pattern of the <b>plage.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, A&A accepte...|$|R

40|$|Solar <b>plage</b> regions can be {{observed}} directly, whereas <b>plage</b> regions as well as star-spots on solar like stars, can only be detected via their contribution to spectral irradiances of these stars. Such a spectral irradiance can be modelled by fractions belonging to the quiet star, the <b>plage</b> regions, and the star-spots. The idea is, to measure these fractions {{as well as the}} intensity enhancement due to <b>plage</b> regions on our Sun and then use this information to be able to model solar like stars. We verify the close connection between the size of the <b>plage</b> regions and the luminosity of the Sun, given by a correlation coefficient of 0. 822. The size of the <b>plage</b> regions varies from 0 %, when the Sun is very quiet, up to 2. 7 % for a more active Sun (a complete solar cycle is not yet analysed and hence our study does not contain an activity maximum). The used data sets are full-disc images taken by the RISE/PSPT instrument during the period from 2005 to 2012, at the MLSO...|$|R

40|$|The {{observed}} phenomenology in RS CVn {{and related}} binary systems is considered {{in terms of}} its modeling according to solar activity by examining UV and optical spectroscopy. Current data are examined to validate the existence of cool starspots, <b>plage,</b> prominences, and flares, as well as to determine the consistency of spatial correlations given by these data. RS CVn stars show spots at or near the poles, contrasting the low latitudes of solar spots; <b>plage</b> appears to be associated with cool spots on BY Draconis-like systems; <b>plage</b> and prominences, although identified as distinct phenomena, are theorized to be the same event in some cases. More spectroscopic and photometric observations are proposed to identify the detailed structure and locations of spots. UV and visible data are also required to distinguish <b>plage</b> regions from flare variations as well as determine the relation of extended structures to starspot and <b>plage</b> phenomena in RS CVn systems...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>plage</b> is {{a bright}} region in the {{chromosphere}} of the Sun, typically found in regions of the chromosphere near sunspots. The term itself is poetically taken from the French word for [...] "beach". The <b>plage</b> regions map closely to the bright spots (faculae) in the photosphere below, but the latter have much smaller spatial scales. Accordingly, <b>plage</b> occurs most visibly near a sunspot region. Faculae have a strong influence on thesolar constant, and the more readily detectable (because chromospheric) <b>plage</b> areas traditionally are used to monitor this influence. In this context [...] "active network" [...] consists of plage-like brightenings extending away from active regions as their magnetism appears to diffuse into the quiet Sun, but constrained to follow the network boundaries.|$|R
40|$|We studied spicular jets over a <b>plage</b> {{area and}} derived their dynamic {{characteristics}} using Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) high-resolution images. The target <b>plage</b> region {{was near the}} west limb of the solar disk. This location permitted us to study the dynamics of spicular jets without the overlapping effect of spicular structures {{along the line of}} sight. In this work, to increase the ease with which we can identify spicules on the disk, we applied the image processing method `MadMax' developed by Koutchmy et al. (1989). It enhances fine, slender structures (like jets), over a diffuse background. We identified 169 spicules over the target <b>plage.</b> This sample permits us to derive statistically reliable results regarding spicular dynamics. The properties of <b>plage</b> spicules can be summarized as follows: (1) In a <b>plage</b> area, we clearly identified spicular jet features. (2) They were shorter in length than the quiet region limb spicules, and followed ballistic motion under constant deceleration. (3) The majority (80 %) of the <b>plage</b> spicules showed the cycle of rise and retreat, while 10 % of them faded out without a complete retreat phase. (4) The deceleration of the spicule was proportional to the velocity of ejection (i. e. the initial velocity). Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in PAS...|$|R
