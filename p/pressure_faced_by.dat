Under the policies, the kerajaan were able {{to gain access to}} various incomes, titles, and religious authority that they used to have in the 1930s. The regaining of Malay aristocrats’ power during the Japanese Occupation has resulted in suppression among the peasant community in East Sumatra. Many Japanese officials managed to exploit food and labour supplies from the peasantry through the kerajaan hierarchy and that had increased the amount of economic <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> the farming population of East Sumatra back then. Consequently, the credibility of those traditional, nationalists and religious leaders, who were assigned by the Japanese, was severely damaged. A new leadership was then formed by a group of pemuda (youth) who had received their formative education under the Japanese military groups (Giyūgun, Heiho and Tokkeitai). The military training guided by Japanese ethics and values has fanned their nationalism and motivated them to defend their lands. These Japanese-trained pemuda then took on active roles in fighting against the Dutch and Malay sultans during the 1946 East Sumatra Social Revolution.|$|E

50|$|With {{the supply}} chain {{lengthening}} {{as a result of}} globalization and offshore production, many companies have experienced a reduction of capital availability. In addition, the <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> companies to improve cash flow has resulted in increased pressure on their overseas suppliers. Specifically, suppliers receive pressure in the form of extended payment terms or increased working capital imposed on them by large buyers. The general trend toward open account from letters of credit has further contributed to the problem.|$|E

It justified the change as follows:due to profound changes in the media environment {{after the fall of}} President Viktor Yanukovych's government in February, despite a rise in attacks on journalists during the Euromaidan protests of early 2014 and the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine. The level of government hostility and legal <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> journalists decreased, as did political pressure on state-owned outlets. The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator.In 2015 the main concerns about media freedom in Ukraine were the handling of pro-Russian propaganda, the concentration of media ownership, and the high risks of violence against journalists, especially in the conflict areas in the east.|$|E

Only three nationalist armies were deployed to guard a vast area covering the region along the section of Longhai (Lanzhou - Lianyungang) Railway from Kaifeng to Xuzhou, and the region {{to the south of}} this section bordered by the northern shore of the Yellow River. Nationalists were not worried, however, because they were already to deploy additional troops for a preemptive strike to wipe out the Communists in the area. Unbeknown to the nationalists, the Communists were planning a preemptive strike of their own, before the much greater nationalist reinforcement could be ready, thus forcing the nationalist reinforcement to remain in the region after the campaign, hence relieving the <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> the Communists in other campaigns.|$|E

50|$|Target costing is an {{approach}} to determine a product’s life-cycle cost which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while ensuring its desired profit. It involves setting a target cost by subtracting a desired profit margin from a competitive market price. A target cost is {{the maximum amount of}} cost that can be incurred on a product, however, the firm can still earn the required profit margin from that product at a particular selling price. Target costing decomposes the target cost from product level to component level. Through this decomposition, target costing spread the competitive <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> the company to product’s designers and suppliers. Target costing consists of cost planning in the design phase of production as well as cost control throughout the resulting product life cycle. The cardinal rule of target costing is to never exceed the target cost. However, the focus of target costing is not to minimize costs, but to achieve a desired level of cost reduction determined by target costing process.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{financial}} obstacles, and, more generally, financial <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> firms, {{significantly affect}} firm growth. For this purpose, we use an unbalanced panel of about 1, 000, 000 observations for around 155, 000 non-financial corporations in five euro area countries. In {{addition to the}} balance sheet information in this panel, we also rely on firm level survey data. In this way {{we are able to}} work out a direct measure of the firms’ probability of facing financing obstacles. Our results indicate that, though based on few variables, this measure appears to be relevant in explaining firm growth in four out of the five countries considered. Other firm-level variables related to the financial <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> firms, such as cash flow (debt burden) are found to exert a positive (negative) impact on firm growth, while the results for leverage are less clear-cut.

We hypothesize {{a positive relationship between}} these variables and the likelihood of a firm receiving initial HACCP certification and a negative association with its subsequent decertification.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of {{expansion}} of higher education on student outcomes {{in the context of}} competition among colleges which differentiate themselves horizontally by setting curricular standards. When public or economic pressures compel less selective colleges to lower their curricular demands, low-ability students benefit at the expense of medium-ability students. This reduces competitive <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> more selective colleges, which therefore adopt more demanding curricula to better serve their most able students. This stylized model of curricular product differentiation in higher education offers an explanation for the diverging selectivity trends of American colleges. It also appears consistent with the U-shaped earnings growth profile we observe among college-educated workers in the U. S...|$|E

Additionally, we propose an alternative operationalisation of vulnerability, which shifts the focus from siloed cultural competency to integrated critical diversity, and in doing so, attempts to relieve some of the institutional, political and operational <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> policing services...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} college enrollment expansion on student aca-demic achievements and labor market outcomes. When public policies promote “access ” to college education, colleges adjust their curricula: Non-elite public col-leges adopt a less demanding curriculum {{in order to accommodate}} the influx of low-ability students. This adjustment benefits low-ability students at the expense of middle-ability students. At the same time, it reduces the competitive <b>pressure</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> elite private colleges, as public colleges are now a less appealing alter-native for middle-ability students. Private colleges hence adopt a more demand-ing curriculum to better serve their high-ability students, again at the expense of middle-ability students.

30|$|The {{behavior}} of these fossorial animals greatly differs from their open-water, non-burrowing relatives, which are solitary and very aggressive animals (Bergman and Moore 2003; Crook et al. 2004; Moore 2007). The environmental <b>pressures</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> burrowing crayfish strongly favor coexistence and overlapping generations. Evidence supporting this assumption includes gregarious tendencies (Punzalan et al. 2001), low aggressiveness (Guiaşu et al. 2005 Dalosto et al. 2013), and prolonged parental care (Dalosto et al. 2012). However, even though burrowing species behave differently from other crayfish, {{very little is}} actually known about them mainly because their fossorial habits make sampling difficult (Punzalan et al. 2001; Richardson 2007).|$|R

40|$|Long run {{returns of}} IPO firms’ {{recommendations}} in Europe reveal possible {{conflicts of interest}} and pressures faced by financial analysts over the 1991 - 2005 period. Nevertheless, recent European legislations about investment research have led to better long run performance of IPO firms’ recommendations issued by affiliated analysts over the 2001 - 2005 period. Findings reveal that market participants do not fully incorporate the perceived value of recommendations. Indeed, difference between affiliated and unaffiliated analysts’ recommendations is statistically significant over one, three or five year horizon. The timing of recommendations specifies that investors {{pay more attention to}} affiliated analysts’ recommendations made later in the aftermarket.
