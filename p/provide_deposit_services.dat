40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{performance}} of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Burkina Faso using indicators such as the sustainable interest rate and the subsidy dependence index. The results indicate that MFIs outreach performance remains very low compared with potential demand, and the factors responsible appear to be both the refusal of most MFIs to mobilize local savings and {{the high costs of}} supply of microfinancial services. The results also show that MFIs are not viable and sustainable. Their interest rates are kept low and do not allow them to cover all the costs. In addition, the results indicate that MFIs are dependent on subsidies. However, the oldest MFIs and/or institutions <b>providing</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>services</b> have the lowest subsidy dependence index. It is suggested that more attention should be placed on savings mobilization and ceilings on interest rates should be removed in order to allow MFIs to charge sustainable interest rates. 2 ̆ 013 microfinance; performance indicators; Burkina Fas...|$|R

Bankers {{and other}} {{financial}} experts have analyzed the value of automated teller machines (ATM) in terms of growing consumer demand, rising costs of technology development, decreasing profitability and market share. This paper presents a step-by-step cost-benefit analysis of the ATM automatic <b>deposit</b> <b>service.</b> The {{first step is to}} determine user attitudes towards using ATM automatic <b>deposit</b> <b>service</b> by using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The second step is to determine location priorities for ATMs that <b>provide</b> automatic <b>deposit</b> <b>services</b> using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model. The results of the previous steps enable a highly efficient application of cost-benefit analysis for evaluating costs and benefits of automatic <b>deposit</b> <b>services.</b> To understand fully the proposed procedure outside of theoretical terms, a real-world application of a case study is conducted...|$|R

3000|$|The author’s {{opportunity}} to participate in the Wenzhou Private Lending Registration Service Center’s pilot program was due to his participation in an earlier project, the “financial innovation research in Q City (a subordinate county-level city of Wenzhou) in Zhejiang Province” in July 2009. This research found that county-level governments had very limited power to reform the local financial system; market access reform and the reform of interest rate marketization in the banking sector had to be approved by the central government. What is more, civil lending behavior was limited to individual lending at that time, and most of the individual lending occurred between relatives and friends. In individual lending, the volume of loans was often constrained. After analyzing the above results, the research team suggested that direct lending between strangers via local governments could be an innovative move for local financial systems. Direct lending transactions between strangers require intermediaries; however, relevant law strictly forbids an unregistered private depository institution from <b>providing</b> <b>deposit</b> and lending <b>services.</b> Then is it possible to develop an intermediary service for direct lending without participating in a deposit and lending transaction?

Banks have been accused of monopolistically setting fees for some of their <b>deposit</b> <b>services</b> at levels greater than associated costs. This paper examines consumer deposit pricing in a world characterized by imperfect information about a heterogeneous customer population.

As a result, competitive banks may be deliberately overcharging for some component <b>deposit</b> <b>services</b> while simultaneously undercharging for others.

This study adopted a quantitative research approach using secondary data of six MFIs from six countries of South Asia from 2008 to 2012. The {{data were collected from}} the Microfinance Information Exchange database. We employed financial ratio analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, and the econometric technique, considered the various performance indicators that have been standardized by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor to measure the financial performance or the profitability of MFIs. Results showed that yield on gross loan portfolio and the number of active borrowers has significant positive effects, conversely, ages and operating expense ratio have significant negative effects on financial performance. Liquidity ratio has been shown as insignificant, but a positive relationship and cost per borrower was found to have no relationship with the profitability of MFIs. Thus, the study suggests reconsidering the interest rate charged by MFIs as {{this is one of the}} major barrier for client's loan repayment. MFIs should also maintain close relationship with borrower to keep them active, for instead, institutions can <b>provide</b> <b>deposits</b> or savings scheme for clients.
