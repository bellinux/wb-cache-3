Cromwell and Lansbury eloped and were married in a small civil {{ceremony}} on September 27, 1945. The marriage ended in divorce in 1946, but they remained friends {{until his death in}} 1960. In 1949 she married actor Peter Shaw, and they remained together for 54 years until his death in 2003; she asserted that [...] "We had the perfect relationship. Not many <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that." [...] She acquired a step-son, David, from Shaw's first marriage. They had two children of their own, Anthony Peter and Deirdre Ann. While Lansbury repeatedly stated that she wanted to put her children before her career, she admitted that she often had to leave them in California for long periods when she was working elsewhere. She brought up her children to be Episcopalian, although they were not members of a congregation. She has stated that [...] "I believe that God is within all of us; that we are perfect, precious beings, and have to put our faith and trust in that." ...|$|E

'Don't you find it horrendous that this people and this state, which only came into existence because of the defeat of fascism and Nazism in Europe, and in the conflict six million Jews paid with their lives for no other reason than that they were Jews, is it not abhorrent that in this place there are <b>people</b> who <b>can</b> <b>say</b> these things and do these things?' he asks.|$|R

Otherwise you lose the flavour. Tell the waiter you must have it broiled, with melted butter and a little parsley and some plain boiled potatoes. It's really astonishing. It's best to stick to fish on the Continent. <b>People</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> what they like, but I maintain that the French don't really understand steaks or any sort of red meat. The veal isn't bad, though I prefer our way of serving it. Of course, what the French are real geniuses at is the omelet.

40|$|Lennox Wilson A. Chitonga of Kaphiri Kamodzi Farm near Mwanza in Malawi {{is a smart}} farmer. He {{tells of}} the {{transformation}} of one hectare of dry, useless land into thriving farmland. The farm is situated west of Middle Shire river. The area used to be uninhabited because it lies in the rain shadow of a mountain range and thus has limited rainfall. The farm was established on land abandoned by two previous occupants because of water stress. In the late 1990 s Mr Chitonga carried out conservation work on the farm, including building 200 m of contours between 0. 5 and 2 m high. Productivity rose from 0. 75 t to 2. 7 t per hectare. In 2000 another 90 m of contours were erected, demarcating plots of 30 by 30 m. The farmland is largely under the canopy of leguminous trees. All these measures have greatly increased the water-retention capacity of the soil, and the well now recharges more quickly. In 2001, a dimba (small water-holding dam) was constructed and another hectare of land brought under maize cultivation. Mr Chitonga applies the principles of permaculture and his farm has attracted {{a lot of new}} settlers to the area. The disadvantage is that half the forest has been logged for charcoal, but the advantage is that the criteria have been met for a population big enough for the government to sink a new well. <b>People</b> <b>can,</b> <b>says</b> Mr Chitonga, now have more than a sip.

Taking into consideration the experience of several generations, witnessing the results of <b>people’s</b> activity, we <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that the problem of our environment and technical progress is closely connected.
