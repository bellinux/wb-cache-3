5|$|Atwood's Massey Lectures {{have been}} adapted as a 2012 {{documentary}} <b>Payback,</b> {{produced by the}} National Film Board of Canada, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2012.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{needed to}} build a wind farm divided into the total output over its life, Energy Return on Energy Invested, of wind power varies but averages about 20–25. Thus, the energy <b>payback</b> time is {{typically}} around one year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Payback</b> entered The Globe and Mail {{bestseller list}} at #6 and peaked at #1 on October 25. It became the best selling Massey Lecture book {{to date and}} was in its fourth {{printing}} {{by the end of}} November. Excerpts were printed in The Times and the Financial Times. In April 2009, it was a finalist for the annual National Business Book Award and won a silver medal in the Business Ethics category of the Axiom Business Book Awards. That same month, the National Film Board of Canada acquired the film rights, with plans to adapt <b>Payback</b> as a feature-length documentary. They announced the involvement of Jennifer Baichwal as director and Ravida Din as producer. In June 2009, the book was awarded a Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{consequences}} of games may vary from small <b>paybacks</b> to <b>paybacks</b> {{built up over}} a long period to a major level.

5|$|As IRC network {{operators}} {{were beginning to}} shut down networks involved in DDoS attacks, Anons organized a group of servers to host an independent IRC network, titled AnonOps. Operation Payback's targets rapidly expanded to include the British law firm , the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft, the British nightclub Ministry of Sound, the Spanish copyright society Sociedad General de Autores y Editores, the U.S. Copyright Office, and the website of Gene Simmons of Kiss. By October 7, 2010, total downtime for all websites attacked during Operation <b>Payback</b> was 537.55 hours.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Truman {{was named}} Missouri's {{director}} for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the Civil Works Administration) {{at the request of}} Postmaster General James Farley. This was <b>payback</b> to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.|$|E
5|$|In February {{after one}} round of drink service, three men were denied further service at Sixteen {{due to their}} {{apparent}} intoxication and as a <b>payback,</b> the three pulled what {{was intended to be}} a prank. They set off fire alarms and opened a fifth-floor stairwell Chicago Fire Department standpipe valve and flooded elevator shafts with thousands of gallons of water and damaged woodwork, electrical circuitry and marble. The resulting damage was estimated at $700,000 and the three faced felony criminal damage to property charges.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{the debt}} as related {{to that of the}} budget has spawned doubt over the {{probability}} of eventual repayment. The CBR {{is based on the assumption}} that the general fund deficit will remain constant over time (allowing <b>paybacks</b> to balance draws). Believing this to be mistaken, critics allege the state uses resources from the CBR to avoid reducing the budget, acknowledging debt, or increasing taxes. According to them, falling oil revenues and growing spending requirements will leave <b>paybacks</b> consistently lower than draws, causing the CBR to fail.|$|R

50|$|As {{one of the}} two only {{casinos in}} Gulfport or Biloxi to not have an {{attached}} hotel (Other then Boomtown Casino), the Copa catered to a locals market, featuring low-minimum table games and relatively high <b>paybacks</b> on slot machines and video poker.|$|R
5|$|In September 2010, in {{retaliation}} against the Bollywood film industry's hiring of Aiplex Software to launch cyberattacks against The Pirate Bay, Anonymous members, recruited through posts on 4chan boards, subsequently initiated their own attacks, dubbed Operation <b>Payback,</b> targeting the website of the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America. The targeted websites usually went offline {{for a short}} period of time due to the attacks, before recovering.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, Grameen has {{had very}} high <b>payback</b> rates—over 98 percent. However, {{according}} to the Wall Street Journal, in 2001 {{a fifth of the}} bank's loans were more than a year overdue. Grameen says {{that more than half of}} its borrowers in Bangladesh (close to 50 million) have risen out of acute poverty thanks to their loan, as measured by such standards as having all children of school age in school, all household members eating three meals a day, a sanitary toilet, a rainproof house, clean drinking water, and the ability to repay a 300 taka-a-week (around 4 USD) loan.|$|E
5|$|To {{mark their}} victory, the Allied troops marched in triumph {{through the streets}} of Buenos Aires. The parades {{included}} the Brazilian Army, which insisted that their triumphal procession take place on 20 February, to mark <b>payback</b> for the defeat it had suffered at the Battle of Ituzaingó twenty five years before on that date. The population of Buenos Aires was said to have looked on silently with a combination of shame and hostility as the Brazilians passed.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} factors in Australia’s {{electricity}} market are now combining to produce favourable conditions for residential battery storage uptake out to 2030. These factors are: decreasing battery prices, increasing forecast grid electricity prices, the removal of state based premium feed-in tariffs and the continued willingness of Australian households to reduce their electricity costs through installing solar. The benefits that residential batteries may provide to Australian electricity networks are also being considered, with batteries able to delay costly network upgrades, displace peaking generation for peak shaving, and assist the integration of {{a higher percentage of}} renewable generation. Research in 2015, by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), looked at the economic viability of residential batteries in Australia. However, both of these studies focused on the National Electricity Market (NEM) regions only. This research uses recently advertised Australian battery prices to provide a more relevant assessment of the economic viability of batteries in all Australian regions, including the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Northern Territory (NT) and Western Australia (WA). The HOMER modelling software is used to calculate <b>paybacks</b> for household scenarios, from which potential uptake is forecast. The results show for new battery and PV installations, <b>paybacks</b> under 9 -years for all regions, and overall uptake of over 500, 000 battery installs, by 2030. While it is shown that almost one million PV households are no longer on premium feed-in tariffs by 2016, the low economic viability for battery retrofits, results in limited uptake. AEMO and CSIRO show similar <b>paybacks</b> to those identified in this study, however forecast uptake is varied, with this study providing medium uptake in-between the other two studies. Under current market conditions, this study identifies medium <b>paybacks</b> with medium uptake for residential batteries across all Australian regions out to 2030...|$|R
50|$|In 2014 Clarke {{brought out}} a solo album {{recorded}} in Porto, Portugal <b>Payback's</b> A Bitch. Co Producer Andre Indiana and Monica Ferraz on backing vocals make this album very unusual and diverse demonstrating the different sides to Clarke's musical abilities. Rolling Stone Germany gave the album full score.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been renewed {{interest}} in energy efficiency in the semiconductor industry. The declining prices for semiconductor products has prompted semiconductor manufacturing plants to control costs so as to maintain profitability. This paper presents the potential for energy efficiency improvements at a semiconductor manufacturing plant from various energy efficiency measures such as high efficiency motors, adjustable speed drive motors, high efficiency HVAC, and high efficiency lighting. The effort {{was part of a}} utility-sponsored technical potential study. Although this paper describes energy efficiency options in a specific facility, the recommended actions have broad application. In this study, the results show that none of the group replacement with high efficiency motors, adjustable speed drive motors, and high efficiency lighting would yield <b>paybacks</b> of less than 3 years. However, the end-of-useful life replacement with high efficiency motors for abatement of exhaust and deionizing of water as well as high efficiency lighting would yield <b>paybacks</b> of less than 3 years. The installation of adjustable speed drive motors at the end of useful life would not yield average <b>paybacks</b> of less than 3 years. Although specific implementation plans to achieve the energy savings are not outlined in this paper, it is hoped that the results of this analysis will identify areas which merit further engineering and economic analyses...|$|R
5|$|After WrestleMania 32, on the April 4, 2016 {{episode of}} Raw, Ziggler {{went to a}} double countout with Baron Corbin, leading to Corbin hitting an End of Days outside of the ring to Ziggler, igniting a feud in the process. At the <b>Payback</b> pre-show, Ziggler faced Baron Corbin in a winning effort. The two then had a no {{disqualification}} match at Extreme Rules where Corbin won after hitting a low blow on Ziggler. Following Extreme Rules, on the May 23 episode of Raw, Ziggler had a confrontation backstage with Corbin and challenged him to a technical wrestling match the next week. In that match, Ziggler intentionally got himself disqualified when he kicked Corbin in the groin immediately after the match began. This led to a rubber match at Money in the Bank, which Corbin won to end their feud.|$|E
5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy <b>payback</b> time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E
5|$|At <b>Payback,</b> the Shield {{ended their}} feud with Evolution by {{defeating}} {{them in a}} six-man No Holds Barred elimination match. On the next Raw on June 2, Batista quit WWE in the storyline as Triple H, in wanting to continue the feud with the Shield, refused to grant Batista a one-on-one match for the WWE World Heavyweight title. Later that night, Seth Rollins turned on his Shield teammates and allied himself with Triple H's Authority, eventually winning the Money in the Bank briefcase. The remaining members of the Shield, Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, went their separate ways {{by the end of}} June. Cesaro ended his association with Paul Heyman in July on the night of Brock Lesnar's return. By that time, Cesaro had failed to win title matches for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, the Intercontinental Championship and the United States Championship.|$|E
50|$|In March 1974, Dale Anderson {{was convicted}} in U.S. District Court on several counts, {{including}} 32 counts of extortion, tax evasion, and conspiracy. The trial lasted 10 weeks and centered on <b>paybacks</b> from contractors in exchange for contracts for state jobs. Anderson was sentenced to 5 years in prison, but only served a portion of that time.|$|R

5|$|At {{the science}} fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet {{tarantula}} has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps {{up behind her}} during the chaos, and pinches her leg {{to make it seem}} that the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated in front of her teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as <b>payback.</b>|$|E
5|$|Daniel Bryan {{announced}} on May 12 {{that due to}} injuries, he would require neck surgery, which he underwent on May 15. Bryan was stripped of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by the Authority on June 9 as he was not healthy enough to defend his championship. Due to his injury, Bryan was largely removed from WWE television. John Cena's feud with Bray Wyatt culminated with a Last Man Standing at <b>Payback</b> on June 1, where Cena buried Wyatt under multiple equipment cases to win the match and end the feud. Cena won Bryan's vacated WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank on June 29. Brock Lesnar returned on July 21 and proceeded to decisively defeat Cena at SummerSlam to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Gibson {{starred in}} Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet in 1990, as the eponymous {{character}} of the Shakespearean tragedy of the same name. It was the first film produced by Icon Productions, a production company he co-founded with Bruce Davey. Gibson's directorial debut was The Man Without a Face (1993), an adaptation of Isabelle Holland's novel of the same name. Two years later he directed and produced Braveheart, a historical epic drama in which he also portrayed Sir William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish knight. The film earned him a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Gibson went on to star in Ransom (1996), <b>Payback</b> (1999), What Women Want and The Patriot (both in 2000), and We Were Soldiers (2002).|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} part, titled <b>Payback,</b> Atwood {{examines}} ecological debt. She recounts {{the journey of}} Scrooge in A Christmas Carol but placed in a modern setting. The modern-day Scrooge is visited by the spirits of Earth Day. In the past Scrooge witnesses debts to nature being repaid through animal and human sacrifices and through pestilence in over-crowded or unsustainable populations. In the present Scrooge witnesses current unsustainable practices, over-fishing and deforestation, creating a debt to nature being repaid through effects on the climate and impacts on people. Finally, in the future, Scrooge is shown two versions: one, an eco-friendly human society balanced with environmental systems, and the other, a dystopian future with a disaster affecting the fuel or food resources {{in such a way}} that hyperinflation sets in and renders money useless.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had never}} seriously {{considered}} coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching {{position with the}} Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as <b>payback</b> for all the years {{he was not the}} league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid. It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary. After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1979, a bus {{carrying}} 18 American Navy sailors {{was forced}} to stop by a delivery truck. Shortly afterwards, four men appeared from within another vehicle and opened fire, killing Emil White and John Ball. Both the EPB and the OVPRR accepted responsibility for the attack, citing it as <b>payback</b> for the unclarified death of Ángel Rodríguez Cristóbal (previously arrested for protesting the Navy's activities in the island of Vieques) in a federal prison in Tallahassee, which had raised controversy because the photographic evidence displayed signs of contusions and contradicted the official account that he had simply committed suicide. On March 13, 1980, the EPB took responsibility for attacking an ROTC vehicle that was moving three soldiers to the UPR.|$|E
