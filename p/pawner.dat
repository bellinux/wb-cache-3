60|$|But {{neither the}} {{official}} police nor Holmes's own small but very efficient organization sufficed to clear away the mystery. Amid the crowded millions of London the three persons we sought were as completely obliterated {{as if they}} had never lived. Advertisements were tried, and failed. Clues were followed, and led to nothing. Every criminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was drawn in vain. His old associates were watched, but they kept clear of him. And then suddenly, after a week of helpless suspense there came a flash of light. A silver-and-brilliant pendant of old Spanish design had been pawned at Bovington's, in Westminster Road. The <b>pawner</b> was a large, clean-shaven man of clerical appearance. His name and address were demonstrably false. The ear had escaped notice, but the description was surely that of Shlessinger.|$|E
5000|$|If an item is pawned {{for a loan}} (colloquially, [...] "hocked"), {{within a}} certain {{contractual}} period of time the <b>pawner</b> may redeem it {{for the amount of}} the loan plus some agreed-upon amount for interest. The amount of time, and rate of interest, is governed by law or by the pawnbroker's policies. If the loan is not paid (or extended, if applicable) within the time period, the pawned item will be offered for sale to other customers by the pawnbroker. Unlike other lenders, the pawnbroker does not report the defaulted loan on the customer's credit report, since the pawnbroker has physical possession of the item and may recoup the loan value through outright sale of the item. The pawnbroker also sells items that have been sold outright to them by customers. Some pawnshops are willing to trade items in their shop for items brought to them by customers.|$|E
50|$|In Italy, {{the country}} of origin of the mont de piété, the {{institution}} still flourishes. It is, as a rule, managed by a committee or commission, and the regulations follow Italy pretty closely {{the lines of the}} one in Rome, which never lends less than fod. or more than 40. Four-fifths of the value is lent upon gold, silver and jewels, and two-thirds upon other articles. The interest, which is reckoned monthly, varies with the amount of the loan from 5 to 7%, but no interest is chargeable upon loans up to 5 lire. A loan runs for six months, and may be renewed for similar periods up to a maximum of five years. If the renewal does not take place within a fortnight of the expiration of the ticket, the pledge is sold, any surplus there may be being paid to the <b>pawner.</b> When more than 10 lire is lent there is a charge of 1% for the ticket. Agencies of the mont de pit are scattered about Rome, and carry on their business under the same rules as the central office, with the disadvantage to the borrower that he has to pay an agents fee. The amount to be advanced by a municipal pawnshop is fixed by an official called the commissaire-priseur, who is compelled to load the scales against the borrower, since, should the pledge remain unredeemed and be sold for less than was lent upon it, he has to make good the difference. This official is paid at the rate of 3/4% upon loans and renewals, and 3% on the amount obtained by the sales of forfeited pledges. The borrower has to pay an agents fee of 2%, which is deducted from the loan. Private pawnshops also exist in Italy, under police authority; but they charge very high interest.|$|E

40|$|Pawn {{practice}} {{has long been}} applied in the Tawangmangu society. The pawn practice in rice field that occurs in the Tawangmangu society can be briefly described as follows, namely {{with the arrival of}} the A to the B intending to borrow some money to provide collateral in the form of rice field then this rice field are managed by the B to take the result until A can pay off the debt and there is no limit time in refunding the loan and sometimes to several harvest times or years. This contract can harm one party, usually those who feel most aggrieved is the <b>pawner,</b> because paddy land as collateral be fully utilized by the pawnee without any revenue sharing with the <b>pawner</b> for the harvest of the land collateral. This is presumably prompted the authors to conduct further research on the practice of paddy land in the Tawangmangu district to be discussed and analyzed in the perspective of Islamic law. The purpos of this study is to find out whether the pledge agreement executed by the Tawangmangu society in accordance with the rules of the pawn contract that have been regulated in Islamic law or not. This research is a field one, and the data obtained using the method of observation, interviews, and ocumentation. The method of data analysis is a qualitative analysis techniqu, and in the conclusion the author has used the inductive method Based on the results of the research, it is concluded that the practice of contract execution of field land pawn in district Tawangmangu is valid in accordance with the provisions of Islamic law. Regarding the full use of collateral by the pawnee is not valid because of the element making opportunistic fashion and does not maintain the values of justice and welfare...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{theoretical}} paper that presents {{the differences between}} Ar Rahnu and conventional pawn broking in the intention to highlight why conventional pawn broking is not compatible with maqasid shariah {{while at the same}} time presenting that Ar Rahnu has conceptualized the application of maqasid syariah. This paper blends the theory of utility, the law of scarcity, information gathered from Quran and Sunnah with maqasid shariah in defending its arguments. From the blend, it is found that conventional pawn broking is deviated from the maqasid as opposed to Ar Rahnu. Ar Rahnu is revealed to offer a better alternative for <b>pawner</b> to have short term cash and property protection. In short, the paper establishes that although Ar Rahnu and conventional pawn broking serve the same function, the differences between these schemes highlights that the application of maqasid shariah is realizable in Ar Rahnu...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} pawning {{primarily from the}} perspective of the pawners. It utilises two samples from the ledgers of a municipal pawnshop in Borås in western Sweden, from 1922 / 23 and 1932 / 33. Its aim is to deal with the relation between the material and financial side of pawning as well as the causes behind pawning. One of the results of the study is that most pawn loans were very small, which means that pawning probably was connected to income insufficiency. It showed that weekly repeated pawning, which has been proposed in previous research as a common pattern, was nearly non-existent. Instead, most pawners were occasional customers at the pawnshop. It was shown that certain collateral (such as clothes and decorative objects) affected the length of the redemption time. This meant that pawners had the ability to redeem a pledge quickly – if they had a need for the item. However, at the same time, pawns could remain for a long time in the pawnshop, which indicates that repaying the loan was difficult for the <b>pawner.</b> Otherwise, they should have acted to minimise the interest they had to pay for the loan. For the <b>pawner</b> the payment of the loan likely meant foregoing much needed consumption in the present. According to this study, variability of income was a more important cause for pawning than the size of income. Pawn loans likely countered short-term variation in income or expenditures. However, it could not help against long-term unemployment. The study also investigated if pawning was affected by the life cycle, but found no clear relationship. The study showed that most of the customers at the pawnshop were male, which goes against most of the previous research. Another of the study’s result was that women’s pawning, but not men’s pawning, was connected to the presence of children in the household, and women had also more children than men did. Having many children had also an effect on women’s pawning, but not on men’s. The study considers that it seems like women pawned more due to family needs than men did...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pawn</b> {{structure}} is commonly important in positional chess. Deficiencies in <b>pawn</b> structure can include having doubled <b>pawns</b> or isolated <b>pawns.</b> A positional advantage can {{be having a}} passed <b>pawn.</b> Exchanges of <b>pawns</b> or other pieces are often made or avoided to prevent such deficiencies or to obtain a <b>pawn</b> structure advantage. If an opponent moves a <b>pawn</b> into a position diagonally adjacent to a player's <b>pawn,</b> effectively offering an exchange of <b>pawns,</b> sometimes {{it is possible to}} avoid a disadvantageous <b>pawn</b> exchange by moving the attacked <b>pawn</b> directly forward instead of taking the offered <b>pawn.</b> However, one may also consider making exchanges of <b>pawns</b> or other pieces to open up a file for one's rooks and queen or opening up a diagonal for one's bishop and queen, even if a <b>pawn</b> deficiency is incurred.|$|R

Because endgames are often {{won by the}} player who can promote a <b>pawn</b> first, having a passed <b>pawn</b> in an endgame can be decisive - especially a protected passed <b>pawn</b> (a passed <b>pawn</b> that is protected by a <b>pawn).</b> In this vein, a <b>pawn</b> majority, {{a greater number of}} <b>pawns</b> belonging to one player {{on one side of the}} chessboard, is strategically important because it can often be converted into a passed <b>pawn.</b>|$|R

40|$|The minithesis {{writing is}} related to {{practice}} of clove plantation pawning occurred in Pegayaman village, Kecamatan Sukasada, Buleleng Regency, Bali province. The research is interesting because the use of security by pawnbroker (murtahin) and existence of requirements that are not conforming to Islamic law. Focus of the research is problem about what is the pawn practice? How does Islamic law review about the pawn practice? The research is field one conducted in Pegayaman village, Kecamatan Sukasada, Buleleng Regency, Bali province. The research is descriptive one, namely researcher explains data that is found in field and provides evaluation form sharia perspective. The research uses normative approach, researcher analyzes problem based on norms contained in Islamic law with Al-Qur’an and hadiths as sources, and also uses relevant principles of Islamic law. Data of the research was collected by performing interview with relevant parties. Based on research in the field, researcher concluded that practice of clove plantation pawning in Pegayaman village, Kecamatan Sukasada, Buleleng Regency, Bali province between <b>pawner</b> (rahin) and pawnbroker (murtahin) was in opposition to Islamic law because: first, there was a forcing element within the agreement, namely if rahin does not give his clove plantation harvest to murtahin, so murtahin will not lend money to him; second, there was riba element in the pawn practice, namely murtahin takes benefit exceeding limits from rahin.; third, the use of security goods (marhun) completely by murtahin, it should be that murtahin only takes benefit comparable to maintenance and operational costs if the clove plantation is indeed requiring the costs. Murtahin was also using marhun without profit-sharing with rahin. The complete use of security goods by pawnbroker is not approved by Islamic law because it means opportunistic principle. Also, the practice was no maintaining justice values and, in fact, the clove plantation was still owned by rahin...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the example}} diagrams, Black attacks White's <b>pawn</b> on 2c by {{dropping}} a <b>pawn</b> on the 2d square leading White to capture Black's <b>pawn.</b> Then, Black plays the joining <b>pawn</b> tactic by dropping a second <b>pawn</b> to the 2e square forcing White's <b>pawn</b> {{to move to}} 2e. Since White's <b>pawn</b> is now at 2e, it cannot be used to protect White's camp on the second file.

5000|$|According to Reuben Fine and Pal Benko, this ending is a draw {{unless the}} <b>pawn</b> is a bishop <b>pawn</b> or a central <b>pawn</b> (i.e. king <b>pawn</b> or queen <b>pawn)</b> and the <b>pawn</b> {{is in the}} seventh rank and is {{supported}} by its king. If the defending king can {{get in front of}} the <b>pawn,</b> the game is a draw; otherwise it is best for the defender to keep his king far away from the <b>pawn.</b> The defender should keep checking until he runs out of check, and then pin the <b>pawn</b> [...] Based on computer analysis, Müller and Lamprecht give a different description. According to them, normally the defending king needs to be in front of the <b>pawn.</b> A rook <b>pawn</b> or knight <b>pawn</b> is a theoretical draw if the defending king is in front or near the <b>pawn</b> or if the king is in the corner opposite the pawn's promotion square. A knight <b>pawn</b> has more practical winning chances than a rook <b>pawn.</b> A bishop <b>pawn</b> or central <b>pawn</b> is a win if the defending king is not in front of the <b>pawn.</b> A bishop <b>pawn</b> has better winning chances than a central <b>pawn.</b> The position of the defending king is especially important [...] John Nunn states that analysis since Fine's initial work (published in 1941 in Basic Chess Endings) has shown that there are many more winning positions than were known at that time (ignoring the fifty-move rule in some cases) [...] Wins by the side with the <b>pawn</b> take up to 59 moves [...] A cross-check may be necessary to win.|$|R
2500|$|Knight and <b>pawn</b> endgames feature clever {{manoeuvring}} by {{the knights}} to capture opponent <b>pawns.</b> While a knight is poor at chasing a passed <b>pawn,</b> {{it is the}} ideal piece to block a passed <b>pawn.</b> Knights cannot lose a tempo, so knight and <b>pawn</b> endgames {{have much in common}} with king and <b>pawn</b> endgames. [...] As a result, Mikhail Botvinnik stated that “a knight ending is really a <b>pawn</b> ending.” ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>pawn</b> captures diagonally forward, to a cell of {{the same}} colour on which the <b>pawn</b> stands. But only a <b>pawn</b> on its initial cell may capture {{straight}} forward; once a <b>pawn</b> has moved, it may capture only to the sides. (So, unless it is a wing <b>pawn,</b> an unmoved <b>pawn</b> has three capturing possibilities; a <b>pawn</b> that has moved, two.) En passant captures are permitted in Brusky's chess.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pawns</b> {{which are}} both doubled and {{isolated}} are typically a tangible weakness. A single piece or <b>pawn</b> {{in front of}} doubled isolated <b>pawns</b> blocks both of them, and cannot be easily dislodged. It is rare for a player to have three <b>pawns</b> in a file, i.e. tripled <b>pawns.</b> Depending on the position, tripled <b>pawns</b> may {{be more or less}} valuable than two <b>pawns</b> which are side by side.|$|R
