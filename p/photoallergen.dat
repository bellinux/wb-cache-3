40|$|Photoallergic contact {{dermatitis}} (PACD) is a clinical {{problem that has}} often been poorly understood and neglected by dermatologists over recent years. This can be partly attributed to its investigation by photopatch testing (PPT) falling between the expertise of photobiologists and {{contact dermatitis}} clinicians. One result of this situation was that no European Baseline PPT series had been agreed on. To redress this, the European multi centre photopatch test study (EMCPPTS) was conceived to provide up to date information on which <b>photoallergens</b> are of greatest clinical relevance. Its conduct and results form the core research project of this thesis. To enable the EMCPPTS to proceed and its results to be viewed in a wider context, the other Chapters of this thesis explore important related aspects of PACD and PPT in Europe. The introduction examines the nature of PACD and PPT and reviews current <b>photoallergens.</b> Then, {{the investigation of the}} two <b>photoallergens</b> carprofen and chlorproethazine by PPT is recounted. These studies highlight deficiencies within the current European regulatory system for preventing <b>photoallergens</b> from reaching the marketplace, as well as providing templates for the investigation of new <b>photoallergens</b> in the human environment. This is followed by a pilot PPT study which provides new information on the optimum non-irritating concentration of the 19 ultraviolet sunscreen absorbers {{to be used in the}} EMCPPTS. The issue of attempting to determine the photoallergenic potential of the EMCPPTS agents with respect to exposure patterns is addressed by conducting a sunscreen survey in the UK. The EMCPPTS itself is then detailed, as well as the difficulties that can be encountered when conducting a large clinical study of this nature. The results from the EMCPPTS and other presented studies were shown to be of importance in deciding upon a new European Baseline PPT series. The process involved in deciding this series, as well as its content are described before overall conclusions and possible future studies in the domain of PACD and PPT are discussed.

Recently, we have proposed the use of THP- 1 cells and IL- 8 release to identify the potential of chemicals to induce skin sensitization. Based {{on the assumption that}} sensitization and photosensitization share common mechanisms, the aim of this work was to explore the THP- 1 model as an in vitro model to identify photoallergenic chemicals. THP- 1 cells were exposed to 7 <b>photoallergens</b> and 3 photoirritants and irradiated with UVA light or kept in dark. Non phototoxic allergens or irritants were also included as negative compounds. Following 24 h of incubation, cytotoxicity and IL- 8 release were measured. At subtoxic concentrations, <b>photoallergens</b> produced a dose-related increase in IL- 8 release after irradiation. Some photoirritants also produced a slight increase in IL- 8 release. However, when the overall stimulation indexes of IL- 8 were calculated for each chemical, 6 out of 7 <b>photoallergens</b> tested reached a stimulation index above 2, while the entire set of negative compounds had stimulation indexes below 2.

Aim: We carried out this study using <b>photoallergens</b> relevant in the Indian context to determine their relevance in patients of photodermatitis. Methods: Thirty patients (M:F, 23 : 7) between 19 and 76 years of age of photodermatitis and 10 controls were patch- and photopatch tested with 20 common <b>photoallergens.</b> In addition, the patients were also (photo) patch tested with articles of daily use as and when these were suspected to be the cause.

Fourteen positive photopatch tests to seven allergens were observed in 10 (33 %) patients, and nine (30 %) of them had a definite relevance. The most common contact allergen was fragrance mix (FM) (30 %), followed by p-phenylenediamine (20 %) and Parthenium hysterophorous (17 %). The definite relevance of the patch- and photopatch tests could be correlated in 47 % of these patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{two most}} common agent groups {{currently}} responsible for photoallergic contact dermatitis (PACD) are organic ultraviolet (UV) absorbers in sunscreens and topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, {{availability of information}} on the photoallergenic potential of these agents is scarce. OBJECTIVES: To obtain current information on the frequency of PACD to 19 organic UV absorbers and five topical NSAIDs, including newer agents, in common usage in Europe. METHODS: A prospective, multicentre photopatch test study was conducted with 1031 patients attending for investigation of suspected PACD in 30 centres across 12 European countries. RESULTS: A total of 346 PACD reactions in 200 (19 · 4 %) subjects occurred. PACD was most commonly caused by the topical NSAIDs, ketoprofen (128 subjects) and etofenamate (59 subjects). Of the organic UV absorbers, octocrylene, benzophenone- 3 and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane most frequently elicited PACD. The 'newer' organic sunscreen absorbers rarely led to PACD. There appeared to be an association between the agents ketoprofen, octocrylene and benzophenone- 3, with several subjects developing PACD to two or all three agents concomitantly. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) was less commonly observed than PACD, comprising 55 reactions in 47 (5 %) subjects. Irritant reactions and photoaugmentation and photoinhibition of ACD occurred infrequently.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} observed <b>photoallergens</b> today is the sunscreen agent 4 -tert-butyl- 4 ′-methoxy dibenzoylmethane (1 a). The structurally similar compound, 4 -isopropyldibenzoylmethane (1 b), was a common cause of sunscreen allergy in the eighties and early nineties but was removed from the market in 1993 and replaced with dibenzoylmethane 1 a. We have studied the photodegradation of the dibenzoylmethane 1 a, to better understand how these substances cause an immune reaction. Several expected degradation products were formed and identified. Of these, arylglyoxals and benzils were of particular interest because they were unexplored as potential contact allergens. The allergenic potential of photodegraded 1 a was evaluated by screening the formed arylglyoxals and benzils for their sensitizing capacity in the murine local lymph node assay. The arylglyoxals were found to be strong sensitizers. They were also found to be highly reactive toward the nucleophile arginine, which indicates that the immunogenic hapten-protein complex could be formed via an electrophilic-nucleophilic pathway. By varying the electron-withdrawing or -donating capacity of the substituent in the para position of the arylglyoxal, the electronic effects were shown to have no significant impact on either the sensitizing or the electrophilic power of arylglyoxals. Thus, a change in the substitution pattern of the parent dibenzoylmethane will not influence the sensitizing capacity of the products formed from them upon photodegradation. Furthermore, the combined studies of benzils, using the local lymph node assay and a cell proliferation assay, indicate that the benzils are cytotoxic rather than allergenic. Taken together, this study presents strong indication that photocontact allergy to dibenzoylmethanes is caused by the arylglyoxals that are formed upon photodegradation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1984, the German, Austrian, and Swiss Photopatch Test Group {{was founded}} to {{standardize}} the photopatch test procedure and to investigate photoallergic reactions, {{as well as}} the epidemiology of photoallergy, in central Europe. Therefore in a first test period from 1985 - 1990, 32 test substances were applied on the backs of patients suspected to be photosensitive. After evaluation of these data, some substances were dismissed, and others were additionally integrated into the test tray. Thus a modified test tray comprising 26 test substances was used for the second test period (1991 - 1997). OBJECTIVE: According to the standard photopatch test procedure defined in the first test period, the aim of this multicenter study was to apply compounds from the modified second test tray to a large group of photosensitive patients. After evaluation of the second test period (1991 - 1997), the outcome was compared with the results of the first period. On the basis of these results and influenced by concurrently published case reports, a third modified photopatch test tray has been established. METHODS: After the application of a duplicate test tray for 24 hours, one test site was irradiated with 10 J/cm(2) UVA, and the other test site served as the control area. Readings were performed immediately and 24, 48, and 72 hours after irradiation. Test reactions were qualitatively graded according to a 4 -point scale and classified by the investigators of the participating centers. In 49 participating clinics 1261 photopatch tests were performed. All data were subjected to computer-assisted analysis by using a specially developed software to classify all positive test reactions as plain contact or photoinduced reactions (nonspecific, toxic, or allergic photoreactions) and to define substance-specific reaction patterns. RESULTS: In test period 1 data of 1129 patients were evaluated. From 2859 positive test reactions, 28. 6 % were excluded as plain contact reactions, 71. 4 % were found to be photoinduced reactions, and 3. 8 % were classified as photoallergic. In test period 2 data of 1261 patients were evaluated. One thousand four hundred fifteen positive test reactions were observed, and of these, 28. 7 % were excluded as plain contact reactions, 71. 3 % were classified as photoinduced reactions, and 8. 1 % were classified as photoallergic reactions. In both test periods nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disinfectants, and phenothiazines represented the leading <b>photoallergens</b> in the evaluated central European region. By using computer-assisted reaction pattern analysis, substance-specific reaction patterns could be distinguished. These substance-specific reaction patterns comprised 4 main categories: the well-known decrescendo (phototoxic) and crescendo (photoallergic) reaction patterns, as well as a combined and a plateau pattern. CONCLUSION: The test modification after the first test period led to a notably reduced number of positive (mainly nonphotoallergic and thus nonrelevant) test reactions per patient in the second test period (from 2. 6 to 1. 1). In contrast, the percentage of photoallergic reactions increased significantly from 3. 8 % to 8. 1 % of all positive test reactions. Test modifications after the first test period led to a remarkably improved specificity of the photopatch test. Furthermore, substance-specific reaction patterns observed in test period 1 were confirmed in test period 2...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} are {{reviewed}} the various hypotheses concerning the etiology of the persistent light reaction and photosensitivity dermatitis, which occurs among older people and is characterized by an extreme photosensitivity that sometimes evolves into a pseudolymphoma, that is, actinic reticuloid.

40|$|Photoallergic dermatoses are skin lesions {{following}} sun exposure, {{characterized by}} activation of immunological mechanisms, involving photosensitizers and photoallergens {{that can cause}} photosensibilization in some individuals. In this group of disorders, photoallergic contact dermatitis should be accentuated. It manifests as contact allergic dermatitis on sun-exposed skin areas, following direct contact with photoallergens during UV exposure (predominantly UVA). Under influence of light, photosensitizers get activated, followed by fusion with cutaneous proteins which renders them to complete antigens, and consequential initiation of immunological mechanisms with resulting pathological skin lesions. The most common photoallergens are: sulfonamide antibiotics, phenothiazines, and halogenated salicylanilides. Photoallergic dermatoses are comprised of several disorders, although the causative <b>photoallergen</b> remains unknown (e. g. solar urticaria, polymorphous light eruption and hydroa vacciniforme). Solar urticaria is a rare, acute urticarial reaction on both sun-exposed and covered skin areas, which appears soon after exposure to sun or artificial lighting. Polymorphous light eruption is a relatively common polymorphous skin eruption, which usually appears in spring. Its pathogenesis is unknown, presumably photoallergic reaction.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Benzydamine, a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) in use {{for more}} than four decades, has been reported to cause photosensitivity. OBJECTIVES: To study the results of photopatch testing to benzydamine and the clinical features of the dermatitis during a 3 -year period (2006 - 2008). PATIENTS AND METHODS: During this period, 74 patients with photodermatoses were photopatch tested with an extended baseline series of allergens including benzydamine and in suspicious cases, with drugs that contain it. Test sites were irradiated on D 2 with 5 J/cm(2) and readings were performed on D 2 and D 4. RESULTS: Ten patients (six females/four males), aged 21 - 84 years (mean 64. 9) had a positive photopatch test to benzydamine [1 - 5 % petrolatum (pet.) from Bial-Aristegui] and to drugs that contain it (Tantum verde oral solution and Momen gel). Nine patients had lower lip cheilitis and one lichenified eczema on photo-exposed sites. CONCLUSION: Photosensitivity from both topical and systemic benzydamine has been occasionally described, mainly in southern Spain.

40|$|Summary Background Despite the {{enormous}} increase in sunscreen use, allergic contact (AC) and photoallergic (PA) reactions to ultraviolet (UV) filters are considered rare. Objectives To analyse {{the data from}} 2715 patients who underwent photopatch testing at St John's Institute of Dermatology during the period 1983 ± 98. Methods A retrospective analysis of all positive photopatch test episodes was undertaken with the results retrieved from the environmental dermatology database and further verified with the original archived patch test documentation for each individual patient. Results In 111 patients with positive reactions (4 ´ 1 %), there were 155 AC or PA reactions to allergens in the photopatch test series. Eighty PA reactions were observed in 62 (2 ´ 3 %) patients (32 men and 30 women, age range 28 ± 75 years), with UV filters accounting for 52 positive reactions (65 %), drugs 16 (20 %), musk ambrette 11 (14 %) and the antiseptic trichlorocarbanilide one (1 %). The most common UV filter <b>photoallergen</b> was benzophenone- 3 with 14 positive results, followed by benzophenone- 10 (n 9), isopropyl dibenzoylmethane (n 6), p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) (n 5), octyl dimethyl PABA (n 5), butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (n 4), isoamyl methoxycinnamate (n 2), ethyl methoxycinnamate (n 2), octyl methoxycinnamate (n 2) ...|$|E
40|$|The use of sunscreens is the ‘gold standard’ for {{protecting}} the skin from ultraviolet light. Octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) {{is one of the}} most widely used UVB filter but it can act as a sensitizer or <b>photoallergen.</b> When exposed to sunlight, OMC can change from the primary trans-form to cisform and the isomerization, not reversible, conducts to a reduction of the UVB filtering efficiency because the trans-form has a higher extinction coefficient. Photostability is the most important characteristic of effective sunscreens and it can be influenced by formulation ingredients and by applying technological strategies. In this work, photostability experiments, performed on emulsion– gels containing different percentages of OMC free or loaded in poly(d,l-lactide) nanoparticles, were carried out. The presence of a polymeric envelop may act to protect the active ingredient. In this study, the influence of poly(d,l-lactide) matrices on the photochemical stability of the sunscreen agent was investigated. As highlighted in this study, free OMC in different formulations has different photoisomerization degree. Moreover, a dissimilar behaviour was observed by studying different sunscreen concentrations in the same cosmetic formulation. Photostability results show a significant reduction in photoisomerization degree for formulations containing sunscreen loaded in nanoparticles, highlighting that the encapsulation is a suitable strategy to improve OMC photostability. Moreover, sun protection factor (SPF) results show that the UVB filter protective power is also maintained after encapsulation...|$|E
40|$|Differentiation between photoallergenic and phototoxic {{reactions}} {{induced by}} {{low molecular weight}} compounds represents a current problem.

We have previously demonstrated the possibility to use the human keratinocyte cell line NCTC 2455 and the production of interleukin- 18 (IL- 18) to screen low molecular weight sensitizers. The purpose of this work was to explore the possibility to use the NCTC 2544 assay to identify photoallergens and discriminate from phototoxic chemicals. First, we identified suitable condition of UV-irradiation (3. 5 J/cm 2) by investigating the effect of UVAirradiation on intracellular IL- 18 on untreated or chloropromazine (a representative phototoxic compound) - treated NCTC 2544 cells. Then, the effect of UVA-irradiation over NCTC 2544 cells treated with increasing concentrations of 15 compounds including photoallergens (benzophenone, 4 -ter-butyl- 4 -methoxydibenzoylmethane, 2 -ethylexyl-p-methoxycinnamate, ketoprofen, 6 -methylcumarin); photoirritant and <b>photoallergen</b> (4 -aminobenzoic acid, chlorpromazine, promethazine); photoirritants (acridine, ibuprofen, 8 -methoxypsoralen, retinoic acid); and negative compounds (lactic acid, SDS and p-phenilendiamine) was investigated. Twenty-four hours after exposure, cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTT assay or LDH leakage, while ELISA was used to measure the production of IL- 18. At the maximal concentration assayed with non-cytotoxic effects (CV 80 under irradiated condition), all tested photoallergens induced a significant and a dose-dependent increase of intracellular IL- 18 following UVA irratiation, whereas photoirritants failed. We suggest that this system may be useful for the in vitro evaluation of the photoallergic potential of chemicals...|$|E

Observation: Positive reactions were detected in 12 of 26 patients who were tested with our <b>photoallergen</b> se-ries: 5 with allergic contact dermatitis, 5 with photoal-lergic contact dermatitis, and 2 with both. Four of the 12 patients had positive patch and photo-patch test re-actions to plant allergens, pesticide allergens, or both.

40|$|ABSTRACT The sun’s UV {{radiation}} {{is necessary for}} the existence of life on earth. However, too much UV exposure can lead to the development of skin cancer. Therefore, sunscreens are often used by the general population as protection from excessive UV radiation. Unfortunately, many of the chemical UV-filters that are used in sunscreens today have the ability to induce contact and photocontact allergy. In this work two different chemical UV-filters together with the anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen, all known to induce allergic reactions, have been studied to better understand the reason for these adverse effects. In addition, a synthetic route to the natural UV-filter scytonemin has been developed. One of the most commonly used UVA-filters today is the well known <b>photoallergen</b> 4 -tert-butyl- 4 ’-methoxy dibenzoylmethane. We showed that it degrades when irradiated with UV light and that several different photodegradation products are formed. Of particular interest were arylglyoxals and benzils because they were unexplored as potential contact allergens. The benzils were found to be cytotoxic rather than allergenic, whereas the arylglyoxals were found to be strong sensitizers in the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) used to assess their allergenic potency. Photocontact allergy to dibenzoylmethanes is therefore probably caused by the arylglyoxals that are formed upon photodegradation. Chemical reactivity experiments showed that the arylglyoxals have the ability to form immunogenic complexes via an electrophilic-nucleophilic reaction with the amino acid arginine. A relatively new UV-filter on the market is octocrylene that has grown in popularity, due to its ability to stabilize other UV-filters such as 4 -tert-butyl- 4 ’-methoxy dibenzoylmethane. However, recent clinical reports suggest that it is the UV-filter that causes most allergic reactions. Patch and photopatch testing of 172 patients with suspected skin reactions to sunscreens or ketoprofen was performed and 23 of these patients displayed a positive test reaction to octocrylene. Five patients were diagnosed with contact allergy and 18 with photocontact allergy. Notably, many of these patients also displayed a photoinduced reaction to ketoprofen. Without UV radiation, octocrylene was classified as a moderate allergen in the murine LLNA and it was shown to reacted with amines like lysine via a retro-aldol condensation. In presence of UV radiation, octocrylene also reacted with amines but via acyl substitution resulting in a different product outcome than the reaction in the dark. Both the clinical studies and the chemical reactivity experiments thereby indicate that octocrylene has the ability to induce both contact and photocontact allergy. The apparent photocross-reactivity between octocrylene and ketoprofen observed in the clinical study could not be explained by the previous reactivity studies of octocrylene. Furthermore, according to other clinical reports, photosensitization to ketoprofen also leads to photocontact allergy to many other compounds. Ketoprofen was therefore irradiated in presence of five amino acid analogs and interestingly a reaction between the tryptophan and lysine analogs was substantially enhanced by ketoprofen. We believe that ketoprofen generates singlet molecular oxygen which activates the tryptophan analog that subsequently reacts with the lysine analog. The formation of an immunogenic complex not containing the allergen itself can explain many of the observed photocross allergies between ketoprofen and other structurally different compounds. In theory all compounds that are able to generate singlet molecular oxygen can promote the formation of the same immunogenic complex. Finally, the first total synthesis of the dimeric alkaloid scytonemin was developed. This natural occurring UV-filter enables the survival of different species of cyanobacteria in areas of intense solar radiation. The planed structure activity studies of scytonemin and derivatives thereof will hopefully lead {{to the development of a}} stable UV-filter that does not cause contact or photocontact allergy...|$|E
