40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the influence of tree age on the assimilates partitioning and its significance {{for the formation of}} heartwood extractives in Robinia pseudoacacia L. (black locust). Assimilate translocation in 6 - and 15 -year-old plants was measured in May and August 2006 using the 14 CO 2 feeding method. The heartwood extractives content in the sapwood-heartwood transition zone and in individual tree rings of the pure heartwood were analysed by HPLC-chromatography. All plants, buds and young leaves showed the strongest 14 C specific activity compared to other plant parts in May and August(14 C specific activity in buds/leaves of 6 -years old plants: 35. 2 - 37. 0 %, 15 -years old plants: 31. 4 - 32. 2 %). However, in <b>plants</b> <b>labelled</b> in August 2006 at the sapwood-heartwood transition zone also showed a strong assimilates sink, while only small amounts of assimilates were translocated to the sapwood-heartwood transition zone in the <b>plants</b> <b>labelled</b> in May 2006. The amount of assimilates transported to the sapwood-heartwood transition zone was significantly higher in the 15 -year-old plants compared to the 6 -year-old plants. This was monitored by a higher content of extractives in the heartwood formed by the older plants compared to heartwood formed by the younger plants. The results indicate that uneven assimilate partitioning in younger and older black locust plants affects the heartwood extractives formation, which might lead to a lower natural durability of the heartwood formed by younger trees compared to heartwood formed by older trees...|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, Bruce Lee Bednar {{wrote that}} {{cultivated}} <b>plants</b> <b>labelled</b> as N. kampotiana {{were thought to}} represent a natural hybrid between N. mirabilis and N. thorelii, and that these appeared on some lists under the unofficial name N. × lecouflei. Bednar noted that a plant known in the horticultural trade as [...] "thorelii-long green" [...] was {{considered by many to}} be a Thailand form of N. mirabilis, while another plant called [...] "short round", which had [...] leaves and squat pitchers, might represent the true N. thorelii. If this were the case, it would mean that artificial crosses such as N. 'Hachijo' and N. 'Effulgent Koto' are intergrades of N. mirabilis as opposed to hybrids.|$|R

40|$|Root-deposited {{photosynthate}} (rhizodeposition) is {{an important}} source of readily available carbon (C) for microbes in the vicinity of growing roots. Plant nutrient availability is controlled, to a large extent, by the cycling of this and other organic materials through the soil microbial community. Currently, our understanding of microbial community dynamics associated with rhizodeposition is limited. We used a 13 C pulse-chase labeling procedure to examine the incorporation of rhizodeposition into individual phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in the bulk and rhizosphere soils of greenhouse-grown annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. var. Gulf). Labeling took place during a growth stage in transition between active root growth and rapid shoot growth on one set of <b>plants</b> (<b>labeling</b> period 1) and 9 days later during the rapid shoot growth stage on another set of <b>plants</b> (<b>labeling</b> period 2). Temporal differences in microbial community composition were more apparent than spatial differences, with a greater relative abundance of PLFAs from gram-positive organisms (i 15 : 0 and a 15 : 0) in the second labeling period. Although more abundant, gram-positive organisms appeared to be less actively utilizing rhizodeposited C in labeling period 2 than in labeling period 1. Gram-negative bacteria associated with the 16 : 1 ω 5 PLFA were more active in utilizing 13 C-labeled rhizodeposits in the second labeling period than in the first labeling period. In both labeling periods, however, the fungal PLFA 18 : 2 ω 6, 9 was the most highly labeled. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using 13 C labeling and PLFA analysis to examine the microbial dynamics associated with rhizosphere C cycling by focusing on the members actively involved...|$|R

50|$|Utricularia cornigera {{is a large}} {{perennial}} {{carnivorous plant}} that belongs to the genus Utricularia. U. cornigera was described in 2009 by Miloslav Studnička based on {{his study of the}} variation in cultivated <b>plants</b> <b>labeled</b> Utricularia reniformis and apparent different geographic ranges. U. cornigera is found on Serra dos Órgãos in south-eastern Brazil and as of the new species' description, was not found in the presence of U. reniformis. Utricularia cornigera has been grown in cultivation under the name U. reniformis and with the cultivar name 'Big Sister'. It differs from U. reniformis by having 6-8 primordial leaves emerging from the seed during germination with a float and whorl of leaves. Utricularia cornigera also produces two distinct types of bladder traps that are dimorphic and it generally has larger leaves.|$|R
