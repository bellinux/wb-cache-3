50|$|Others {{have argued}} that tying aid to donor-country {{products}} is common sense; it is a strategic use of aid to promote donor country’s business or exports. It is further argued that tied aid - if well designed and effectively managed - would not necessarily compromise the quality {{as well as the}} effectiveness of aid. However, this argument would hold particularly for <b>programme</b> <b>aid,</b> where aid is tied to a specific projects or policies and where {{there is little or no}} commercial interest. It must be emphasized, however, that commercial interest and aid effectiveness are two different things, and it would be difficult to pursue commercial interest without compromising aid effectiveness. Thus, the idea of maximizing development should be separated from the notion of pursuing commercial interest. Tied aid improves donors export performance, creates business for local companies and jobs. It also helps to expose firms, which have not had any international experience on the global market to do so.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{research}} on the aid and growth relationship remains inconclusive. We propose that this ambiguity may {{be a result of}} ignoring different types of aid, such as project or <b>programme</b> <b>aid.</b> Indeed, disaggregating total aid into these two categories, we find evidence that project aid flows affect growth positively whilst the impact exerted by <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> is negative.

40|$|To {{strengthen}} {{the help that}} <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> gives to poor, we must strengthen its ability to increase {{the participation of the}} poor in growth. To do this requires a detailed appraisal during a programme's preparation to identify the expected impact on poverty of both the resource transfer of aid and the accompanying policy changes. Without this information opportunities to strengthen growth's benefits for poor people are missed. Our ability to evaluate the programme's poverty impact is severely constrained if the programme does not have clear poverty objectives and if it fails to establish processes for collecting poverty information. To improve <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> we must assess the implications of import support and debt relief for poverty, as well the implications of the countervalue funds provided by <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> which can help to support budgets for pro-poor services and infrastructure. A range of participatory techniques and household surveys should be used to assess these effects, and national capacities to gather the necessary information should be improved as a key priority...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the aid effectiveness literature in two important fronts. Firstly, it develops a new database for project aid and <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> disbursements for 104 developing countries, for the period of 1973 - 2001. Secondly, using this new dataset and, food aid and technical assistance data from the OECD-DAC database the paper re-examines the savings displacement hypothesis. The main results of this study can be summarised as follows. Firstly, taking into account the functional classification of development aid casts doubt on the conclusion and more importantly the policy recommendation of {{the vast majority of the}} existing aid effectiveness literature. Secondly, the results suggest, overall, that project aid flows and food aid (excluding emergency and relief food aid) are associated with a reduction domestic savings. By contrast, financial <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> and technical assistance grants do not appear to reduce domestic savings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirics of aid and growth by investigating whether aid modality matters in explaining its effectiveness. For this purpose, we include the four main aid modalities (project aid, financial <b>programme</b> <b>aid,</b> technical assistance grants and food aid) as explanatory variables in an endogenous growth model. Using the GMM-SYS approach to dynamic panel estimator we test the three main competing specifications in the aid and growth literature for a sample of aid recipient countries over the 1974 - 2001 period. We find that project aid exerts a positive and significant impact on growth, thus casting doubt on the so-called “micromacro paradox”. Our results also show that financial <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> generally impacts on growth negatively, while the impact of non-financial aid, technical assistance grants and food aid, is statistically insignificant. We found, however, no {{evidence to suggest that}} policy enhances the growth effect of the aid categories. Our non-linearity tests suggest that only project aid is associated with diminishing returns. Finally, our results confirm the finding that climate related conditions affect the working of aid (project) ...|$|E

40|$|The paper uses an aid {{disaggregation}} {{approach to}} {{examine the impact of}} different aid modalities on the fiscal sector of the aid-recipient country. It uses time-series data on different types of development aid (project aid, <b>programme</b> <b>aid,</b> technical assistance and food aid) for Uganda, an important aid recipient in recent years, to estimate a model of fiscal response in the presence of aid which combines aid heterogeneity and endogenous aid. The empirical findings clearly suggest the importance of the above approach for delving deeper into aid effectiveness issues since different aid categories have different effects on key fiscal variables-an impact that could not be revealed if a single figure for aid were employed. Project and food aids appear to cause a reduction in public investment whereas <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> and technical assistance are positively related to public investment. The same applies for government consumption. A negligible impact on government tax and non-tax revenues, and a strong displacement of government borrowing are also found.

40|$|Ownership {{refers to}} <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> {{recipient}} countries establishing their own development priorities by leading development policymaking {{in partnership with}} donors, rather than donors prescribing priorities for these recipients. Ownership has become a central indicator of global aid effectiveness since the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Simultaneously, donors have shifted towards a reliance on sectoral programme assistance which channels <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> throughout whole sectors rather than using piecemeal projects. The donors comprising the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development-Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) have institutionalized ownership as international aid policy, and are broadly of the view that ownership at the sectoral level is best promoted through a reliance on sector wide approaches (SWAps). However there is no settled understanding of what recipient leadership entails; there is lack of an institutional understanding of recipient contexts, and how these contexts can operationalize ownership; {{and there has been}} a spurious association between ownership and SWAps over time. By relying on Historical Institutionalism, this thesis discusses how broader institutional characteristics establish the context of recipient policymaking generally, and how these characteristics contextualize the operationalization of ownership during sectoral development policymaking, specifically. The evidence reveals that ownership can be simultaneously reflected and challenged in Jamaica...|$|E
40|$|This paper takes a {{fresh look}} at the issue of foreign aid fungibility. Unlike the bulk of {{existing}} empirical studies, I employ panel data that contain information on the specific purpose for which aid is given. This allows me to link aid given for education and health purposes to recipient public spending in these sectors. In addition, I attempt to distinguish between aid flows that are recorded on the recipient’s budget and those that are off-budget, and illustrate how a failure to differentiate between on- and off-budget aid produces biased estimates of fungibility. Sector <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> is the measure of on-budget aid, while technical cooperation serves as a proxy for off-budget aid. In both sectors, across a range of specifications, technical cooperation leads to at most a small displacement of recipient public expenditure, implying limited fungibility for this type of aid. In static fixed effects models sector <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> shows an almost one-for-one correlation with recipient public expenditure, again suggesting low fungibility, but this effect becomes imprecise and volatile in dynamic models estimated with system GMM. foreign aid, fungibility, public education expenditure, public health expenditure...|$|E

The mix between `responsive´ components of aid, e. g. <b>programme</b> <b>aid,</b> and `proactive´ components, e. g. technical assistance, is important.
