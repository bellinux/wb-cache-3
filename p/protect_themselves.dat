5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system.

Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E

5|$|By July 1990 the {{government}} began to distribute weapons to civilians in turn, to Krahn and Mandingo who wished to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves.</b> These hastily enlisted civilians became known as '1990 soldiers.' A '1990 soldier' which the President had personally picked, Tailey Yonbu, led a massacre of refugees, mostly Gio and Mandingo civilians, {{on the night of}} July 29/30, 1990 at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Sinkor, Monrovia. Some 600 were killed. Because of the previous ethnic purges carried out by Doe's forces, the conflict took on characteristics of an ethnic pogrom.|$|E
5|$|Many {{currently}} available pharmaceuticals {{are derived from}} the secondary metabolites plants use to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> from herbivores, including opium, aspirin, cocaine, and atropine. These chemicals have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in very specific ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human biochemistry in ways {{similar to that of}} insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in bioprospecting.|$|E

A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the Wild Weasel pilots.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{construction}} of the Iowa class, the US Navy was not building a fast battleship class solely for the purpose of escorting Pacific-based aircraft carriers, and thus the Montana class would not be designed principally for escorting the fast carrier task forces; nonetheless they would have been equipped with a wide array of anti-aircraft guns to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> and other ships (principally the US aircraft carriers) from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. If commissioned, the ships were expected to mount a considerable array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft weapons.|$|E

5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled the barges, sinking two {{and killing}} {{a great many}} of the picaroons. During this time two of the barges left the warship and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These barges managed to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> from Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which was between the two barges and the warship. The Haitians boarded Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the hold. The second barge attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once the Haitians had boarded Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|E
5|$|Insects in {{the group}} are plant-eaters, with a few species at times {{becoming}} serious pests of cereals, vegetables and pasture, especially when they swarm in their millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas. They <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> from predators by camouflage; when detected, many species attempt to startle the predator with a brilliantly-coloured wing-flash while jumping and (if adult) launching themselves into the air, usually flying for only a short distance. Other species such as the rainbow grasshopper have warning coloration which deters predators. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases, and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults. The eggs {{are the subject of}} attack by parasitoids and predators.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{were among}} the {{earliest}} terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants. Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> from their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics. Over time, {{this has led to}} complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms. Coevolution has {{led to the development of}} very specific mutualisms in such systems.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opinion was}} sharply divided. Some {{communities}} supported the rebellion {{for a variety}} of reasons. Others, including Gonzales, declared their loyalty to Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna's centralist government. Local leaders began calling for a Consultation to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> from head injuries. Helmets later evolved {{to be made of}} hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{equipment}} or kit players {{are required to}} wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. Headgear is not a required piece of {{basic equipment}}, but players today may choose to wear it to <b>protect</b> <b>themselves</b> from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.|$|E
