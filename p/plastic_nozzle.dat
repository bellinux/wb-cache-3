50|$|Venom {{extraction}} syringes {{are different}} from standard syringes, because they usually do not puncture the wound. The most common types have a <b>plastic</b> <b>nozzle</b> which is placed over the affected area, and then the syringe piston is pulled back, creating a vacuum that allegedly sucks out the venom. Attempts to treat snakebites in this way are specifically advised against, as they are ineffective and can cause additional injury.|$|E
50|$|During this two-year program, two {{development}} and three qualification motors were successfully static-tested. The motor is 45 in. in diameter, has a length-to-diameter ratio of 8:1, and delivers {{an average of}} 100,000 lb of thrust for an action time of 72 sec. The motor design features a very high volumetrically loaded internal-burning-charge design of 17% aluminized composite polybutadiene propellant, a plasma-welded and heat-treated 4130 steel alloy case, and an all-ablative <b>plastic</b> <b>nozzle</b> liner enclosed in a steel shell. The only significant development problem encountered was tailoring the grain design to account for erosive burning effects produced in the high length-to-diameter ratio, high subsonic mach number port. In this paper, the program development results will be presented, together with design descriptions and fabrication methods {{for each of the}} major components.|$|E

50|$|A tube is a soft {{squeezable}} container {{which can}} be used for thick liquids such as adhesive, caulking, ointment, and toothpaste. Basically, a tube is a cylindrical, hollow piece with a round or oval profile, made of plastic, paperboard, or aluminum. Both ends of this tube are treated differently during the manufacturing process and filling. In general, {{on one end of the}} tube body there is a round orifice, {{which can be}} closed by different caps and closures. The orifice can be shaped in many different ways. <b>Plastic</b> <b>nozzles</b> in various styles and lengths are just one good example.|$|R

40|$|Many {{species of}} caridean shrimp are protandrous hermaphrodites, {{maturing}} initially as males but developing into females {{as they age}} and grow. A unique sexual system was recently discovered in the peppermint shrimp, Lysmata wurdemanni. In this species, individuals are initially male, but become simultaneous functional hermaphrodites over time. As in most caridean shrimp, L. wurdemanni can mate as a male during the intermoult period, but can reproduce through female function for only a short period after moulting. Ecdysis does not occur en masse in this species, and thus the operational sex ratio found in populations of L. wurdemanni is extremely male-biased. Sexual selection theory suggests that these conditions will result in increased competition for access to mates. Evolutionary pressures should therefore have selected for mechanisms that permit individuals to quickly identify and locate potential mating partners. L. wurdemanni were exposed to chemical stimuli collected from recently moulted conspecifics of varying reproductive condition. Test animals were able to distinguish among the different conditions, and physically manipulated only the <b>plastic</b> <b>nozzle</b> used to pump solutions collected from shrimp with ovaries filled with vitellogenic oocytes. It was subsequently hypothesized that methyl farnesoate, a hormone associated with ovarian maturation in crustaceans, might be {{a key component of}} sex pheromones used by L. wurdemanni. However, a series of methyl farnesoate concentrations did not elicit responses, indicating this species does not use this hormone alone when determining reproductive condition. Reproductive behaviour in L. wurdemanni was observed to differ both before and after copulation, as well as with increasing population density. Intermoult individuals were more likely to approach, follow and remain in the vicinity of a near-moult shrimp before mating could occur, and under high density conditions. The near-moult shrimp approached conspecifics only under low density conditions, and performed rapid escape behaviours only after copulation had occurred. The unusual occurrence of epibiota upon L. wurdemanni was described, and the location, size and age of barnacles quantified. The effect of salinity upon grooming activities was tested. Results indicated that carapace grooming was depressed at low salinities, and could account for the considerable epibiota found in this region...|$|E
50|$|A {{spray tower}} (or spray column or spray chamber) is gas-liquid {{contactor}} used to achieve mass and heat transfer between a continuous gas phase (that can contain dispersed solid particles) and a dispersed liquid phase. It {{consists of an}} empty cylindrical vessel made of steel or <b>plastic,</b> and <b>nozzles</b> that spray liquid into the vessel. The inlet gas stream usually enters {{at the bottom of}} the tower and moves upward, while the liquid is sprayed downward from one or more levels. This flow of inlet gas and liquid in opposite directions is called countercurrent flow.|$|R
40|$|Laser {{consolidation}} process produces net-shape functional metallic parts layer by layer {{directly from}} a CAD model by using a laser beam to melt the substrate along with the injected powder. This process provides the capability to produce functional complex components with unique design. In this paper, laser consolidation of 420 stainless steel (S. S.) and H- 13 tool steel was investigated to build nozzles with embedded cooling channels for plastic injection molding. The microstructures of laser consolidated H 13 and 420 S. S. were examined using optical microscope and SEM. Mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the laser consolidated materials were evaluated. Detailed investigation was conducted to use laser consolidation process to build the <b>plastic</b> injection <b>nozzles</b> with embedded muliple spiral cooling channels, which are very difficult or even impossible to make using conventional manufacturing methods.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerned}} the wear of farm sprayer nozzles in practical operation and {{was conducted in}} order to answer following questions. * when do the nozzles become worn out? * which type of nozzle wears out the fastest? * do certain herbicides cause more wear than others? The Swedish Farmers Selling & Purchasing Association had requested its local branches to collect nozzles from farmers who had kept records of how they had been used. These records gave information {{on the type of}} herbicide, the number of seasons used and the spray rate. Altogether 42 sets of nozzles were used in the survey. Of these, 9 were made of brass (fan nozzles) and 33 of <b>plastic</b> (5 cone <b>nozzles,</b> 28 fan nozzles). The experimental equipment consisted of a patternator. The test was divided into two parts, the first dealing with determinations of the flow and the second dealing with the spraying uniformity. In the present study the total flow per nozzle was chosen as a measure of the nozzles range of use. As the original flows of the nozzles are not known, it is impossible to calculate the relative change in flow. This survey demonstrates that the change in flow is negligible within the sector in which the nozzles have been used. Neither do coefficients of variation for the flow change with the total flow. The coefficient of variation for the distribution increases with the total flow in the <b>nozzle.</b> A <b>plastic</b> fan <b>nozzle</b> is, on average, worn out after approximately 4000 l. In order to obtain a corresponding value for brass we have made an extrapolation (but its justification is doubtful). According to the extrapolation, the brass nozzles would wear out after approximately 14000 l (3. 5 times more than plastic). The material was divided with regard to herbicides used into one group consisting of herbicides which form true solutions when mixed with water and another consisting of slurry herbicides and micro-suspensions. It is clear that the latter group is the most aggressive...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the design, fabrication {{and control of}} a piezoelectric-type droplet generator which is applicable for on-line dispensing. The piezoelectric-actuated dispensing system consists of a linear piezoelectric motor (LPM) actuated table, a <b>plastic</b> syringe, a <b>nozzle,</b> a linear encoder and a PC-based control unit. Adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) control is applied to overcome nonlinear hysteresis inherited in the LPM. The adaptive learning rates are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem so that convergence of the tracking error can be assured. Unlike open-loop dispensing system, the system proposed can potentially generate droplets with high accuracy. Experimental verifications including regulating and tracking control are performed firstly to assure {{the reliability of the}} proposed control schemes. Real dispensing is then conducted to validate the feasibility of the piezoelectric-actuated drop-on-demand droplet generator. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme works well in developing the piezoelectric-actuated drop-on-demand dispensing system...|$|R

Our technique automatically generates scaffoldings made of horizontal bridges supported by vertical pillars, shown in purple. The print {{is shown in the}} middle and on the right after clean up. Bridges are strong and stable, increasing the print reliability while having a low material usage. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is the process of 3 D printing ob-jects from melted plastic filament.

40|$|A {{study was}} done to {{characterize}} the cleanliness level achievable when using a rudimentary cleaning process, and results were compared to JPR 5322. 1 G Level 300 A. While it is not ideal to clean in a shop environment, some situations (e. g., field combat operations) require oxygen system hardware to be maintained and cleaned to prevent a fire hazard, even though it cannot {{be sent back to}} a precision cleaning facility. This study measured the effectiveness of basic shop cleaning. Initially, three items representing parts of an oxygen system were contaminated: a metal plate, valve body, and metal oxygen bottle. The contaminants chosen were those most likely to be introduced to the system during normal use: oil, lubricant, metal shavings/powder, sand, fingerprints, tape, lip balm, and hand lotion. The cleaning process used hot water, soap, various brushes, gaseous nitrogen, water <b>nozzle,</b> <b>plastic</b> trays, scouring pads, and a controlled shop environment. Test subjects were classified into three groups: technical professionals having an appreciation for oxygen hazards; professional precision cleaners; and a group with no previous professional knowledge of oxygen or precision cleaning. Three test subjects were in each group, and each was provided with standard cleaning equipment, a cleaning procedure, and one of each of the three test items to clean. The results indicated that the achievable cleanliness level was independent of the technical knowledge or proficiency of the personnel cleaning the items. Results also showed that achieving a Level 300 particle count was more difficult than achieving a Level A nonvolatile residue amount...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is {{the process}} of 3 D {{printing}} objects from melted plastic filament. The hot <b>plastic</b> exits a <b>nozzle</b> and fuses with the part just below, adding a layer of material to the object being formed. However, filament can only be deposited on top of an existing surface. Therefore, overhangs require a disposable support structure to be printed, temporarily supporting the threads of plastic that would otherwise hang in empty space. Existing techniques for support generation fall into two categories: The first allow for very reliable prints by enclosing the bottom of the object in a dense structure, at the expense of increased material usage and build times. The second generate thin hierarchical structures connecting to the surface in a sparse number of points. This uses less material, at the expense of reliability: the part might become unstable, the structure itself may become difficult to print, the bottom surface quality degrades. The user therefore has to correct the structure and its parameters for each new object. We propose to exploit the ability of FFF printers to print bridges across gaps. Since bridges are always supported by pillars at their extremities, they are both stronger and more stable than hierarchical tree structures. Our technique first selects the points to support based on overhang and part stability during the entire print process. It then optimizes for a printable scaffolding composed of bridges and vertical pillars, supporting all points. The result is an automated support generation technique using little material while ensuring fine surface quality and stability during the printing process...|$|R
