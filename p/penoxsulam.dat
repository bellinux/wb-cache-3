50|$|Chemical {{herbicides}} {{that have}} been used with the best success on S. minima include the ingredients fluridone, imazamox, and <b>penoxsulam.</b> Some of these herbicides kill S. minima more successfully when a surfactant is added to make the chemicals stick {{to the surface of the}} leaves. Though herbicides are effective in controlling S. minima, they can have adverse effects. Herbicides can kill or cause harm to native organisms that are not the intended target. Also, if a large area of S. minima is sprayed with an herbicide all at once, the dead plant matter will sink into the water and decompose, which can deplete oxygen in the water and result in fish kills. Smaller sections can be sprayed at a time to combat this side effect.|$|E
40|$|Alligatorweed is a {{perennial}} plant which reproduces vegetatively and has spread from waterways into canals and ultimately into rice fields of Louisiana and Texas. <b>Penoxsulam</b> {{is a new}} acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting broad-spectrum herbicide that was registered for rice in 2005. Previous research on alligatorweed control has focused mainly in aquatic areas and in the rice producing regions of Louisiana with little success. Research is limited using <b>penoxsulam</b> for alligatorweed control in rice production and results vary between year and location. Variability {{could be due to}} growth habit and resource allocation of this perennial species. Therefore, field and laboratory experiments were conducted from 2004 to 2007 to: 1) evaluate the effects of select rice herbicides on alligatorweed control, 2) determine the absorption and translocation efficiency and the effect of propanil on <b>penoxsulam</b> in alligatorweed 3) access the environmental effects of temperature on <b>penoxsulam</b> efficacy and determine application timing to avoid antagonism with propanil and, 4) evaluate the effects of flood timing and rice cultivars on rice root stunting and plant foliar injury from <b>penoxsulam</b> applications. Alligatorweed control was obtained from <b>penoxsulam</b> or bispyribac-sodium applied alone; however, mixtures with propanil were antagonistic. Day temperatures at 21 C increased efficacy of <b>penoxsulam</b> compared to 27 and 30 C day temperatures. Delaying propanil applications 3 days following <b>penoxsulam</b> applications were required at 21 and 27 C and 10 days at 30 C in order to avoid antagonism. Alligatorweed absorbed up to 33 % of <b>penoxsulam</b> when applied alone, but most was retained in treated leaves (29 %). Propanil reduced <b>penoxsulam</b> absorption into alligatorweed with only 22 % of total <b>penoxsulam</b> recovered being absorbed by alligatorweed. More than 50 % remained on the leaf surface of the treated leaf. Previous research has indicated root stunting of rice plants from ALS inhibiting herbicides. When various rice varieties were permanently flooded one week after herbicide application of <b>penoxsulam,</b> root stunting was greater compared to delaying flood establishment 7 or 14 days after treatment.

A good agreement between laboratory and field experiments was observed with a faster dissipation of <b>penoxsulam</b> and tricyclazole under field conditions. Profoxydim was the least persistent chemical (DT 50 soil < 1 d; DT 50 water 0. 5 - 1. 2 d), followed by <b>penoxsulam</b> which persisted for longer particularly in the water compartment (DT 50 water = 3. 8 - 5. 9 d).

The experimental design was the one of randomized blocks in factorial scheme, composed by the herbicide treatments <b>penoxsulam</b> (36 g ha - 1); bispyribac-sodium (50 g ha - 1); pyrazosulfuron-ethyl (20 g ha - 1) and weeded control. Herbicides were applied at three times: 15, 30 and 45 days after emergence (DAE) with four replications in two upland rice cultivars: BRS Pepita and BRS Monarca. At 7, 14 and 28 days after application (DAA) the following assessments were performed: phytotoxicity to the crop, plant height, dry weight, number of panicles m - 2, grains per panicle - 1 and productivity. The highest levels of phytotoxicity were observed in plants treated with bispyribac-sodium applied at 15 and 30 DAE. The rice plants were able to recover as for height influenced by herbicides from 14 DAA. The dry weight of plants was not affected by herbicide application. Since they have not reduced the grain productivity, the herbicides tested, when applied at 30 DAE, have showed their potential to be used only in BRS Monarca cultivar. </p...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{chemicals}} are, in most cases, caused by internal concentrations within organisms which rely on uptake and elimination kinetics. These processes might be key components {{for assessing the}} effects of time-variable exposure {{of chemicals}} which regularly occur in aquatic systems. However, the knowledge of toxicokinetic patterns caused by time-variable exposure is limited, and gaining such information is complex. In this work, a previously developed mechanistic growth model of Myriophyllum spicatum is coupled with a newly developed toxicokinetic part, providing a model that is able to predict uptake and elimination of chemicals, as well as distribution processes between plant compartments (leaves, stems, roots) of M. spicatum. It is shown, that toxicokinetic patterns, at least {{for most of the}} investigated chemicals, can be calculated in agreement with experimental observations, by only calibrating two chemical- specific parameters, the cuticular permeability and a plant/water partition coefficient. Through the model-based determination of the cuticular permeabilities of Isoproturon, Iofensulfuron, Fluridone, Imazamox and <b>Penoxsulam,</b> their toxicokinetic pattern can be described with the model approach. For the use of the model for predicting toxicokinetics of other chemicals, where experimental data is not available, equations are presented that are based on the log (Poct/wat) of a chemical and estimate parameters that are necessary to run the model. In general, a method is presented to analyze time-variable exposure of chemicals more in detail without conducting time and labour intensive experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) to imidazolinone herbicides is a worldwide problem in paddy fields. A rapid diagnosis {{is required for}} the selection of adequate prevention and control practices. The objectives of this study were to develop expedite bioassays to identify the resistance to imidazolinone herbicides in barnyardgrass and to evaluate the efficacy of alternative herbicides for the post-emergence control of resistant biotypes. Three experiments were conducted to develop methods for diagnosis of resistance to imazethapyr and imazapyr + imazapic in barnyardgrass at the seed, seedling and tiller stages, and to carry out a pot experiment to determine the efficacy of six herbicides applied at post-emergence in 13 biotypes of barnyardgrass resistant to imidazolinones. The seed soaking bioassay was not able to differentiate the resistant and susceptible biotypes. The {{resistance of}} barnyardgrass to imidazolinones was effectively discriminated in the seedlings and tiller bioassays seven days after incubation at the concentrations of 0. 001 and 0. 0001 mM, respectively, for both imazethapyr and imazapyr + imazapic. The biotypes identified as resistant to imidazolinones showed different patterns of susceptibility to <b>penoxsulam,</b> bispyribac-sodium and pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, and were all controlled with profoxydim and cyhalofop-butyl. The seedling and tiller bioassays are effective in the diagnosis of barnyardgrass resistance to imidazolinone herbicides, providing an on-season opportunity to identify the need to use alternative herbicides to be applied at post-emergence for the control of the resistant biotypes...|$|E

The highest degree of nutsedge control with a single application of sulfosulfuron was 91 to 96 % control at 28 days after treatment. In general, ALS herbicides applied as a single application or multiple applications provided one month of effective control following a first application. After one month, the degree of control declined unless repeated applications at monthly intervals or as needed were applied for extended control. <b>Penoxsulam</b> at 0. 12 lb a. i. /A in one test gave only 70 % control.

40|$|Aerobic rice {{systems can}} {{substitute}} the conventional rice cultivation {{system in the}} wake of water shortage and energy crises. The major constraint in the success of aerobic rice is high weed infestation. Hence, we have discussed the weed flora, yield losses, herbicide-resistant weeds, need for integrated weed management, and approaches to manage weeds in aerobic rice systems. A review of several studies indicated that 90 weed species were competing with rice under aerobic systems, causing 23 - 100 % reductions in grain yield. Weed control in aerobic rice gets difficult due to shifts in weed flora and herbicide resistance development in weeds. A wide increase in grain yield (15 - 307 %) by implementing different weed control practices elaborates the scope of weed management in aerobic rice. Practices, such as soil solarization, sowing of competitive crop cultivars, stale seedbed preparation, mulch application, correct fertilization, and intercropping, were found to have particular significance for managing weeds in aerobic rice systems. Moreover, hand weeding and mechanical control were more effective when combined with other weed control methods. Herbicides, such as pendimethalin, 2, 4 -D, <b>penoxsulam,</b> ethoxysulfuron, bispyribac-sodium, triclopyr, imazosulfuron, bensulfuron, pretilachlor, and metsulfuron, were found most effective in aerobic rice systems. Keeping in view the severity of weed infestation in these systems and the evolution of herbicide resistance, reliance on a single control method is out of question. Hence, the approach of integrated weed management is the most appropriate for proper weed management and the subsequent success of rice cultivation using aerobic systems...|$|E
40|$|Pesticides {{are widely}} used in rice cultivation, often {{resulting}} in detection of their residues in rice grains. So far, no analytical method has been available for the simultaneous determination of most rice pesticides in rice grains. This paper reports the development and validation of such a method for the determination of eight rice pesticides (<b>penoxsulam</b> tricyclazole, propanil, azoxystrobin, molinate, profoxydim, cyhalofop-butyl, deltamethrin) and 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, the main metabolite of propanil. Pesticide extraction and clean-up was performed by an optimized matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) protocol on neutral alumina (5 g) using acetonitrile as the elution solvent. Samples were analyzed in a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) system. Pesticide separation was achieved with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water in a linear elution gradient from 30 : 70 % (v/v) to 100 : 0 % (v/v) in 14 min at a flow rate of 0. 8 mL min(- 1). Method validation was performed by means of linearity, intra-day accuracy, inter-day precision and sensitivity. Linear regression coefficients (R (2)) were always above 0. 9948. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) varied from 0. 002 to 0. 200 mg kg(- 1) and 0. 006 to 0. 600 mg kg(- 1), respectively. Recoveries were investigated at three fortification levels and {{were found to be}} acceptable (74 - 127 %) with relative standard deviations (RSD) below 12 %.

Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the response of rice plants to flooding events that would result in plant submersion and it is interaction with herbicide applications. To achieve the objectives two studies were conducted in Southern Brazil (Pelotas, RS). Experiment 1 was conducted with ten rice cultivars and six submersion periods (one, five, seven, 15 e 20 days of plant submersion plus a check treatment. In the check treatment plants were keep under a flooding regime (water layer of 10 cm).). Experiment 2 was conducted with two cultivars, two water regimes (flooded and submerged) and six herbicides (clomazone, bispyribac sodium, <b>penoxsulam,</b> imazethapyr + imazapic, imazapyr + imazapic and an untreated check). Shoot dry matter, chlorophyll levels, total carotenoids, total phenolic content, levels of hydrogen peroxide and activity of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were assessed in plant samples. The results observed in the first experiment showed that cultivars Puitá INTA CL, IRGA 417 and IRGA 422 CL were the most tolerant to submergence. The most susceptible cultivars were IRGA 424, BRS Querência, EPAGRI 108 and BRS Taim. In general, the cultivar Puitá INTA CL has lower oxidative damage than BRS Querência when submerged. In order to cope with excessive free radicals, BRS Querência demonstrated higher activity of SOD, APX and CAT enzymes compared to cultivar Puitá INTA CL. Imidazolinone formulated mixtures of herbicides imazethapyr + imazapic and imazapyr + imazapic caused greater reduction in total chlorophyll content and carotenoids...|$|E

Hybrid rice {{has the potential to}} grow in dry-seeded conditions and can perform well even if seeds can be planted at low seedling rates. A field study was conducted in the wet season of 2011 and dry season of 2012 to evaluate the effect of plant-to-plant spacing (10 or 20. cm), the number of rice seeds planted per spacing (2 or 3), and weed control methods (42 days weedy, weed-free, and oxadiazon followed by <b>penoxsulam.</b> +. cyhalofop) on the growth and yield of rice under a dry-seeded rice system. The crop was planted at 20 -cm row spacing. Herbicide-treated plots had fewer rice plants than the 42 days weedy and weed-free plots when rain occurred before crop emergence. However, the herbicide treatment provided 81 - 93 % better weed control than the 42 days weedy treatment, which resulted in 54 - 125 % yield advantages over no weeding for 42 days. Grain yield in the herbicide-treated plots was only 75 - 88 % of the grain yield in the weed-free plots, suggesting further scope to improve rice yield in dry-seeded systems. Grain yield was similar across plant-to-plant spacing and the number of seeds planted per spacing. Our study suggests that hybrids can be grown at low seeding rates or at 20 -cm plant-to-plant spacing, provided that there is no herbicide phytotoxicity on crop emergence and rice plant density is uniform. These results may help manufacturers in designing sowing drills with precise seed-metering systems for dry-seeded rice systems in Asia...|$|E
40|$|A new {{herbicide}} site {{of action}} (SOA) is needed by rice (Oryza sativa L.) producers in the Midsouth for the control of problematic and herbicide-resistant weeds. Currently, six problematic weeds are relevant to Midsouthern rice producers because of resistance {{to at least one}} SOA, if not more. Gowan Company {{is in the process of}} commercializing benzobicyclon for use in Midsouthern rice systems. Benzobicyclon, a Group 27 post-flood herbicide, controls a broad spectrum of aquatics, broadleaves, grasses, and sedges, including those currently resistant to Group 2 herbicides. This will be the first 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) -inhibiting herbicide commercially available in US rice production. Since, benzobicyclon is still under development, it is important to evaluate this herbicide in a drill-seeded rice production system. Therefore, experiments were conducted across Arkansas to determine rice cultivar tolerance, weed spectrum controlled, rate optimization, compatible tank-mix partners, and rotational crop safety. It is recommended to apply benzobicyclon into a continuous flood system. Japonica cultivars exhibited excellent crop safety to benzobicyclon, while indica cultivars showed high levels of sensitivity to the herbicide. Benzobicyclon effectively controlled Amazon sprangletop (Leptochloa panicoides J. Presl), ducksalad (Heteranthera limosa Sw.), California arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia Willd.), indica rice, hemp sesbania (Sesbania herbacea Mill.), northern jointvetch (Aeschynomene virginica L.), red sprangletop (Leptochloa chinensis L.), rice flatsedge (Cyperus iria L.), and smallflower umbrella sedge (Cyperus difformis L.). The efficacy and spectrum of control of benzobicyclon is increased when applied with tank-mix partners such as bispyribac, cyhalofop, halosulfuron, imazamox, <b>penoxsulam,</b> and propanil. Cotton, grain sorghum, soybean, and sunflower can safely be planted in rotation with a drill-seeded rice crop that has been treated with benzobicyclon post-flood without concerns of crop yield loss.

A solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detection (DAD) was used. A C- 18 RP column operated at 30 degrees C was utilised and the analytes were separated with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water mixture in a linear gradient. Clean-up of water samples and isolation of pesticides was performed on SPE Bakerbond octadecyl cartridges and an ethyl acetate-dichlomethane mixture (9 : 1 v/v, 2 mL) was used for elution. Method validation was performed by means of intra-day (n = 5) and inter-day accuracy and precision (n 8), sensitivity and linearity. The relative recoveries of the pesticides in paddy water samples were acceptable (80. 6 - 110. 2 %) and the relative standard deviation (RSD%) ranged from 1. 9 to 7. 6 %.
