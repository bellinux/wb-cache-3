5|$|A {{total of}} 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1918, with the excess over the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1919 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. There was no official packaging; a few were used in badges for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not publicized much outside Illinois. The centennial commission distributed them, at face value, to its county affiliates in proportion to their share of Illinois' population, on condition they be sold at a <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> help pay for local celebrations, and if one had already been held, for war relief.|$|E
5|$|Sparked by low-mintage {{issues which}} {{appreciated}} in value, {{the market for}} United States commemorative coins spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> their issue prices. The apparent easy profits {{to be made by}} purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 Old Spanish Trail half dollar. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and coin dealer, who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had {{served as president of the}} American Numismatic Association (ANA). Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926.|$|E

25|$|The seller may grant {{an option}} to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue {{or as part of}} an {{employee}} incentive scheme, otherwise a buyer would pay a <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> the seller for the option. A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E
25|$|Sovereigns {{usually have}} a higher <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> {{the price of gold}} than some other bullion coins, such as the Krugerrand. This is due to a number of factors: the higher unit cost of the Sovereign (at under one-quarter of an ounce); the higher demand for the Sovereign from numismatists (compared to the Krugerrand which is not sought-after numismatically); and the higher costs of {{identifying}} and stocking a numismatic coin.|$|E

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this study}} is to investigate the opinions of Cypriot insured drivers regarding the fairness of particular risk classification variables. Classification variables include, amongst others, age, gender, years of driving experience and driver record. The aim of this research paper is also to establish whether significant associations exist between the opinions of Cypriot insured drivers and a number of demographic and other policyholder characteristics which are used <b>to</b> set <b>premiums</b> in automobile insurance. A hundred and sixteen usable questionnaires were collected from respondents of different ages across the country of Cyprus. The research revealed that the majority of the respondents considered as fair the practice of charging higher <b>premiums</b> <b>to</b> very young drivers, whilst 80. 2 % and 88. 8 % of the respondents considered to some degree unfair charging higher <b>premiums</b> <b>to</b> male drivers and charging higher <b>premiums</b> <b>to</b> unmarried drivers respectively. Almost half of the respondents chose age as the classification variable they considered that should be of highest importance and 31. 9 % of the respondents chose marital status as the one that they believed should be of least importance in setting automobile insurance premiums. Moreover, even if respondents supported the elimination of specific rating factors, the majority opposed the elimination of all rating factors. Significant associations were found to exist between charging higher <b>premiums</b> <b>to</b> young drivers and the age of the respondent, and the above practice and the years of driving experience of the respondent. Significant associations were also found to exist between charging higher <b>premiums</b> <b>to</b> male drivers and the gender of the respondent since more male drivers were more likely to oppose the above practice than female drivers. Contrary to the above, no association was found to exist between opinions regarding the elimination of age as a rating factor and the years of driving experience of the respondent...|$|R
25|$|Insurance is a {{financial}} instrument, which allows exposed individuals to pool resources to spread their risk. They {{do so by}} contributing <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> an insurance fund, which will indemnify those who suffer insured loss. This procedure reduces the risk for an individual by spreading his/her risk among the multiple fund contributors. Insurance can be designed to protect many types of individuals and assets against single or multiple perils and buffer insured parties against sudden and dramatic income or asset loss.|$|E

25|$|Producers and producer-groups {{spend this}} social <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> support {{socioeconomic}} {{development in a}} variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.|$|E
25|$|Public Part C Medicare Advantage {{health plan}} members {{typically}} usually also pay a monthly premium {{in addition to}} the Medicare Part B <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> cover items not covered by traditional Medicare (Parts A & B), such as the OOP limit, prescription drugs, dental care, vision care, annual physicals, coverage outside the United States, and even gym or health club memberships as well as—and probably most importantly—reduce the 20% co-pays and high deductibles associated with Original Medicare. But in some situations the benefits are more limited (but they can never be more limited than Original Medicare and must always include an OOP limit) and there is no premium. In some cases, the insurer even rebates part or all of the Part B premium, though these types of Part C plans are becoming rare.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, it was {{announced}} that Jim Beam would be purchased by Suntory Holdings Ltd., a Japanese group of brewers & distillers known for producing Japan's first whiskey. Suntory agreed to acquire Jim Beam, Maker's Mark, Teacher's Highland Cream and Laphroaig distillery Scotch whiskies for approximately $13.62 billion and also take on Beam's debt. This deal is the biggest Suntory has ever agreed to and will elevate them to the third largest maker of distilled drinks in the world. The combined company is expected to have annual sales of spirits products of more than $4.3 billion. Suntory will pay $83.50 per share, a 25 percent <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> Beam's Friday closing price of $66.97. The companies put the deal's value at about $16 billion, including debt. According to press releases regarding the deal, the Illinois-based Jim Beam will continue to be managed by its current leadership. Beam and Suntory unanimously approved the transaction; however, the deal needs to be approved by Beam Inc. stockholders. Pending approval by its shareholders, the deal was expected to close by June 30, 2014. Jim Beam and Suntory have a previous partnership where they would freely distribute each other's brands in different markets.|$|E
