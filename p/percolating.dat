5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water <b>percolating</b> through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{water balance}} and <b>percolate</b> production for a landfill in operation <b>Percolate</b> production and precipitation data for a full-scale landfill in operation measured over a 13 -year period {{were used to}} evaluate the impact and importance of the hydrolog-ical conditions of landfill sections on the <b>percolate</b> produc-tion rates. Both active (open) and closed landfill sections were included in the evaluation. A simple top cover model requiring a minimum of input data was used to simulate the <b>percolate</b> production as a function of precipitation and land-fill section hydrology. The results showed that changes over time in the hydrology of individual landfill sections (such as section closure or plantation of trees on top of closed sec-tions) can change total landfill <b>percolate</b> production by more than 100 %; thus, <b>percolate</b> production at an active landfill can be very different from <b>percolate</b> production at the same landfill after closure. Furthermore, plantation of willow on top of closed sections can increase the evapotranspiration rate thereby reducing <b>percolate</b> production rates by up to 47 % compared to a grass cover. This process, however, depends upon the availability of water in the top layer, and so the evaporation rate will be less than optimal during the summer where soil-water contents in the top cover are low...|$|R

5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by <b>percolating</b> natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E

For this purpose, the antinociceptive effects of <b>percolated</b> and soxhlet extracts were evaluated in mice subjected to acute thermal (hot-plate) and persistent chemical (formalin) pain stimuli. Intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of the <b>percolated</b> extract evoked significant antinociceptive effects at a dose of 100 mg/kg {{in the second phase}} of formalin test. The maximum antinociceptive effect was induced by the dose of 300 mg/kg that was significant in both phases of formalin test. Dose of 400 mg/kg of the <b>percolated</b> extract induced acute adverse effects such as diarrhea, polyurea, malasia and hyperventilation in mice. Soxhlet extract of F. parviflora (300 mg/kg, i. p.) also showed significant effects in the both phases of formalin test. The most effective dose of the <b>percolated</b> extract as well as the soxhlet extracts (300 mg/kg, i. p.) were evaluated in hot plate test. The results showed that only <b>percolated</b> extract had significant antinociceptive effect in hot-plate. Pretreatment of mice with naloxane, an opioid antagonist, did not change antinociceptive effect of <b>percolated</b> extract in formalin test, but in hot-plate it increased extract’s effect after the first 15 minutes. In histopathological evaluation of liver, toxic dose of <b>percolated</b> extract (400 mg/kg) caused degeneration, necrosis and regeneration of hepatic cells. The study of ulcerogenic effects of oral <b>percolated</b> extract on stomach in rats showed that this adverse effect was significantly lower in comparison with the same dose of indomethacin.

40|$|The {{forest floor}} {{represents}} an important compartment for {{the accumulation of}} heavy metals in forest soils. To study the mobility of Pb species and their linkage to C cycling in the forest floor, we investigated concentrations of trimethyllead (C 3 H 9 Pb+) and total Pb (Pbtotal) in throughfall and forest floor <b>percolates</b> during 14 snow-free wk. For our study, we used a long-term field experiment with increased input of throughfall and litterfall at a Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. ] site. The concentrations of trimethyllead were highest in throughfall (106 pg Pb L− 1) and decreased with depth of the forest floor. Strong correlations between trimethyllead concentrations in throughfall and forest floor <b>percolates</b> suggested that trimethyllead in forest floor <b>percolates</b> originates largely from throughfall. The partition coefficients of trimethyllead and Pbtotal, estimated as ratios of concentrations in <b>percolates</b> to those in forest floors, ranged from 54 to 560 and 870 to 26, 400 L kg− 1, respectively, indicating that the mobility of trimethyllead was greater than Pbtotal The Pbtotal concentrations were low in throughfall and often the highest in Oa horizon <b>percolates</b> (15. 2 − 57. 5 μg L− 1). They decreased in Oi horizon <b>percolates</b> after increased throughfall addition. Increased litterfall resulted in increased concentrations of Pbtotal in forest floor <b>percolates.</b> Concurrently, dissolved organic C increased. The tight coupling of Pbtotal to dissolved organic C was also indicated by correlations (r ≥ 0. 48) that were stronger than those between Pbtotal and pH (r ≤ − 0. 22). We concluded that the mobilization of Pbtotal from the large pool in forest floor horizons is strongly linked {{to the release of}} dissolved organic matter.

25|$|A {{solution}} lake is a lake {{occupying a}} basin formed by surface dissolution of bedrock. In areas underlain by soluble bedrock, its solution by precipitation and <b>percolating</b> water commonly produce cavities. These cavities frequently collapse to form sinkholes that {{form part of}} the local karst topography. Where groundwater lies near the grounds surface, a sinkhole will be filled water as a solution lake. If such a lake consists of a large area of standing water that occupies an extensive closed depression in limestone, it is also called a karst lake. Smaller solution lakes that consist of a body of standing water in a closed depression within a karst region are known as karst ponds. Limestone caves often contain pools of standing water, which are known as underground lakes. Classic examples of solution lakes are abundant in the karst regions at the Dalmatian coast of Croatia and within large parts of Florida.|$|E

Medical studies among the Tharu and non-Tharu population of the Terai yielded the evidence that the prevalence of cases of residual malaria is nearly seven times lower among Tharus. The basis for resistance has been established to be homozygosity of α-Thalassemia gene within the local population. Endogamy along caste and ethnic lines appear to have prevented these genes from being more widespread in neighboring populations.|$|E

Locally available laterite—a low-grade bauxite rich in iron and aluminium—is used in acid solution, followed by precipitation to remove phosphorus and heavy metals at several sewage treatment facilities. Calcium-, iron- and aluminium-rich solid media are recommended for phosphorus removal. A study, using both laboratory tests and pilot-scale constructed wetlands, reports the effectiveness of granular laterite in removing phosphorus and heavy metals from landfill leachate. Initial laboratory studies show that laterite is capable of 99% removal of phosphorus from solution. A pilot-scale experimental facility containing laterite achieved 96% removal of phosphorus. This removal is greater than reported in other systems. Initial removals of aluminium and iron by pilot-scale facilities have been up to 85% and 98% respectively. <b>Percolating</b> columns of laterite removed enough cadmium, chromium and lead to undetectable concentrations.

25|$|As a {{secondary}} mineral, turquoise forms by {{the action of}} <b>percolating</b> acidic aqueous solutions during the weathering and oxidation of preexisting minerals. For example, the copper may come from primary copper sulfides such as chalcopyrite or from the secondary carbonates malachite or azurite; the aluminium may derive from feldspar; and the phosphorus from apatite. Climate factors appear {{to play an important role}} as turquoise is typically found in arid regions, filling or encrusting cavities and fractures in typically highly altered volcanic rocks, often with associated limonite and other iron oxides. In the Southwestern United States turquoise is almost invariably associated with the weathering products of copper sulfide deposits in or around potassium-feldspar-bearing porphyritic intrusives. In some occurrences alunite, potassium aluminium sulfate, is a prominent secondary mineral. Typically turquoise mineralization is restricted to a relatively shallow depth of less than , although it does occur along deeper fracture zones where secondary solutions have greater penetration or the depth to the water table is greater.|$|E
25|$|Once the acidic {{groundwater}} {{drained from}} the caverns, speleothems {{began to be}} deposited within the cavern. Erosion above ground created the natural entrance to the Carlsbad Caverns within the last million years. Exposure to the surface has allowed for the influx of air into the cavern. Rainwater and snowmelt <b>percolating</b> downward into the ground pick up carbon dioxide; once this water reaches a cavern ceiling, it precipitates and evaporates, leaving behind a small calcium carbonate deposit. Growths from the roof downward formed through this process are known as stalactites. Additionally, water {{on the floor of}} the caverns can contain carbonic acid and generate mineral deposits by evaporation. Growths from the floor upward through this process are known as stalagmites. Different formations of speleothems include columns, soda straws, draperies, helictites, and popcorn. Changes in the ambient air temperature and rainfall affect the rate of growth of speleothems, as higher temperatures increase carbon dioxide production rates within the overlying soil. The color of the speleothems is determined by the trace constituents in the minerals of the formation.|$|E

In the present study, organic C, N, S and P were analysed in rainfall, throughfall, litter <b>percolate</b> and soil solution of a montane rainforest at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. The aim was to determine the amounts of organic nutrients in different water pathways and to assess the influence of forest disturbance on organic nutrients by comparing mature forests, secondary forests and shrub vegetation in clearings. Concentrations of all studied elements increased from rainfall to throughfall and litter <b>percolate</b> and then exhibited a rapid decrease in the mineral soil. Concentrations of organic P were above the detection limit only in the litter <b>percolate.</b> Organic N (ON) as a fraction of total N increased from 50 % in rainfall (0. 19 mg l⁻¹) to 66 % (0. 45 mg l⁻¹) in throughfall followed by a decline to 39 % in the litter <b>percolate</b> (0. 77 mg l⁻¹) of the mature forest. Similarly, proportions of organic S and P amounted to 43 and 34 %, respectively, in the litter <b>percolate</b> in mature forest.
