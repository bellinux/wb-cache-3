40|$|Caching {{is applied}} to provide <b>requested</b> <b>documents</b> or Web {{contents}} quickly from a short memory. We consider the Cluster Caching Rule policy proposed recently by Markovich [12]. The idea of the rule is to keep only highly popular contents in the cache. Due to dependency in the inter-request process and heavy-tail distributed inter-request times, such frequently <b>requested</b> <b>documents</b> arise in clusters of popularity. The corresponding clusters of documents are loaded in the cache. If the <b>requested</b> <b>document</b> {{is present in the}} previous cluster, then it stays further in the cache. Otherwise, it is evicted from the cache. A mixture of m-dependent Markov and Poisson renewal processes is proposed as example of an inter-request time model.
