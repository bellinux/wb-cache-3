25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} using occupations {{as a method}} of therapy can be found in ancient times. In c. 100 BCE, Greek physician Asclepiades treated patients with a mental illness humanely using therapeutic baths, massage, exercise, and music. Later, the Roman Celsus prescribed music, travel, conversation and exercise to his patients. However, by medieval times the use of these interventions with <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> was rare, if not nonexistent.|$|E

There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.|$|E
