30|$|The {{pavement}} {{resistance of}} bitumen, {{due to a}} reduced penetration grade, can be increased by using SBS. SBS is a flexible long-chain polymer and its thermoplastic properties cause {{the reduction in the}} penetration grade of bitumen mixed with it. A three-dimensional network of <b>polystyrene</b> <b>blocks</b> and butadiene middle blocks occur in bitumen with thermoplastic properties (<b>polystyrene</b> <b>blocks),</b> which cause increasing viscosity of the bitumen at high temperatures, and as a result, the penetration grade of the bitumen is reduced, proven by tests of softening point. However, due to the presence of these blocks with elastic properties (butadiene middle blocks) at low temperatures, the bitumen also has good elasticity. Then, by increasing the percentage of polymer, reduced resistance and softness can be achieved, i.e., dominance of the polymer network in the bitumen, which gives morphological discontinuity.|$|R

40|$|The {{material}} from which an object is made can determine how heavy it feels (Seashore, 1899). Interestingly, a metal block {{that has been}} adjusted {{to have the same}} size and mass as a <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block</b> will feel lighter than the <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block.</b> We recently showed that participants experiencing this material-weight illusion’ (MWI) do not apply forces that match their perceptual experience of heaviness ‐ just like in the size‐weight illusion (Flanagan 2 ̆ 6 Beltzner, 2000).

MWI persisted throughout – the <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block</b> felt the heaviest and the metal block felt the lightest. We followed this finding up with two experiments: Experiment 1 – different weight, different material: We adjusted the weight of each block slightly in the opposite direction to the illusion, predicting that we would find opposing perceptual and motor responses (e. g., Grandy 2 ̆ 6 Westwood, 2006). Experiment 2 – different weight, same material: We also removed the visual differences between the blocks, keeping the slight difference in weight, predicting that the dissociation between perception and action would disappear...|$|E

At 25 °C, a sample of polystyrene-b-polyisoprene diblock micelles with a <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block</b> of 20. 6 kDa and a polyisoprene block of 6 kDa was observed to form cylindrical micelles in heptane, a selective solvent for polyisoprene. Upon heating to 35 °C, the sample adopted a spherical micelle morphology. When the sample was cooled back to 25 °C, cylindrical micelles were once again observed. In addition, a reversible transition from vesicles to cylindrical micelles, upon heating from 25 to 40 °C, was observed for a second diblock sample with the same <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block</b> (20. 6 kDa) and a shorter polyisoprene block of 4. 3 kDa.

40|$|International audienceIn this contribution, the {{principle}} of spontaneous surface segregation has been applied for the preparation of polypeptide-functionalized polystyrene microspheres. For that purpose, an amphiphilic diblock copolymer {{was introduced in the}} mixture styrene/divinylbenzene and polymerized using AIBN as initiator. During the polymerization, cross-linked particles were obtained in which the diblock copolymer was encapsulated. The amphiphilic diblock copolymers used throughout this study contain a hydrophilic polypeptide segment, either poly(L-lysine) or poly(L-glutamic acid) and a hydrophobic <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block.</b> After 4 h of polymerization, rather monodisperse particles with sizes of ∼ 3 - 4 μm were obtained. Upon annealing in hot water, the hydrophilic polypeptides migrate to the interface, hence, either positively charged or neutral particles were obtained when poly(L-lysine) is revealed at the surface and exposed to acidic or basic pH, respectively. On the opposite, negatively charged particles were achieved in basic pH water by using poly(L-glutamic acid) as additive. The surface chemical composition was modified by changing the environment of the particles. Thus, exposure in toluene provoked a surface rearrangement, and due to its affinity, the <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block</b> reorients toward the interface...|$|E

40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{transformation}} of poly(butadienyl) lithium into a macromolecular atom transfer radical polymerization initiator or reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer agent is the modification of the anionic chain end into a suitable leaving/reinitiating group. We have investigated three different modification reactions to obtain a styrenic end group at the chain end of poly(butadienyl) lithium. In all cases, we have looked at the influence of a Lewis base on the progress of the reaction. The first modification reaction with -methylstyrene leads to partial functionalization and oligomerization. The second reaction with 1, 2 -diphenylethylenes, particularly trans-stilbene, results in monoaddition to the poly(butadienyl) lithium chain ends. Quantitative functionalization is not obtained, possibly because of a hydrogen abstraction reaction, which causes termination. In the third modification reaction, a small <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block</b> is successfully added to the chain ends, as shown by a detailed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the block copolymers.

50|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature (Tg) of the polybutadiene blocks is typically -90 °C and Tg of the <b>polystyrene</b> <b>blocks</b> is +100 °C. So, at any temperature between about -90 °C and +100 °C Kraton SBS will act as a physically crosslinked elastomer. If Kraton polymers are heated substantially above the Tg of the styrene-derived blocks, that is, above about 100 °C, like 170 °C the physical cross-links change from rigid glassy regions to flowable melt regions and the entire material flows and therefore can be cast, molded, or extruded into any desired form. On cooling, this new form resumes its elastomeric character. This is the reason such a material is called a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). The <b>polystyrene</b> <b>blocks</b> form domains of nanometre size in the microstructure, and they stabilise {{the form of the}} moulded material. Depending on the rubber to polystyrene ratio in the material, the polystyrene domains can be spherical or form cylinders or lamellae. The hydrogenated Kraton polymers named Kraton G exhibit improved resistance to temperature (processing at 200 - 230 °C is common), to oxidation and to UV.

The polymers consisted of a <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block,</b> and a second block prepared from a styrenic monomer grafted with fluoroalkyl-tagged poly(ethylene glycol) side chains. Compositional depth profiling of the microphase separated block copolymer films, in the top 1 − 3 nm of the film, was performed to understand the role of block copolymer microstructure and self-assembly on surface composition. Using experimentally determined concentration profiles, the surface concentration of phenyl ring carbon atoms was quantified and {{compared with those of}} homopolymer and random copolymer controls. The carbon atoms from the relatively high surface energy phenyl groups were depleted or excluded from the surface, in favor of the low surface-energy fluoroalkyl groups. While it is expected that block copolymer surfaces will be completely covered by a wetting lamellar layer of the lower surface energy block, a significant amount of the higher surface energy <b>polystyrene</b> <b>block</b> was found to be present in the surface region of the cylinder-forming block copolymer. Evidently, the spontaneous formation of the cylindrical polystyrene microdomains in the near-surface region compensated for the lowering of the free energy that could have been achieved by completely covering the surfaces with a lamellar layer of the lower surface energy fluorinated block. All surfaces underwent molecular reconstruction after immersion in water. The experimental concentration depth profiles indicated an increased surface depletion of phenyl ring carbon atoms in the water-immersed thin films, due to the tendency of hydrophilic PEG side groups to be present at the polymer-water interface. Such a detailed characterization of the outermost layers of the block copolymer surfaces was possible because of the exceptional depth resolution of the NEXAFS depth profiling technique...|$|E
