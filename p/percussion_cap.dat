5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of a hollow metal tube attached to a tripod, with a rudimentary breech at one end. Rounds were fired {{with the use of}} black powder ignited by a standard musket <b>percussion</b> <b>cap,</b> and it had an effective range of between 100 and 150 yards. Although it was cheap and easy to manufacture, it did have several problems; it was difficult to move and the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenades it used as one type of ammunition had a tendency to break inside the breech, damaging the weapon and injuring the crew. Production began in late 1940, and by the beginning of 1943 nearly 19,000 were in service. Like many obsolete Home Guard weapons, it was eventually replaced by other weapons, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|Bond dispatches Sévérine's {{guards and}} sneaks aboard her boat. After he joins {{her in the}} shower, the two have sex. While {{approaching}} Silva's base on Dead Island, Sévérine becomes more afraid and tells Bond {{that it is not}} too late to retreat. However, they are taken prisoner by the guards, handcuffed and escorted through an abandoned city on the island. She explains to Bond that Silva made the natives believe a leak at the local chemical plant required them to evacuate the island. This allowed him to use it as his base of operations. Sévérine is separated from Bond, and is brutally beaten for her betrayal. After Bond is interrogated by Silva, he is taken to a courtyard, where Sévérine is bound to a statue. Silva places a shot glass of whiskey on her head, and challenges Bond to shoot it with an antique <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> pistol. Bond misses the target, and Silva responds by shooting her in the head.|$|E
50|$|As {{ignition}} devices, matchlocks, wheel locks, snaplock, flintlocks and <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> {{were used}} in turn.|$|R

25|$|<b>Percussion</b> <b>caps</b> were yearly {{sent from}} Brum in {{millions}} of grosses, the manufacture of the complete gun cartridge came later.|$|R
25|$|Another {{danger was}} that the {{friction}} igniter was very sensitive, a powerful blow to the grenade with the detonator inserted could set it off. This made the No 6 almost as dangerous as the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> grenades that {{it was designed to}} replace.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until that}} time, revolvers were black-powder {{percussion}} arms. The shooter had to pour powder {{into each of}} the six cylinder mouths, push a bullet over the powder, and load a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> on the rear of the cylinder, making the reloading process cumbersome.|$|E
25|$|Early torpedoes used contact {{exploder}}s. A typical exploder had {{a firing}} pin that stuck {{out from the}} warhead and was restrained by a transverse shear pin. The torpedo would hit the target with enough energy to break the shear pin and allow the firing pin to strike a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> that ultimately detonated the warhead. An arming impeller was an additional safety device: the firing pin could not move until the torpedo had travelled a preset distance.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinders}} of {{the revolving}} cannon were fired using <b>percussion</b> <b>caps.</b> The cap {{was struck by}} a large spring-actuated striker.|$|R

500|$|Colt never {{claimed to}} have invented the revolver; his design was a more {{practical}} adaption of Collier's earlier revolving flintlock incorporating a locking bolt to keep the cylinder {{in line with the}} barrel. The invention of the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> made ignition more reliable, faster, and safer than the older flintlock design. Colt's great contribution was to the use of interchangeable parts. Knowing that some gun parts were made by machine, he envisioned that all the parts on every Colt gun to be interchangeable and made by machine, later to be assembled by hand. His goal was the assembly line. This is shown in an 1836 letter that Colt wrote to his father in which he said, ...|$|E
500|$|Halfway {{through the}} trial, Whiting made {{allegations}} that Adams {{had been murdered}} with a Colt Paterson revolver rather than a hatchet. [...] Whiting came to this conclusion after Doctor Gilman, who examined the body with the coroner, testified about a round hole in Adams skull {{that could not have}} been made by the hatchet and suggested that Colt used a revolver in a premeditated act by which he lured Adams to his death. [...] Although no witnesses had reported the sounds of gunfire, Whiting's argument was that a revolver ball fired under the power of the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> alone could propel the ball with [...] "enough force to kill a man", without making the noise of the exploding black powder in the cylinder. [...] Several witnesses were called in to testify against this idea including an early ballistician named Zabrisky and Samuel Colt himself, who demonstrated to the court, by shooting his revolver in the courtroom and catching the fired balls in his hand, that such a shot could not penetrate to the depth of the wound found on Adams' skull.|$|E
2500|$|Later models {{used the}} <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> action, {{although}} both actions were manufactured and sold for some time. For arms {{of his own}} design, he adopted the newer <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> technology, putting his pistol on the modern cutting edge. [...] He was innovating; the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> was perfected about 1820, and Deringer was marketing them by the 1830s, and possibly the mid-1820s.|$|E
50|$|Caps {{are used}} in cartridges, grenades, rocket-propelled grenades, and rescue flares. <b>Percussion</b> <b>caps</b> are also used in land mine fuzes, boobytrap firing devices and anti-handling devices.|$|R

2500|$|An unusual {{solution}} to the problem of obtaining ammunition for the very old pinfire cartridges is even available. [...] This solution uses specialized cartridges that use a removable pin and anvil which hold a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> of the type use in caplock firearms. [...] To reload a fired case, the pin is removed, allowing the anvil to slide out; a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> is placed in the anvil, it is re-inserted, and the pin serves to lock the anvil in place, as well as to ignite the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Near railway lines, {{on which}} [...] "fog working" [...] was implemented, loud explosions {{similar to the}} report of a shotgun were a common feature. The explosions were made by [...] "detonators" [...] – a form of large <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> placed on the track and {{activated}} by the wheels of trains. These devices were placed by certain signals to provide an audible warning to match the visual indication provided by the signal for the driver.|$|E
50|$|The Starr carbine fired {{paper or}} linen {{cartridges}} that were ignited by conventional <b>percussion</b> <b>caps.</b> The weapon fired reliably {{as long as}} the lengthy flash channel was kept clean.|$|R

50|$|A {{cartridge}} box holding several pre-made paper cartridges {{was often}} worn on a belt. When percussion locks became popular, musketeers also carried another small box on their belt which held the <b>percussion</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After each shot, a user {{was advised}} {{to raise his}} {{revolver}} vertically while cocking back the hammer so as to allow the fragments of the spent <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> to fall out safely. Otherwise, the fragments could fall into the revolver's mechanism and jam it. Caplock revolvers were vulnerable to [...] "chain fires", wherein hot gas from a shot ignited the powder in the other chambers. [...] This could be prevented by sealing the chambers with cotton, wax, or grease.|$|E
2500|$|The {{military}} Sharps rifle was {{a falling}} block rifle used {{during and after}} the American Civil War in multiple variations. Along with being able to use a standard <b>percussion</b> <b>cap,</b> the Sharps had a fairly unusual pellet primer feed. This was a device which held a stack of pelleted primers and flipped one over the nipple each time the trigger was pulled and the hammer fell - making it much easier to fire a Sharps from horseback than a gun employing individually loaded percussion caps.|$|E
2500|$|The PG-70 was {{inserted}} into the muzzle of the launcher and fired using a simple <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> firing a [...] cartridge. Three ring-shaped stabilising fins were mounted on a tube that extended down the outside of barrel of the launcher, avoiding the need for flip-out fins or other solutions that would fit inside the barrel. The round was [...] long and weighed [...] It fired at a muzzle velocity of [...] and had a maximum effective range of about [...] A trained two-man crew could fire 4 to 6 rounds per minute.|$|E
50|$|MICs {{have been}} {{investigated}} as a possible replacement for lead (e.g. lead styphnate, lead azide) in <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> and electric matches. Compositions based on Al-Bi2O3 tend to be used. PETN may be optionally added.|$|R
5000|$|The Terzerol (or terzerole) {{was a small}} muzzleloading pistol {{with one}} or two barrels. These {{firearms}} were used from the 17th century onward, first as flintlocks, and in the 19th century with <b>percussion</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1854, Eugene Lefaucheux {{introduced}} the Lefaucheux Model 1854, the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges rather than loose powder, pistol ball, and <b>percussion</b> <b>caps.</b> It is a single-action, pinfire revolver holding six rounds.|$|R
2500|$|British {{military}} drills of {{the time}} required soldiers to bite open the cartridge, pour the gunpowder contained within down the barrel, ram the cartridge (which included the bullet) down the barrel, remove the ram-rod, bring the rifle to the ready, set the sights, add a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap,</b> present the rifle, and fire. The musketry books also recommended that, [...] "Whenever the grease around the bullet appears to be melted away, or otherwise removed from the cartridge, {{the sides of the}} bullet should be made wet in the mouth before putting it into the barrel; the saliva will serve the purpose of grease for the time being".|$|E
2500|$|While the {{cartridge}} revolver {{was known in}} Europe, Rollin White's famous patent combined a cylinder and a box magazine. It was a completely unworkable design which never went into production (only one sample was built which malfunctioned dramatically), [...] Yet {{it was the first}} US patent to include a cylinder bored through so that a revolver could be loaded from the breech. White's original solution for the misfires that plagued early revolvers was to plug the rear of the chambers with pieces of leather. The patent drawings imply that a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> would have had to be applied to the single nipple for each shot, so it would have been far slower than the existing cap-&-ball revolvers.|$|E
2500|$|As in all muzzle-loading {{firearms}} (prior to {{the introduction}} of the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap),</b> the pan transmits the fire to the main charge of gunpowder inside the breech of the barrel, via a small hole (or [...] "vent") {{in the side of the}} breech, that gives on to the pan. The priming pan of all wheellocks is provided with a sliding cover that has two purposes, the first of which is to contain the priming powder and afford it some protection from the elements (the second is examined below, under 'Operation'). The pan cover may be slid open and closed by hand, but it is also attached to an arm inside the lock plate, which is acted upon by the eccentric on the shaft of the wheel.|$|E
50|$|With the {{increased}} {{safety of the}} black powder substitutes often comes a reduced sensitivity to ignition. Flintlocks in particular need very sensitive, finely granulated powder {{for use in the}} flash pan, and black powder tends to perform more reliably in these and traditional caplock guns than substitutes. Modern in-line muzzleloaders provide a stronger ignition than traditional designs, and this helps to increase reliability with the less flame sensitive substitutes. In addition, magnum <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> are often recommended for use with black powder substitutes for both inline and traditional caplock guns, in place of the #11 <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> traditionally used with black powder in these guns, to achieve the best ignition reliability.|$|R
30|$|Loud noises {{were created}} by using sports <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> (Evernew, Tokyo, Japan). A {{handmade}} remote control device was used to generate the noises. The device was placed 2.0  m behind participants. The sound level used was approximately 110  dB.|$|R
