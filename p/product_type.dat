25|$|The {{shift toward}} riskier {{mortgages}} and private label MBS distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels {{that had been}} elevated during 2001–2003 by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates. Earnings depended on volume, so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the GSEs would not (initially) securitize. Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage <b>product</b> <b>type,</b> from traditional, amortizing, fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM's), and in {{the start of a}} sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards. The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders. Shareholder pressure pushed the GSEs into competition with PLS for market share, and the GSEs loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete. In contrast, the wholly public FHA/Ginnie Mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share.|$|E

2500|$|Non-discrimination. It has {{two major}} {{components:}} the most favoured nation (MFN) rule, {{and the national}} treatment policy. Both are embedded in the main WTO rules on goods, services, and intellectual property, but their precise scope and nature differ across these areas. The MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members, i.e. a WTO member has to grant the most favourable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain <b>product</b> <b>type</b> to all other WTO members. [...] "Grant someone a special favour {{and you have to}} do the same for all other WTO members." [...] National treatment means that imported goods should be treated no less favourably than domestically produced goods (at least after the foreign goods have entered the market) and was introduced to tackle non-tariff barriers to trade (e.g. technical standards, security standards et al. discriminating against imported goods).|$|E
2500|$|Research {{shows that}} consumers' broad general {{perceptions}} of a country, including of its national characteristics, economic and political background, history, traditions, and representative products, combine to create an overall image or stereotype that is then attached to the products of that country. For example, a global survey carried out by Nielsen, reported that [...] Country of origin image has a significant influence on consumer perceptions and behaviours, and in situations in which additional information is unavailable or difficult to get can be the sole determinant {{of whether or not}} someone buys a product. Its effect is strongest on consumers who don't know much about the product or <b>product</b> <b>type,</b> and weakest on consumers who are well-informed. Sensitivity to country of origin varies by product category. It is strongest for durable goods and luxury goods and weakest for [...] "low involvement" [...] product categories such as shampoo and candy. In various studies it has also been proven that the Country-of-Origin Effect also applies to services.|$|E
