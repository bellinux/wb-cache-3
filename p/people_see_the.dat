5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} week of release, the PS3 version of A Realm Reborn placed second in Japan's sales charts, with 184,000 {{physical}} copies sold. In late October 2013, Square Enix announced that the game had one and a half million registrations. It was the 16th best selling personal computer game of 2013 in the United States. In Japan, the PlayStation 3 version was ranked 32 in sales, with 244,574 retail copies sold. Following an extremely poor fiscal year 2013, Square Enix executives commended the game's sales and subscriptions for its role in returning the company to profitability in 2014. As of July 2016, the game had over 6 million cumulative players, a figure which excludes free trial members. Yoshida has repeatedly emphasized that the robust success of A Realm Reborn was due to its traditional monthly subscription model. He sees the free-to-play model as an unreliable source of income predicated on devoting a lot of development resources to monthly consumable or cosmetic items in order to maintain profitability, leaving little time left for higher quality story and battle content. He also disclosed that over 80% of players are satisfied with the subscription model and theorized that this is due to players' confidence in a steady stream of quality content because of their subscription. With the traditional model, the player base grows over time as <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> game expand, unlike a free-to-play game which can boast a huge initial player base which changes dramatically in size and revenue from month to month. Yoshida has no plans to change to a free-to-play model in the near future.|$|E

25|$|Color {{vision is}} the ability of an {{organism}} or machine to distinguish objects based on the wavelengths (or frequencies) of the light they reflect, emit, or transmit. Colors can be measured and quantified in various ways; indeed, a person's perception of colors is a subjective process whereby the brain responds to the stimuli that are produced when incoming light reacts with the several types of cone cells in the eye. In essence, different <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> same illuminated object or light source in different ways.|$|E

25|$|After the Great War, {{there was}} a {{proposal}} for the League of Nations to accept Esperanto as their working language, following a report by Nitobe Inaz≈ç, an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague. Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, Gabriel Hanotaux. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat, effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision. However, two years later, the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. For this reason, many <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> 1920s as {{the heyday of the}} Esperanto movement. Anarchism as a political movement was very supportive during this time of anationalism {{as well as of the}} Esperanto language.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{argue that}} hip hop {{can have an}} {{empowering}} effect on youth. While there is misogyny, violence, and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics, hip hop also displays many positive themes of self-reliance, resilience, and self-esteem. These messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty. A lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the African American community promoting social causes. Social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with at-risk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child. Hip hop {{has the potential to}} be taught as a way of helping <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> world more critically, be it through forms of writing, creating music, or social activism. The lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, tone, theme, motif, plot, and point of view.|$|E

500|$|Following script rewrites, Cherry {{pitched the}} series to ABC, who {{picked up the}} pilot. ABC {{executives}} were, however, concerned about {{the title of the}} series, which Cherry had selected before even writing the script. They suggested renaming the series Wisteria Lane or The Secret Lives of Housewives, but Cherry insisted on keeping the original title. He later commented, [...] "I put 'desperate' [...] to try to indicate, however subtly... I'm going to have some fun with the imagery, to take it to some interesting places. Most critics got the joke. Some <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> word 'housewives' and it pushes a button in them and they seem to lose all reason." [...] The project was officially announced on October 23, 2003 as a cross between American Beauty and Knots Landing. While Desperate Housewives, along with fellow new series Grey's Anatomy and Lost, would later help reverse ABC's flagging fortune, network executives Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne were fired shortly after greenlighting these risky and expensive pilots.|$|E
500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> movie‚Äî {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E

Despite his caveats, he recommends that <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> movie, stating: [...] "I hope it develops into a cult movie in the UK {{as it has in}} the US.

2500|$|Singing {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vocables, though recordings and {{reports from the}} early 1900s and prior indicate there were {{a great deal more}} lyrics or vocal texts. Blackfoot <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> profusion of words in European American music and African American music as lessening the importance and meaning of both words and music; and the same for the manner of listening to such music, that is, for entertainment or enjoyment, often while doing other things: if someone needed to say so many words, why didn't they just talk (p.69). Blackfoot music is not based on instruments or texts, and singing is not supposed to sound like talking (or imitate any other sound). Typically, songs which contain texts are short and not repetitive, such as: [...] "It's a bad thing to be an old man", (Nettl, 1989, p.73, 1951 recording of a Crazy Dog Society song) or the relatively lengthy, [...] "Yonder woman, you must take me. I am powerful. Yonder woman, you must take me, you must hear me. Where I sit is powerful." [...] (Nettl, 1989, p.73, Wissler and Duvall 1909:85 sung by a rock to a woman in the buffalo-rock myth). Often when the text takes up most of the melody with fewer vocables the melodies are short. The vocables used, as in Plains Indian singing, are the consonants h, y, w, and vowels. They avoid n, c (ts) and other consonants. i and e tend slightly to be higher in pitch, a, o, and u lower (p.71). (Nettl, 1989) ...|$|E
