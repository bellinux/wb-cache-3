40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the interaction between}} two firms engaged in a repeated procurement relationship modelled as a multiple criteria auction, and a <b>procurement</b> <b>official</b> (agent) whose duty is to decide on a scoring rule. We find that with favoritism, the procedure selects projects with an extreme design. In the one-shot game, the equilibrium bribe is maximal when the cost of favoritism is zero. As the cost increases, competition for favors weakens. When the firms meet repeatedly on different markets, the optimal collusive scheme, {{in the absence of}} corruption, entails an allocation rule contingent on firms ’ costs and on the government’s preferences. Our main finding is that with corruption a non-contingent allocation rule where firms take turn in winning independently of the true government preferences and the firms ’ costs is ex-post efficient. The ‘environment ’ adapts to the cartel: in equilibrium, the contract is fine-tailored to the in-turn winner. Favoritism not only increases the gains from collusion, it also solves basic problems of implementation for the cartel...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 47). On {{the basis of a}} number of arguments by procurement experts and from findings of some international organizations on International Open Tendering Method (IOTM) procurement procedures, this study has sought to investigate the extent of its practices and major challenges at the procurement for projects implemented in Bangladesh by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). This study has started with reviewing different aspects of IOTM through literature review. It has found that there exist differences in IOTM procurement procedures followed by different donor agencies like World Bank, ADB, IDB, DFID, USAID etc. It has found that IOTM as an essential system in implementing major and complicated public works in Bangladesh particularly by the LGED. Openness and transparency in IOTM is a must. There is no scope of corruption in decision making process of tender evaluation stage. This study also finds that procurement guideline of World Bank and ADB is very strong and play dominant roles in the procurement policy process. It works in a well structured framework. There exist strong internal control and accountability mechanisms making decision making process unique. In-depth investigation depicts that <b>procurement</b> <b>official</b> have the willingness and proper attitude to serve the people. This study also reveals structural, managerial as well as efficiency problems in the IOTM procurement. World Bank and ADB’s procurement guideline is still flexible and decentralized. Official jobs for procurement, authority and responsibilities are clearly specified. Both the World Bank and the ADB emphasized in favor of delegating financial power to the procurement officials. They felt that there is scope for improving the information disclosure system. Concepts like responsibility, transparency and good governance exist in procurement guidelines of the World Bank and the ADB. If structural deficiencies can be eliminated, level of ensuring efficiency of using IOTM procurement will be enhanced. This study concludes that the total time required for invitation of tender, evaluation and contracting is less than that of PPR 2008 of Bangladesh in the International Procurement of works. According to the ADB Procurement guidelines 6 to 8 weeks are needed from advertising to Evaluation and Contracting for the procurement of works internationally and according to the WB Procurement guidelines, 6 to 13 weeks are needed from advertising to Evaluation and Contracting for the procurement of works internationally. On the other hand, according to PPR 2008 Procurement guidelines, 6 to 12 months are needed from advertising to evaluation and contracting for the procurement of works internationally which is too much. But the time required from invitation of tender to evaluation and contracting depends on donors. The World Bank, ADB and JICA (Japan) takes less time compared to others. SFD and IDB take more time for concurrence and approval. So, for smooth implementation of projects having major and complicated works in public sector of Bangladesh in general and for LGED in particular the existing time frame in the PPR 2008 for procurement through IOTM procedure should be reviewed.

40|$|The need {{to deliver}} high quality goods and {{services}} in less time and at a lower total cost {{has resulted in a}} Revolution in Business Affairs throughout the Federal acquisition community. When the lowest price is not the driving factor during procurements, the Federal Acquisition Regulation allows <b>procurement</b> <b>officials</b> to make trade-offs between cost or price, past performance, and technical merit to ensure the best value to the Government. One of the tools that Government <b>procurement</b> <b>officials</b> have for reducing procurement risk is the ability to request, via the request for proposal, information regarding a supplier's past performance and to use this informaion in selecting sources of supply. This thesis investigates the use of past performance information in the Federal acquisition process. It reviews the current policies and best practices for the collection and evaluation of past performance information. It then categorizes and analyzes the past performance protest decisions handed down by the Comptroller General from October 1, 1997, to June 30, 2000. Following the review and analysis, the overall best practices and case principles are linked with the phases of the Federal acquisition process to develop a managerial model that will aid contracting officials in more effectively incorporating the use of past performance information into their acquisition and contracting processes.

And so it is critical that those responsible for procurement understand the foundations, recent history and terminology for this emerging paradigm.

It focuses on the recent history since the landmark “Perry Memo ” of 1994, to current progress. Important issues such as intellectual property are also presented.
