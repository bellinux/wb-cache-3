40|$|AbstractExtraction of {{tantalum}} and niobium from sulfate {{leach liquor}} of south Gabal El-A’urf polymineralized ore material {{was carried out}} by using octanol. The latter was contacted with the sulfate leach liquor prepared after fusing the highly mineralized ore sample with <b>potassium</b> <b>bisulphate</b> in a weight ratio of 1 / 3 at 650 °C for 3 h. From the McCabe–Thiele diagram, it is proposed that three extraction stages are sufficient to extract most of the Ta and Nb contents efficiently at the optimum extraction conditions of 100 % octanol, and A/O ratio of 1 / 1. A highly pure product of Ta was achieved by keeping the pH of the leach liquor at 2. 0 with contact time of 15 min. With respect to Nb, pH of 0. 7 and contact time of 5 min were sufficient to extract most of the Nb contents efficiently. Finally, a technical flowsheet was constructed...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} 125 {{species of the}} Palmae {{revealed}} a complex pattern of flavonoids in the leaf. C-Glycosylflavones, leucoanthocyanins and tricin, luteolin and quercetin glycosides were common, being present in 84, 66, 51, 30 and 24 % of the species respectively. Apigenin and kaempferol were recorded {{in only a few}} species and isorhamnetin only once. Eighteen flavonoids were identified: the 7 -glucoside, 7 -diglucoside and 7 -rutinoside of both luteolin and tricin, tricin 5 -glucoside, apigenin 7 -rutinoside, quercetin 3 -rutinoside- 7 -galactoside, isorhamnetin 7 -rutinoside, orientin, iso-orientin, vitexin, isovitexin and vitexin 7 -O-glucoside. Many of the C- and O-flavonoid glycosides were present as the <b>potassium</b> <b>bisulphate</b> salts and negatively charged compounds were detected in 50 % of the species. The distribution patterns are correlated with the taxonomy of the family in several ways. Thus, the Phoenicoideae and Caryotoideae have distinctive flavonoid patterns, there is evidence to support the separation of the subfamilies Phytelephantoideae and Nypoideae, and tricin is a useful marker at tribal level. At the generic level, Cocos is clearly separated from Butia, and other Cocoseae and Mascarena and Chamaedorea form well defined groups within the Arecoideae. A numerical analysis of these biochemical data, together with morphological characters, produces a new classification which suggests that the flavonoid data may have more systematic value than is indicated when they are applied to the traditional classification...|$|E
40|$|Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{demanding}} vegetables grown in Bangladesh. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of chemical additives on the shelf life of tomato juice. Tomato juice was prepared with three different chemical additives namely Potassium meta-bisulphate (KMS), Sodium benzoate and sorbic acid. The shelf life of these tomato juices was studied for 60 days storage period. Chemical analysis and sensory tests were carried out during the 60 days at an interval of 15 days to assess the effect of chemical additives on the shelf life of tomato juice. Negligible change in chemical constituents except vitamin C was observed in the prepared juices throughout the 60 days storage period. Color was gradually faded and off-flavor developed at the end of the storage time at room temperature. Additives and storage period has significant effect on percent acidity. Tomato juice prepared with <b>potassium</b> meta <b>bisulphate</b> was spoiled after 45 days whereas, tomato juice prepared with sorbic acid was spoiled after 30 days of storage at room temperature. Tomato juice prepared with sodium benzoate was more stable than others and spoiled at the end of the 60 days storage period at room temperature. Total number of viable bacteria was highest in tomato juice with <b>potassium</b> meta <b>bisulphate</b> and tomato juice with sodium benzoate contained least viable bacteria. There were no significant difference among the juices with three different chemical additives in respect to color and acceptability. Considering all the parameters, sodium benzoate tends to be better additive than <b>potassium</b> meta <b>bisulphate</b> and sorbic acid for preservation of tomato juice...|$|R
40|$|The wider {{utilization}} of Indian jujube (Zizyphus maurtiana) is hindered by the rapid {{deterioration of the}} fresh fruits and results in the striking decline in quality. Aloe vera gel which {{has been known for}} its therapeutic, antibacterial and antifungal properties is used as an edible coating to prolong the storage life of tropical and sub tropical fruits, which would be an innovative and interesting means for commercial application as a means of preservation. An attempt has been made to optimize the post harvest dip treatment for shelf life extension and maintaining physico chemical and organo leptic characteristics of Jujube. Aloe vera gel of 1 : 3 ratios with a dipping period of 5 minutes effectively inhibited the undesirable physicochemical and physiological changes during storage of Jujube packaged in LDPE film, extending its shelf life to 45 days under refrigerated temperature conditions of 5 ± 2 ℃ while the control fruits were tend to lose its physical and chemical characteristics after 21 days. Interestingly, this edible coating along with surface cleaning of fruit with <b>potassium</b> Meta <b>bisulphate</b> was able to reduce the initial microbial counts for both bacteria and fungi, which significantly increased the shelf life of edible coated jujube fruits to 45 days over storage. Jujube fruits with above treatment scored appreciable sensory scores by the panelists compared to control...|$|R
