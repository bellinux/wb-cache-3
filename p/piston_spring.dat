25|$|The {{manufacture}} of economical, reliable ballpoint pens {{as we know}} them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century. Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens. If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear.

25|$|As gas {{leaves the}} {{cylinder}} it decreases in {{pressure in the}} first stage, becoming very cold due to adiabatic expansion. Where the ambient water temperature is less than 5°C any water {{in contact with the}} regulator may freeze. If this ice jams the diaphragm or <b>piston</b> <b>spring,</b> preventing the valve closing, a free-flow may ensue that can empty a full cylinder within a minute or two, and the free-flow causes further cooling in a positive feedback loop. Generally the water that freezes is in the ambient pressure chamber around a spring that keeps the valve open and not moisture in the breathing gas from the cylinder, but that is also possible if the air is not adequately filtered. The modern trend of using plastics to replace metal components in regulators encourages freezing because it insulates the inside of a cold regulator from the warmer surrounding water. Some regulators are provided with heat exchange fins in areas where cooling due to air expansion is a problem, such as around the second stage valve seat on some regulators.|$|E
5000|$|A {{reservoir}} above each {{master cylinder}} supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air {{from entering the}} master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, {{but it may also}} be referred to as [...] "clutch fluid" [...] in a clutch applr). Each piston in a master cylinder operates a brake circuit, and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a brake circuit leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other brake circuit provides brake-pressure to slow down and stop the other two wheels. This is done in a diagonally split hydraulic system. If there is a hydraulic failure in the brake lines served by the master cylinder's secondary piston both pistons will move forward when the brakes are applied, but there is nothing to resist piston travel except the secondary <b>piston</b> <b>spring.</b> This lets the primary piston build up only a small amount of pressure until the secondary piston bottoms in the cylinder bore. Then the primary piston will build enough hydraulic pressure to operate the brakes served by this half of the system. In case of a hydraulic failure in the brake system served by the primary piston, the primary piston will move forward when the brakes are applied but will not build up hydraulic pressure. In this case very little force is transferred to the secondary piston through the primary <b>piston</b> <b>spring</b> until the piston extension screw comes in contact with the secondary piston. Then, pushrod force is transmitted directly to the secondary piston and enough pressure is built up to operate its brakes. Usually the 2 systems are split into left front and right rear comprising one system and right front and left rear comprising the other system. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability {{at the same time and}} that both sides of the car have at least one braking system working and both ends of the car have at least one system working. With only 1 system working there is longer stopping distances and repairs should be done before driving again.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of lever machines; manual <b>piston</b> and <b>spring</b> <b>piston</b> design. With the manual piston, the {{operator}} directly pushes the water through the grounds. In the <b>spring</b> <b>piston</b> design, the operator works to tension a spring, which then delivers the pressure for the espresso (usually 8 to 10 bar; 116 to 145 psi).|$|R
50|$|The plunger type has a {{cylinder}} with a spring-loaded piston which is pushed down and locks into place. When triggered by pressing a button, the <b>piston</b> <b>springs</b> up, creating suction that sucks the solder off the soldered connection. The bulb type creates suction by squeezing and releasing a rubber bulb.|$|R

These late <b>spring</b> <b>piston</b> era match air rifles, the Anschutz LG 380 and the Diana Model 75, were certainly of high quality and very accurate, but <b>spring</b> <b>piston</b> technology, with its complex recoil cancellation mechanisms and slow lock times, was no longer cutting edge.The competition successes of the Walther LGR forced the other match air rifle manufacturers to ultimately drop the spring-piston-powered match air rifles and move into the “recoil free” pneumatic era.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first patent}} for a ballpoint pen was issued on 30 October 1888, to John J. Loud, who was {{attempting}} to make a writing instrument that {{would be able to}} write [...] "on rough surfaces-such as wood, coarse wrapping-paper, and other articles" [...] which then-common fountain pens could not. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited and the patent eventually lapsed.The manufacture of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as we know them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years, the {{industry}} standard tool for thermal analysis, SINDA, has been expanded to include advanced thermodynamic and hydrodynamic solutions (“FLUINT”). With the recent culmination of the unique modeling tools, SINDA/ FLUINT has arguably become the most complete general-purpose thermohydraulic network analyzer that is available. Traditional network elements for fluid circuit analyzers include control volumes and flow passages. During the development of modeling tools capable of handling phasic nonequilibrium within SINDA/ FLUINT, several new network elements were created as by-products. This paper describes one of them: control volume interfaces or “ifaces ” for short. Ifaces are used to describe how one control volume abuts another. While originally developed to model liquid-vapor interfaces within two-phase control volumes, {{they can also be}} used to describe <b>pistons,</b> <b>spring</b> bellows, liquid slugs, and curved interfaces such as those between bubbles and liquid as well as those within capillary structures (e. g., sintered wicks). More importantly, they can be used as an imaginary film to subdivide quasi-stagnant control volumes, extending the reach of a 1 D network into certain 2 D and 3 D problems. Despite their abstract nature, ifaces have been well received by analysts for a variety of modeling tasks. ...|$|R

30|$|An air gun {{is special}} kind of small arm that hurls {{projectiles}} by means of mechanically pressurized air or other means which involves no any chemical reaction.

40|$|The {{domestic}} coffee machines {{market has}} widely expanded {{in the last}} five years. The core of these machines is an electro-pump that allows the correct water distribution. In this paper a root cause failure analysis was conducted utilizing some electro-pumps samples taken from a corroded batch. Several examinations were carried out in order to identify the root cause of the failure: visual examination, SEM-EDS analysis and microstructural characterization. The corrosion phenomenon is located at the piston-spring interface. As result of the examinations carried out, it has been possible to identify that the corrosion mechanism is due to different interacting factors: high chlorine concentration, potential dynamic difference between <b>piston</b> and <b>spring</b> materials, material sensitization and ironmanganese bacteria growth...|$|R
50|$|A light-gas gun {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as a <b>spring</b> <b>piston</b> airgun. A large-diameter piston is used to force a gaseous working fluid through a smaller-diameter barrel containing the projectile to be accelerated.

50|$|Initially, most valved {{instruments}} were offered in rotary valve configurations with piston valve cornet and alto horn {{being the only}} exceptions. The rotary valve is a string operated dual-bored axial valve actuated by a lever pressed with the fingers. A piston valve is directly actuated by downward finger pressure {{on the top of}} a dual-bored <b>piston</b> over a <b>spring.</b> Rotary valves were common in central Europe in the mid 19th century while piston valves were the preferred configuration in British brass bands.|$|R
50|$|Multiple-pump {{pneumatic}} {{guns are}} also common. Many pneumatic pellet guns provide {{the ability to}} use BBs as a cheaper alternative to lead shot. Some of these guns have rifled barrels, but the slightly undersized BBs don't swage in the barrel, so the rifling does not impart a significant spin. These are the types of guns that will benefit most from using precision lead BB shot. The pneumatic BB gun can attain much higher velocities than the traditional <b>spring</b> <b>piston</b> types.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed of}} sound also {{increases}} with {{the temperature of the}} fluid (but is independent of the pressure), so the heat formed by the compression of the working fluid serves to increase the maximum possible speed. <b>Spring</b> <b>piston</b> airguns increase the temperature of the air in the chamber by adiabatic heating; this raises the local {{speed of sound}} enough to overcome frictional and other efficiency losses and propel the projectile at more than the speed of sound in the ambient conditions.|$|R
