40|$|The current {{building}} envelope standards from Article 4. 1. 10 of the “General Law of Urban Planning and Construction” The current {{building envelope}} standards from Article 4. 1. 10 of the “General Law of Urban Planning and Construction” in Chile are applied {{on a typical}} residential building for the climate of Concepción (36 ° Latitude South, 73 ° Longitude West) and a detailed energy simulation program is {{used to assess the}} energy performance of this building. The simulation results of the Chilean standards are then compared with simulation results of <b>PassivHaus</b> <b>standards</b> upon the same building layout and with simulation results from the same typical building when applying alternative passive solar design and envelope upgrade techniques. The research aims to identify useful design strategies for achieving energy results comparable to those proposed by <b>PassivHaus</b> <b>standards</b> (i. e. less than 15 kWh/m 2 annum for heating and cooling needs). This would demonstrate to designers, developers and clients how to incorporate cost-effective features and build beyond current regulations in order to achieve large energy savings. In addition, this study is expected to be of use for policy makers, providing suggestions on how future energy regulations of Chile can promote low energy building designs. This study also aims initiate a discussion regarding future methodologies for assessing climate-responsive design in the Chilean context, in a way that useful passive features can also be considered, since they may represent a cost-effective alternative to <b>PassivHaus</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{challenges}} of achieving affordable low carbon housing {{in the context of}} the Scottish, UK, and <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>Standards.</b> It also investigates the potential for bridging the gaps between set targets and what is happening in reality, in order to achieve better performance of low carbon affordable housing at a wide scale. It looks at two case study housing projects – Enkelt Simple Living and Tygh-Na-Cladach, completed in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Both are located in Dunoon, Glasgow, Scotland. The case study design compares the high environmental targets set in the design briefs of the two projects; their delivery processes; and the outcome. The analysis is based on identified common challenges to achieving low carbon homes in the context of a four stage process of the lifetime of dwellings. The two projects demonstrate the need for innovative processes and approaches of delivering housing to meet low carbon targets in the affordable sector of the market...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to present an {{evaluation}} of the in-use energy performance of the Richard Feilden House student accommodation at Queen Mary University, London, UK. The building was completed and occupied in October 2007 and the study was conducted over a 2 -year period (January 2008 –December 2009). Analysis of the energy audit carried out as part of the study is presented in this paper. The findings suggest that the energy performance of the Richard Feilden House student accommodation is in accordance with its design intent and better than the Good Practice Benchmarks. High levels of insulation, thermal mass, ventilation heat recovery, decentralised electric heating, a greater reliance on internal heat gains for space heating and a proactive building management approach have contributed to this success. However, strategies similar to those adopted by the <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>Standards</b> will be required if future targets of low-carbon buildings are to be met. Currently, there is limited knowledge on the in-use energy performance of student housing in the UK, and while the findings from this study can be helpful for benchmark comparison, more such studies o...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} {{to the threat of}} anthropogenic climate change, heating dominated countries have focused on re-ducing the space conditioning demand by increasing insulation and airtightness. However, given climate projec-tions and lifespan of buildings, concerns have arisen on whether these strategies deliver resilient solutions. As overheating can be evaluated through different criteria, this paper investigates if building fabric performance is subject to bias from the assessment method chosen and account for discrepancies between previous studies. To answer this, we modelled dwellings compliant with 1995 and 2006 UK building regulations and the FEES and <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>standards</b> in a consistent and realistic manner. The parametric study included different weathers, thermal mass, glazing ratios, shading strategies, occupancy profiles, infiltration levels, purge ventilation strate-gies and orientations, resulting in 16128 simulation models. To provide confidence in the output, the base model was first validated against data collected from a real well-insulated dwelling. Results show that the benchmark choice is influential in the evaluation of building fabric performance as it is able to inverse overheating trends. Criteria based on adaptive comfort best represented expected behaviour, where improved building fabric is a resilient measure that reduces overheating as long as occupants are able to open windows for ventilation...|$|R
50|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirements}} of the <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>standard,</b> windows are manufactured with exceptionally high R-values (low U-values, typically 0.85 to 0.70 W/(m²·K) for the entire window including the frame). These normally combine triple-pane insulated glazing (with a good solar heat-gain coefficient, low-emissivity coatings, sealed argon or krypton gas filled inter-pane voids, and 'warm edge' insulating glass spacers) with air-seals and specially developed thermally broken window frames.|$|E
50|$|Building {{envelopes}} {{under the}} <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>standard</b> {{are required to}} be extremely airtight compared to conventional construction. They are required to meet either 0.60 ACH50 (air changes per hour at 50 pascals) based on the building's volume, or 0.05 CFM50/sf (cubic feet per minute at 50 pascals, per square foot of building enclosure surface area). In order to achieve these metrics, recommended best practice is to test the building air barrier enclosure with a blower door at mid-construction if possible.|$|E
50|$|In Sweden the use {{of direct}} {{electric}} heating has been restricted since the 1980s for this reason, and there are plans to phase it out entirely - see Oil phase-out in Sweden - while Denmark has banned the installation of direct electric space heating in new buildings for similar reasons.In the case of new buildings, low-energy building techniques can be used which can virtually {{eliminate the need for}} heating, such as those built to the <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a thermodynamic and exergoeconomic {{analysis of a}} recently-retrofitted Passivhaus non-domestic building. The selected case study, a Community Centre located in London, underwent a deep-energy retrofit in 2011, becoming the first ‘non-domestic Passivhaus’ retrofit in the country. As the building was retrofitted per <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>standards,</b> which is based solely on First Law analysis, a thermodynamic investigation can provide a novel means by which to assess its exergy efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As such, {{the aim of this}} paper is to conduct a comprehensive exergy and exergoeconomic analysis, presenting novel performance indicators for the pre-retrofit and post-retrofit Passivhaus building. First law outputs show that the improvement presents high levels of energy savings (75. 6 %), reductions in carbon emissions (64. 5 %), and occupant thermal comfort improvement (28. 8 %). Second law outputs present a reduction in primary exergy input reduction of 56. 4 % and exergy destructions of 60. 4 %, leading to improve building exergy efficiency from 9. 8 % to 18. 0 %. Nevertheless, exergoeconomically the building did not perform as expected due to high capital cost and exergy destructions cost rates. These results give an insight into the thermodynamic impact of the Passivhaus approach, providing a critical assessment of the strengths and limitations of the standard under both thermodynamic laws...|$|R

40|$|The {{full text}} version {{attached}} to this record is the authors final peer reviewed version. The publishers final version can be found by following the doi link. Purpose – The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify the factors present in successful energy efficiency investments that might indicate how to resolve the landlord-tenant dilemma in existing and new commercial property. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews literature to indicate the importance of energy efficiency in buildings and to explore the barriers to such investments, including problematic landlord-tenant relationships. Such relationships have been investigated by the International Energy Agency, and a similar approach is used here in two case studies in new and existing buildings. These studies explore the nature of landlord-tenant relationships and the importance of policy and standards of building performance. Findings – In neither case did landlord-tenant issues constitute barriers to investments in energy efficiency, however, these investments were made for other reasons than simple cost savings. Construction of new commercial property to <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>standards</b> ensures a high-build quality and a comfortable building with low-energy costs. The added value to tenants may justify the cost of construction. The cost of investments in energy efficient buildings can also be justified by the enhanced reputation of landlords which may be more valuable than a DEC rating. In neither case was the commercial Green Deal felt to be an attractive funding mechanism. Practical implications – Conclusions based on these case studies must be regarded as tentative, so future studies of successful energy efficient buildings should be undertaken to explore the motivation to invest, particularly the relative importance of indirect benefits of energy efficiency. Originality/value – One of the case study buildings is exceptionally energy efficient and is the result of a particularly open and effective contractual relationship. Further study of such cases may suggest a new approach to landlord-tenant problems of energy efficiency, even in refurbishment of existing buildings...|$|R
50|$|By {{achieving}} the Passivhaus standards, qualified buildings {{are able to}} dispense with conventional heating systems. While this is an underlying objective of the <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>standard,</b> some type of heating will still be required and most Passivhaus buildings do include a system to provide supplemental space heating. This is normally distributed through the low-volume heat recovery ventilation system that is required to maintain air quality, rather than by a conventional hydronic or high-volume forced-air heating system, {{as described in the}} space heating section below.|$|E
50|$|The AECB {{estimates}} that Step Three, the Gold Standard, would reduce overall CO₂ emissions by 95% {{compared with the}} UK average for buildings of each type, since this standard is almost identical to the <b>Passivhaus</b> <b>Standard</b> in terms of thermal efficiency but sets even lower limits on CO₂ emissions and overall primary energy use. As well as a requirement for energy-efficient electrical appliances, this standard demands {{a greater emphasis on}} electricity-producing renewables to offset power used for lighting, appliances and ventilation.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} suggests {{the most effective}} way for improving energy efficiency in tall buildings is a ‘fabric first’ approach. This involves optimising the performance of the building form and envelope as a first priority, with additional technologies a secondary consideration. The paper explores a specific fabric first energy standard known as ‘Passivhaus’. Buildings that meet this standard typically use 75 % less heating and cooling. The results show tall buildings have an intrinsic advantage in achieving Passivhaus performance, as compared to other low-rise buildings, due to their compact form, minimising heat loss. This means highrise can meet <b>Passivhaus</b> energy <b>standards</b> with double-glazing and mid-levels of insulation as compared to other typologies where triple glazing and superinsulation are commonplace. However, the author also suggest that designers need to develop strategies to minimise overheating in Passivhaus high-rise, and reduce the quantity of glazing typical in high-rise residential buildings to improve their energy efficiency...|$|R
50|$|Straw bales {{have also}} been used in very energy {{efficient}} high performance buildings such as the S-House in Austria which meets the <b>Passivhaus</b> energy <b>standard.</b> In South Africa, a five-star lodge made from 10,000 strawbales has housed luminaries such as Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair. In the Swiss Alps, in the little village of Nax Mont-Noble, construction works have begun in October 2011 for the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales. The Harrison Vault, in Joshua Tree, California, is engineered to withstand the high seismic loads in that area using only the assembly consisting of bales, lath and plaster. The technique was used successfully for strawbale housing in rural China. Straw bale domes along the Syrio-African rift at Kibbutz Lotan have an interior geodesic frame of steel pipes. Another method {{to reap the benefits}} of straw is to incorporate straw-bale walls into a pre-existing structure.|$|R
40|$|Human {{activities}} are significantly contributing to an upsurge {{of greenhouse gases}} that lead to climate change (IPCC, 2014). Building construction and operation are responsible for ~ 40 % of energy consumption worldwide and for ~ 30 % of the greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere (UNEP, 2009). These high emissions has forced UK authorities to promote mitigation measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, hence reduce energy consumption (e. g. the EU’s EPBD demands ‘nearly-zero energy buildings’ by 2020). At present, operational energy in buildings and especially space-heating, which represents the highest proportion of energy use in UK housing (Shorrock, 2005), are regulated in building codes. However, {{in order to reduce}} this operational energy, there is usually an increased demand for high-intensity materials and construction processes which, although they may improve the building energy performance, in turn increase the building’s embodied energy (Lane, 2010, Crawford & Stephan, 2013). An unintended consequence of regulations imposing the design of low-energy buildings may be that they require more energy for their construction (Lane, 2010), leading to an increase in associated CO 2 and CO 2 e emissions (CO 2 e : the greenhouse potential of emissions, considered as if they were all CO 2 – Pelsmakers, 2012). This paper discusses whether the environmental impact of materials used in the design of Passivhaus buildings should form part of the <b>Passivhaus</b> (PH) <b>Standard,</b> alongside its operational energy requirements. The paper presents research results from an investigation of an as-built PH case study located in the UK...|$|R
