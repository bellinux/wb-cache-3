40|$|ABSTRACT Heroin {{is known}} to enhance {{catabolism}} and inhibit anabolism of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides,</b> leading to <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> deficiencies in rat brains. Here, we determined the effect of exogenous <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> administration on <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> metabolism in the brains of heroin-dependent rats. Heroin was administrated in increasing doses for 9 consecutive days to induce addiction, and the biochemical changes associated with heroin and <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> administration were compared among the treated groups. HPLC was performed to detect the absolute concentrations of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> in the rat brain cortices. The enzymatic activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) in the treated rat cortices were analyzed, and qRT-PCR was performed to determine the relative expression of ADA, XO, adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT), hypoxanthine-guaninephosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), and adenosine kinase (AK). Heroin increased the enzymatic activity of ADA and XO, and up-regulated the transcription of ADA and XO. Alternatively, heroin decreased the transcription of AK, APRT, and HGPRT in the rat cortices. Furthermore, <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> administration alleviated the effect of heroin on <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> content, activity of essential <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> metabolic enzymes, and transcript levels of these genes. Our findings therefore represent a novel, putative approach {{to the treatment of}} heroin addiction...|$|R

40|$|<b>Purine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> are {{essential}} basic {{building blocks for}} DNA and RNA synthesis. They can also serve as energy storage and transfer unit and {{play an important role}} in cell signalling and regulation of variety of biochemical processes. It is crucial for the cells to maintain a sufficient supply of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> in order to secure its survival and cell division. Level of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> pool in the human body is regulated via <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> metabolism, which consists of three coordinated processes: de novo synthesis pathway, salvage pathway and degradation pathway of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides.</b> Regulation of those three pathways is under control of various mechanisms including regulation on the level of enzyme expression, allosteric regulation of enzyme activity or forming a multienzime complexes, i. e. purinosomes in the de novo synthesis pathway. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase I (PRS-I) and cytosolic purine 5 '-nucleotidase (cN-II) {{play an important role in}} <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> metabolism.

40|$|Deoxyadenosine (dAdo) and {{deoxyguanosine}} (dGuo) decrease methionine synthesis from homocysteine in cultured lymphoblasts; {{because of}} the possible trapping of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate this could lead to decreased <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> synthesis. Since <b>purine</b> deoxynucleosides could also inhibit purine synthesis de novo at an early step not involving folate metabolism, we measured in azaserine-treated cells 5 -amino- 4 -imidazolecarboxamide (Z-base) -dependent <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> synthesis using [14 C]formate. In the T lymphoblasts, Z-base-dependent <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> synthesis was decreased 26 % by 0. 3 microM-dAdo, 21 % by 1 microM-dGuo and 28 % by 1 microM-adenosine dialdehyde, a potent S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor; homocysteine fully reversed the inhibitions. The B lymphoblasts were considerably less sensitive to the deoxynucleoside-induced decrease in Z-base-dependent <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> synthesis, with 100 microM-dAdo required for significant inhibition and no inhibition by dGuo at this concentration; homocysteine partly reversed the inhibition by dAdo. The observed decrease in Z-base-dependent <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> synthesis could not be attributed either to dUMP depletion changing the folate pools or to decreased ATP availability because dUrd was without effect and during the experimental period the intracellular ATP concentration did not change significantly. Cells with 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency were relatively resistant to inhibition of Z-base-dependent <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> synthesis by dAdo and adenosine dialdehyde.

40|$|An {{animal model}} {{was used to}} {{determine}} the basis for the increase in purine biosynthesis that results from hepatic depletion of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides,</b> such as seen in patients with type I glycogen storage disease or following fructose administration. Mice were injected intravenously with glucose or fructose, 2. 5 mg/g of body weight, and the animals were killed at 0, 3, and 30 min following carbohydrate infusion. Fructose, but not glucose, administration led to a threefold increase in [14 C]glycine incorporation into hepatic <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> documenting an increase in the rate of purine biosynthesis in the liver of fructose-treated animals. In the fructose, but not the glucose-treated animals, there was a reduction in the hepatic content of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> that are inhibitory for amidophosphoribosyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction unique to the pathway of purine biosynthesis. PP-ribose-P, an important metabolite in the control of purine biosynthesis, was increased 2, 3 -fold in liver following fructose, but not glucose administration. In conjunction with the decrease in inhibitory nucleotides and increase in PP-ribose-P 29 % of amidophosphoribosyltransferase was shifted from the large inactive to the small active form of the enzyme. Results of these studies demonstrate that the end-products of the pathway, <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides,</b> control the activity of the enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction leading to <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> synthesis either through a direct effect of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> on the enzyme, through an indirect effect of the change in nucleotides on PP-ribose-P synthesis, or a combination of these effects.

40|$|Controversy {{exists as}} to whether the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle is {{important}} in normal skeletal muscle function. Patients with disruption of the cycle from a deficiency of AMP deaminase exhibit variable degrees of muscle dysfunction. An animal model was used to examine the effect of inhibition of the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle on muscle function. When the compound 5 -amino- 4 -imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAriboside) is phosphorylated to the riboside monophosphate in the myocyte it is an inhibitor of adenylosuccinate lyase, one of the enzymes of the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle. AICAriboside was infused in 28 mice, and 22 mice received saline. Gastrocnemius muscle function was assessed in situ by recording isometric tension developed during stimulation. The <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> content of the muscle was measured before and after stimulation. Disruption of the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle during muscle stimulation was evidenced by a greater accumulation of adenylosuccinate, the substrate for adenylosuccinate lyase, in the animals receiving AICAriboside (0. 60 +/- 0. 10 vs. 0. 05 +/- 0. 01 nmol/mumol total creatine, P less than 0. 0001). There was also a larger accumulation of inosine monophosphate in the AICAriboside vs. saline-treated animals at end stimulation (73 +/- 6 vs. 56 +/- 5 nmol/mumol total creatine, P less than 0. 03). Inhibition of flux through the cycle was accompanied by muscle dysfunction during stimulation. Total developed tension in the AICAriboside group was 40 % less than in the saline group (3, 023 +/- 1, 170 vs. 5, 090 +/- 450 g. s, P less than 0. 002). An index of energy production can be obtained by comparing the change in total phosphagen content per unit of developed tension in the two groups. This index indicates that less high energy phosphate compounds were generated in the AICAriboside group, suggesting that interruption of the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle interfered with energy production in the muscle. We conclude from these studies that defective energy generation is one mechanism whereby disruption of the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle produces muscle dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Three enzymes of purine metabolism, adenylosuccinate synthetase, adenylosuccinate lyase and AMP deaminase, {{have been}} {{proposed}} to form a functional unit, termed the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle. This cycle converts AMP into IMP and reconverts IMP into AMP via adenylosuccinate, thereby producing NH 3 and forming fumarate from aspartate. In muscle, the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle {{has been shown to}} function during intense exercise; the metabolic flux through the cycle has been proposed {{to play a role in}} the regeneration of ATP by pulling the adenylate kinase reaction in the direction of formation of ATP, and by providing Krebs cycle intermediates. In kidney, the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle was shown to account for the release of NH 3 under the normal acid-base status, but not under acidotic conditions. In brain, the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle might function under conditions that induce a loss of ATP, and thereby contribute to its recovery. There is no evidence that the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle operates in liver. Deficiency of muscle AMP deaminase is an apparently frequent disorder, which might affect approximately 2 % of the general population. The observation that it can be found in clinically asymptomatic individuals suggests, paradoxically, that the ATP-regenerating function which has been attributed to the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> cycle is not essential for muscle function. Further work should be aimed at identifying the conditions under which AMP deaminase deficiency becomes symptomatic. Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency provokes psychomotor retardation, often accompanied by autistic features. Its clinical heterogeneity justifies systematic screening in patients with unexplained mental deficiency. Additional studies are required to determine the mechanisms whereby this enzyme defect results in psychomotor retardation...|$|R

Cellular treatment with AG 2037, an inhibitor of the purine biosynthetic enzyme GARFT, profoundly inhibits mTORC 1 activity via a reduction in the level of GTP-bound Rheb, an obligate upstream activator of mTORC 1, because of a reduction in intracellular guanine nucleotides. AG 2037 treatment provokes both mTORC 1 inhibition and robust tumor growth suppression in mice bearing non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenografts.

40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} {{the influence of}} different adenine and guanine nucleotides on the free fatty acid-induced uncoupling protein (UCP) activity in non-phosphorylating Acanthamoeba castellanii mitochondria when the membranous ubiquinone (Q) redox state was varied. The <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> exhibit an inhibitory effect in the following descending order: GTP>ATP>GDP>ADP≫GMP>AMP. The efficiency of guanine and adenine nucleotides to inhibit UCP-sustained uncoupling in A. castellanii mitochondria depends on the Q redox state. Inhibition by <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> can be increased with decreasing Q reduction level (thereby ubiquinol, QH 2 concentration) even with nucleoside monophosphates that are very weak inhibitors at the initial respiration. On the other hand, the inhibition can be alleviated with increasing Q reduction level (thereby QH 2 concentration). The most important finding was that ubiquinol (QH 2) but not oxidised Q functions as a negative regulator of UCP inhibition by <b>purine</b> <b>nucleotides.</b> For a given concentration of QH 2, the linoleic acid-induced GTP-inhibited H+ leak was the same for two types of A. castellanii mitochondria that differ in the endogenous Q content. When availability of the inhibitor (GTP) or the negative inhibition modulator (QH 2) was changed, a competitive influence on the UCP activity was observed. QH 2 decreases the affinity of UCP for GTP and, vice versa, GTP decreases the affinity of UCP for QH 2.
