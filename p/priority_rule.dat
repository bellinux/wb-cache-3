40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design of <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> for job shops that process {{multi-level}} assembly jobs. Specifically, it explores {{the means by which}} the structural complexity of jobs can be incorporated explicitly into <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> to reduce job lead times. The job lead time is viewed as consisting of two components: flow time and job staging delays. The primary focus of the paper is on the development of a class of <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> that is aimed at reducing the staging delay. The class of <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> that is developed is then used in combination with rules that are effective for the flow time component. The combined rule results in the improvement of the lead time performance. The paper also includes experimental results on sets of jobs of varying degrees of complexity. These results provide a comparative perspective on the performance of <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> that have been examined in the earlier research literature as well as the rules specifically developed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} new scheduling heuristics, namely Mean Progressive Weighted Tardiness Estimator (MPWT) Heuristic Method {{and modified}} <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> with sequence-dependent setup times consideration. These {{are designed to}} solve job shop scheduling problems with new performance measures – progressive weighted tardiness penalties. More realistic constraints, which are inter-machine overlapping sequencedependent setup times, are considered. In real production environments, inter-machine overlapping sequencedependent setups are significant. Therefore, modified scheduling generation algorithms of active and nondelay schedules for job shop problems with inter-machine overlapping sequence-dependent setup times are proposed in this paper. In addition, new customer-based measures of performance, which are total earliness and progressive weighted tardiness, and total progressive weighted tardiness, are proposed. The objective of the first experiment is to compare the proposed <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> with the consideration of sequence-dependent setup times and the standard <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> without setup times consideration. The {{results indicate that the}} proposed <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> with setup times consideration are superior to the standard <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> without the consideration of setup times. From the second experiment and the third experiment to compare the proposed MPWT heuristic approach with the efficient <b>priority</b> <b>rules</b> with setup times consideration, the MPWT heuristic method is significantly superior to the Batched Apparent Tardiness Cost with Sequence-dependent Setups (BATCS) rule, and othe...|$|R

50|$|In {{spite of}} the criticisms {{of the way in}} which the rule in Dearle v Hall has developed, there is much to be said for the concept that the {{priority}} of assignments or charges over debts should, as a general rule, depend on the date notice is given to the person who owes the debt. Not least, this is because the person who owes the debt will get a good discharge by paying the creditor unless he has been notified of the assignment or charge. Once a debt has been paid, it ceases to exist, and the <b>priority</b> <b>rule</b> recognises this fact. That is not to say that, in appropriate cases, it would not be possible for one creditor to trace the proceeds of the debt into the hands of another. But a simple rule that both priority and discharge depend on notice has much to recommend it.|$|E
5000|$|In science, {{priority}} is the credit {{given to the}} individual or group of individuals who first made the discovery or propose the theory. Fame and honours usually go to the first person or group to publish a new finding, even if several researchers arrived at the same conclusion independently {{and at the same}} time. Thus between two or more independent discoverers, the first to make formal publication is the legitimate winner. Hence, the tradition {{is often referred to as}} the <b>priority</b> <b>rule,</b> the procedure of which is nicely summed up in a phrase [...] "publish or perish", because there are no second prizes. In a way, the race to be first inspires risk-taking that can lead to scientific breakthroughs which is beneficial to the society (such as discovery of malaria transmission, DNA, HIV, etc.); on the other hand, it can create an unhealthy competition, thus, becoming detrimental to scientific progress.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>priority</b> <b>rule</b> {{came into}} {{existence}} before or as soon as modern scientific methods were established.

This particular incidence clearly shows human biases and prejudice. It has become unanimously accepted that both the mathematicians independently developed calculus. Since then priority has caused a number of historical maladies {{in the history of}} science.In the cases of scientists who have since achieved incredible levels of popularity, such as Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein, priority questions are often rooted in taking too seriously the myth of the [...] "lone genius" [...] which is often cultivated around such quasi-mythic figures (see Great Man theory and Whig history). In an attempt to laud such scientists as visionaries, the context in which they worked is often neglected by popularizers, making it appear as if they worked without assistance or without reference to other work, something which is rarely the case.|$|E
