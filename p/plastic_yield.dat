40|$|The {{thermolysis}} of {{mixtures of}} polyethylene and polystyrene was investigated. Overall liquid production for the mixture {{was above the}} values predicted from individual polymer reactions. No {{detrimental effects on the}} styrene production were evident, as over 50 % of the initial polystyrene charge was converted to styrene for polystyrene and for mixtures. There were, however, some differences in the secondary products. No incorporation of one polymer onto another was observed, either in the liquid or the residue. Different reaction conditions were examined. It was determined that using a single reaction temperature (445 $ sp circ$C) was as effective at separating the aromatic and aliphatic products as using two different reaction temperatures. Polystyrene was found to catalyze the thermolysis of polyethylene. Conventional catalysts (Mordenite and FCC zeolite) affected the overall production and product distributions for mixtures and polyethylene, while only changing the product distribution for polystyrene. Hydrogen in the purge gas only slightly decreased the ratio of 1 -alkenes to n-alkanes.

40|$|Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was tasked to {{find and}} {{characterize}} the impact of rheological modifiers to a clay (Kaolin-Bentonite) slurry having 23. 1 total wt percent solids, 1. 165 g/ml, and Bingham <b>Plastic</b> <b>yield</b> stress of 13 Pa and plastic viscosity of 24 mPa-sec. The primary objective was to find rheological modifiers when blended with this clay slurry that would provide a vane yield stress of 300 Pa when the slurry was undisturbed for 24 hours. A secondary objective {{was to find a}} modifier that after shearing would produce a Bingham <b>Plastic</b> <b>yield</b> stress of 30 Pa and plastic viscosity of 30 mPa-sec. Two parallel paths were chosen with one examining a variety of organic/inorganic modifiers and another using just the inorganic modifier Laponite (R). The addition of organic modifiers hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and hydroxypropylcellulose at a target 0. 50 wt percent dramatically increased the vane yield stress over the range 311 - 724 Pa, and also increased the Bingham <b>plastic</b> <b>yield</b> stress and plastic viscosities over the range 33 - 112 Pa and 27 - 166 mPa-sec, respectively. The organic modifiers also showed elastic behavior, yielding a very unpredictable up flow curve. The 0. 50 wt percent addition of inorganic modifiers magnesium aluminum silicate and hydrate magnesium aluminum silicate only increased the vane yield stress to 36 - 46 Pa and had little impact on the Bingham Plastic parameters. A range of an inorganic (2 - 4 wt percent magnesium aluminum silicate) and combination of a range of an inorganic (2 - 3 wt percent magnesium aluminum silicate) and organic (0. 03 - 0. 05 wt percent sodium carboxymethylcellulose) modifiers were then tested. These results showed that the target vane yield stress could be obtained but the Bingham <b>Plastic</b> <b>yield</b> stress and plastic viscosity were 3 times too high. Reducing the organic modifier weight percent by a few hundredths, the Bingham <b>Plastic</b> <b>yield</b> stress could be obtained, but then the vane yield stress would be too low. The addition of Laponite (R) (synthetic lithium aluminum silicate) increased the vane yield stress of the clay slurry to values as high as 1500 Pa.

40|$|Slow crack {{propagation}} in ductile, and in certain brittle materials, appears {{to take place}} via the nucleation of voids ahead of the crack tip due to <b>plastic</b> <b>yields,</b> followed by the coalescence of these voids. Post mortem analysis of the resulting fracture surfaces of ductile and brittle materials on the μm-mm and the nm scales respectively, reveals self-affine cracks with anomalous scaling exponent ζ≈ 0. 8 in 3 -dimensions and ζ≈ 0. 65 in 2 -dimensions. In this paper we present an analytic theory based on the method of iterated conformal maps aimed at modelling the void formation and the fracture growth, culminating in estimates of the roughening exponents in 2 -dimensions. In the simplest realization of the model we allow one void ahead of the crack, and address the robustness of the roughening exponent. Next we develop the theory further, to include two voids ahead of the crack. This development necessitates generalizing the method of iterated conformal maps to include doubly connected regions (maps from the annulus rather than the unit circle). While mathematically and numerically feasible, {{we find that the}} employment of the stress field as computed from elasticity theory becomes questionable when more than one void is explicitly inserted into the material.
