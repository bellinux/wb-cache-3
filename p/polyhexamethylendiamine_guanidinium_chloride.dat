The unfolding was reversible and characterized by at least three distinct stages—the intensity and lifetime data, for example, were both characterized by an initial increase followed by a decrease and then a plateau region. The lifetime data, in the absence and presence of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> were heterogeneous and fit best to a model consisting of a major Gaussian distribution component and a minor, short discrete component. The observed increase in intensity in the initial stage of the unfolding process is attributed to the conversion of this short component into the longer, distributed component as the <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration increases.

The solubilizing action of CTAC appeared {{to be dependent on}} the presence of a positively charged head group, as a non-charged variant was inactive. Relatively low concentrations of CTAC were required for rapid solubilization, and protein-bound CTAC was easily removed by ion-exchange chromatography. Compared with solubilization and recovery of rPGH from inclusion bodies with 7. 5 M-urea and 6 M-guanidinium chloride, the relative efficiency of solubilization was lower with CTAC. However, superior refolding efficiency resulted in final yields of purified rPGH being in the order of CTAC greater than urea {{greater than or equal to}} <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Detailed comparison of the different rPGH preparations as well as pituitary-derived growth hormone by h. p. l. c., native PAGE, c. d. spectral analysis and radioreceptor-binding assay showed that the CTAC-derived rPGH was essentially indistinguishable from the urea and <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> preparations. The CTAC-derived rPGH was of greater biopotency than pituitary-derived growth hormone.

C. d. spectroscopy reveals that malate dehydrogenase is almost unfolded in 3 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> suggesting that a state with little or no residual secondary structure is the optimal 'substrate' for chaperonin-assisted refolding. Malate dehydrogenase denatured to more highly structured states proves to refold less efficiently with chaperonin assistance.

All three folding aids could inhibit the formation of insoluble aggregates of rhG-CSF but with different efficacies. A low concentration of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> was found to denature protein, so that rhG-CSF was not fully or correctly folded even if concentration was reduced to I M. Low concentration of urea (2 M) or arginine (0. 5 M) did not cause rhG-CSF denaturation, but urea was unable to suppress the formation of soluble oligomers, which persisted at a level of about 30 % in refolded soluble rhG-CSF. Arginine, in contrast, could inhibit formation of all soluble oligomers. Based on these phenomena, we tested rhG-CSF folding in a mixture of 2 M urea and 0. 5 M arginine. Kinetic analysis indicated that urea aided in suppressing insoluble precipitates, while arginine prevented formation of soluble oligomers produced by hydrophobic interaction.

This behavior is characteristic of a two-state transition. The thermodynamic characteristics of this transition (delta G 0 and m), whether estimated directly from the EPR data or from both CD and fluorescence data analyzed by assuming a two-state scheme, are in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} structure of recombinant streptococcal Protein G' was predicted and compared with spectropolarimetric data. The predicted {{secondary structure}} consisted of 37 +/- 4 % alpha-helix and 30 +/- 5 % beta-sheet, whereas the values obtained from c. d. data were 29 +/- 2 % alpha-helix and 41 +/- 3 % beta-sheet. An alpha-helix-beta-sheet/turn-alpha-helix motif is conjectured to comprise the Fc-binding unit. The c. d. spectra {{in the near}} u. v. and far u. v. show that the Protein G' molecule is stable to heating at 100 degrees C and to extremes of pH (pH 1. 5 to 11. 0). The protein retained biological activity at these extremes. The molecule uncoils above pH 11. 5 in a time-dependent fashion. Unfolding of the molecule in <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> was monitored by c. d. and fluorescence emission; 3 M-guanidinium chloride was required to unfold the protein by 50 %. The protein was completely unfolded in 5. 5 M-guanidinium chloride and fully refolded with restoration of activity after removal of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{macromolecular}} {{properties of}} cervical-mucus glycoproteins (mucins) were studied {{as a function}} of the concentration of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> with conventional light-scattering, photon-correlation spectroscopy and sedimentation-velocity centrifugation. No evidence for an association of the mucins in 0. 2 M-NaCl as compared with 6 M-guanidinium chloride was found at mucin concentrations below approx. 0. 5 mg/ml. However, an increase in the frictional coefficient and in the radius of gyration occurred with increasing concentrations of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> in particular between 4 M and 6 M, suggesting an expansion of the individual macromolecule. The change in the particle-scattering function is consistent with a transition from a 'stiff' random coil in 0. 2 M-NaCl into a more flexible one in 6 M-guanidinium chloride. We suggest that the mucins contain regions of 'ordered' structure which can undergo a reversible 'unfolding' analogous to the behaviour of a conventional globular protein exposed to a denaturing solvent. Such regions might carry sites for specific interactions between mucins and/or be decisive for their conformation and macromolecular properties in physiological solvents...|$|R

The cold-induced denaturation temperature (Tl {{has been found to}} be − 28 °C. The results for the first time clearly establish that temperature alone can induce denaturation in a cooled protein solution. The validity of earlier data, obtained in the presence of perturbants (particularly pH or <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride),</b> is discussed.

40|$|Avidin {{that had}} been coupled to Sepharose 4 B {{activated}} with CNBr retained over 90 % of its biotin-binding capacity. When low concentrations of CNBr were used about 75 % of the protein could {{be removed from the}} Sepharose by washing with <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> (6 m). The remaining 25 %, the covalently bound subunits, had an almost undiminished capacity for biotin but a decreased affinity. Addition of avidin subunits in <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> to the coupled subunits followed by dilution or dialysis restored the original biotin-binding capacity and affinity. Three classes of binding sites were present in preparations of the subunits. About 25 % were weak (K= 5 × 10 − 8 m), about one third exchanged their biotin in a few minutes (K∼ 10 − 10 m) and the remainder were indistinguishable from the native tetramer. The last-named exchanged their bound biotin at a similar rate at pH 5 and at pH 2, they did not lose their biotin in 6 m-guanidinium chloride and they were resistant to tryptic digestion in the absence of biotin. The proportion of these stable sites could be increased to 65 % when the subunits coupled to Sepharose were incubated at 37 °C. This increase was reversed by <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> which suggested that it was caused by a temperature-dependent association of covalently linked subunits. This in turn implies a temperature-dependent mobility of the agarose matrix of the Sepharose. Analysis of the spatial distribution of subunits within the Sepharose beads led {{to the conclusion that the}} association of subunits implied that they could move through distances greater than 20 nm (several hundred Å). This mobility and consequent formation of tetramer was greatly decreased when avidin subunits were coupled to Sepharose {{that had been}} cross-linked with divinyl sulphone...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{stability of}} family 16 endo-ß- 1, 3 -glucanase (EC 3. 2. 1. 39) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus is decreased upon single (D 287 A, E 53 A) and double (E 53 A/D 287 A) mutation of Asp 287 and Glu 53. In {{accordance with the}} homology model prediction, both carboxylic acids {{are involved in the}} composition of a calcium binding site, as shown by titration of the wild-type and the variant proteins with a chromophoric chelator. The present study shows that, in P. furiosus, endo-ß- 1, 3 -glucanase residues Glu 53 and Asp 287 also make up a calcium binding site in 7. 9 m <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride.</b> The persistence of tertiary structure in 7. 9 m <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> a feature of the wild-type enzyme, is observed also for the three variant proteins. The ¿GH 2 O values relative to the guanidinium chloride-induced equilibrium unfolding of the three variants are approximatelty 50 % lower than that of the wild-type. The destabilizing effect of the combined mutations of the double mutant is non-additive, with an energy of interaction of 24. 2 kJ·mol¿ 1, suggesting a communication between the two mutated residues. The decrease in the thermodynamic stability of D 287 A, E 53 A and E 53 A/D 287 A is contained almost exclusively in the m-values, a parameter which reflects the solvent-exposed surface area upon unfolding. The decrease in m-value suggests that the substitution with alanine of two evenly charged repulsive side chains induces a stabilization of the non-native state in 7. 9 m <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> comparable to that induced by the presence of calcium on the wild-type. These results suggest that the stabilization of a compact non-native state may be a strategy for P. furiosus endo-ß- 1, 3 -glucanase to thrive under adverse environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{heterogeneity}} {{of the components}} of proteoglycan aggregates, their stoichiometry within the aggregate and the aggregates' stability was investigated in normal human articular cartilage specimens (age-range newborn to 63 years). Proteoglycans were extracted from tissue by sequentially extracting them with PBS alone, PBS containing oligosaccharides of hyaluronan, and PBS containing solutions of increasing <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration (1 M, 2 M, 3 M and 4 M). A high proportion of each {{of the components of}} the proteoglycan aggregate, i. e. uronic acid, sulphated glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan binding domain of aggrecan (G 1 -domain), link protein (LP) and hyaluronan, was extracted from immature cartilage by PBS alone and PBS containing oligosaccharides of hyaluronan. This was in marked contrast to adult cartilage, which required high concentrations of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> for the efficient extraction of these components. The molar ratios of total G 1 -domain:LP and the G 1 -domain associated with aggrecan:LP also differed markedly between immature and mature cartilage and between each of the sequential extracts. The concentration of LP was less than that of the G 1 -domain in all extracts of cartilage from individuals over 13 years, but this was particularly noticeable in the 1 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> extracts, and it was surmised that a deficiency in LP produces unstable aggregates in situ. The fragmentation of LP, which is known to occur with advancing age, did not influence the extractability of LP, and fragments were present in each of the sequential extracts. Therefore the generally accepted model of proteoglycan aggregation presented in the literature, which is mostly derived from analysis of immature animal cartilage, cannot be used to describe the structure and organization of aggregates in adult human articular cartilage, where a heterogeneous population of complexes exist that have varying degrees of stability...|$|R
