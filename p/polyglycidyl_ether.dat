Glycerol <b>polyglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> (GPE) and trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TTE) were also investigated as crosslinking agents for SF as adhesive for plywood. The plywood panels bonded with SF-TGA and SF-GPE adhesives did meet and those with SF-TTE adhesive did not meet the water-resistance requirement for interior application. The former two adhesives are formaldehyde-free, environmentally friendly, easy to use and readily available. They can be derived completely from renewable materials.

The new strategy developed in this work, makes use of two different plasticizers: a primary “external-type” or “non-reactive-type” plasticizer, triacetin (TA), added prior to extrusion to enhance the “processing window” of the polymer and a secondary “internal-type” or “reactive-type”, Glycerin <b>Polyglycidyl</b> <b>Ether</b> (GPE), added during the extrusion step {{to reduce the amount}} of potential volatiles or leachable products in the final product and to help in the reduction of viscosity and thus further improving processability.

40|$|Cyclic and linear, isoregic and aregic, and {{isotactic}} and atactic <b>poly(glycidyl</b> phenyl <b>ether)</b> (PGPE) with molecular weights up to Mw = 5. 5 kg/mol are synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of glycidyl phenyl ether. Initiation with tetrabutylammonium fluoride {{leads to}} isoregic linear polymers with ~ 95 % regular linkages, and initiation with B(C 6 F 5) 3 and B(C 6 F 5) 3 /water leads to aregic cyclic and linear polymers, respectively, with ~ 50 % regular linkages as quantified by 13 C NMR. Local, segmental, and chain dynamics in PGPE is investigated by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (10 – 2 – 106 Hz). The ß-relaxation for linear PGPE is separated into two contributions {{arising from the}} motions of side groups and end groups with activation energies of 35. 4 and 23. 8 kJ/mol, respectively. The ß-relaxation process for cyclic PGPE shows the same activation energy as that shown by the side-group contribution in linear PGPE, indicating that topology does not {{play a key role}} on the side-group local dynamics. Moreover, cyclic PGPE samples show higher calorimetric and dynamic glass transition temperatures as well as lower dynamic fragility compared to linear chains. Unexpectedly from topological considerations, cyclic PGPE shows low frequency dielectric contributions that can be attributed to short wavelength internal ring motions and that are detectable by dielectric relaxation due to the aregic nature of the rings.

40|$|Small angle neutron {{scattering}} {{has been used}} to probe the self-assembled structures formed by novel block copolymers in water and two protic ionic liquids (ILs), ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) and propylammonium nitrate (PAN). The block copolymers consist of solvophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) tethered to either poly(ethyl glycidyl <b>ether)</b> (PEGE) or <b>poly(glycidyl</b> propyl <b>ether)</b> (PGPrE) solvophobic blocks. Four block copolymers (EGE 109 EO 54, EGE 113 EO 115, EGE 104 EO 178, and GPrE 98 EO 260) have been investigated between 10 and 100 °C, showing how aggregate structure changes with increasing the EO block length, by changing the insoluble block from EGE to the more bulky, hydrophobic GPrE block, and with temperature. EO solubility mainly depends on the hydrogen bond network density, and decreases in the order H₂O, EAN, and then PAN. The solubility of the EGE and GPrE blocks decreases in the order PAN, EAN then water because the large apolar domain of PAN increase the solubility of the solvophobic blocks more effectively than the smaller apolar domains in EAN, and water, which is entirely hydrophilic; GPrE is less soluble than EGE because its larger size hinders solubilization in the IL apolar domains. Large disk-shaped structures were present for EGE 109 EO 54 in all three solvents because short EO chains favor flat structures, while GPrE 98 EO 260 formed spherical structures because long EO chains lead to curved aggregates. The aggregate structures of EGE 113 EO 115 and EGE 104 EO 178, which have intermediate EO chain lengths, varied depending on the solvent and the temperature. Solubilities also explain trends in critical micelle concentrations (cmc) and temperatures (cmt) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThree {{different}} bio-based epoxy prepolymers are studied: {{one that}} is synthesized from isosorbide and two that are commercial prepolymers derived from sorbitol and cardanol. The chemical structures are analyzed by SEC, ESI-TOF MS, and FTIR analyses. The bio-based prepolymers exhibit different structures, either aromatic with long aliphatic chains for the epoxy prepolymer derived from cardanol (DGECAR), with high functionality for the sorbitol <b>polyglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> (SPGE) or a short and cyclic structure for the epoxy prepolymer derived from isosorbide (DGEDAS(0)). A traditional petroleum-based epoxy prepolymer, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) is also used for comparison. Gelation and reactivity of the different precursors with an isophorone diamine hardener are studied using rheological measurements and differential scanning calorimetry. Glass transition temperatures of the epoxy networks are evaluated and the thermal stability is also studied by thermo-gravimetric analysis...|$|E
40|$|A surface {{modified}} polyamide (PA) {{thin film}} composite (TFC) membrane was prepared using in-situ polymerization of sorbitol <b>polyglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> (SPGE) on the membrane surface immediately after interfacial polymerization of TFC membranes. This modification {{was conducted to}} protect the chlorine-sensitive sites of the PA membrane using a chlorine-resistant hydrophilic SPGE polymer. The optimum preparation condition of the modified PA TFC reverse osmosis membranes was investigated, and then the successful modification of the membrane was confirmed using various analytical tools including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, a zeta potential analyzer, a contact angle analyzer, X-ray photoelectron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The modification converted {{the surface of the}} membrane to a more neutral, hydrophilic, and smooth surface. With increasing SPGE concentration in the coating solution, molecular overlapping of the coating polymer led to a denser coating layer, which resulted in declined flux but increased salt rejection. Chlorination tests showed that the modification of the membrane using SPGE ring-opening polymerization improved chlorine stability. close 101...|$|E
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} flame-retarded bioepoxy composites {{were prepared}} from commercially available sorbitol <b>polyglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> (SPE) cured with cycloaliphatic amine hardener. Samples containing 1, 2, and 3 % phosphorus (P) were prepared using additive type flame retardants (FRs) resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) (RDP), ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and their combinations. The fire {{performance of the}} composites was investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL- 94 tests, and mass loss calorimetry. The effect of FRs on the glass transition temperature, and storage modulus was evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), while the mechanical performance was investigated by tensile, bending, and interlaminar shear measurements, {{as well as by}} Charpy impact test. In formulations containing both FRs, the presence of RDP, acting mainly in gas phase, ensured balanced gas and solid-phase mechanism leading to best overall fire performance. APP advantageously compensated the plasticizing (storage modulus and glass transition temperature decreasing) effect of RDP in combined formulations; furthermore, it led to increased tensile strength and Charpy impact energy...|$|E
40|$|Ring opening {{polymerization}} {{and click}} reaction {{was used to}} synthesize thermo-responsive glyco-block copolymers consisting of a polyether block with pendant α-D-mannose groups and random copolymer blocks of <b>poly(glycidyl</b> methyl <b>ether)</b> -poly(epoxyhexane). The thermo-responsive block was synthesized as a random copolymer to decrease the phase transition temperature to usable region. Temperature-responsiveness would enable the polymers to switch between dissolved and aggregated states. Such glycopolymers would be interesting candidates for studying carbohydrate-lectin interactions and drug delivery properties. The synthesized polymers were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, turbidimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Both glycopolymers and thermo-responsive copolymers were synthesized. The latter showed good control over the polymerization, leading to clickable azide functionality and desired ratios of monomers in the copolymers. Altering the ratios of glycidyl methyl ether and epoxyhexane in the feed led to variations in the cloud points and glass transition temperatures of the copolymers. The synthesis of glycopolymers proved difficult {{and could not be}} initiated using clickable propargyl alcohol. Also, no effective way to purify the glycopolymers initiated using bezyl alcohol was found. Combination of the glycopolymers and thermo-responsive copolymers was attempted using click reaction. A triazole signal was detected using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggesting the reaction was successful. However, further studies are required to confirm this. Vain tiivistelmä.

40|$|Flame-retarded bioepoxy resins were {{prepared}} with {{the application of}} commercially available sorbitol <b>polyglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> (SPE). The additive-type flame retardancy of the cycloaliphatic amine-cured SPE was investigated. Three-percent phosphorus (P) -containing samples {{were prepared}} with {{the application of the}} liquid resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) (RDP), the solid ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and by combining them. Synergistic effect was found between the inorganic APP and the organophosphorus RDP, when applied in combination: formulations applying RDP or APP alone showed increased limiting oxygen index (LOI) values, however, their UL- 94 standard ratings remained HB. When the same amount of P originated from the two additives, V- 0, self-extinguishing rating and LOI value of 34 % (v/v) was reached. By the combined approach the heat release rate of SPE could be lowered by approximately 60 %. The assumed balanced solid and gas phase mechanism was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) analysis (of the gases formed during laser pyrolysis), attenuated total reflection-infrared spectrometry (ATR-IR) analysis (of the charred residues), as well as by mechanical testing (of the char obtained after combustion) ...|$|E

Cross-link density values were estimated by swelling measurement. Temperature and frequency dependencies of rheological behaviour parameters (storage modulus, loss modulus, loss factor and glass-rubber transition temperature) were also analyzed. Based on the frequency dependencies of storage modulus, {{put in the}} range of temperature from - 50 °C to 20 °C by the experiment, master curves (logG' vs log ω) were generated, reaching broader frequency interval in comparison to that used in the measurements. By choosing the glass-rubber transition temperature to be the reference one, Williams-Landel-Ferry equation constants were determined. Further, material constants, fractional free volume at the glass-rubber transition temperature and thermal coefficient of free volume expansion were calculated. Although small quantity of tris(2, 3 -epoxypropyl) affects the network density, the dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the bonding agent content did not affect the glass-rubber transition temperature of the tested materials...|$|E
40|$|YesHighly-oriented poly (lactic acid) (PLA) with bionic fibrillar {{structure}} and micro-grooves was fabricated through solid hot drawing technology for further improving the mechanical properties and blood biocompatibility of PLA as blood-contacting medical devices. In order {{to enhance the}} melt strength and thus obtain high orientation degree, PLA was first chain branched with pentaerythritol <b>polyglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> (PGE). The branching degree as high as 12. 69 mol% can be obtained at 0. 5 wt% PGE content. The complex viscosity, elastic and viscous modulus for chain branched PLA were improved resulting from the enhancement of molecular entanglement, and consequently higher draw ratio can be achieved during the subsequent hot stretching. The stress-induced crystallization of PLA occurred during stretching, and the crystal structure of the oriented PLA {{can be attributed to}} the α′ crystalline form. The tensile strength and modulus of PLA were improved dramatically by drawing. Chain branching and orientation could significantly enhance the blood compatibility of PLA by prolonging clotting time and decreasing hemolysis ratio, protein adsorption and platelet activation. Fibrous structure as well as micro-grooves can be observed for the oriented PLA which were similar to intimal layer of blood vessel, and this bionic structure was considered to be beneficial to decrease the activation and/or adhesion of platelets.

40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on the {{optimization}} of a green process based on the employment of by-products obtained from wood treatments as raw materials for producing flexible polyurethane foams. More specifically, lignin was employed in flexible polyurethane foams in order to partially replace the usual fossil polyols; therefore glycerol (GLY) and glycerin <b>polyglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> (EJ 300) were used as the polyol fraction for lignin liquefaction. Polypropylene glycol triol was used as a chain extender in different ratios with liquefaction solvents, and polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate as an isocyanate fraction. Liquefaction of lignin was performed by microwave irradiation, thus reducing the processing time and energy required compared to present industrial production processes. All the foams were produced in controlled expansion through the adoption of a one-shot' approach, using water as a blowing agent and with an isocyanate index (NCO/OH) of less than 100 to improve the flexibility of the foam. This approach allowed for the substitution of up to 12 % of common petro derived polyol with commercial soda lignin. Finally, the foams were characterized, presenting properties that could be modulated as a function of lignin content, GLY/EJ 300 ratio and isocyanate index. The qualities of the foams were compatible with existing materials used for furniture and for the interiors of car seats and couches...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of the Society of Leather Technologists & Chemists [© SLTC] and is also available at: [URL] epoxide resins have an obvious potential as collagen crosslinkers, in particular as alternatives to the aldehydic-types used. In the work reported here, some conditions for the effective use of epoxides in tanning systems have been studied and identified based on hide powder trials. Few commercial aromatic epoxides are found to be water-soluble, and also have relatively low reaction rates, proving another disadvantage. In a series of screening tests, it has been found that an epoxide with aromatic groups in its backbone, used to treat collagen, produces higher hydrothermal stability than that treated with aliphatic epoxide. However, of the commercial aliphatic epoxide resins examined in this research, the water-soluble, tetra-functional pentaerythritol <b>polyglycidyl</b> <b>ether,</b> (e. g. Denacol EX 411), {{has been shown to be}} suitable for the leather tannage applications. Different types of waterborne epoxide resins, including emulsion and emulsifiable resins based on BDEGA (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether), have been examined but gave disappointing results. It is thought that difficulties here lie in trying to achieve good penetration into the collagen’s fibrous structure, of the particles that make up such emulsions. Late stage tannage, giving a leather product with high shrinkage temperature (Ts = 85 ºC) has been achieved; here the system required catalyst to produce acceptable conversion within 3 hr at 50 ºC. The important factors influencing the effectiveness of a particular tannage, are discussed...|$|E
