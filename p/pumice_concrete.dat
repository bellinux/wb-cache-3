The building materials were for the construction of the Clunie home and studio on Bishop Creek. Aware of Richard’s notable track accomplishments as reported in the local newspaper, and as an athlete of some note himself, Clunie struck up a conversation about sports with the younger Coons. Clunie’s son Kent enrolled that same year in Bishop High School and he and Richard quickly became good friends. Often a visitor in the Clunie home or accompanying Kent in the Sierra backcountry while Robert observed the artist capture on canvas “the beauty and perfection” of nature. They were the first oil paintings Richard had seen close enough to touch. Not long afterward, twenty-year-old Richard purchased, by installment, his first Robert Clunie painting, Monterey Boat Works.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Pumice</b> <b>concrete</b> and {{volcanic}} concrete used in low-rise rural {{residential building}} more and more. In {{order to better}} realize the <b>pumice</b> <b>concrete</b> wall and cinder concrete wall compressive strength, respectively to make three slices of <b>pumice</b> <b>concrete</b> wall and three slices of cinder concrete wall, wall compressive experiment was carried out. The experimental {{results showed that the}} compressive strength of <b>pumice</b> <b>concrete</b> wall and volcanic concrete wall meet the requirements of the bearing capacity of masonry structure. Foreword Because the low-rise building’s strength request of concrete in rural area is not high, we can use local made lightweight aggregate of lightweight aggregate concrete {{to meet the needs of}} the project. The experiment mainly studies that the wall’s compressive strength of scoria concrete and <b>pumice</b> <b>concrete.</b> Each wall made 3 pieces, and the concrete grade is CL 15. The measurements of height×width×thickness is 900 × 900 × 250 (mm). General situation of experiment The preparation of lightweight aggregate concrete According to the Technical Specification for Lightweight Aggregate Concrete[1]（in Chinese ）,the scoria concrete and <b>pumice</b> <b>concrete</b> mix proportion of CL 15 as following: cement: 210 kg/m 3, fly-ash: 90 kg/m 3,water: 150 kg/m 3,fine sand: 380 kg/m 3,pumice/scoria: 570 kg/m 3. The pumice and scoria are from Changbai mountain area. The porosity of pumice and scoria is large,so wetting it before stirring...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Pumice {{is a kind}} {{of natural}} {{lightweight}} aggregate with well-developed porosity and moderate-intensity. Amorphous Si-Al oxide is its main mineral composition. This paper focused on the performance and features of the pumice pozzolan and aggregate firstly. Then a kind of pumice concretes was prepared with the ordinary Portland cement, ordinary sand and strengthened coarse pumice aggregates. And its mechanical properties, durability, insulation and absorbing performance were investigated. The result showed that the compressive strength of <b>pumice</b> <b>concrete</b> was 20 MPa, anti-freezing durability was more than 100 freeze-thaw cycles, electric flux within 6 hours was 1749 C, thermal conductivity coefficient was 0. 318 W / m•K, and the electromagnetic wave absorption was- 5 dB ranging from 8 to 18 GHz. The results indicated that the <b>pumice</b> <b>concrete</b> could be developed as the green and multi-functional concrete materials in the future...|$|E

One example is the Pantheon, where the aggregate of the upper dome region consists of alternating layers of light tuff and <b>pumice,</b> giving the <b>concrete</b> a density of 1,350 kg/m3. The foundation of the structure used travertine as an aggregate, having a much higher density of 2,200 kg/m3.|$|R

40|$|AbstractHigh porosity, low modulus of elasticity, and {{adequate}} strength {{are the main}} requirements of the concrete structures as an impact energy absorber. The development of porous concrete mainly focuses on increasing the porosity rather than the strength due to many advantages can be gained when having higher porosity. Consideration to the environmental problem has been a concern recently, therefore utilization of a waste material as construction materials has been spreading widely. Volcanic pumice as one of waste materials having a high porosity can possibly be utilized as an aggregate replacement material on porous concrete to improve its porosity without much reducing the strength. The purpose {{of this research is}} to evaluate the effect of varying proportion of volcanic pumice as an aggregate replacement (VP/A) and proportion of aggregate to cement (A/C) with a constant water to cement ratio (WCR) to the mechanical properties of volcanic <b>pumice</b> porous <b>concrete,</b> and to those porous concrete with normal aggregate as a control. The result shows that by using volcanic pumice the porosity increases and the modulus of elasticity decreases, even though slightly decreasing in strength is also found. However, it showed a possibility of volcanic <b>pumice</b> porous <b>concrete</b> as impact energy absorber structures. This research is a preliminary study which is expected to be developed for future research related to the dynamic and impact test. In addition, ACI 318 - 08 developed equation (Ec = 0. 043 W 1. 5 f’c 0. 5) can be used to rapidly estimate the modulus of elasticity of porous concrete, where it is necessary, due to experimental difficulties to measure it...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Volcanic Pumice (VP) {{is found}} abundantly {{in various parts}} of the world. In this study, VP from East New Britain {{province}} of Papua New Guinea is investigated and assessed for its industrial utilization. The manufacturing of heat-insulating lightweight concrete, building blocks or composites using VP is of prime importance as an energy saver. The utilization of VP as a heat-insulating material is tested and the results are found to satisfy the ASTM requirements. This fact suggests that VP could be utilized in the manufacture of composite building blocks or concrete. Acoustic performance of composite building floors with lightweight volcanic <b>pumice</b> <b>concrete</b> (VPC) is also described based on the performance of normal concrete (NC) and Code based requirements. The performance of VPC and NC composite floors is judged based on Sound Transmission Class (STC) or Impact Insulation Class (IIC) values. VPC composite floors exhibit better acoustic performance than their NC counterparts and seem to achieve the requirements of Codes of various countries...|$|E
40|$|We numerically {{investigated}} {{moisture transfer}} in buildings made of concrete. We considered {{three types of}} concrete: normal concrete, <b>pumice</b> <b>concrete</b> and cellular concrete. We present {{the results of a}} 1 -D liquid water flow in such materials. We evaluated the moisture distribution in building materials using the Runge-Kutta fourth-and-fifth-order method. The DOPRI 5 code was used as an integrator. The model calculated the resulting moisture content and other moisture-dependent physical parameters. The moisture curves were plotted. The dampness data obtained was utilized for the numerical computation of the coefficient of the capillary conductivity of moisture. Different profiles of this coefficient are represented. Calculations were performed for four different values of the outdoor temperature: - 5 °C, 0 °C, 5 °C and 10 °C. We determined that the curves corresponding to small time intervals of wetting are associated with great amplitudes of the capillary conductivity. The amplitudes of the coefficient of the capillary conductivity decrease as the time interval increases. High outdoor temperatures induce high amplitudes of the coefficient of the capillary conductivity...|$|E
40|$|Concrete is an {{integral}} material in modern infrastructural requirements worldwide. The production of Portland cement is however expensive, energy intensive, and results in globally significant greenhouse gas emissions. Natural pozzolans such as pumice {{can be used as}} a partial replacement for Portland cement in concrete, which can reduce production costs and greenhouse gas emissions, and improve concrete performance. A fluvial pumice deposit which may be suited for use as a natural pozzolan has been identified on the floodplains of the Waikato River. A sample was milled in Germany, and returned to New Zealand in two subsamples. These were tested in concrete, with tests divided into four rounds. The first two rounds established baseline concrete strengths at water/binder (w/b) ratios of 0. 6 and 0. 5, with pumice replacing cement at 5, 10, 15 and 30 %. Round Three assessed the use of high pH mix water (pH= 12. 9), and Round Four assessed the use of a polycarboxylate superplasticiser, both with 10 % pumice. Pumice is known to retard early concrete strength, however through optimisation of mix design, improvements in concrete strength and durability can be made. Indeed, all 28 day concrete strengths in this research were below Ultracem, however half of these achieved or exceeded Ultracem strengths at 91 days. The use of superplasticiser achieved the best 28 day concrete strengths, and dosage optimisation is expected to yield further improvements. Concrete durability was tested at w/b= 0. 5, with 10 % and 30 % pumice. After prolonged curing (231 days), composite concrete showed substantial improvements in electrical resistivity and resistance to chloride attack, most notably with 30 % <b>pumice.</b> <b>Concrete</b> porosity was essentially unaffected. This pumice has shown significant promise as a partial cement replacement. Further mix optimisation is likely to yield greater improvements in concrete strength and durability, and will provide a more economically and environmentally sustainable product for the New Zealand concrete market...|$|E
40|$|Some {{properties}} of lightweight <b>pumice</b> stone <b>concrete</b> (LWPSC) are discussed, {{on account of}} a possible structural use of this material. Then {{the results of an}} experimental investigation are described, in order to show that pumice can really be considered an alternative to common artificial lightweight aggregates, taking into account the performance pointed out by loading tests carried out on structural systems made of LWPSC. Three different kinds of reinforced wall panels were made using LWPSC, lightweight expanded clay concrete and normal weight concrete; then their structural responses under horizontal cyclic and constant vertical forces were compared, above all with reference to lateral stiffness, cracking pattern, ultimate strength and associated plastic deformations. This comparison shows the effectiveness of pumice as an aggregate in manufacturing concrete, at least for this type of structural element. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
500|$|In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due {{to changes}} in the way domes were constructed, {{including}} advances in centering techniques and the use of brick ribbing. The so-called [...] "Temple of Minerva Medica", for example, used brick ribs along with step-rings and lightweight <b>pumice</b> aggregate <b>concrete</b> to form a decagonal dome. The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells. The use of ribs stiffened the structure, allowing domes to be thinner with less massive supporting walls. Windows were often used in these walls and replaced the oculus as a source of light, although buttressing was sometimes necessary to compensate for large openings. The Mausoleum of Santa Costanza has windows beneath the dome and nothing but paired columns beneath that, using a surrounding barrel vault to buttress the structure.|$|R

40|$|Pumice {{has been}} proven as {{substitution}} material aggregate in lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC). However due to its characteristic, pumice has the disadvantages of its excessive water absorption during preparation of concrete mixture which may reduce concrete strength. Therefore in order to eliminate this additional water absorption, this study investigate the effect of coated <b>pumice</b> in <b>concrete</b> mixture to the beam flexural strength and stiffness. This study performed flexural strength test on three types of sample: 1) normal reinforce concrete beam, 2) reinforce concrete beam with uncoated pumice and 3) reinforce concrete beam with coated pumice. The result showed that the lightest weight concrete occurred on the coated pumice specimen, with the reduction of water absorption was 4 % compared to the uncoated pumice specimen. The stiffness of the reinforce beam with coated pumice was lower compared to the uncoated ones, {{this was due to}} the reduction of adhesion action between cement and aggregates. However, the use of coated pumice increased the flexural strength compare to the uncoated ones with 2. 58 %...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{within the}} scope of the number of studies related to the {{efficient}} use of energy increasing day by day, the thermal insulation performance of wall elements used in dwellings was determined using experimental methods.

These materials, widely used in dwelling production in Turkey, were applications of horizontal coring bricks, vertical coring bricks, <b>pumice,</b> gas <b>concrete,</b> block brick and a cavity wall. The interior temperature was kept constant by placing a thermal source inside the built sample construction and the temperatures for different exterior temperatures were measured with a thermocouple and camera from each wall surface.

40|$|Aesthetic and {{environmental}} benefits {{in public and}} private areas can be obtained by replacing common asphalt and impervious paved car parks with turf-based parking lots. A good balance between high water retention, infiltration rate and low susceptibility to compaction of the root zone mix are crucial points in designing such areas. Results reported here refer to a trial carried out from 1996 to 2000 in which eight different growing media (two mixes of crushed gravels + soil, lapillus + soil, two mixes of lapillus + <b>pumice,</b> perforated <b>concrete</b> blocks, plastic paver, sand + peat + Netlon) and two cool season turfgrass mixtures were compared, under car traffic. All growing media tested were suitable for turf parking lot construction, with water holding capacity and wear tolerance being the main difference between treatments. The cheapest growing media were gravels amended with soil, although frequent irrigation was required to maintain turf quality. Mixes of lapillus and pumice had a high available water content (about 5 -fold higher than the sand + peat mix) and a good cation exchange capacity, thus providing conditions that grew good quality turf. Perforated concrete blocks and plastic paver provided the best results on heavily trafficked areas even though they were expensive techniques and did not allow cultivation to manage organic matter accumulation. A combination of plastic pavers in driveways and growing media without rigid elements in car parking spaces was considered a good compromise for construction of turf parking lots...|$|R

This paper aims {{to study the}} behavior and strength resistant of the slabs under flexural loading test. Eleven slab specimen divided into four groups namely BSN, BSL, BSM and BSH were considered. The slabs cross section was 550 x 120 mm with steel reinforcement ratio of 0 % (BSN), 0. 39 % (BSL), 0. 48 % (BSM) and 0. 77 % (BSH). The slabs of 2. 7 m length were supported at 2. 5 m clear span. BSN was used as control specimen. The slabs were tested under two symmetrical point load acting on 1 / 3 clear span. The {{results showed that the}} first cracking load of BSH, BSM and BSL were generally higher than that of BSN. The present of steel reinforcement in the bamboo slab proportionally increased the slab capacities. Normalized ultimate load of BSL, BSM and BSH to BSN were 2. 27, 2. 64 and 4. 04 respectively, where the average ultimate load capacity of BSN was 15. 575 kN. Service load to ultimate load ratio of the slab with steel reinforcement were obtained varies between 0. 37 and 0. 57. Increasing the number of reinforcement ratio, it was found to decrease the slab ductility. The ductility index of BSL, BSM and BSH were 2. 84, 2. 09 and 1. 34 respectively while BSN ductility index was 1. 71.

Test results indicate that the demoulded density of lightweight concrete tends to decrease, inversely proportional to the addition of the volume fraction of pumice aggregate into the mixes. Structural lightweight concrete can be produced when the lightweight concrete mixtures utilized the pumice breccia as coarse aggregate and its volume fraction range between 55 % and 75 % to the total volume of aggregate.

40|$|A novel {{concept in}} {{internal}} curing of High Performance Concrete {{is based on}} dispersing very small, saturated lightweight aggregates (LWA) in the concrete, containing sufficient water to counteract self-desiccation. With this approach, {{the amount of water}} in the LWA can be minimized, thus economizing on the amount of the LWA. In this study, the pore structure of different size fractions of pumice aggregates was characterized by different techniques. The different size fractions show differences in porosity, sorption behavior, and pore-size distribution. The smaller size fractions have lower water absorption, but they release a greater percentage of their absorbed water at the equilibrium relative humidity of practical interest in early-age concrete, above 90 %. Additionally, early-age properties of mortars with different contents of saturated pumice were investigated: a reference mix without pumice and mixes with 4 % and 8 % pumice by volume of mortar. By addition of pumice, mortars with improved strength, enhanced degree of hydration and reduced autogenous shrinkage were obtained. An important obstacle to the application of this kind of <b>pumice</b> for actual <b>concrete</b> production is saturation of the particles, which can be achieved only by immersion in boiling water or by vacuum saturation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Many {{existing}} flat-plate {{buildings are}} seismically deficient and {{pose a threat}} to life safety if subjected to ground motions of even low to moderate intensity. Failure in such structures is typically the result of punching failure at the slab-column connection. Because of this, performance-based retrofit procedures are needed to upgrade these non-ductile buildings. This investigation evaluated the use of lightweight <b>pumice</b> stone <b>concrete</b> (LWPSC) infill panels as a retrofit alternative for flat-plate buildings. Six four-tenth-scale slab-column subassemblies were designed and detailed based on ACI 318 - 63 and current performance-based testing requirements. Except for one bare frame specimen, all the subassemblies were retrofitted with prefabricated LWPSC infill panels and subjected to quasi-static loading conforming to FEMA 273. The geometry of the individual units was governed by weight limitations for handling and erection. Among the variables studied were connections between the slabs and the infill wall and the addition of uniformly distributed perforations (circular and rectangular openings). All of the retrofitted specimens had significant increases in both strength and stiffness over that of the bare frame. The behavior of the specimen with the infill panels not attached to the slabs was similar to that of a masonry wall without any connections to the frame. Although diagonal tension cracks formed within the recessed region, ultimate failure of the infill did not occur. Instead, frame-wall interaction transmitted large concentrated shear forces into the column that eventually contributed to failure of the longitudinal tension splice. The remaining subassemblies all had connections to the slabs and perforations within the wall. Specimens with circular holes experienced uniformly distributed cracking throughout the entire area of the infill wall. The chosen configuration, however, did not sufficiently weaken the wall, and shear failure of the column stopped the test. Because of its ductility and energy dissipation mechanism, the most promising infill panel configuration contained rectangular perforations. Two different reinforcement patterns were tested using rectangular openings. The addition of diagonal reinforcement between openings had the effect of increasing the yield strength of the wall as well as better maintaining post-yield deterioration...|$|R
