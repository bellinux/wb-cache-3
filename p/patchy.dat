5|$|Potty then scolds <b>Patchy</b> for his unsanitary {{environment}} (such as keeping {{ground beef}} {{in an old}} boot, having rats in the kitchen, not washing his hands after using the bathroom and not wearing a hair net). Fed up with Potty's criticisms, <b>Patchy</b> starts throwing patties at Potty, but they keep missing, and one eventually hits Mr. Pirateson, the Owner of Poop Deck. <b>Patchy</b> then tells the viewers to watch {{the rest of the}} SpongeBob episode while he watches Potty get fired, just as Mr. Pirateson forcefully shouts for <b>Patchy</b> to get in his office.|$|E
5|$|Later on, <b>Patchy</b> gets {{hallucinations}} and {{he finds}} a man dressed in a tall SpongeBob outfit (who is actually Tom Kenny, <b>Patchy</b> the Pirate's actor {{and the voice of}} SpongeBob himself), who tells him that he is SpongeBob SquarePants in real-life form. Then, Potty wakes him up after he thought he is back in Encino, which is all just a dream. <b>Patchy</b> begins to eat a sandwich, which Potty brings to him, but he finds mayonnaise on it. He tries to give it to a vulture.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria is a {{cosmopolitan}} species that is roughly similar in size, color, and stature, {{but does not}} have <b>patchy</b> woolly tufts on the cap like C.variegata.|$|E
5|$|Manicaria is a {{monotypic}} genus of pinnate-leaved palms. The sole species, M. saccifera {{is found}} from Belize to Brazil and Peru. Its distribution is <b>patchy,</b> but usually {{more common in}} coastal regions.|$|E
5|$|The story then shifts back to <b>Patchy,</b> {{who wants}} to replay the episode, but his {{difficulty}} with the TV remote causes him to accidentally destroy the tape. The episode ends with the narrator telling the viewers to get lost.|$|E
5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its <b>patchy</b> known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has four}} {{ecological}} provinces: Prairie Parkland, {{in the southwestern}} and western parts of the state; the Eastern Broadleaf Forest (Big Woods) in the southeast, extending in a narrowing strip to the state's northwestern part, where it transitions into Tallgrass Aspen Parkland; and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest, a transitional forest between the northern boreal forest and the broadleaf forests to the south. These northern forests are a vast wilderness of pine and spruce trees mixed with <b>patchy</b> stands of birch and poplar.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recurring}} characters appear {{throughout the}} series, {{such as the}} muscular lifeguard of Goo Lagoon, Larry the Lobster; a pirate specter known as the Flying Dutchman; and retired superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, who are idolized by SpongeBob and Patrick. Most double-length episodes of the show are hosted by a live action pirate named <b>Patchy</b> and his pet parrot Potty, whose segments are presented in a dual narrative with the animated stories.|$|E
5|$|The Bornean {{orangutan}} population {{declined by}} 60% {{in the past}} 60 years and is projected to decline by 82% over 75 years. Its range has become <b>patchy</b> throughout Borneo, being largely extirpated from {{various parts of the}} island, including the southeast. The largest remaining population is found in the forest around the Sabangau River, but this environment is at risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} for auxiliary ranks and pay is scant: even less exists than the <b>patchy</b> {{evidence for}} their legionary counterparts. There {{seems to be}} some consensus, however, that the auxiliary was paid one third of what a legionary received: 300 sesterces a year (400 after the reign of the emperor Commodus). Both auxiliaries and seamen received the viaticum of 300 sesterces, although the various sources differ as to whether auxiliaries and sailors received the retirement bonus known as the honesta missio, or honorable discharge.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{continues}} eastward, serving residential developments, commercial outlets, and John Paul Stevens High School. It intersects with SH151, where development {{once again}} becomes <b>patchy.</b> The most notable development along {{this stretch of}} Potranco is a National Security Agency data center. State maintenance ends at an intersection with FM3487 (Culebra Road), slightly west of Interstate410 (I-410). Potranco Road continues as a city street until Ingram Road.|$|E
5|$|Truth or Square {{was written}} by Luke Brookshier, Nate Cash, Steven Banks, and Paul Tibbitt. Rosario Dawson, LeBron James, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell, Craig Ferguson, Robin Williams, P!nk, and Ricky Gervais guest starred in the special as themselves. Upon release, the special {{attracted}} an estimated 7.7 million viewers, but was met with mixed reviews from critics. Although critics generally spoke positively of the special's main animated segments, most criticized the <b>Patchy</b> the Pirate scenes, which were described as unfunny.|$|E
5|$|After {{six years}} at the Kestrels, the {{defection}} saw Kydd forced {{to adapt to a}} new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon. As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team before the opening of the season, the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other's style. After a tenuous start, however, the pair found form, and were able to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally <b>patchy</b> form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|Chairman Kelvin Thomas {{stepped down}} during the 2012 close season, to be {{replaced}} by owner Ian Lenagan. The 2012–13 season was blighted by injuries and <b>patchy</b> form: after opening the season with three wins and briefly heading the table, United lost their next six games, a pattern of inconsistency that was to continue throughout the season. United finished outside the play-offs for the third consecutive season, but manager Chris Wilder was given a further one-year contract in April 2013. Some Oxford fans were unhappy about the decision to renew Wilder's contract, having pressed for his sacking {{during the second half of}} the 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|Extremely {{sensitive}} to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, Banksia coccinea is an indicator species {{for the presence}} of the disease. There is no known means of eradicating dieback. Much of the Stirling Range National Park is infested, though Fitzgerald River National Park has been largely spared. Applying phosphite to infested areas has been shown to reduce the mortality rates to around 50%. B. coccinea has shown some symptoms of toxicity to application of phosphite, with some <b>patchy</b> necrosis of leaves, but the plant's uptake of the compound is somewhat lower compared with uptake by other shrub species. Unusually, the symptoms {{do not appear to be}} proportional to exposure levels.|$|E
5|$|FM1957 {{begins at}} FM471 near Rio Medina, as a two-lane country road. It then {{traverses}} mostly rural, undeveloped land, {{before reaching the}} Bexar–Medina county line, where it becomes Potranco Road. In far western Bexar County, Potranco Road travels through recently built, <b>patchy,</b> residential developments. Development becomes somewhat heavier after the highway passes State Highway211 (SH211), but FM1957 still displays mostly rural characteristics until the highway reaches Loop1604, at which point it enters the San Antonio city limits. Now five lanes wide, with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane, the legislative definition of FM1957 becomes UR1957; however, Potranco Road remains signed as FM1957.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the spotted}} hyena was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is present in}} all habitats save for the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests {{and the top of}} alpine mountains. Its current distribution is <b>patchy</b> in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E
5|$|Only 18 {{species of}} mammals {{are found in}} Bahrain, animals such as gazelles, desert rabbits and {{hedgehogs}} are common in the wild but the Arabian oryx was hunted to extinction on the island. 25 species of amphibians and reptiles were recorded as well as 21 species of butterflies and 307 species of flora. The marine biotopes are diverse and include extensive sea grass beds and mudflats, <b>patchy</b> coral reefs as well as offshore islands. Sea grass beds are important foraging grounds for some threatened species such as dugongs and the green turtle. In 2003, Bahrain banned the capture of sea cows, marine turtles and dolphins within its territorial waters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Patchy</b> {{records from}} around the world {{indicate}} the bignose shark probably has a circumglobal distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. In the Atlantic Ocean, it occurs from Delaware Bay to Brazil, in the Mediterranean Sea, and off West Africa. In the Indian Ocean, it is known in South Africa and Madagascar, the Red Sea, India, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it has been recorded from China to Australia, around Hawaii, and from the Gulf of California to Ecuador. It is reportedly common off Florida, the Bahamas, and the West Indies, and rare off Brazil and in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans are a genus {{of large}} water birds {{that makes up}} the family Pelecanidae. They are characterised by a long beak and a large throat pouch used for {{catching}} prey and draining water from the scooped up contents before swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, the exceptions being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season. The eight living pelican species have a <b>patchy</b> global distribution, ranging latitudinally from the tropics to the temperate zone, though they are absent from interior South America {{as well as from}} polar regions and the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Ranging {{behavior}} can also exhibit seasonal variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either {{alone or in}} groups of up to six individuals. In the cool, dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when fruit is abundant, subgroups are larger while scarcity is met with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, <b>patchy,</b> and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the social system in order to survive.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) {{is a small}} American sparrow. This {{passerine}} {{is primarily}} found across the Southwestern United States {{and much of the}} interior of Mexico, south to the transverse mountain range, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range. Its distribution is <b>patchy,</b> with populations often being isolated from each other. Twelve subspecies are generally recognized, though up to eighteen have been suggested. This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. The crown is rufous, and the face and supercilium are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black malar streak.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{the type}} species of the genus. By extension, {{it is also the}} type species of Amanita {{subgenus}} Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this subgenus. Amanita subgenus Amanita includes all Amanita with inamyloid spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species which have very <b>patchy</b> universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. Amanita section Amanita consists of A.muscaria and its close relatives, including A.pantherina (the panther cap), A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.xanthocephala. Modern fungal taxonomists have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its very}} <b>patchy</b> range, the copper shark has been scientifically {{described}} several times from different locales. The earliest valid description is presently {{considered to be}} British zoologist Albert Günther's account of Carcharias brachyurus in the 1870 eighth volume of Catalogue of the fishes in the British Museum. The earliest name was {{once thought to be}} Auguste Duméril's 1865 Carcharias remotus, until {{it was found that the}} type specimen associated with that name is actually a blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Thus, this shark was often referred to as C. remotus in older literature. An even earlier name, Richard Owen's 1853 Galeolamna greyi, is of questionable taxonomic status as it was based solely on a set of now-destroyed jaws that may or may not have belonged to a copper shark. Modern authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have had}} great trouble {{determining}} the exact dispositions of the French fleet {{and even more}} trouble assessing the casualties it suffered in the battle. During The Terror then raging in France, bureaucracy broke down and consequently records were <b>patchy</b> or non-existent. The French Navy was no exception and few ship's logs have survived, making an accurate order of battle difficult to discern. Those estimates which are available are often the work of British naval officers at the battle whose accounts frequently differ. Casualties too are almost impossible to establish exactly. French sources published after the battle give a figure of 3,000, but this number does not include those captured, which amounted to 3,500 alone. British estimates aboard captured ships alone are of 1,500 casualties and most historians agree that total French losses during the month-long campaign were around 7,000, {{as opposed to the}} British losses estimated at between 1,100 and 1,500.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the {{managerial}} change from Burley to Freedman, the club announced plans to relocate the club back {{to the site of the}} Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, built on the club's original home, redeveloping it into a 25,000-seater, purpose-built football stadium. The following season started well, with a League Cup run that saw Palace beat Crawley Town, Wigan Athletic and Middlesbrough, and by late October the club were third in the league. A League Cup victory over Southampton set up a quarter final tie away at Manchester United. However league form began to slip and Palace went six games without scoring immediately prior to the match at Old Trafford. Entering the tie as the underdogs, a 35-yard free-kick from Darren Ambrose and an extra time header from Glenn Murray saw Palace win at Old Trafford for the first time in 22 years. The club then announced potential plans to update the image of the club through a new badge. On the pitch, league form remained <b>patchy,</b> and the semi-final of the League Cup ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Cardiff. Palace finished the season in seventeenth place, an improvement on the previous season.|$|E
5|$|Like all lemurs, this genus {{is found}} {{only on the}} island of Madagascar off the southeastern coast of Africa. Confined to the island's {{seasonal}} eastern tropical rainforests, it is uncommon to rare throughout its range, which historically ran from the Masoala Peninsula in the northeast to the Mananara River in the south. Today, the black-and-white ruffed lemur has a much larger range than the red ruffed lemur, although it is very <b>patchy,</b> extending from slightly northwest of Maroantsetra, on Antongil Bay, in the north down the coast to the Mananara River near Vangaindrano in the south. Additionally, a concentrated population of black-and-white ruffed lemurs, of the subspecies Varecia variegata subcincta, can also be found on the island reserve of Nosy Mangabe in Antongil Bay. It is suspected that this population was introduced to the island in the 1930s. The red ruffed lemur, on the other hand, has a very restricted range on the Masoala Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is <b>patchy</b> and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species richness peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.|$|E
5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their <b>patchy</b> food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|Six {{sets were}} {{constructed}} on which 60 pounds of baking soda {{were used as}} snow (the crew tried to use real snow but it melted), 42 pounds of glitter were used to cover the background, and 20 boxes of breakfast cereal were used to cover the coral rocks. Over 38 different types of foam were {{used to make the}} set pieces and the characters' bodies and heads. To render SpongeBob's pineapple house, palm fronds from a tree in a school yard were used. Other props and materials used were an actual starfish, three Christmas trees (for the <b>Patchy</b> the Pirate's Winter Wonderland scenes), six boxes of puff cereal (to create the fruitcake inside SpongeBob's mouth), 21 pounds of googly eyes (for rivets, texture pieces, knobs, etc.), 22 pounds of woodchips (to create Sandy's treedome floor), and 24 bunches of craft flowers (to create the parade float).|$|E
5|$|The diet of the golden-crowned sifaka {{consists}} {{of a wide variety}} of plants—as many as 80species—whose availability varies based on the season. It is a seed predator, making seeds a year-round staple in its diet when available. The golden-crowned sifaka also eats unripe fruits, flowers, and leaves. One study showed a diet composition of 37%unripe fruit and seeds, 22%immature leaves, 17%mature leaves, 13%flowers, and 9%fruit pulp. Individuals have also been observed consuming tree bark during the dry season. In general, approximately 60% of its diet {{consists of}} unripe fruits and seed, mainly from leguminous pods, and less than 50% consists of leaves. At Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree (Poupartia caffra) and on mango trees. Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available. Studies have also shown that when food distribution is <b>patchy,</b> feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations, suggesting that it is important for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is <b>patchy,</b> with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is <b>patchy,</b> for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, {{which has led to}} other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, {{it is important to have}} continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} and the marbled newt {{are the only}} species in the genus with a considerable range overlap (in western France). In that area, they have <b>patchy,</b> mosaic-like distributions and in general prefer different habitats. When they do occur in the same breeding ponds, they can form hybrids, which have intermediate characteristics. Individuals resulting from the cross of a crested newt male with a marbled newt female had mistakenly been described as distinct species Triton blasii de l'Isle 1862, and the reverse hybrids as Triton trouessarti Peracca 1886. The first type is much rarer due to increased mortality of the larvae and consists only of males, while in the second, males have lower survival rates than females. Overall, viability is reduced in these hybrids and they rarely backcross with their parent species. Hybrids made up 3–7% of the adult populations in different studies.|$|E
5|$|Urbanization {{can result}} in the {{fragmentation}} of contiguous natural landscapes into <b>patchy</b> habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, {{which can lead to}} reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose's {{finances}} {{entered the}} second half of the century in poor shape, and considerably worse than the period between 1930 and 1931, slipping relative to other colleges from 3rd to 8th. But they were improved during Last's tenure, along with undergraduate admissions; the college showed a surplus in 1952–53, and income in 1957 (£104,000) was double what it had been in 1938. Pay for fellows was still poor, and they were small in number compared to other colleges. There was a sizeable entertainment budget, however, something which, combined with the long hours, have contributed to short lifespans. Only in 1987 did a sitting fellow reach retirement age. Last resigned as Principal in 1956, dying shortly after. Turnover was considerable, although some fellows stayed on: Maurice Platnauer became Principal in 1956, and retired in 1960; he was replaced by Sir Noel Hall. Hall's tenure was troubled, not externally, but rather from Hall's <b>patchy</b> knowledge of the college and staff; his selection, faute de mieux, was sometimes questioned, although he remained well-liked. However, the college, which had thus far stayed assured, found itself in a changing environment. Herbert Hart, however, Principal between 1973 and 1978, was the first to be elected from outside Brasenose. Lord Windlesham, made principal in 1989, was the first to hold Cabinet Office.|$|E
