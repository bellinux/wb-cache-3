5|$|At {{a bend in}} the highway, {{there is}} a small <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> development, with a few houses near the highway. At the {{intersection}} with Township Road 529, State Route 664 enters Gallagher Township. Eventually, the large <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> forests in the surroundings come towards a clearing, where the highway intersects with Old Dirt Road. After crossing a stream, State Route 664 gains the moniker of the Coudersport Pike. The highway passes a small <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> development, reaching another clearing in the forest. After entering another forest, State Route 664 ends at an intersection with State Route 44 in the community of Haneyville.|$|E

30|$|Similar {{patterns}} emerged at the land-tenure {{level in}} each of the counties in 1992. Within Cimarron County, both private lands and State Trust Lands were dominated by <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> herbaceous and cultivated lands. This stood in distinct contrast to the Union County private and State Trust lands, which consisted of numerous, albeit relatively small, <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> woody vegetation interspersed among larger <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> herbaceous land cover (Fig  3, Table  3). Within each state’s federal lands, though, relatively large <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> herbaceous vegetation dominated.|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} {{dispersal}} indicate that decisions to immigrate are patch-type dependent; yet theoretical models usually ignore this fact. Here, we investigate {{the evolution of}} patch-type dependent immigration of a population inhabiting and dispersing in a heterogeneous landscape, which is structured by <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> low and high reward. We model the decision to immigrate in detail from a mechanistic underpinning. With the methods of adaptive dynamics, we derive both analytical and numerical results {{for the evolution of}} immigration when life-history traits are patch-type dependent. The model exhibits evolutionary branching in a wide parameter range and the subsequent coevolution can lead to a stable coexistence of a generalist, settling in <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> any type, and a specialist that only immigrates into <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> high reward. We find that individuals always settle in the <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> high reward, in which survival until maturation, relative fecundity and emigration probability are high. We investigate how the probability to immigrate into <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> low reward changes with model parameters. For example, we show that immigration into <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> low reward increases when the emigration probability in these patches increases. Further, immigration into <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> low reward decreases when the <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> high reward become less safe during the dispersal season. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|A {{circular}} <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> hair on {{the central}} pad of their hind paws marks plantar glands that give off a distinctive odor.

50|$|The {{surficial}} geology along Rattlesnake Creek {{near its}} mouth mainly consists of alluvium. However, some <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift and alluvial fan are present, as are larger areas of a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till and bedrock consisting of conglomerate, sandstone, and shale. Further upstream, the surficial geology immediately {{adjacent to the}} creek consists of alluvium, but it eventually switches to Wisconsinan Till, which also makes {{up most of the}} surficial geology elsewhere in the watershed. However, there are a few large <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> bedrock and a few small <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift. Additionally, there are several <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> wetlands and peat bogs, especially near the headwaters.|$|R
5|$|Like many zoo animals, hippos were {{traditionally}} {{displayed in}} concrete exhibits. In {{the case of}} hippos, they usually had {{a pool of water}} and <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> grass.

5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} martins are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground.

The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} by the 2015 Group {{takeover of the}} club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms, though the Animo et Fide motto was removed, along with a <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> green {{at the base of}} the badge; the flag of Cheshire, featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and Lancashire, owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010–11 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.|$|E

5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder {{arrives in}} the fields, he {{inadvertently}} drives over a <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores. Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate.

Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier, covered in the yellow secretion, being digested alive.|$|E
