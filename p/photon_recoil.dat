40|$|We {{report on}} an {{original}} and simple {{formulation of the}} phase shift in N-light-pulse atom interferometers. We consider atomic interferometers based on two-photon transitions (Raman transitions or Bragg pulses). Starting from the exact analytical phase shift formula obtained from the atom optics ABCD formalism, we use a power series expansion in time {{of the position of}} the atomic wave packet with respect to the initial condition. The result of this expansion leads to a formulation of the interferometer phase shift where the leading coefficient in the phase terms up to T^k dependences (k >= 0) in the time separation T between pulses, can be simply expressed in terms of a product between a Vandermonde matrix, and a vector characterizing the two-photon pulse sequence of the interferometer. This simple coefficient dependence of the phase shift reflects very well the atom interferometer's sensitivity to a specific inertial field in the presence of multiple gravito-inertial effects. Consequently,we show that this formulation is well suited when looking for selective atomic sensors of accelerations, rotations, or <b>photon</b> <b>recoil</b> only, which can be obtained by simply zeroing some specific coefficients.

Equilibrium temperatures range from detuning-independent values scaled by the power-broadened transition width, to detuning-dependent minima well below the Doppler limit, to absolute minima below the single-photon recoil limit. For positive detuning, the cloud divides into discrete momentum packets resembling lattice points on a face-centered-cubic crystal.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the question whether}} Michelson type interferometry is possible if {{the role of the}} beam splitter is played by a spontaneous process. This question arises from an inspection of trajectories of atoms bouncing inelastically from an evanescent-wave (EW) mirror. Each final velocity can be reached via two possible paths, with a spontaneous Raman transition occurring either during the ingoing or the outgoing part of the trajectory. At first sight, one might expect that the spontaneous character of the Raman transfer would destroy the coherence and thus the interference. We investigated this problem by numerically solving the Schrödinger equation and applying a Monte-Carlo wave-function approach.

By operating the mirror on an open transition, we have also observed atoms that bounce inelastically due to a spontaneous Raman transition. The observed distributions consist of a dense peak at the minimum velocity and a long tail of faster atoms, showing that the transition is a stochastic process with a strong preference to occur near the turning point of the bounce.

40|$|The linear {{momentum}} and angular momentum of virtual photons of quantum vacuum fluctuations can induce the Casimir {{force and the}} Casimir torque, respectively. While the Casimir force has been measured extensively, the Casimir torque has not been observed experimentally though it was predicted over forty years ago. Here we propose to detect the Casimir torque with an optically levitated nanorod near a birefringent plate in vacuum. The axis of the nanorod tends to align with the polarization direction of the linearly polarized optical tweezer. When its axis is not parallel or perpendicular to the optical axis of the birefringent crystal, it will experience a Casimir torque that shifts its orientation slightly. We calculate the Casimir torque and Casimir force acting on a levitated nanorod near a birefringent crystal. We also investigate the effects of thermal noise and <b>photon</b> <b>recoils</b> on the torque and force detection.

40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} a novel laser cooling mechanism applicable to particles with narrow-linewidth optical transitions. By sweeping {{the frequency of}} counter-propagating laser beams in a sawtooth manner, we cause adiabatic transfer {{back and forth between}} the ground state and a long-lived optically excited state. The time-ordering of these adiabatic transfers is determined by Doppler shifts, which ensures that the associated <b>photon</b> <b>recoils</b> are in the opposite direction to the particle's motion. This ultimately leads to a robust cooling mechanism capable of exerting large forces via a weak transition and with reduced reliance on spontaneous emission. We present a simple intuitive model for the resulting frictional force, and directly demonstrate its efficacy for increasing the total phase-space density of an atomic ensemble. We rely on both simulation and experimental studies using the 7. 5 ~kHz linewidth $^ 1 $S$_ 0 $ to $^ 3 $P$_ 1 $ transition in $^{ 88 }$Sr. The reduced reliance on spontaneous emission may allow this adiabatic sweep method to be a useful tool for cooling particles that lack closed cycling transitions, such as molecules.
