25|$|The presses {{first used}} {{were of the}} {{ordinary}} letterpress type, the engraved plate being fixed {{in the place of}} the type. In later improvements the well-known cylinder press was employed; the plate was inked mechanically and cleaned off by passing under a sharp blade of steel; and the cloth, instead of being laid on the plate, was passed round the <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The plate was raised into frictional contact with the cylinder and in passing under it transferred its ink to the cloth.|$|E
25|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} roller-printing machine {{consists of a}} strong cast iron cylinder mounted in adjustable bearings capable of sliding up and down slots in {{the sides of the}} rigid iron framework. Beneath this cylinder the engraved copper roller rests in stationary bearings and is supplied with colour from a wooden roller that revolves in a colour-box below it. The copper roller is mounted on a stout steel axle, at one end of which a cogwheel is fixed to gear with the driving wheel of the machine, and at the other end a smaller cogwheel to drive the colour-furnishing roller. The cast iron <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> is wrapped with several thicknesses of a special material made of wool and cotton lapping, the object of which is to provide the elasticity necessary to enable it to properly force the cloth to be printed into the lines of engraving.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{machines}} printing {{from two}} to sixteen colours are precisely similar in principle to the above, but differ somewhat in detail and are naturally more complex and difficult to operate. In a twelve-colour machine, for example, twelve copper rollers, each carrying one portion of the design, are arranged round a central <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder,</b> or bowl, common to all, and each roller is driven by a common driving wheel, called the crown wheel, actuated, in most cases, by its own steam-engine or motor. Another {{difference is that the}} adjustment of pressure is transferred from the cylinder to the rollers which works in specially constructed bearings capable of the following movements: (1) Of being screwed up bodily until the rollers are lightly pressed against the central bowl; (2) of being moved to and fro sideways so that the rollers may he laterally adjusted; and (3) of being moved up or down for the purpose of adjusting the rollers in vertical direction. Notwithstanding the great latitude of movement thus provided each roller is furnished with a box-wheel, which serves the double purpose of connecting or gearing it to the driving wheel, and of affording a fine adjustment. Each roller is further furnished with its own colour-box and doctors.|$|E

50|$|Number 7 {{was built}} in 1886 at Swindon as a tandem {{compound}} 2-4-0 with 7 ft coupled wheels and outside frames. The 23 in diameter low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> were {{in front of the}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders,</b> the pistons being carried on the same piston rod. Valves for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> were below, and those for the high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> above the cylinders. One set of valve gear drove each pair of valve spindles. This setup proved difficult to access for maintenance, and the locomotive was relegated to minor routes. It was broken up in 1890. The wheel centres were used in building No. 7 of the Armstrong class.|$|R
50|$|La France was visibly not a GWR engine, {{although}} {{fitted with}} a Swindon chimney and paired with a standard tender, as immediately recognisable from firebox and the cab. Initially the locomotive was painted black, looking more LNWR than GWR, but she was repainted in 1905 into the standard GWR green livery. In contrast to previous GWR practice, La France had two high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> fitted between the frames, and two low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> outside. The high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> drove the front driving wheels while the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> drove the rear driving wheels. Also notable was the external steam pipe mounted {{just in front of}} the dome, and looking rather similar in appearance to a top feed.|$|R

50|$|On {{succeeding}} Dean, the GWR board authorised Churchward {{to purchase}} three French de Glehn-du Bousquet four-cylinder compound locomotives, {{in order to}} evaluate the benefits of compounding. Similar to the Paris-Orleans Railway's 3001 class and built by Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques, the first locomotive no.102 La France was delivered in 1903, with Nos. 103 and 104 purchased in 1905.

50|$|They were three-cylinder {{compound}} locomotives: the two outside {{high pressure}} cylinders drove the trailing drivers via Howe-Stephenson valve gear, the one inside low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> drive the leading drivers via a slip eccentric.

50|$|Woolstenhulme & Rye {{engines are}} said to be {{conservative}} in design, and although Gurr & Hunt claim that {{there was no evidence that}} the company had ever used Corliss valves, in his Black Book engine list, Arthur Roberts documents their use in Parkfield Mill. This engine was a 1,200-hp cross-compound engine. It had a 20 in HP (high <b>pressure)</b> <b>cylinder,</b> 40 in LP (low <b>pressure)</b> <b>cylinder,</b> with a 6 ft stroke. It was steamed at 140 psi. The 18 ft flywheel ran at 52 rpm. Transmission was by a geared drive. There were Corliss valves on the HP cylinder and slide valves on the LP, in fact a classic Lancashire configuration. The air pump was driven by a bell crank from the LP tail rod.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of the diver's centre of gravity {{is determined by the}} distribution of weight, which is in most cases determined by the actual equipment in use. Trim of the centre of gravity is usually achieved by selection of cylinder material and positioning of main ballast weights and trim weights. Aluminium cylinders are generally less negatively buoyant than steel cylinders of equivalent capacity, and high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> more negative than low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> of the same material.|$|R
50|$|The center set of {{cylinders}} received high-pressure steam. The exhaust {{from these}} was fed to the two other sets of cylinders, which were valved for low <b>pressure.</b> The right <b>cylinder</b> exhausted into the front set of low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and the left into the rear set; this is also why the high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> have the same diameter as the low pressure ones, whereas most mallet locomotives have much smaller high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The front set exhausted through the smokebox and the rear set exhausted first through a feedwater heater in the tender {{and then to the}} open air through a large pipe, which {{can be seen in the}} photo. Since only half of the exhaust steam exited through the smokebox, firebox draft (and thus boiler heating) was poor. Although the boiler was large (in line with contemporary two-cylinder and four-cylinder practice), six large cylinders demanded more steam than even such a boiler could supply.|$|R

50|$|The boiler was {{the largest}} of a German steam engine {{at the time the}} XX HV was brought into service and had {{exceptionally}} long heating tubes of 5.8 m in length. The grate was of almost square shape and had to be arranged above the frame due to its size. The boiler was used in the Saxon XVIII H as well, with only minor adjustments to decrease its weight which resulted in a heating area that was smaller by 10 m2. The boiler was supplied with water through two feedwater pumps that were later replaced by one injector and a Knorr feed pump with preheater. The steam engine was configured as a four-cylinder compound. The high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> sloped steeply between the frame sides, the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> were located in the usual, horizontal position outside the frame. Both pairs of cylinders drove the second coupled axle. To control the supply to the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> there was a normal Walschaerts valve gear which also controlled the inside cylinders via pendulum levers. A special feature was the Lindner starting cock, already well-known on two-cylinder compounds, which could supply additional live steam to the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> when working at over 60%.|$|R
