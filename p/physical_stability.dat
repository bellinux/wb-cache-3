25|$|The {{aluminum}} oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the metallic aluminum against aggressive chemical reactions from the electrolyte. However, the converted layer of {{aluminum oxide}} {{is usually not}} homogeneous. It forms a complex multilayer structured laminate of amorphous, crystalline and porous crystalline aluminum oxide mostly covered with small residual parts of unconverted aluminum hydroxide. For this reason, {{in the formation of}} the anode foil, the oxide film is structured by a special chemical treatment so that either an amorphous oxide or a crystalline oxide is formed. The amorphous oxide variety yields higher mechanical and <b>physical</b> <b>stability</b> and fewer defects, thus increasing the long term stability and lowering the leakage current.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that {{bevirimat}} does not inhibit the cytochrome P450 system or interact with the human P-glycoprotein. Unformulated bevirimat is not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood. Some of the less desirable properties of unformulated bevirimat and its salts include: inadequate bioavailability, poor solubility of the pharmaceutical composition in gastric fluid, insufficient dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, below standard long term safety profile for oral dosage forms, below standard long term chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>stability</b> of the final dosage form, tendency for conversion to metastable forms, lengthy dissolution times for oral dosage forms, and precipitation in gastric or intestinal fluids. Some pharmaceutical compositions of formulated bevirimat have shown to have better properties over unformulated bevirimat. Some of these properties include: improved bioavailability, improved solubility of the composition in gastric fluid, improved dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, improved safety for oral dosage forms, improved chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>stability</b> of the oral dosage form, decreased conversion to metastable forms, and decreased rate of precipitation in gastric fluid. Bevirimat was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with detectable concentrations present in the plasma within 15 minutes after administration and peak plasma concentrations were achieved approximately one to three hours after administration. The plasma had a mean plasma elimination half-life ranging from 58 to 80 hours. This long half-life of bevirimat supports once-daily dosing. Elimination of bevirimat is primarily via hepatobiliary routes, with renal elimination counting for less than 1% of the dose.|$|E
25|$|Prang et al. (2006) {{assessed}} {{the capacity of}} ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the sodium alginate layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels. After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This is the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are need to study the long-term <b>physical</b> <b>stability</b> of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, {{in addition to being}} able to provide long-term support the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future studies will also need to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target in vivo after a spinal cord injury.|$|E

30|$|Many {{different}} reversible covalent chemistries {{have now}} been developed that allow {{for the construction of}} DCLs in aqueous solution. The most popular of these are hydrazone and disulfide chemistry [1]. However, both processes have equilibration times that are typically in the range of 2 - 5 days and sometimes even several weeks [55]. This makes these chemistries less applicable to bilayer systems, many of which have limited <b>physical</b> <b>stabilities.</b> For example, unilamellar vesicles prepared from phospholipids are often only stable for approximately 24 hours. Thus, alternative reversible chemistries are required that allow equilibrium to be reached within this timeframe and under relatively dilute conditions. Literature reports suggest that the equilibration of thioesters in bulk aqueous solution is relatively fast [33, 44, 49 – 54], which led us to investigate the potential of this reaction in bilayer vesicle systems. As a model system we chose unilamellar vesicles made from egg phosphatidyl choline.|$|R
30|$|Liposome is a {{promising}} carrier system for delivering bioactive molecules. However, the successful delivery of pH-sensitive molecules is still {{limited by the}} intrinsic instability of payloads in physiological environment. Herein, we developed a special liposome system that possesses an acidic micro-environment in the internal aqueous chamber to improve the chemical stability of pH-sensitive payloads. Curcumin-loaded liposomes (Cur-LPs) with varied internal pH values (pH  2.5, 5.0, or 7.4) were prepared. These Cur-LPs have similar particle size of 300  nm, comparable <b>physical</b> <b>stabilities</b> and analogous in vitro release profiles. Interestingly, the chemical stability of liposomal curcumin in 50 % fetal bovine serum and its anticancer efficacy in vitro are both micro-environmental pH-dependent (Cur-LP- 2.5  > Cur-LP- 5.0  > Cur-LP- 7.4). This serum stability still has space to be further enhanced to improve the applicability of Cur-LP. In conclusion, creating an acidic micro-environment in the internal chamber of liposome is feasible and efficient to improve the chemical stability of pH-sensitive payloads.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} improve {{immobilization}} process which is crucial for creating of high-performance biosensors, various techniques are used. In recent time, very often different types of nanoparticles become more popular for biosensor creation. One of these perspective nanomaterials is zeolite. Zeolites are hydrated microporous crystalline minerals. They are composed mainly of silicon, aluminum and oxygen. The modification of crystal structures {{makes it possible to}} obtain zeolites with different properties [1, 2]. The regular microporous structure of the zeolite guarantees an improvement of the chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the immobilized agent, whereas the porosity of the zeolite keeps open the access of the guest molecules or ions to the ambient. Furthermore, zeolites are able to exchange ions with some compounds. An important characteristic of zeolites is the Si/Al ratio. The increase of the Si/Al ratio results in higher thermal stability and hydrophobicity as in silicalite. Silicalite {{is one of the most}} studied zeolites that has both hydrophobic and organophilic selectivities. Also, silicalite has high thermal and chemical stabilities and high adsorption properties [3, 4].|$|R

The solubility and dissolution of the spherical agglomerates was improved compared with pure piroxicam and recrystallized sample. In stability test, the release profile of the spherical agglomeration was almost unchanged as compared with the freshly prepared spherical agglomeration stored at 20 °C and 45 % relative humidity for 90 days.
