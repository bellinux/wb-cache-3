500|$|In {{addition}} to the announced mid-life update of the existing Class 373 fleet, Eurostar in 2009 reportedly entered <b>prequalification</b> bids for eight new trainsets to be purchased. Any new trains would need to meet the same safety rules governing passage through the Channel Tunnel as the existing Class 373 fleet. The replacement to the Class 373 trains has been decided jointly between the French Transport Ministry and the UK Department for Transport. [...] The new trains will be equipped {{to use the new}} ERTMS in-cab signalling system, due to be fitted to High Speed 1 around 2040.|$|E

5000|$|Effective {{contractor}} management relies {{first on}} a standardized <b>prequalification</b> form (PQF). [...] A quality <b>prequalification</b> form will also allow for customized functionality, as needed.

50|$|Years ago public {{purchasing}} officials began applying <b>prequalification</b> and short-listing of pre-selected contractors for {{bidding on}} public procurement contracts.

50|$|So far, the {{connection}} of the plants is carried out relying on manufacturer-specific information and communication standards while using different data models. An open industrial standard can help facilitate and accelerate {{the connection}} and <b>prequalification</b> process for decentralized power plants.|$|E
50|$|Once the <b>prequalification</b> form {{has been}} filled out, the {{contractor}} must be monitored for compliance, {{this is a}} significant part of contractor management.

5000|$|The <b>prequalification</b> form is then {{reviewed}} for OSHA logs [...] and Experience Modification Ratings (EMR) {{to unearth}} any inconsistencies and {{to verify the}} contractor license status. Finally, references are contacted to provide actual work history and experience to further certify that the contractor is prequalified for performing work at that location.|$|E
50|$|These {{questions}} are then used as indicators {{to determine the}} contractor’s level of performance. The audit ensures that the contractor has prepared for, and is enforcing, safety guidelines in their everyday practices. Essentially, the audit provides a third-party confirmation that the information supplied in the <b>prequalification</b> form is both accurate and up-to-date.|$|E
50|$|These {{ratings and}} {{processes}} now {{make the whole}} issue of bonding and surety, (that has been around since the late 19th century to guarantee of performance and paying large premiums), obsolete and redundant since the public officials have already reduced risks and are paying premiums associated with reducing competition by using the <b>prequalification</b> process and rating systems.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, the {{sporadic}} {{occurrence of}} mismanagement or misuse {{of these programs}} by either public officials or private enterprises {{should not be used}} to undermine their efficacy to promote economic development as a whole.

50|$|Colombian {{construction}} {{companies that were}} active in the water sector were awarded PPP contracts following tenders in which only local investors participated. In all these cases, governments chose to ease <b>prequalification</b> criteria to increase competition, resorting to various mechanisms to ensure the winning bidder {{would be able to}} operate the water utility. In Colombia, the winning bidders contracted experienced technical staff (often former managers and engineers from public utilities). Between 2001 and 2004, Colombian investors won almost all the PPP contracts awarded in that country under the PME program.|$|E

50|$|A public body’s {{experience}} with an incentive program can impact its approach toward incentive arrangements. The prior {{experience with}} an insolvent company {{enrolled in a}} program can prompt a public body to adopt rigorous <b>prequalification</b> criteria {{as part of its}} incentive screening process. Likewise, the failure of a recipient to meet public body’s expectations about a project (e.g., employment) can prompt it to impose strict project commitments on new incentive recipients. Conversely, an incentive program with a successful track record of business expansion or retention can encourage the expansion of the program or the adoption of new incentive programs.|$|E
50|$|In January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Prospect Mortgage {{to pay a}} $3.5 million {{fine for}} {{improper}} mortgage referrals. Prospect had agreements with over 100 real estate brokers to deliver payments for referrals of mortgage business.
