50|$|The Wall - During the {{demolition}} challenge, {{two of the}} bedroom's walls were also taken down. In its place {{on one of them}} will be a faux log finish. To do this, foam must be applied onto the wall before the faux wall pieces (roughly-hewn lumber) are attached. Then, <b>parging</b> must be used to fill the gaps between the wall pieces. Neither Eric nor Brian P had managed to buy the washers needed to attach the foam to the wall (Brian P also lacked screws); they make do with construction adhesive instead. At the start of Day 3, Brian M threatens to leave rehab over {{the fact that he was}} not taught the use of a table saw or chop saw, even though neither are necessary for the project, and are not used by anyone else. The shouting match between Brian M and Andrew gets so intense Eric (working within earshot) forces them both to shut up; telling them that they were being a distraction. Eric, though, passes this challenge despite the distraction. Angie fails due to having assembled her log pieces vertically (leaving nothing to support the <b>parging,</b> upon that realization she opts to use spray foam insulation instead), as does Johnnie. The Brians both fail due to having large gaps in their log pieces (Brian M also getting the cement-based <b>parging</b> all over his wood), so much so that <b>parging</b> will never cover the foam adequately.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} is a one-story frame building on a raised, <b>parged,</b> and scored concrete basement, separated from the first floor by a wooden water table. It is sided in rough stucco with small bits of inlaid glass. The gabled roof is shingled in asphalt.|$|R
50|$|The name Kozice {{has been}} {{explained}} as referring to Kozice Ridge {{south of the}} settlement, imagined {{to look like a}} goat (from Slovene koza 'goat'). The name Parga has been explained as derived from Slovene prga 'that which rakes (up)'. However, compare Gottscheerish parc, <b>parge</b> 'hill, mountain'.|$|E
50|$|<b>Parge</b> (Pāji) is {{the only}} female member of the Fear Quartet.

50|$|Gelbman's workers {{assembled}} them on {{the site}} by bolting the arms to a partial steel frame on the interior so the exterior would remain flush and smooth after being sealed with a mortar <b>parge</b> and surfaced with stucco. The arms left a space inside for insulation, usually vermiculite, another new material at the time, that would go behind the plywood panels used for the walls. To build floors, the panels were just laid horizontally on the summer beams, with the floor's surface material (asphalt on the first story, cork originally upstairs) then laid on top, and {{the space between the}} arms available for infrastructure piping. Once the exterior was done, the openings for the doors and windows were cut and then they were installed.|$|E
50|$|The {{house itself}} is a 21 ft cubical steel frame {{structure}} on a cinder block foundation faced in prefabricated 2 by 10 ft concrete panels with stucco <b>parging</b> topped by a bowl-shaped roof centered on a drain. At the main entrance on the curved eastern corner, there is an entrance portico.|$|R
50|$|The building, now {{a private}} home, {{was added to}} the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

To the west a modern shed-roofed wing on block piers projects.|$|R
50|$|<b>Parging</b> (or pargeting) {{is usually}} applied with a trowel and {{pressed into the}} {{existing}} surface. The intent {{is to create a}} contiguous surface by filling surface air voids and bugholes (eliminating bughole-induced outgassing), to level a surface with extreme rugosity, or to prep a surface for topcoating with a high-performance protective coating.|$|R
5000|$|The church {{consists}} of a gothic style choirtower from the 15th century at its eastern end, with a classical style nave from the 18th century at its western end. Originally, the upper portion of the tower employed half-timbered construction, but was rebuilt with stone in 1830 due to severe structural deterioration. The southern face of the choirtower features a mechanical clock, that was added in the 20th century. In terms of materials, the building is constructed of solid masonry with uncoursed random rubble walls. The stone of the tower is exposed, while the nave is finished with a <b>parge</b> coat. The tower has a pyramidal hipped roof topped with a rooster shaped weather vane, while the nave has a combination of gable and hipped roofs, all with squared terra cotta tiles.|$|E

40|$|An {{operational}} orthorectification {{solution in}} support of the combined geometric and radiometric process- ing of currently available imaging spectrometry data is presented. The described parametric geocoding procedure (<b>PARGE)</b> strictly considers the aircraft and terrain geometry parameters and uses a forward transformation algorithm to create orthorectified imaging spectrometry cubes. The implementation princi- ples, the auxiliary data calibration strategies, and the workflow of the currently applied processor are dis- cussed. The major error sources of the approach are identified, and possibilities are shown how to make the most out of the available auxiliary data (INS/GPS) parameters. Results on HyMap and AVIRIS imaging spectrometry data show an absolute accuracy in the range of 1 - 3 pixels for this kind of imagery. The com- bination of <b>PARGE</b> with an atmospheric correction procedure is shown in part 2 to this paper. The depicted geo-atmospheric workflow is proposed as standard processing approach for available and future imaging spectrometry data...|$|E

40|$|A {{combined}} geometric and radiometric {{processing chain}} for hyperspectral data is presented. This paper describes the ortho-rectification {{solution for the}} geometric {{part of the whole}} problem. A parametric geocoding approach (<b>PARGE)</b> has been chosen. The geometrical model strictly considers all navigational parameters engaging a forward transformation methodology. For the implementation, a number of auxiliary data calibration and tuning possibilities are shown together with the work flow of the currently applied processor. Results of the procedure for HyMap and AVIRIS hyperspectral imagery are analyzed with respect to their absolute accuracy and coregistration errors. The geocoding procedure will be used in standard preprocessing chains in combination with the atmospheric correction procedure ATCOR 4 for current and future hyperspectral instruments. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of Dirichlet and Neumann {{boundary}} control of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on the domain [0, 1]. First we note that, while the uncontrolled Dirichlet problem is asymptotically stable when an "anti-di#usion" parameter is small, and unstable when it is large (we determine the critical value of the parameter), the uncontrolled Neumann problem is never asymptotically stable. We develop a Neumann feedback law that guarantees L 2 -global exponential stability and H 2 -global asymptotic stability for small values of the anti-di#usion parameter. The more interesting problem of boundary stabilization when the anti-di#usion parameter is <b>parge</b> remains open. Our proof of global existence and uniqueness of solutions of the closed-loop system involves construction of a Green function and application of the Banach contraction mapping principle.

40|$|Nearly all current imaging {{spectroscopy}} data are obtained by scanning airborne systems. The stability of such systems is always {{worse than that}} of spaceborne platforms. Thus, geometric distortions occur due to variations of the flightpath {{as well as of}} the attitude (given by roll, pitch and heading angles) of the plane. These distortions cannot be corrected simply by ground control point based traditional georeferencing procedures since the movements cannot be approximated satisfactorily by polynomial transformations of the image. A pixel by pixel calculation has to be performed instead, to account for the position and attitude of the plane during the scanning process. A georeferencing procedure is described which is based on a parametric approach and theoretically allows sub-pixel accuracy even in steep terrain. The current work resulted in an new algorithm and application for parametric geocoding (<b>PARGE).</b> A ground control point based procedure has been developed to recalibrate the offsets of the attitude data since they usually are given as relative angles. It exactly reconstructs the scanning geometry for each image pixel using position, attitude, and terrain elevation data. The procedure is tested on AVIRIS and on DAIS data and compared to digital topographic data. The geocoding results are of reliable accuracies of down to 1 - 2 pixels for both data sets...|$|E
