Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. <b>Printed</b> <b>circuits</b> and RFID antennas are made with silver paints, Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components.|$|E

25|$|Arduengo's {{work with}} DuPont also {{involved}} {{a number of}} applied projects including the flexible polyimide film, Kapton-ZT, that is widely used in electronics for flexible <b>printed</b> <b>circuits,</b> connections, and insulation. Arduengo's research at DuPont often coalesced with his other hobbies outside the laboratory; for example with sports cars (cf. photo in the summary box above). He contributed to development of low VOC automotive coatings by devising catalysts for a novel cross-linking chemistry used by DuPont Performance Coatings in next-generation low-VOC paints. Eventually, DuPont waterborne performance coatings would be used by Lotus on their Elise and Exige models. Arduengo's effort on the industrial-scale syntheses of the catalysts for the paints on which he worked would launch his re-entry into the area of carbene chemistry, {{but this time it}} was to be nucleophilic rather than electrophilic carbenes. The observation that the catalyst syntheses were well tolerant of varied reaction conditions and substituents led Arduengo to postulate that the imidazol-2-ylidenes that were intermediates in the syntheses had to be far more stable than the then conventional wisdom would allow.|$|E
