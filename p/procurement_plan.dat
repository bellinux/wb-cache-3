In June 1957, Republic Aviation requested that the F-105 be named Thunderchief, continuing the sequence of the company's Thunder-named aircraft: P-47 Thunderbolt, F-84 Thunderjet, and F-84F Thunderstreak.

The 1990 Major Aircraft Review led by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced this to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996. By 1997, funding instability had further cut the total to 339, which was again reduced to 277 F-22s by 2003. In 2004, the Department of Defense (DoD) further reduced this to 183 operational aircraft, despite the USAF's preference for 381. In 2006, a multi-year <b>procurement</b> <b>plan</b> was implemented to save $15billion but raise each aircraft's cost. That year the program's total cost was projected to be $62billion for 183 F-22s distributed to seven combat squadrons.

This paper addresses the effects of <b>procurement</b> <b>planning</b> on Local Governance in Uganda. The findings are from a study conducted among key political and administrative stakeholders from 11 local governments in Uganda. A total of 99 respondents out of the expected 150 respondents returned the survey instruments, a response rate of 66 %. The data was analyzed using principal component factor analysis, upon whose results, reliability analysis for each of the retained components were calculated, providing way for correlation and regression analysis.

The purchase of new-build steam locomotives by the DR ended in 1960 with 50 4088, the last standard-gauge steam locomotive built in Germany. No locomotive {{of the classes}} 25.10 and 83.10 was in service for more than 17 years. The last engines of the classes 23.10, 65.10 and 50.40 were retired in the late 1970s, with some units older than 25 years. Some of the narrow-gauge locomotives are still in service for tourism purposes. Later, during the early 1960s, the DR developed a way to reconstruct older locomotives to conform with contemporary requirements. The high-speed locomotive 18 201 and the class 01.5 are examples of designs from that programme.|$|E

40|$|Working in Supply Chains or Supply Networks (SN) {{requires}} to efficiently {{manage the}} information flow all along the network, and as a consequence, to define efficient coordination/cooperation mechanisms between partners. This problem is usually considered according to two main points of view: centralised planning of the SN using an APS (Advanced Planning System), or point-to-point relationship, each point being possibly managed by an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. The autonomy of each partner makes the centralised planning solution difficult, while in point-to-point relationship, {{it seems to be}} implicitly considered that a high level plan (Sales and Operation Planning-SOP) is generated by the final assembler, like in the automotive or aircraft industry, and is used for building a <b>Procurement</b> <b>Planning</b> which is sent as forecasts to the partners/suppliers. Iteratively, this <b>procurement</b> <b>planning</b> should allow the suppliers themselves building their SOP, and then generating forecasts for their own suppliers. Therefore, the main stream of the information flow should cross the chain from its end to its beginning, whereas the material flow goes in the reverse direction. This global framework seems to be considered as consistent on its own, independently from the characteristics of the involved partners. After having performed a number of case studies in various SN, we do believe that the characteristics of the companies involved in the SN have a deep influence on information processing and especially on the way the <b>procurement</b> <b>planning</b> is built and processed, setting into question the ideal case of an unidirectional information flow. In this paper, we suggest to define taxonomies of companies which in our opinion influence information processing all along the SN.
