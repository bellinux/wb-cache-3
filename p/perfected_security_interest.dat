An unsecured creditor {{is simply a}} person who is owed money and has not received payment according to the terms of the agreed upon transaction.

40|$|The Bankruptcy Reform Act 2 ̆ 7 s {{treatment}} of belatedly <b>perfected</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> in personal property is enigmatic, because {{it attempts to}} employ preference law to avoid a class of transfers, so-called 2 ̆ 2 secret liens, 2 ̆ 2 that are not true preferences. When a <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> is granted in exchange for contemporaneous value, preference policy in bankruptcy is not offended, because the transaction does not cause a depletion of the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s estate {{for the benefit of}} a particular creditor. However, the effect of the timing rules of section 547 (e) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act is to treat most <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> <b>perfected</b> during the preference period and more than ten days after attachment as section 547 (b) preferential transfers. Recently, in the Vance case, the Ninth Circuit had an opportunity to apply section 547 (c) (1), the substantially contemporaneous exchange exception, to the delayed perfection problem. Following a line of cases that apply the exception narrowly and mechanically, the court adopted an inflexible construction of section 547 (c) (1) and refused to apply it to <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> that are not perfected within the ten-day grace period established by section 547 (e). This decision should not be followed by courts in other jurisdictions,because its reasoning is flawed and neglects {{to take into account the}} purposes and goals of bankruptcy preference law and the broad language and historical development of the substantially contemporaneous exchange exception. The better-reasoned cases apply section 547 (c) (1) broadly and protect <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> that are (1) created in exchange for contemporaneous new value, and (2) perfected within a commercially reasonable time thereafter. This flexible approach to the delayed perfection problem ought to be followed, because it recognizes and protects the legitimate contractual expectations of secured creditors who act to <b>perfect</b> their <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> within a reasonable period of time, without sacrificing the interests of unsecured creditors who might have been misled by unreasonable delays in perfection...|$|R

Although section 547 (c) (5) is capable of complex applications, it is, in general, an efficient and workable response to the perceived unfairness of the case law under the Former Act. This article has discussed certain factual situations which, when analyzed under section 547 (c) (5), may produce results not clearly in accord with fundamental notions of bankruptcy preference policy.

40|$|Inspired {{by similar}} reforms {{introduced}} in New Zealand, Canada and the United States, the Commonwealth, with the co-operation of the States, seeks in the Personal Property Securities Bill 2008 (the Bill) {{to introduce a}} central repository of recorded information reflecting particular security interests in personal property in Australia. Specifically, the interest recorded is an interest in personal property provided for by a transaction that in substance secures the payment or the performance of an obligation. In addition to providing a notification {{of the use of}} the personal property as collateral to secure the payment of monies or the performance of an obligation, the Bill proposes to introduce a regime of prioritising interests in the same collateral. Central to this prioritisation are the concepts of a ‘perfected security interests’and ‘unperfected security interests’. Relevantly, a <b>perfected</b> <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> in collateral has priority over an unperfected security interest in the same collateral. The proposed mechanisms rely on the fundamental integer of personal property, which is defined as any property other than land. Recognising that property may take a tangible as well as an intangible form, the Bill reflects an appreciation of the fact that some property may have a tangible form which may act as collateral, and simultaneously the same property may involve other property, intangible property in the form of intellectual property rights, which in their own right may be the subject of a‘security agreement’. An example set out in the Commentary on the Consultation Draft of the Bill (the Commentary), indicates the practical implications involving certain property which have multiple profiles {{for the purposes of the}} Bill.

40|$|Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (2 ̆ 2 UCC 2 ̆ 2), {{governing}} secured transactions, {{was recently}} revised, {{changing the way}} in which nonpossessory <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> are <b>perfected.</b> 2 ̆ 7 All fifty states have approved the revision, which became effective in most states as of July 1, 2001.

40|$|This Article answers {{questions}} {{created by}} the financing statement requirements for sufficiency {{of the name of}} an individual debtor under the amendments to Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 —Secured Transactions. An individual debtor in a <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> transaction could be known by various names: birth certificate name, driver’s license name, passport name, or nickname. Revised Article 9 provides no guidance on what name is the correct name of the debtor for entry on the financing statement, and a financing statement that does not provide the correct name of the debtor does not <b>perfect</b> the <b>security</b> <b>interest.</b> To resolve this problem, the Joint Review Committee for Article 9 considered possible amendments to the individual debtor name requirements. Even the Joint Review Committee struggled with the issue, finally adopting two alternatives for sufficiency of the name of an individual debtor and asking states to choose between them. The Uniform Law Commission and the American Law Institute accepted the proposal and have offered the alternatives to the states, along with other amendments to Article 9. The proposed effective date of the amendments to Article 9 is July 1, 2013. To date, most states have adopted Alternative A to section 9 - 503 (a) (4) of amended Article 9. It is known as the “only if” rule. In accordance with this rule, a financing statement is sufficient only if it provides the name of the individual debtor as indicated on the debtor’s unexpired driver’s license. However, a secured party complying with section 9 - 503 (a) (4) Alternative A could still face many questions regarding the debtor’s name. This Article asks and answers twenty such questions. The Article also examines the statutory requirements of section 9 - 503 (a) (4) Alternative A and how a filed financing statement that does not satisfy those requirements could nevertheless remain effective...|$|R
40|$|Bankruptcy {{law allows}} {{third-party}} creditors of a consignee to attach consigned {{property in the}} consignee 2 ̆ 7 s possession when the consignee declares bankruptcy unless a consignor has acted to <b>perfect</b> a <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> in the consigned goods by complying with commercial law requirements. The drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provided for attachment {{because they wanted to}} protect third-party creditors from the unwelcome surprise of hidden liens dominating claims to a consignee 2 ̆ 7 s property in bankruptcy. Applying this attachment policy overly broadly in the art consignment context creates problems, though, because opportunistic creditors can use the attachment procedure despite having full knowledge of the widespread practice of consignment in the art industry. In 2001, the drafters revised the UCC with the desire to clarify consignment issues as part of the revision. Courts continue to struggle, however, with analyzing issues of consignment in bankruptcy. This Note argues that because art consignment stands apart from other types of consignment, the law should not require art consignor-collectors to follow UCC filing requirements to protect their artwork from attachment by third-party creditors, who are acutely aware of the risk that a consignee art dealership is substantially dealing in consigned artwork. Further, it suggests that courts should presume that art dealerships are generally known to be substantially selling in consigned work. Once consignors show that an art dealership is generally known to be substantially selling in consigned work, courts should exempt consigned artwork from the bankruptcy estate. This Note also proposes extending the statutory protection afforded to consignor-artists to consignor-collectors...|$|R
40|$|Although a goodly {{amount of}} recent {{commentary}} {{provides guidance to}} practitioners on the pitfalls of <b>perfecting</b> a <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> in intellectual property collateral, and another body of work has undertaken the laudable task of proposing reform in the area, no comprehensive attempt has yet been made to help judges resolve the complex priority disputes that arise under existing law. In light of {{the increased use of}} intellectual property as collateral and the concomitant rise in litigation, guidance on the resolution of priority disputes in intellectual property collateral is sorely needed. For example, recent cases find Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (U. C. C.) to be broadly preempted by federal intellectual property law and create significant differences between the way copyright and patent priority disputes are addressed, without providing a detailed analysis of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s most recent pronouncement on intellectual property preemption. This Article criticizes these and other cases, provides guidelines for resolving the puzzling priority disputes that arise when intellectual property is taken as collateral, and clearly defines the proper contours of federal preemption. Part I of the Article will review well-established preemption principles, determine whether federal or state rules of decision apply to familiar patterns of dispute involving copyright collateral, and suggest the appropriate result in each case. The conclusions contradict recent academic and judicial discussion of the preemption issue that suggests an inappropriately broad preemptive scope for federal law. The key is not to examine preemption questions in the abstract, but to identify the precise disputes that federal law settles and leave for state law the disputes for which federal law provides no answer. Part II applies the same method of analysis to priority disputes involving patents as collateral and examines whether the current disparate treatment of patents and copyrights is warranted. To round out the discussion, Part III evaluates the effect of the Lanham Act on disputes over <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> taken in trademarks...|$|R

5000|$|Remnants of {{this common}} law {{doctrine}} exist {{today in the}} United States in the Uniform Commercial Code. Name changes can mislead searchers of official records of titles or liens. Article 9 of the UCC states that a financing statement shall not <b>perfect</b> a valid <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> if a name change would be [...] "seriously misleading.". A creditor may gain priority over other creditors {{in the event of}} a bankruptcy by filing a financing statement. The financing statement contains information relevant to the secured transaction and puts other creditors on notice that the filer has a secured interest in the property. Should the filer use a debtor name that is substantially different from the debtor's actual name, the purpose of filing the financing statement is defeated. On the other hand, if there is a minor difference in spelling or an idem sonans, the error is not fatal, but only if it is not seriously misleading. The actual search results may reveal a debtor with a similar name and address which would put the researcher on notice to investigate further, which is the purpose of the filing in the first place. The legal effect of an idem sonans is that the minor name difference shall have no bearing on the priority of debtors.|$|R
40|$|Anyone who {{has been}} paid {{attention}} to developments {{in the world of}} business over the past quarter century can attest to the fact that intellectual property (IP) is a hot commodity. Indeed, in contrast to the companies that emerged out of the Industrial Revolution, the companies that have spawned as part of the so-called “Information Age” attribute much of their value and future prospects to intangible, rather than tangible, assets. Unfortunately, while bankruptcy courts have generally recognized the need to distinguish between tangible and intangible assets, particularly when determining whether a claim is secured or unsecured, they often fail to acknowledge the practical and legal differences between the various forms of IP. Not all forms of IP are created equal. Trade secrets, in particular, present a challenge for the bankruptcy courts because, by definition, they must be “secret. ” Thus, the very act of identifying and attempting to place a value on trade secrets may result in the loss of such rights. A number of recent articles have addressed the treatment of IP assets in bankruptcy proceedings. Typically, these articles focus on two important aspects of bankruptcy law as it relates to intellectual property generally: (1) how to <b>perfect</b> a <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> in intellectual property assets, i. e., “general intangibles” in the parlance of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“the U. C. C 2 ̆ 2.), and (2) the treatment of executory contracts involving intellectual property assets. While both of these issues are important, they are meaningless with respect to trade secrets unless the trade secrets continue to exist after the bankruptcy petition is filed. Thus, rather than jump to a discussion of <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> and executory contracts as they relate to trade secrets, this article begins with a discussion of trade secret law and how various trade secret issues may arise in the bankruptcy context. Because the nature of the relationships in which trade secrets are disclosed is a key aspect of trade secret law, the article then proceeds to explore the interests and objectives of the various players in a bankruptcy proceeding, including the debtor, the trustee, creditors, licensees, and other third parties. The article concludes with a discussion of the interests of the unsecured creditors, employees of the debtor, and the buyer of estate assets...|$|R
