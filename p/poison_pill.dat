Through the 2016–17 season, the accounting was different for the player's original team, where the player's salary for a given year—not the contract's average—was counted against the cap. In some cases, the offering team could exploit a loophole to create what is referred to as a <b>poison</b> <b>pill</b> for the player's original team, potentially forcing the original team to pay the luxury tax by the third season, as the Houston Rockets did in order to sign Jeremy Lin and Ömer Aşık away from the New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls, respectively.

40|$|We {{challenge}} a common presumption that <b>poison</b> <b>pills</b> and two Delaware case rulings in 1995 validating such pills materially entrench firms.

With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated <b>poison</b> <b>pill.</b> To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison.

The rights of public {{shareholders}} are protected by the Panel on a case-by-case, principles-based regulatory regime.

If these companies had <b>poison</b> <b>pills,</b> they could have prevented the raids by threatening to dilute the positions of their hostile suitors if they exceeded the statutory levels (often 10% of the outstanding shares) in the rights plan. The London Stock Exchange itself is another example of a company that has seen significant stakebuilding by a hostile suitor, in this case the NASDAQ.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of {{corporate}} takeover defences {{on the extent of}} earnings management in the US. Theoretically, it is not obvious whether takeover defences alleviate or exacerbate earnings management. Four well-known corporate takeover defences are examimed: blank check preferred stock, <b>poison</b> <b>pills,</b> classified boards and dual class stock. In spite of their similarity as takeover defences, the empirical evidence indicates that they do not influence the degree of earnings management in the same way. Specifically, blank check preferred stock does not {{have a significant impact on}} earnings management. <b>Poison</b> <b>pills</b> and classified boards are found to reduce earnings management, on average, by 1. 9 % and 1. 5 % respectively. On the contrary, dual class stock exacerbates earnings management by increasing the degree of abnormal accruals by 2. 6 % on average. The results are robust even after controlling for firm size, profitability, financial distress, growth opportunities and information asymmetry. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{trends in}} {{shareholder}} activism {{have brought to}} light the competing interests of management and stockholders. With a rise in shareholder activism, firms are continuing to include change in control provisions, known as proxy puts, in their debt agreements to counter activist success. Recent litigation {{regarding the use of}} these provisions has created a debate as to whether these provisions are valid under Delaware law. Moreover, companies and lending institutions have morphed these provisions into a more restrictive form, known as “dead hand proxy puts. ” The controversy analyzed in this Note arises out of the use of dead hand proxy puts in debt agreements. The Delaware Chancery Court has considered the issue of proxy puts in three recent cases. On no occasion has the court declared traditional or dead hand proxy puts invalid; the court, however, expressed skepticism toward these provisions. With a recognized entrenchment effect on management and a deterrent effect on the stockholder franchise, the court indicated that they could potentially be invalid in Delaware as a matter of public policy. This Note considers the rise of shareholder activism in the United States and the use of both proxy puts and <b>poison</b> <b>pills</b> to defend against activist investors and hostile takeovers. It analyzes the current debate over dead hand proxy puts and compares these provisions to the already illegal dead hand <b>poison</b> <b>pills.</b> It ultimately argues that dead hand proxy puts should be outlawed in Delaware on the same basis as dead hand <b>poison</b> <b>pills...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first director's duty {{under section}} 171 {{is to follow}} the company's constitution, but also only {{exercise}} powers for implied [...] "proper purposes". Prior proper purpose cases often involved directors plundering the company's assets for personal enrichment, or attempting to install mechanisms to frustrate attempted takeovers by outside bidders, such as a <b>poison</b> <b>pill.</b> Such practices are improper, because they go beyond the reason for which directors were delegated their power. The all-important duty of care is found in section 174. Directors must display the care, skill and competence that is reasonable for somebody carrying out {{the functions of the}} office, and if a director has any special qualifications an even higher standard will be expected. However, under section 1157 courts may, if directors are negligent but found to be honest and ought to be excused, relieve directors from paying compensation. The [...] "objective plus subjective" [...] standard was first introduced in the wrongful trading provision from the Insolvency Act 1986, and applied in Re D'Jan of London Ltd. The liquidator sought to recover compensation from Mr D'Jan, who failing to read an insurance policy form, did not disclose he was previously the director of an insolvent company. The policy was void when the company's warehouse burnt down. Hoffmann LJ held Mr D'Jan's failure was negligent, but exercised discretion to relieve liability on the ground that he owned almost all of his small business and had only put his own money at risk. The courts emphasise that they will not judge business decisions unfavourably with the benefit of hindsight, however simple procedural failures of judgment will be vulnerable. Cases under the Company Director Disqualification Act 1986, such as Re Barings plc (No 5) show that directors will also be liable for failing to adequately supervise employees or have effective risk management systems, as where the London directors ignored a warning report about the currency exchange business in Singapore, where a rogue trader caused losses so massive that it brought the whole bank into insolvency.|$|E
