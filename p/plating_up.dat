25|$|Heavy {{losses to}} enemy fighters forced the {{reintroduction}} of a rear gunner; early Il-2s were field modified by cutting {{a hole in}} the fuselage behind the cockpit for a gunner sitting on a canvas sling armed with a 12.7mm UBT machine gun in an improvised mounting. The semi-turret gun mount allowed the machine gun to be fired at angles of up to 35° upwards, 35° to starboard and 15° to port. Tests showed that maximum speed decreased by between 10 and 20km/h (6.2–12.4mph) and that the two-seater was more difficult to handle because the center of gravity was shifted backwards. At the beginning of March 1942, a production two-seat Il-2 with the new gunner's cockpit began manufacturer tests. The second cockpit and armament increased all-up weight by 170kg (374lb) so the flaps were allowed to be deployed at an angle of 17° to avoid an over-long takeoff run. The new variant had a lengthened fuselage compartment with an extended canopy offering some protection from the elements. Unlike the well-armoured cockpit of the pilot compartment with steel <b>plating</b> <b>up</b> to 12mm (0.47in) thick behind, beneath and on both sides as well as up to 65mm thick glass sections, the rear gunner was provided with 6mm (.23 in) thick armour, effective only against rifle-calibre rounds.|$|E

40|$|Uteroplacental (UP) {{vascular}} arterial pathology {{has been}} associated with pregnancy complications. UP arterial structure has been characterized in placental bed biopsies, at the decidual-myometrial junction. Basal <b>plate</b> <b>UP</b> arteries, which are delivered with the placenta and thus routinely available, are not well characterized. We compared basal <b>plate</b> <b>UP</b> arterial segment morphometry in cases of elective termination of a clinically normal pregnancy at 11 to 24 weeks and of term birth. This study was done in a community-based obstetric service in New York City. UP arteries were identified in placentas of 20 midtrimester (MT) cases and 17 term (TERM) cases. We measured 336 UP artery cross-sections from 46 TERM and 290 MT cases. The basal <b>plate</b> <b>UP</b> artery path length was calculated as the distance between (x,y) coordinates of estimated centers of lumen cross-sections. Basal <b>plate</b> thickness near <b>UP</b> arteries, UP artery cross-sectional areas, vascular luminal eccentricity, and radial standard deviation were directly measured off digital images. Nonparametric and parametric methods compared groups, with P < 0. 05 considered statistically significant. In TERM cases, the basal <b>plate</b> thickness near <b>UP</b> arteries was 1. 8 -fold thinner (P = 0. 002) and mean basal plate path lengths were 2. 13 -fold shorter (P < 0. 0001) than in MT cases. Mean TERM UP artery cross-sectional area was 3. 15 -fold larger, the major axis was 1. 95 -fold larger, and the minor axis was 1. 75 -fold larger than in MT arteries (P = 0. 001 to 0. 008). Our data demonstrate that basal <b>plate</b> <b>UP</b> arteries (delivered with the placenta) are less tortuous, with shorter path lengths and larger areas as gestation advances.

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} visceral {{approach}} {{to explore the}} affective relations between kangaroo meat and home. We concentrate on eating kangaroo as a central political issue. In 2008, kangaroo meat gained prominence in Australia through the proposal in the Garnaut Climate Change Review to reduce carbon emissions by changing consumers 2 ̆ 7 red meat diets in an expanded kangaroo meat market. This paper considers why many Australian households choose to avoid eating kangaroo despite market relations and climate policy constituting roo-consumers as environmental citizens. We draw on taste-driven fieldwork that involved participants <b>plating</b> <b>up</b> kangaroo meat at home. We focus on two participants who never eat kangaroo at home to illustrate how this visceral approach is useful to rethinking climate change policies. We discuss how the intensity of visceral disgust works against incorporating more kangaroo meat into weekly home diets to help mitigate climate change. Eating kangaroo created a domestic space where these participants felt viscerally disconnected with culinary legacies along with particular dimensions of their subjectivities and home. Rather than eating kangaroo being tied to the logic of climate change or capitalism, visceral disgust ruptures boundaries that maintain a socio-spatial political order to things through chicken, beef, lamb and pork...|$|E
