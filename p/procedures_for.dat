40|$|We {{characterize}} provability in {{intuitionistic logic}} with equality {{in terms of}} a constraint calculus. This characterization uncovers close connections between provability in intuitionistic logic with equality and solutions to simultaneous rigid E-unification. We show that the problem of existence of a sequent proof with a given skeleton is polynomial-time equivalent to simultaneous rigid E-unifiability. This gives us a proof <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> intuitionistic logic with equality modulo simultaneous rigid E-unification. We also show that simultaneous rigid E-unifiability is polynomial-time reducible to intuitionistic logic with equality. Thus, any proof <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> intuitionistic logic with equality can be considered as a <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> simultaneous rigid E-unifiability. In turn, any <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> simultaneous rigid E-unifiability gives a <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> establishing provability in intuitionistic logic with equality. 2 2 Copyright c fl 1995, 1996 Andrei Voronkov.

Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems.

5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation.

At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E
