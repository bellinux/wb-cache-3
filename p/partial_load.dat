25|$|In September 1989, the 120,000 ton collier M.S. Leon entered port with 85,000 tons of coal. The coal was {{unloaded}} by crane {{unto the}} conveyor {{and taken to}} the Coal Company {{at the rear of}} the Ashdod power station. The big ship was brought into port by modern Voit-Schneider type tugboats, which have an exceptional maneuverability and a bollard pull of 35 and 45 tons respectively. Bringing 160,00 G.R.T. ships into the port (at <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> capacity) is a considerable accomplishment in view of the fact that the Port of Ashdod was intended for navigation by ships of maximum deadweight of 30,000 tons (before the port was expanded in the 2000s).|$|E
500|$|One {{hundred and}} two men of the Sixth Division, many fresh from {{training}} at NSGL, were busy rigging the newly built Victory ship [...] (also spelled Quinalt) in preparation for loading it with explosives, a task that was to begin at midnight. The Quinault contained a <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> of fuel oil, some of which was of a type that released flammable fumes as it sat, or upon agitation. The fuel, taken aboard at Shell Oil Company's Martinez refinery mid-day on July 17, would normally be sluiced to other fuel tanks in the following 24hours.|$|E
500|$|After {{reviewing}} a {{study of}} the overall infiltration threat, MACV requested additional aircraft and patrol vessels for Operation Market Time. A request for an additional division of Point-class cutters to be added to Squadron One was made on 5 August 1965 and preparations for deploying the additional cutters started in late October with the new division of nine patrol boats to be named Division 13. The staff and repair personnel arrived at Subic Bay 14 December 1965 while the division's boat crews received weapons and undertook survival training in California. The crews started arriving at Subic Bay on 28 December where additional survival and weapons training was given. Twenty-one of the division's personnel were sent to Divisions 11 and 12 to be exchanged for crewmen who had Market Time experience. Division 13 cutters began arriving as deck cargo on transport ships at Subic Bay on 24 January 1966 and crews commenced outfitting and painting them deck gray. Some of the outfitting had been accomplished before shipment so that more time could be devoted to training crews in gunnery and procedure before the division's scheduled departure for Vietnam on 18 February. During a training exercise on 13 February, the main engine alarm sounded on the bridge of [...] After checking the cause of the alarm, it was determined that a complete overhaul of one of the engines would be required. Division 12 shipped a complete kit of repair parts from Da Nang overnight by way of a U.S. Marine Corps C-130 flight to Cubi Point Naval Air Station. The flight was met by division personnel and repairs commenced. Divided into three shifts, the crews worked around-the-clock and the repairs were completed in 72 hours. A <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> break-in was made the morning of departure {{and the rest of the}} procedure was completed while the division was en route to Vietnam. At 16:00 on 18 February, Division 13 left Subic Bay in the company of , arriving at the RVN Base at Cat Lo on 22 February. Patrol work for six of the division's cutters began at 08:00 the following morning, covering the area from [...] north of Vung Tau to [...] south.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} the startup when the airlines delivered a [...] "parting shot" [...] {{in the form of a}} publicity stunt to remind the public of its efficiency in mail service. World War I legend Eddie Rickenbacker, a vice president of North American Aviation (Eastern Air Transport's parent holding company) and Jack Frye of Transcontinental and Western Air, both of which had lost their mail contracts, flew T's prototype Douglas DC-1 airliner [...] "City of Los Angeles," [...] which was still in flight test, across the country on the last evening before the Air Corps operation began. Carrying a <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> of mail and a passenger list of airlines officials and news reporters, they flew from Douglas Aviation's plant at Burbank, California, to Newark, New Jersey. Bypassing several regular stops to stay ahead of a blizzard, the stunt established a new cross-country time record of just over 13 hours, breaking the old record by more than five hours. The DC-1 arrived on the morning of February 19 only two hours before the Air Corps was forced by the winter weather to cancel the startup of AACMO.|$|E
2500|$|A {{peripheral}} {{intake port}} gives the highest mean effective pressure, however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, {{because it helps}} to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the intake ducts which cause [...] "misfirings", caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite. Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range, but PP was linked also to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to {{the addition of a}} fresh air supply to the exhaust port, and proved also that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a small loss of power at top rpm. David W. Garside, the developer of the Norton rotary engine, who proposed that earlier opening of the intake port before top dead center (TDC), and longer intake ducts, improved low rpm torque and elasticity of Wankel engines. That is also described in Kenichi Yamamoto's books. Elasticity is also improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine. Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system. Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean effective pressure, more severely in peripheral intake port engines. The Mazda RX-8 Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs, and there has been specific study of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines.|$|E

40|$|A {{front-end}} rectifier {{can significantly}} impact a power electronics system performance and efficiency for {{applications such as}} motor drive where the system commonly operates under <b>partial</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. This paper proposes an adjustable switching frequency scheme using an electronic inductor technique to improve the energy saving of the system operating at <b>partial</b> <b>loading.</b> In the proposed solution, the switching frequency is adjusted based on the loading conditions, and thus maintains the system performance {{both in terms of}} switching losses and harmonic distortion.

50|$|Due to its {{excellent}} behaviour with <b>partial</b> <b>loads,</b> the cross-flow turbine is well-suited to unattended electricity production.

50|$|Because the {{evolution}} analysis requires {{large amounts of}} data to be manipulated, it was not feasible anymore to manipulate all the model information all the time. Also, the computation of the metrics beforehand for all entities in the model was another bottleneck.

50|$|Yanmar Diesel, a Japanese engine maker, was {{pioneer in}} {{introducing}} reed valves for flow control at intake ports of its small Wankel engines, showing {{an improvement in}} torque and performances at low rpm and under <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> of the engine. Toyota discovered the benefits of injecting fresh air into the Wankel RCE exhaust port, and also used a reed valve in prototypes where they tested the SCRE concept (Stratified Charge Rotary Engine). However, this kind of intake port arrangement never reached the production line for automobile size RCEs. According to David W. Garside, who developed the Norton line of Wankel-powered motorcycles, data from other RCE producers pointed that reed valves do improve performances at low rpm and under <b>partial</b> <b>load,</b> but reduce the high speed power output of the engine, a feature considered inconvenient for motorcycle engines.|$|E

40|$|Wave {{power is}} a large {{untapped}} source of renewable energy. There is {{a wide variety of}} wave energy converters {{and one of them is}} the Symphony Wave Power device. The aim of this thesis is to find the best generator design for the Symphony. There is some research available on generator designs for wave energy converters but the Symphony is a unique case, so a new research needed to be conducted. Several generator types can be used in the Symphony. Compared to an induction and switched reluctance generator, the iron-cored permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) seems a good choice because it is efficient and reliable. A disadvantage, however, is that, in the case of the Symphony, the iron losses are relatively high at <b>partial</b> <b>loads.</b> An air-cored PMSG does not have this problem since it has no iron losses at all. A drawback of the air-cored PMSG is that it needs more permanent magnetic material, which is expensive. Finally, it was decided to test and compare the iron-cored radial flux PMSG and the air-cored axial flux PMSG on both performance and costs. For both generator types, an analytical model was built which puts out the efficiency and material cost. To find the best generator geometries for the case of the Symphony, an optimization procedure was created which minimizes both material costs and losses. It was found that an axial flux air-cored PMSG is both cheaper and more efficient than a radial flux iron-cored PMSG. The iron losses of an iron-cored generator are relatively high at <b>partial</b> <b>loads</b> while the Symphony operates at <b>partial</b> <b>loads</b> most of the time...|$|R

40|$|Honey bee foragers {{transfer}} their nectar loads to receiver bees {{within the}} nest. Surprisingly, they often transfer {{to more than}} one receiver (published values range from 1. 9 to 2. 7). Several adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain why multiple transfer occurs. One hypothesis, information improvement, states that multiple transfer arises as an adaptive forager-driven process. Foragers use the delay in finding a receiver to assess the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers, performing recruitment dances when appropriate. Multiple transferring improves their delay information. We used a stochastic simulation model to investigate the non-adaptive <b>partial</b> <b>loads</b> hypothesis. We determined the extent to which <b>partial</b> crop <b>loads</b> and receiver filling and emptying rules (i. e. how much nectar to accept before leaving the transfer area) can cause multiple transfer. As many as 1. 9 nectar transfers per returning forager were generated within biologically realistic parameter space. We suggest that much multiple transfer arises as a non-adaptive consequence of partitioning nectar foraging between foragers and receivers, but that this will also result in foragers having better information about the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers as a useful consequence. We suggest that the number of transfers caused by <b>partial</b> <b>loads</b> could also be increased by an adaptive forager-driven effort to improve their information concerning the balance of foragers and receivers and we outline a framework wherein the information improvement hypothesis can be directly tested...|$|R
5000|$|A {{so-called}} [...] "pumping loss" [...] is {{also cited}} as causing extra {{work for the}} engine to do under <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> conditions because the pistons {{have to work harder}} to suck in the fuel-air mixture when the throttle position results in low intake-manifold pressure.
