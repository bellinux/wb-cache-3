We explain that this maneuver removes entanglement from any quantum algorithm. But all <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> must be <b>accounted</b> for to quantify algorithm complexity, and this scheme typically incurs exponential costs in some other resource(s). In particular, we demonstrate that a recent experimental realization requires exponentially increasing precision.

40|$|In this {{deliverable}} {{we describe}} the SUPERCLOUD resilient network virtualization platform. We present its main components and the techniques used to improve the dependability, scalability, and security of the platform. The architecture follows a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) approach. The main components are divided into two modules: address and topology virtualization, and virtual network embedding. Our network hypervisor provides address and topology virtualization, allowing each tenant to use the full header space and to define arbitrary topologies. The virtual network embedding module maps virtual network requests to <b>physical</b> <b>resources,</b> taking into <b>account</b> the security and dependability demands by users. To avoid the network hypervisor being a single point of failure, we present the design and implementation of a fault-tolerant SDN controller. Our design guarantees consistent event processing under faults, without requiring changes to current SDN protocols or switches. To allow the system to scale, we propose {{the design of a}} distributed SDN controller centered around a consistent data store that allows coordination amongst the different controllers instances. Finally, {{we describe the}} autonomic security management framework of the network virtualization platform, a component that offers data plane monitoring and proactive attack detection across the different providers of the SUPERCLOUD...|$|R

Investment in education can help bring about economic growth, improve productivity, contribute to social and national development and lead to reduction in social inequality. This study was therefore to affirm the above sentiments by confirming whether <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> in any way relate to internal efficiency in secondary schools of Tana River County. The study specifically sought to establish the relationship between <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> and internal efficiency of public secondary schools in Tana River County in terms of number of classrooms, laboratories, textbooks, furniture, toilets/latrines, and electricity among others. The research particularly sought to determine the magnitude of inefficiency in form of dropout, repetition, and completion and aimed at providing possible solutions in relation to <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> to minimize wastage in secondary schools and establish corrective measures that can minimize dropouts and repetition. The study was guided by the cost benefit analysis theory which aims at achieving optimal output. This theory stresses that the out-put of any investment should be correlated with the in-put {{in order to assess}} profitability. The objectives of the study were to assess the adequacy of <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> in development and enhancing internal efficiency in public secondary schools, to find out the relationship between <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> and dropout rate, {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> and repetition rate of public secondary schools in Tana river County, to find the relationship between <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> and completion rate and finally to develop complimentary policies and interventions related to <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> that can reduce wastage in public secondary schools of Tana river County. The study was conducted using a descriptive survey and correlation research designs and the data was collected using questionnaires, interview guide and documentary analysis from 15 secondary schools which were visited by the researcher; 1 County Director of Education, 3 District Education officers, 15 Principals and 30 teachers were contacted with the Principals being purposively selected and teachers selected randomly from the accessible population. Data generated was analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative data from interview schedule and questionnaires was analyzed thematically based on research objectives. Data from documents analysis and numerical data generated from interview schedules with key informants was analyzed using mean, frequency counts and percentages. Chi-square test was used to establish relationships between <b>physical</b> <b>resources,</b> dropout, repetition, and completion rates. On the first objective, the study found out that school in Tana River County had inadequate <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> and that those available were in poor condition. On objective two, the study found out that there was no relationship between dropout rates and condition of <b>physical</b> <b>resources.</b> On objective three and four the study found out that there was positive significant relationship between repetition, completion rates and condition of <b>physical</b> <b>resources.</b> The research also revealed that the secondary education system in Tana River County as at the period of study was inefficient with a mean dropout rate of 16. 0. On the basis of findings, the study concluded that <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> are positively correlated with internal efficiency of public secondary schools in Tana river County. It was therefore recommended that for realization of internal efficiency, there was need to equip schools in Tana River County with the necessary <b>physical</b> <b>resources,</b> adequate mechanisms and procedures for ensuring retention and high completion rates in schools. Finally, the researcher suggested that schools should be given funds directly for them to have a chance of prioritizing and acquiring essential <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> based on their specific needs...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} regarding availability is the abuse of <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> by virtual networks. Virtual networks may attempt to use as much resources as possible {{in order to maximize}} their performance. If the environment is not adequately protected, this behavior may lead to the exhaustion of <b>physical</b> <b>resources,</b> compromising the availability of other virtual networks hosted on the same substrate. Therefore, <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> must be shared in a fair manner, and actions performed by a virtual network must not negatively impact others.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the criticisms}} of human <b>resource</b> <b>accounting</b> in the {{literature}} {{is that it has}} no impact on the financial statement numbers. Human <b>resource</b> <b>accounting</b> numbers, it was felt, would be insignificant. ^ Empirical studies by Elias, Hendricks, Schwan, and others emphasized the impacts human <b>resource</b> <b>accounting</b> had on decision making. This behavioral research contended that human <b>resource</b> <b>accounting</b> does have an impact on decision making. ^ This study utilizes a sensitivity analysis on the human resource variables. This was done to determine the magnitude necessary for human resource adjusted net income to deviate significantly from conventional net income. Through this procedure, the human asset balance was also investigated to determine if the ultimate balance would differ from the presently assumed balance of zero. In so doing, if the amount of human resource variables necessary for significance is adequately small (in comparison to net income), the general conclusion that human <b>resource</b> <b>accounting</b> impacts the income statement and balance sheet can be made. ^ The results were encouraging. With the exception of the short-term scenario with changing variables and net income, the magnitude of the human resource variables were small enough (generally less than ten percent of net income) for human <b>resource</b> <b>accounting</b> to be considered significant at least at the five percent level of confidence. It can be assumed, therefore, that human <b>resource</b> <b>accounting</b> does impact the financial statements, giving credence to the previous behavioral studies and the need for human <b>resource</b> <b>accounting</b> to be incorporated into the financial statements. ...|$|R

In an attempt to contribute to a new environmental information system compatible with economic accounts, we represent Australia’s resource use by employing standard biophysical indicators for resource use developed within the OECD context. We are looking at the last three decades of resource use and the economic, social and environmental implications. We also discuss scenarios of future resource use patterns based on a stocks and flows model of the Australian economy. We argue that current extractive economic patterns have contributed to the recent economic boom in Australia but will eventually lead to negative social and environmental outcomes. While there is currently little evidence of political support for changing the economic focus on export-oriented agriculture and mining industries, there is significant potential for improvements in socio-technological systems, and room for more sustainable household consumption. natural resources, resource use patterns and dynamics, <b>physical</b> <b>accounting,</b> <b>resource</b> productivity, social and environmental impacts of resource use, Australia...|$|R

(Educational Leadership and Management) In post-apartheid South Africa, {{socio-economic}} and socio-political challenges {{coupled with}} serious {{lack of adequate}} <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> in historically disadvantaged public schools are barriers to effective curriculum delivery {{and the provision of}} co-curricular activities. The National Norms and Standards for School Funding policy has been designed to address equity and social justice by providing substantial funding to public schools ranked as quintile 1 and 2. The State funding has been earmarked for, amongst others, the purchase of learning and teaching support materials and other phyiscal assets for educational purposes. This study determines the perceptions and experiences of teachers and school managers on the management of <b>physical</b> <b>resources.</b> Governing bodies have been empowered and are held accountable to manage physical assets at public schools. In the case of fee paying schools, the State provides limited funding and consequently, governing bodies are expected to raise funds in order to supplement the State’s funds so that additional <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> that further the ends of effective education in every public school, may be procured. The management of <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> is found to be ineffective and inefficient in many schools, paricularly historically disadvantaged schools. This study was framed using the quantitative research method. A structured questionnaire was distributed to a randomly stratified sample consisting mainly of post level one educators and members of the school management teams. This research was conducted at 30 public schools in the Gauteng East district. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Section A required the respondents’ biograhical details; Section B comprised of 30 items on the management of physcial resources at public schools and Section C contained 11 items indicating the processes concerned with <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> management. The analytical procedures applied in the empirical investigation revealed that <b>physical</b> <b>resource</b> management consists of three factors, namely, effective management of phyical resources; effective procurement of physical resources; and the provisioning of <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> by the Provincial Education vi Department. The findings revealed that the educators agree that the governing body effectively manage and effectively procure resources for the school. There was only partial agreement that the Provincial Education Department provides <b>physical</b> <b>resources</b> adequately. It was found that governing bodies and school management teams need to be provided with continual training by the Provincial Education Department. Furthermore, it appears that whilst structures and processes are established to manage <b>physical</b> <b>resources,</b> there is need to constantly appraise and review their functionality...|$|R
