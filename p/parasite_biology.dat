40|$|Human malaria and bovine {{babesiosis}} {{are caused}} by apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Babesia bovis respectively. These two parasites show very similar pathogenesis which is significantly influenced by their apical complex. Members of the apical complex; rhoptry, microneme, apical polar rings and microtubules are intricately involved in the <b>parasite’s</b> <b>biology</b> and are essential for viability and pathogenicity. Apicomplexan microtubules have previously been suggested as plausible drug targets based on several factors. In this study, we have attempted to asses i) the functional role of P. falciparum and B. bovis microtubular system in the <b>parasite’s</b> <b>biology</b> and ii) the feasibility of antimicrotubule drugs as potential antiparasitic agents. Parasite microtubular structures were visualised during different stages of the lifecycle using confocal microscopy. These temporal data have led to {{better understanding of the}} potential role played by parasite microtubules in nuclear and apicoplast segregation, maintenance of cell integrity and invasion. The antimicrotubule drugs used on P. falciparum were predicted by in silico docking to bind to well-defined domains of the tubulin dimer. This docking data provides a structure-activity relationship for the binding of antimicrotubule ligands to specific sites and the consequent phenotypic effects as observed by immunofluorescence. The in silico data is also supported by in vitro combination assays displaying antagonism between competing ligands binding to the same site. Growth inhibition studies performed with antimicrotubule drugs leads to the hypothesis that the action of these drugs on their own are too slow to be clinically useful as antimalarials. Their action is recognisable only in the second cycle of parasite division following addition of the drug. However the slow, lingering activity of these drugs could be complementary for fast acting, artemisinin derivatives having short half life. Resistance against current chemotherapeutic agents, residue issues and absence of a globally effective vaccine necessitates the need for increased research efforts on novel effective drugs like microtubule inhibitory agents.

We analyzed 123 piggyBac insertion mutants of P. falciparum for proliferation efficiency in the intraerythrocytic stages, in vitro. Almost 50 % of the analyzed mutants showed significant reduction in proliferation efficiency, with 20 % displaying severe defects. Functional categorization of genes in the severely attenuated mutants revealed significant enrichment for RNA binding proteins, suggesting the significance of posttranscriptional gene regulation in parasite development and emphasizing its importance as an antimalarial target.

Although infection by the parasite has been widely described in mammals, the role of birds in its life-cycle is still obscure.

Experimental infections were conducted in 7 -day-old chicks, laying hens and embryonated eggs, where samples were analysed for parasite burden, IgG antibodies and lesions promoted. Chickens demonstrated an asymptomatic infection, although with seroconversion and systemic replication of the parasite. In laying hens, no signs of vertical transmission were observed. However, embryonated eggs inoculated by the allantoic cavity route demonstrated susceptibility to infection, with mor-tality rates around 50 % independent of the inoculum dose. Additionally, dogs became infected after ingestion of different amounts of inoculated eggs, producing either oocysts or specific IgG antibodies.

Statistical modeling robustly segregated infected and uninfected samples based on metabolite species with significantly different abundances. Metabolites of the α-linolenic acid (ALA) pathway, known to exist in plants but not known to exist in P. falciparum until now, were enriched in infected plasma and erythrocyte samples.

Considering the importance of proteasomes in both processes in many different parasites such as Trypanosoma, Leishmania, Toxoplasma, and Entamoeba, parasite proteasomes might serve as virulence factors.

NAD+ metabolism is related to the maintenance of several biochemical, cellular, and physiological processes; consequently, the characterization and analysis of the enzymes involved in its biosynthesis represent key steps in the development of control strategies. In this study, the NMNAT enzymes of different Leishmania species were identified using bioinformatics procedures. The sequences were used to construct structural homology models that revealed characteristic elements common to NMNATs. The open reading frame of Leishmania braziliensis NMNAT was cloned from complementary DNA and the enzymatic activity of the corresponding recombinant protein was confirmed through enzymatic assays. Primary structure analysis revealed a Leishmania-specific amino-terminal insertion in NMNAT. The deletion of this insertion is negatively correlated with in vitro enzymatic activity.
