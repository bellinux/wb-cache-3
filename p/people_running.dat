25|$|In Bengal, some Muslims {{refer to}} the social {{stratification}} within their society as qaum (or Quoms), a term that is found among Muslims elsewhere in India, {{as well as in}} Pakistan and Afghanistan. Qaums have patrilineal hereditary, with ranked occupations and endogamy. Membership in a qaum is inherited by birth. Barth identifies the origin of the stratification from the historical segregation between pak (pure) and paleed (impure) - - defined by the family's social or religious status, occupation and involvement in sexual crimes. Originally, Paleed/Paleet qaum included <b>people</b> <b>running</b> or working at brothels, prostitution service providers or professional courtesan/dancers (Tawaif) and musicians. There is history of skin color defining Pak/Paleed, but that does not have historical roots, and was adopted by outsiders using analogy from Hindu Caste system.|$|E
25|$|Nineteen {{people were}} killed and about 235 were wounded. The dead {{included}} seventeen men, one woman, and a seven-year-old girl. Some of the dead were demonstrators while others were simply passers-by. Many were chased by the police and shot or clubbed at the entrance of their houses as they tried to escape. Others were taken from their hiding places and killed. Leopold Tormes, a member of the Puerto Rico legislature, told reporters how a policeman murdered a nationalist with his bare hands. Dr. Jose N.

25|$|Authorities {{initially}} {{arranged for}} Genie's {{admission to the}} Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where a team of doctors and psychologists managed her care for several months, and her subsequent living arrangements {{became the subject of}} rancorous and protracted debate. In late June 1971 she left the hospital to live with her teacher at the hospital, but {{a month and a half}} later authorities placed her with the family of the scientist heading the research team, where she lived for almost four years. Soon after turning 18, in mid-1975, Genie returned to live with her mother, who after a few months decided she could not adequately care for her. Authorities then moved her in the first of what would become a series of institutions for disabled adults, and the <b>people</b> <b>running</b> it cut her off from almost everyone she knew and subjected her to extreme physical and emotional abuse. As a result, her physical and mental health severely deteriorated, and her newly acquired language and behavioral skills very rapidly regressed.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after moving}} into this {{location}} the <b>people</b> <b>running</b> it began subjecting Genie to extreme {{physical and psychological}} abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again she would never see her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not bring herself to open her mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the writers had been to kill off Rhys {{at the end of}} the first series, but series creator Russell T Davies found it necessary to keep the show grounded through Rhys as Gwen evolved as a character. Producer Richard Stokes stated that [...] "without him, it simply becomes a sci-fi show about sci-fi <b>people,</b> <b>running</b> around and hunting aliens." [...] Following from the first series the production team decided to make Rhys less of a [...] "sap" [...] whilst continuing to use him as a contrast to Torchwood's activities and its charismatic leader Jack Harkness. Whilst early response to the character was mixed— the character was parodied as [...] "Barry Backstory"— subsequent reviews praised the character's larger role in later episodes.|$|E
500|$|The American designs, the [...] "SST" [...] project (for Supersonic Transport) {{were the}} Boeing 2707 and the Lockheed L-2000. These {{were to have}} been larger, with seating for up to 300 <b>people.</b> <b>Running</b> a few years behind Concorde, the Boeing 2707 was {{redesigned}} to a cropped delta layout; the extra cost of these changes helped to kill the project. The operation of US military aircraft such as the XB-70 Valkyrie and B-58 Hustler had shown that sonic booms were quite capable of reaching the ground, and the experience from the Oklahoma City sonic boom tests led to the same environmental concerns that hindered the commercial success of Concorde. The American government cancelled its SST project in 1971, after having spent more than $1billion.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} drafts of the script, there were [...] "so many copies of <b>people</b> <b>running</b> around the place" [...] {{which made the}} story too confusing, so Graham and the {{production}} crew worked {{to make it more}} rational. The episode also contains a subplot in which Rory helps and protects Jennifer as she is scared and affected by the Gangers, which proved a twist in Amy and Rory's relationship. Karen Gillan enjoyed the twist. Amy had previously always had Rory [...] "in the palm of her hand" [...] and a different side of the character was shown as she experienced the same emotions Rory felt when she seemed interested in the Doctor. Arthur Darvill also thought it gave Rory a chance to [...] "man up" [...] and be a hero by protecting someone.|$|E
500|$|The {{family first}} {{appeared}} on screen on 3 June 2003. Later on in the year Indian chef Madhur Jaffrey was cast in EastEnders as Dan's estranged wife, Pushpa. Jaffrey commented, [...] "I {{really wanted to do}} the role because Indian women are usually portrayed as so proper and withdrawn – the kind of women who just stay at home cooking and cleaning. I thought, 'How wonderful of EastEnders to write a character that is realistic.' What my character has done happens all the time in India; {{there are all kinds of}} stories of <b>people</b> <b>running</b> away and marrying their lovers. This is what commonly happens in those places, but somehow the image of Indian womanhood is different." [...] Pushpa was a guest character only appearing for the duration of a storyline that revealed Dan had been lying about her death and had actually left him for another man, Pradeep (Kaleem Janjua) Dan's best friend.|$|E
500|$|Much of Gwen's {{characterisation}} {{centers on}} her developing {{relationship with her}} partner Rhys. Eve Myles describes the character as Gwen's [...] "normality base". The relationship is tested by Gwen's affair with colleague Owen Harper (Gorman), a betrayal which Myles believes to be [...] "completely out of character" [...] for Gwen, explaining that the guilt experienced over her actions tears her to pieces. The production team had originally planned for Rhys {{to die in the}} first series but he was given a reprieve. Producer Richard Stokes explains that Rhys' presence keeps Gwen from losing her [...] "heart" [...] and that without him [...] "it simply becomes a sci-fi show about sci-fi <b>people,</b> <b>running</b> around and hunting aliens". Julie Gardner adds that in the discussion, the writers had felt they could not have written Gwen as ever recovering from Rhys' loss, and so chose not to kill off the character. In his analysis of Gwen, Daniel Rawcliffe opines that Rhys helps to keep her mental health intact, and argues that his presence prevents her from undergoing the same psychological deterioration as Suzie.|$|E
