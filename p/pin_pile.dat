40|$|In November 2011, the National Renewable Energy Center (narec) {{launched}} their offshore wind demonstrator project 'round 3 '. Narec commissioned SeaRoc {{to undertake the}} deployment and drilling operation of the Narec Offshore Anemometric Hub (NOAH). On this occasion, the Bio-Acoustic Research Consortium combining university and industry researchers conducted a study on noise and marine mammal occurrence before, during and after installation of the Noah platform. This paper describes the noise emission from {{the installation of the}} NOAH's jacket. The team preliminary undertook underwater ambient noise measurements at different seasons, and locations at the site. The results of these measurements are discussed in this paper. The <b>pin</b> <b>pile</b> drilling itself occurred at 3 nautical miles offshore Blyth and at a 40 m depth. The Newcastle research vessel Princess Royal was positioned at 500 m and 3 nautical miles from the NOAH's drilling. The engine and all electronic equipment on board, such as sonar and depth sensors were switched off during the <b>pin</b> <b>pile</b> drilling noise monitoring. At each position, a self-recorder hydrophone was deployed from a semi-submersible drifting buoy to reduce the effect of the swell (sea state 3), which could have affected the quality of the recordings. The deployment from a drifting buoy also has the advantage of reducing mechanical noise from the boat as the buoy drifts freely away from the vessel. Each recording lasted between 5 and 10 minutes and the buoy was then retrieved for another deployment at the next position. Sample measurements were taken at approximately 10 m depth and at a sampling rate of 312 kHz and 24 bits resolution. Matlab was used as a post-processing tool to analyse the data. Each file was processed on a 2 min average using a FFT of 216 points. The in-house code displays Sound Pressure Level (dB re 1 µParms) and Pressure Spectral Density (dB re 1 µParms 2 /Hz) with a 1 Hz resolution. The results demonstrate that the noise coming from the <b>pin</b> <b>pile</b> drilling was relatively low in comparison to the background noise. At 500 m from the drilling, the noise appears to be only 10 to 20 dB higher than the background noise over the frequency band 10 Hz to 50 kHz. Higher energy was concentrated between 100 Hz and 600 Hz reaching up to 100 dB re 1 µParms. Natural Environment Research Counci...|$|E

Underwater construction noise was close to ambient noise levels for gravity based foundations (about 115 dB re 1 µPa RMS), while <b>pin</b> <b>piling</b> and especially monopile piling produced excessive levels of underwater noise up to 194 dB re 1 µPa (zero to peak level at 750 m), attenuating to ambient noise levels {{at a distance of}} up to 70 km.

40|$|Abstract: To {{evaluate}} {{the responses of}} fixed and <b>pinned</b> <b>pile</b> groups under torsion, a method is presented to analyze the nonlinear behavior of free-standing pile groups with rigid pile caps. The method is capable of simulating the nonlinear soil response in the near field using p-y and τ-θ curves, the far-field interactions through Mindlin’s and Randolph’s elastic solutions, and the coupling effect of lateral resistance on torsional resistance of the individual piles using an empirical factor. Based on comparisons of the solutions for fixed- and pinned-head, 1 × 2, 2 × 2, and 3 × 3 pile groups subjected to torsion, {{it was found that}} pile-cap connection significantly influences the torsional capacity of pile groups and the assignment of applied torques in the pile groups. In this study, the applied torques for the pinned-head pile groups are only 44 %~ 64 % of those for the corresponding fixed-head pile groups at a twist angle of 2 °. Such a difference is mainly due to the change of the lateral resistances of individual piles in the groups...|$|R

40|$|Excessive post {{construction}} and differential settlements constitute an engineering challenge for structure founded on soft cohesive soil which caused instability and crack {{to the existing}} structure. Inadequacy of design for foundation supporting structure during the early stage of {{construction and}} less information on site investigation might be {{the main reason for}} this problem. Various methods of remedial works have been proposed and implemented for the existing foundation which has been encountered with this settlement problem such as underpinning <b>piles,</b> grouting, <b>pin</b> <b>piles</b> and etc. However, most of these methods require major excavation and disturbance to the existing structure. To overcome this problem, polyurethane (PU) injection pile and slab is proposed to replace the conventional underpinning pile. No excavation is required and only a small diameter hole is drilled on the existing slab foundation before injection of PU. Performance of this method is compared against lightweight concrete slab using finite element analysis called PLAXIS 2 D. From analysis that has been carried out, it shows that PU will eliminate the settlements with very minimal disturbance to existing structures, easy and fast installation as well as cost effective long term remedial measures compared to lightweight concrete slab...|$|R
40|$|The highway {{departments}} {{of the states}} which use integral abutments in bridge design were contacted in order to study the extent of integral abutment use in skewed bridges and to survey the different guidelines used for analysis and design of integral abutments in skewed bridges. The variation in design assumptions and pile orientations among the various states in their approach {{to the use of}} integral abutments on skewed bridges is discussed. The problems associated with the treatment of the approach slab, backfill, and pile cap, and the reason for using different pile orientations are summarized in the report. An algorithm based on a state-of-the-art nonlinear finite element procedure previously developed by the authors was modified and used to study the influence of different factors on behavior of piles in integral abutment bridges. An idealized integral abutment was introduced by assuming that the pile is rigidly cast into the pile cap and that the approach slab offers no resistance to lateral thermal expansion. Passive soil and shear resistance of the cap are neglected in design. A 40 -foot H pile (HP 10 X 42) in six typical Iowa soils was analyzed for fully restrained <b>pile</b> head and <b>pinned</b> <b>pile</b> head. According to numerical results, the maximum safe length for fully restrained pile head is one-half the maximum safe length for <b>pinned</b> <b>pile</b> head. If the pile head is partially restrained, the maximum safe length will lie between the two limits. The numerical results from an investigation of the effect of predrilled oversized holes indicate that if the length of the predrilled oversized hole is at least 4 feet below the ground, the vertical load-carrying capacity of the H pile is only reduced by 10 percent for 4 inches of lateral displacement in very stiff clay. With no predrilled oversized hole, the pile failed before the 4 -inch lateral displacement was reached. Thus, the maximum safe lengths for integral abutment bridges may be increased by predrilling. Four different typical Iowa layered soils were selected and used in this investigation. In certain situations, compacted soil (> 50 blow count in standard penetration tests) is used as fill on top of natural soil. The numerical results showed that the critical conditions will depend on the length of the compacted soil. If the length of the compacted soil exceeds 4 feet, the failure mechanism for the pile is similar to one in a layer of very stiff clay. That is, the vertical load-carrying capacity of the H pile will be greatly reduced as the specified lateral displacement increases...|$|R

A study has been initiated to develop a design framework for sliding PLET foundations, allowing a controlled movement of the foundation during its design life. Such a performance-based design needs to characterize displacements and rotations of the foundation during several cycles of large-amplitude foundation movement in order to provide a robust design. Series of scale model tests in the centrifuge of IFSTTAR in Nantes have been performed to validate the performance based design approach outlined by this study. These tests have focused on the influence of the interface roughness and degree of soil consolidation to characterize the soil response under in-plane loading...|$|R
50|$|One {{result was}} the Tripod foundation. The first design was drawn by OWT - Offshore Wind Technology in Leer (Germany) in 2005. The Tripod was {{integrally}} designed with the tower from this early beginning. The three-legged structure reaches from the sea bed up to typically 20m above the sea water level, keeping the bolted flange on top safely apart from {{the crest of the}} waves. This section allows to be outfitted onshore with all functionalities needed in terms of boat landing, cable guiding and last but not least corrosion protection systems. The central column is designed as an open system allowing an unrestricted water exchange in each tide cycle. This circumstance is beneficial when the corrosion protection system has to be designed for the inner surfaces.The Tripod is fixed with midsized <b>pin</b> <b>piles</b> at the sea bed. The piles might be pre piled or post piled. A suction bucket foundation was designed as well. The first tower section, called S3, is foreseen to be mounted offshore on top of the Tripod with a bolted flange connection. This section contains the outer service platform and the entry door. This section is independently accessible for electrical equipment and cold commissioning procedures. Additionally it provides simply height, what can be saved on Tripod side. The height of a Tripod amounts already about 60m for 40m water depth.|$|R

40|$|A Laplace {{transform}} is used {{to solve}} the problem of the steady state and transient response of a <b>pinned</b> head <b>pile</b> embedded into a viscoelastic Winkler soil medium. The pile is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam while the soil medium is modeled using a Winkler subgrade approach. Two analytical solutions are developed to specifically address both steady state and transient loads encountered during dynamic pile testing. After choosing a proper contour integration in the complex plane, inverse integration is evaluated. The steady state solutions are associated to the residues of the integration around the poles while the transient solutions are associated to the integration paths along the contour integration. The derived solutions are applied to a case history for which results of dynamic pile tests are available. Dynamic pile flexion is generated by delivering eccentric impact using a dynamic loading test module. Validity of the proposed solution is discussed basing on geotechnical campaign and recorded pile head bending moment and rotation rate. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{earthquake}} {{response of}} various types of pile foundations supporting a variety of bridge structures to liquefaction induced lateral spread displacement demands is analyzed using the concepts of pile ductility and <b>pile</b> <b>pinning.</b> The soil/pile model uses the stress-strain response of reinforced concrete and steel, incorporating both the axial and lateral loads for structural elements, and p-y curves to represent interface elements to assess the pile response during earthquake induced lateral spread displacement demands.; The analysis approach is incorporated in an improved design methodology using concepts documented in the FHWA "Recommended LRFD Guidelines for the Seismic Design of Highway Bridges (2003) ".; Case studies of earthquake events, during which lateral spread displacement has caused damage to the bridge pile foundations are revisited to examine the response of these piles using the methodology developed in the research.; Design examples of several bridges supported by various types of pile foundations are also presented and the pile response in terms of plastic hinge development, pile ductility ratio and pile curvature response are studied. It is shown using the methodology developed in this research that given the subsurface conditions, the liquefaction and lateral spread potential and the structural details of the piles at a given bridge site, one can reasonably assess how close the pile is to acceptable ductility levels in plastic hinge zones. The method also provides a robust approach to screen for the acceptability of existing bridge pile foundations subject to lateral spread during present day design earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|Landslides {{are very}} common within the {{residual}} soils and sedimentary rock of Southern Indiana. A {{substantial amount of}} the Indiana State budget is spent on road repair and maintenance from damage caused by landslide. The landslide remedial technique frequently applied by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) is the excavation and backfill method, which in most instances is successful. However, in many cases more liberal landslide treatments may be applied that would arrest movement, provide a sufficient safety factor, and at a lower cost. The objective {{of this study is}} to propose economically feasible landslide remedial methods that may be used as an alternative to the excavation and backfill method. “Unconventional” landslide remedial methods describe stabilization methods that are not commonly practiced in Indiana, and for which design criteria are not available. Unconventional stabilization methods will likely have the greatest benefit applied to relatively small landslides requiring constant maintenance because these landslides are in a delicate equilibrium. Relatively modest improvements in stability may be sufficient to stop persistent movements. Proposed landslide remedial methods are conventional horizontal drains, driven horizontal wick drains, driven recycled plastic <b>pins,</b> railroad rail <b>piles,</b> lime piles, biotechnical remediation, and gravity mass retaining systems. A landslide inventory containing various attribute information of geologic environment and landslide geometry was compiled. The inventory includes 284 landslides with attribute information of each individual landslide. Landslide locations were entered into a geographic information system (GIS) database along with geographic and geologic information. The constructed GIS database allowed easy correlation of landslide occurrence with geologic features. It is concluded that landslide occurrence is a function of topography and bedrock geology. Suitability of landslide stabilization methods depends upon the characteristics of the sliding mass, which include the geologic environment and geometry of the landslide. A landslide classification scheme was developed which recommends suitable remedial solutions based upon the landslide classification. Eleven landslide types are recognized by the classification scheme, which is based upon four landslide attributes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of tree stump extraction on the diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce Picea abies roots. I tested if the density of saproxylic beetles was {{the same in the}} interior layer of the stump storage piles as in the exterior layer. I also tested if the beetle density was as high or higher in piles as in remaining stumps at extraction clear-cuts and to test if they could be ecological traps. I tested if species at higher trophic level as well as red-listed species could be impacted negatively by stump extraction. A total of 110 root wood samples were collected from 6 clear-cuts and 6 extraction clear-cuts and 4 different piles in central Sweden near Uppsala, Lindesberg and Fågelfors. The clear-cuts were dominated by Norway spruce and were sampled 1 to 2 years after clear felling. Norway spruce is the most common tree species used in tree stump extraction. Insect were reared from the sampled roots in rearing boxes for 8 weeks. Insects were also sampled after the rearing box period by pealing the bark of the roots and putting the bark in Tullgren-funnels to sample the last insects inside the bark. The sampled Coleoptera were determined to species level. A total of 1379 beetles of 35 species were collected from the roots. Higher species richness was found inside the <b>piles</b> (<b>PIN)</b> than {{on the outside of the}} piles (POUT). Hardly any difference was found between the clear-cut (C) and extraction clear-cut (EC) in species-richness per root-sample, but a significant difference was found between the pile habitats. Common saproxylic species, like Dryocetes autographus and Hylastes cunicularius, showed increased abundance in C and EC but a decrease in the storage piles. The pest species Pityogenes chalcographus was only reared in PIN. Predatory species higher up in the trophic levels, like the staphylinid Nudobius lentus, were found in low abundance in C, EC and in POUT but not in PIN. This could mean that the piles can be an ecological trap to species at higher trophic levels as well as for some pest species. The results of this study indicates that tree stump extraction can cause a lower diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce roots and a decreased species richness if the stump piles constitutes an ecological trap. As a consequence, this can decrease the diversity and species richness in the surrounding area...|$|R
