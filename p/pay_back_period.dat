40|$|Poplar {{plantations}} are {{a category}} of fixed assets in forestry, i. e. the assets with a biological character. They are related to their site, they are cultivated for a relatively long time {{and they have a}} relatively long utilization cycle, with the yield development determined by the plantation growth and age. Plantations transfer their value gradually to the obtained products during the period of their harvesting, and, by the realization of the products, the means invested in the plantation establishment are reproduced. The period of investments in poplar growing can be relatively long, and so is the period of harvesting. Therefore, it is important to determine the time of the return of the capital invested in these and similar plantations. This paper presents the analysis of commercial profitability of poplar cultivation according to the indicator for the assessment of projects in agriculture and forestry - <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> <b>period.</b> The application of <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> <b>period</b> (PBP) calculation can affect greatly the reliability of predicting the degree of economic effectiveness of investments, and also the potential risks for the investor in his decisions on the investments in poplar cultivation.

40|$|The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} has a large consumption of energy. It is therefore interesting to see if this use of energy can be decreased. This would mean less use of fuel and lower emissions to the atmosphere. This study has been undertaken as a case study at Skoghall Board Mill, where the possibilities for decreased use of live steam by increased internal heat exchanging have been investigated. As a tool Pinch Technology has been used. This is a tool that makes it easier to see where the system has heat and cooling demand and at which temperatures. Using this as a base, it is then possible to identify where the potential for more internal heat exchange is possible and as a result one can reduce the steam demand. The mill has two power boilers in addition to the recovery boiler, one oil boiler and one bark boiler. The bark boiler is fired with both bark from the mill’s own debarking and purchased bark. The oil boiler has the highest marginal operating costs, thus a reduced steam demand will decrease usage of the oil boiler. By identifying the pinch violations in the system one can identify potential measures for increasing internal heat exchanging. Four alternatives with different degrees of heat recovery have been identified. For these cases the investment costs have been calculated and the technical consequences considered. The calculations were carried out for winter operation. Two cases were considered for potential fuel savings: oil fuel and bark fuel. The results show that the use of live steam can be reduced by 10 to 20 MW. The <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> <b>periods</b> for these investments lie around one year when the saved fuel is oil.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{explores the}} {{economic}} feasibility of the underfloor heating {{system for the}} climatic conditions of Beirut. A case study of a typical residential room (150 m 2) is selected to compare its heating energy requirement when using either the conventional convective heating system or the underfloor heating system at similar comfort and indoor air quality conditions. Two mathematical models are developed, a steady space thermal model to establish the energy consumption at the peak load and a transient simulation model to find the energy consumption during the winter heating season. In addition, the economic feasibility of the underfloor heating system is assesd when integrated with solar energy. Based on the steady space model, the calculated peak heating load is reduced by 20 % when the test space is heated by the underfloor heating system and a thermal comfort level of PPD 18. 3 % is achieved for a floor temperature of 27. 4 ºC. The simulation results of the transient space model indicates that the seasonal heating energy consumption is reduced by 18 % and that the yearly energy savings is $ 104 for an on-off control strategy that maintains a PMV comfort level greater than- 0. 5. The <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> <b>period</b> of the underfloor heating system is 10 years for an initial incremental cost of $ 850.

Due to the high costs associated with electricity and fossil fuels, biomass energy continues to supply the bulk (81 %) of industrial energy demands. However unsustainable harvesting of tradition biomass fuels (firewood and charcoal) is leading to depletion and causing a hike in prices of this important energy source. This study determined current thermal loads for 4 small scale industries, the costs of the fuels used, possible agro waste replacement options and economic comparisons of gasification using these fuel alternatives. Questionnaires, interviews and quantitative measurements of the various parameters were undertaken to establish current fuel usage and costs. Economic and emission reductions analysis were conducted using RETScreen energy planning tool. Results of indicated that the current combustion and heat transfer devices are very inefficient leading to intensive energy demands. Proposed gasifier systems of the range of 30 kW to 100 kW fuel power, would cost between US$ 6, 156. 35 and US$ 20, 371. 20.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the economics of a planned system of supplementary irrigation and pasture improvement on a typical Richmond Valley dairy farm. In developing the plan for the farm, consideration is, given to a range of assumptions concerning the farmer's resources of labour and machinery. Similarly, three different levels of production response are considered; these represent assumed variations in the managerial skills of farmers. Thus, with a typical initial farm production of 8. 650 lb. butterfat, the gains assumed are: (1) an increase of 4, 830 lb. butterfat under "good management"; (2) an increase of 6, 040 lb. butterfat under "outstanding management"; and (3) an increase of 3, 620 lb. butterfat under "average management". For each set of assumptions, on the production gain achieved and the resource situation of the typical farmer, a credit budget is developed for a ten-year period. With "good management", when the only major investment is the irrigation plant and when the farmer does not need to employ extra labour, income gains are sufficient to ensure rapid repayment of the overdraft. If, however, the farmer is older and finds it necessary to employ a youth, the "pay back period" is much longer than ten years and the plan is clearly not attractive, except as a means of financing the return of a son to the property. Again, if {{there is no need to}} employ extra labour, the income generated is sufficient to cover investment in a tractor and implements, as well as the irrigation plant, with a <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> <b>period</b> of ten years, or in a herringbone milkshed in the third year of development, with a <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> <b>period</b> of eleven years.

Failures in the boiler side equipment have been considerably responsible for this with a huge financial loss to the country. This project studies the suitable designs for design faults and shortcomings of LVPS to improve {{the reliability of the}} power plant related to the boiler side. By analyzing the past data until the first overhaul of the power plant, it is revealed that the main failures are arisen in the primary air system, coal pulverizing system, secondary air and flue gas systems related to the boiler side. In addition to the low reliability of primary air system, it is not supplying the required total amount of primary air to the system to run the pulverizers within the safe margins. Installing a new primary air fan in the system not only meets the deficiency, but also improves the reliability. Failures related to the pitch controllers of forced draft fans and induced draft fans resulting to high vibrations and high bearing temperatures directly affect to the low reliability in the secondary air and flue gas system. Variable speed drivers to control the air flow instead of fan pitch controlling or inlet vane controlling methods are discussed in this paper. According to the past data of the plant, 53 % of failures arose in the pulverizing system have been recovered within ten hours. Rearranging the system with pulverized coal storages for ten hours with a suitable fire protection system is also discussed here. Considering financial losses of these deficiencies, simple <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> <b>periods</b> of each of proposed implementations lies well within the acceptable limits...|$|R
40|$|Sustainability in {{the built}} {{environment}} is becoming a strong force {{in the construction industry}} to achieve social and environmental benefits and to lower negative environment impacts. The research objectives of this study were to identify the main drivers and barriers of sustainable design and construction in the US construction industry and to prioritise the identified drivers and barriers with respect to implementation of sustainability in the construction industry. To achieve the research objectives, this study identified the main drivers and barriers of sustainable design and construction factors with a two-step process, including an in-depth literature review and an experts' review. The identified drivers and barriers were then prioritised using a survey research method using a survey instrument developed by the authors. The sample used in the survey was comprised of members in the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) North Carolina (NC) Triangle Chapter. USGBC NC Triangle Chapter members were selected for the survey because of their interest in sustainable design and construction practices in North Carolina. After collecting data from the survey participants, the authors developed descriptive statistics to rank the main drivers and barriers of sustainable design and construction. The result indicated that the most important driving factors of sustainable design and construction were energy conservation, improving indoor environmental quality, environmental/resource conservation, and waste reduction. In addition, the most significant barriers to sustainable design and construction were first cost premium of the project, long <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> <b>periods</b> from sustainable practices, tendency to maintain current practices, and limited knowledge and skills of subcontractors. Based on these findings, the study suggests the direction of sustainability policies and programmes as well as the direction of future research and development.
