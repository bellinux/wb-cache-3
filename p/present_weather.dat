500|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a special}} type of weather map which provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations. [...] Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea-level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical map to help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts. [...] Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. [...] For example, an H may represent high pressure, implying fair weather. [...] An L {{on the other hand}} may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Low pressure also creates surface winds deriving from high pressure zones. [...] Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the <b>present</b> <b>weather</b> at various locations on the weather map. [...] In addition, areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.|$|E
