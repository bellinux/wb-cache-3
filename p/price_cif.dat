The excess production has {{allowed for the}} expansion of the export sector, converting Chile in a net exporter in 2001. A relevant question in this new market scenario is how this Structural change can affect milk prices paid to producer,; in Chile. the consequences of this Structural change were explored in this study using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model and cointegration analysis. The results indicated that the domestic, CIF (Cost. Insurance, Freight) and FOB (Free Oil Board) prices were cointegrated, implying that changes in the import and export prices are transmitted to the domestic market affecting the milk price paid to producers. Prior to 200 1, the import <b>price</b> (<b>CIF)</b> was the relevant reference dictating the movements of the domestic price. After 2001, the export price (FOB) became the reference, whereas the CIF price was no longer significant. the parameters of the VEC model SLIcroest that the conitegrating relation between CIF and domestic prices for the first period Under analysis (1990 - 2000) was clearer than that between FOB and domestic prices for the second period (2001 - 2007 / 3). the price elasticity for the FOB-domestic price vector had a large confidence interval, which is Why it IS difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the impact Of future FOB fluctuations Oil the milk price paid to producers in Chile after 2001...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} of the thesis primary focused {{on the effectiveness of}} law No. 10 / 1995 about Customs to stengthen Customs function in Indonesia. As national law product, the new customs law has specific things which are not covered by previous customs law determined by Netherland Colonial Government and Material Penal Provisions (KUHP) and Formai Penal Provisions (KUHAP). Based on the above reason, the matter lodged in this research is how effective Las No. 10 / 1995 on law perception and to accomodate national needs, matter of objection and appeals, as customs law enforcer, the expeditious flow of goods process, also customs duty income. To solve and describe the above matter the research using normative juridical approach and completed with sociological approach and quantitative analysis. Therefore, the research besides observed law in books also observed law as law in action. The discoveries of the research are : The effectiveness of law No. 10 / 1995 may look by the outcome of law produd, i. e. three previous customs law become one customs law which based the phyiosophies on Pancasila and UUD 1945. The outcome of the quality/effectiveness of the product of Law No. 10 / 1995 may look by the successful' to make a) the smoothness of the flow of goods by seff assessment system, application of selective examination, also release of goods is not tied to payment process. b) the smoothness of customs declaration whether export declaration or- import declaration by the provisions of Law No. 10 / 1995. Besides lodgment of customs declaration by form, also lodgment of Customs declaration by disket or via electronic data interchange. So the effectiveness may look by the time needed for the process. c) the using of high technology container X-ray for physically inspections. The effectiveness of special programme to reach certain outcome may outlook by the using of profiling, targeting, verification and auditing, so the control system focused on investigating of book keeping and Wing of documents and correspondence concerning imports and exports. Thing which can not be ignored is possibility of argue. In this matter, the users of customs services are provided With rights to file objections, appeals against decisions made by the customs officials. The objections and the appeals besides regulated in provisions of national law also regulated in statements or agreement which conducted by several nations such as ASEAN Agreement on Customs, ASEAN Customs Vision 2020 Vision Statement also International Convention on the simplification and harmonization of customs procedures. The argue which can not be ignored needs fair solution which needs fast, cheap and simply process and procedure. The effectiveness of law enforcement also covered by Law No. 10 / 1995 which include administrative sanction for the violation of customs administration by fine punishment which the amount of flne ang things of violation written inarticles of Law No. 10 / 1995 also the violation of customs penal provisions which are fiscal violations described dearly in Law No, 10 / 1995. Specificaly, Law No. 10 / 1995 regulated different things such as : concerning formai penal : 1) 	Penal threat against trial is equal to final penal. 2) 	Imprison punish ment subtitute by fine penalty in case of criminal prosecution is directed to a legal person as written in article 108 La No. 10 / 1995. 3) 	The fine which is not paid by the sentence, asset and/or eaming of the sentence shall be taken as the subtitute, as written In article 110 paragraph 1 Customs Law. 4) 	Expiration of the law suft as regulated in article 111 customs law. Things related with formal penal are : 1) 	The termination of the investigation for the state revenue purposes is written in article 113 2) 	Passing on the result of the investigation (SPDP) to general Prosecutor as written in article 112 paragraph 3 Customs Law 3) 	Execution for confiscation of goods for the state written in article 109 Customs Law All of things described above besides effected to more effective of law inforcement also state fast services, cheap and simple related to formal penal and considering with Lex Specielis Derogate Lex Generalis. The effectiveness to reach fundamental goal accomadated in law. No. 10 / 1995, as protection function for domestic industries by a) giving facilities of exemption/suspended for customs duty and tax of imported goods of raw material and support material to produce exported goods. b. protection domestic industries from material injury cause of dumping and subsidy practice of exported goods which imported to Indonesia, to the goods will be applied Anti Dumping dities and Countervailing duties. 	Law No. 10 / 1995 about customs has separation of sub systems of imported goods clearance process, revenue collection process, control princip. The three things are separated to warrant the expeditous flow of goods so there is no high cost economy that customs user paid as the wish. The high cost economy may be avoided by Directorate General of Customs and Excise together with Customs Services Users. Concerning the above reason, Directorate General of Customs and Excise may acts one of customs functions as trade facilitator which may smoother the flow of goods. 	Directorate General of Customs and Excise has one of its functions as to prevent violation against customs law and take action on goods in performing the task by virtue of customs law and investigate an offence against customs law. Another law enforcement which Is new authority Is tax collection implemented with "Surat Paksaw regulated by Law No. 19 / 1997 Activities of dity collection by Directorate General of Customs and Excise is the implementation one of primary tasks of Directorate General of Customs and Excise i. e.

Due to data availability, 15 monthly data from January 1995 to December 2005 (132 observations) are used to test transmission effects before the full implementation of the CAP Luxembourg agreement, while bi-weekly data from January 2006 to December 2015 (260 observations) are used to test for transmission post implementation of the agreement. For butter, a representative EU and a World price series are considered. The EU prices are weekly Dutch Dairy Board wholesale prices, as published by Agra Europe. They have been converted to monthly and bi-weekly data by simply averaging weekly prices. The World butter prices are reported by the USDA. 16 These consist of FOB (Free on Board) wholesale Oceania export prices which can be considered as proxy World prices. 17 Crude oil prices are Europe Brent FOB prices and were obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). 18 Lastly, two sources for palm oil prices are considered. For the first period, from January 1995 to December 2005, monthly prices from the World Bank 19 are used. For the second period, from January 2006 to December 2015, palm oil prices are sourced from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. 20 In particular, crude palm oil <b>prices</b> <b>CIF</b> (Carriage, Insurance, Freight inclusive) at Rotterdam are used.

During the late sixties and early seventies the Sahelian drought made the country painfully aware how dependent its agriculture is on rainfall. Irrigation and full water control systems along the major rivers became the "priority of priorities" in the recent Senegalese national plans. In the Senegal River Valley two major types of irrigation schemes had been implemented along the river valley since 1973 : large scale and small scale irrigated perimeters. The objectives are to increase rice production and reduce dependence on foreign imports of rice. This paper analyzed {{the two types of}} irrigation schemes in the Senegal River Valley and compares the financial and economic cost of producing rice in each of them with the average <b>CIF</b> <b>price</b> of rice delivered to the capital city Dakar. The analysis shows that for large irrigated perimeters the economic and financial cost of locally produced rice delivered to Dakar range from 132 to 233 percent of the economic and financial average <b>CIF</b> <b>price,</b> respectively. For small perimeters the economic and financial costs are, respectively, 140 and 125 percent of the <b>CIF</b> <b>prices.</b> Costs for both large scale and small scale perimeters are relatively high for the following reasons: a) Senegal rice imports consist of broken milled rice from Southeast Asia which is the least expensive quality of rice on the world market; and b) Managerial problems which can be significantly improved if more consistent policies toward irrigated rice production are defined and applies, and if the land development agency concerned with the Senegal River Valley is reorganized.

Several Latin American countries have announced their intention to challenge the new EU trade policy by initiating a new WTO complaint. In this paper, we first propose an analysis of the two WTO arbitration awards that ruled against the initial EU tariff proposals. We show that the arbitrators’ awards are incomplete notably because they do not explain why CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) import unit values in the EU- 15 from MFN suppliers are much higher than FOB (Free on Board) export unit values in corresponding MFN countries adjusted by all relevant costs that should theoretically be added to transform FOB into <b>CIF</b> <b>prices.</b> One plausible explanation to this apparent paradox is that reported <b>CIF</b> <b>prices</b> include at least part of quota rents generated by the tariff-rate quota policy.

The {{article describes the}} construction and two-years experience of usage of {{the first version of}} such a system. For dating turning points we used a seasonally adjusted industrial production index as a reference series. Then forty indicators were examined, in order to decide whether they are or are not the leading ones. After testing them against turning points of industrial production, we included seven series in our system of leading indicators for Russia: [1] Effective demand (assessments), diffusion index (IET Surveys); [2] Stocks of finished goods (assessments), diffusion index (IET Surveys); [3] Crude oil <b>price</b> (Urals <b>CIF</b> Med); [4] Real exchange rate of the ruble; [5] Growth of internal financial resources (assessments), diffusion index (CEA Surveys); [6] Stock price index (“Moscow Times ” dollar index); [7] Real interest rate (MIACR-overnight). Finally we calculated a composite leading index and a diffusion leading index. Two years experience showed that their behaviour as leading indicators is quite satisfactory since January 1994 (the moment when the slump, which had been related to the transformation from a planned to a market-oriented economy, was over). The ways for further refining the procedure are quite obvious, too.

We focus on the aggregate demand for crude oil in EU with the aim of investigating the degree of substitutability of crude oil imports from the Former Soviet Union countries (FSU) and crude oil imports from four alternative regions (America, Middle East, Europe, Africa). Following Fuss (1977) and Serletis (2010) we employ an econometric model of intra-fuel substitution, using a nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimator, to assess the aforementioned degree of substitutability in terms of Morishima elasticities of substitution. We use the most recent dataset, published by the European Commission, consisting of a collection of imported volumes and <b>CIF</b> <b>prices</b> of crude oil by country of origin.

40|$|Imports are {{increasingly}} becoming a {{significant source of}} Japan’s pork supply. Japan’s share of imports to total consumption increased from 9 percent in 1980 to 24 percent in 1990, reaching a maximum of 44 percent in 1996. Under the World Trade Organization (WTO) safeguard provisions for pork, Japan can raise its gate price by 24 percent when imports in a given quarter are 119 percent higher than the average imports of the last three years of the same quarter. Japan has already invoked the safeguard provision twice since the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) was signed in 1995. In both cases, the level and volatility of retail <b>prices</b> increased; the <b>CIF</b> values of imports increased, making the impact on the government of Japan (GOJ) tax revenue uncertain; the level of imports and stocks increased; and the timing of imports changed. New underlying parameter estimates suggest that the reduction in pork exporters’ profit is three times higher when the Japanese General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) safeguard is invoked, providing foreign pork suppliers an incentive to collude to avoid exceeding the trigger. Workable and efficient allocation rules are constructed with a multi-plant monopolist structure that allows trade of quota. This collusion is welfareimproving since the safeguard induces more inefficiencies, including larger deadweight loss and a shift from low cost to high cost pork supply...|$|R
40|$|Japan’s dairy {{industry}} is under heavy governmental regulation. This has serious consequences; for instance, {{controls on the}} imports of butter leads to periodic butter shortages. The collection of raw milk from farmers is monopolized by agricultural cooperatives in the region, which blend the raw milk from many farmers and sell it to dairy processing firms. Therefore, there is no opportunity for farmers to save money, increase quality and {{reap the benefits of}} a higher quality product. Regarding pork, Japan’s tariffs are highly irregular. Japan imposes a specific tariff of ¥ 482 per kilogram on inexpensive pork parts imported at a <b>CIF</b> <b>price</b> less than ¥ 64. 53 per kg. For imported pork at the <b>CIF</b> import <b>price,</b> which is between ¥ 64. 53 and ¥ 524 per kg, Japan uses a “gate price system” in which the tariff equals the difference between the benchmark price of ¥ 546. 53 and the <b>CIF</b> import <b>price.</b> Imported pork products that are more expensive than the ¥ 524 per kg (expensive pork parts) are subject to a conventional ad valorem tariff of 4. 3 %. This system maintains a domestic price of at least ¥ 524 /kg regardless of quality. It also produces a huge incentive to lie about the true import price. Another incentive is to mix expensive and cheap pork parts to reduce the average import price to ¥ 524 per kg in order to minimize tariffs to be paid. This system discourages Japanese farmers from producing high quality pork, since expensive imports may be sold cheaper as part of the mixed pork shipment. Agricultural reform should be fundamental, not cosmetic, since the whole system needs to be overhauled.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 This study {{attempts}} {{to show that}} competitive advantage alone does not determine the directions of trade in kraft liner. Trade depends on comparative advantage and especially on familiarity with foreign demand. Implications from international trade theories guided this study of trade in kraft liner. Future demand in the E. E. C. for foreign kraft liner was deduced from estimates of corrugated production related to a basic economic indicator in each member country. The competitive advantage of each supplying area [...] British Columbia, Eastern Canada, Sweden, Finland and the Southern United States [...] was obtained by analyzing production and transportation costs to the E. E. C. The competitive advantage of each supplying area [...] defined as {{the difference between the}} <b>CIF</b> <b>price</b> and total cost (production plus transportation costs) [...] was calculated in order to see if it explained fully past and actual directions of trade. As the U. S. domestic market represents an alternative to export, the possible influence of domestic trade on export was also considered. Marketing efforts developed in the E. E. C. by U. S. firms were used to explain discrepancies between actual trade and that indicated by competitive advantage. A survey of U. S. firms' export marketing practices in the E. E. C. showed that the channel of distribution and product differentiation were important factors in determining trade. The relation between probability, of repeated exports (export loyalty) and sales abroad of U. S. subsidiaries in the pulp and paper industry were shown by use of a Markov chain process. This model was then used to determine the E. E. C. 's future share of U. S. exports of kraft liner. A regression model was developed to formulate relevant economic relationships so as to predict the future level of U. S. exports of kraft liner to the E. E. C. Finally, implications were drawn concerning techniques of export prediction and an appropriate marketing strategy for a potential exporter...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the Korean dairy {{industry}} has been affected by considerable reductions in non-tariff barriers {{as a result of}} trade liberalisation. The dairy marketing system in particular has had many regulations and barriers removed. The question arises as to the effect of trade liberalisation and reductions in protection on imported dairy product marketing margins in Korea. This study determined imported dairy product marketing margins in Korea and assessed how they had changed over the past 15 years. The most important factors responsible for the trends and fluctuations observed in those margins were identified and estimated. An attempt at a product-focused method was made on cheese and skim milk powder (SMP), which are generally representative of dairy products as a whole. Descriptive and econometric methods were both used to identify the most important determinants of the aggregate cost of processing and distributing imported dairy products. A cheese (MMCHE) model and a SMP (MMSMP) model were developed and estimated. The two models estimated cheese and SMP marketing margins respectively as functions of exchange rates, trade liberalisation, wage rates and transportation costs. Both models were estimated using standard and stepwise regressions. Results obtained from this analysis suggest that changes in earnings (wages) were the strongest influence on imported dairy product marketing margins during the past 15 years. However, these results cannot explain the fall in cheese and SMP marketing margins after 1995 as this coincided with a rise in wage rates. The increase in CIF (Cost of Insurance and Freight) prices for these products was largely responsible for the smaller margins. Because exchange rates are a large element of <b>CIF</b> <b>price,</b> it is believed that marketing margins were closely associated with the value of the exchange rate. Conclusions are based on descriptive indicators and an econometric analysis that examined the relationships between economic factors and marketing margins. The impact of trade liberalisation on imported dairy product marketing margins was mixed with other economic factors. This study concludes that trade liberalisation has not in general been associated with lower imported dairy product marketing margins in Korea. Labour costs (wages) appear to have been the most important influence on those margins during the period 1985 - 98...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a more {{consistent}} and flexible method for embedding a target country’s domestic IRIO table into an existing ICIO table. The existing efforts mentioned above can be considered a good starting point. However, some important problems in the existing works remain unsolved. One is consistency of terms used for valuation in the IO tables. For example, the official WIOT uses basic prices, while China’s IRIO table uses producer prices. Without appropriately adjusting China’s IRIO from producer’s prices to basic prices in advance, potential discrepancies may arise to some extent in the process of linking these two tables. This is mainly because taxation and transportation margin at the product level may be different across domestic regions or sectors. In addition, the import data in China’s IRIO table are at <b>CIF</b> <b>prices,</b> which also should be adjusted before linking with an ICIO table since tariff, import duty, and international transportation margins and insurance may vary across countries of origin at the product level. The other challenge is how to improve the reliability of the target country’s regional trade data (exports and imports for goods and services). These data provide very important information to be used in allocating the international trade flow between the target country’s domestic regions and other countries. However, domestic regional customs data may not provide true domestic destination information of imported goods and domestic origin information of exported goods. For example, officially published Japanese regional customs data are based on the reporter’s location information rather than that of producer and user locations. Therefore, when using a target country’s domestic regional customs data, careful treatment and adjustment should be done in advance. Another problem is the control and evaluation of estimation errors. Meng et al. (2013 a) and Inomata and Meng (2013) use the so-called split method to link target countries’ domestic IRIO table with an ICIO table. This method keeps the balance of the existing ICIO column-wise, but without detailed treatments of row-wise estimation discrepancies. Meng et al. (2013 b) use a linear programing method to do similar linking work resulting in a balanced ICIO table with a target country’s IRIO table embedded. However, the selection of constraint equations in the linear programing method is not unique. In order to get a converged result with the smallest discrepancy level, personal experiences play a very important role in their estimation.|$|R
40|$|The Role of Market Speculation in Rising Oil Prices: {{the large}} oil price {{fluctuations}} occurred from 2003 to 2008 has raised {{many questions about}} their causes. Many empirical studies have attempted to understand how oil price fluctuations are driven by changes in both market fundamentals and speculative pressures. In this regard, some problems arise such as: the use of unreliable data like the global level of inventories or the specification of {{a vast number of}} arbitrary restrictions for the models. In this study I try to isolate, coherently with the view of Knittel and Pindyck(2016) and inspired by Kilian's works, the speculative effect on the short-term spot price fluctuations determined by structural forward-looking behavioral shocks produced in the futures market. Exploiting a dataset used in Kilian and Murphy (2012), CFTC data (period 1999 M 1 - 2008 M 6) and taking advantage of the standard theory of storage {{we will be able to}} verify, with a Blanchard-Quah structural approach, that the impact of these shocks is remarkable but not the prevalent one in magnitude. Instead, it would seem that speculative inventory holdings may have played a much more important role. The study named "European Energy Security: the Substitutability of European Crude Oil Imports from Russia" is meant to be a contribution to the current debate on the diversification possibilities in EU for reducing the dependency on Russian crude oil and ensuring the energy security of the European Union (EU). We focus on the aggregate demand for crude oil in EU with the aim of investigating the degree of substitutability of crude oil imports from the Former Soviet Union countries (FSU) and crude oil imports from four alternative regions (America, Middle East, Europe, Africa). Following Fuss (1977) and Serletis (2010) we employ an econometric model of intra-fuel substitution, using a nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimator, to assess the aforementioned degree of substitutability in terms of Morishima elasticities of substitution. We use the most recent dataset, published by the European Commission, consisting of a collection of imported volumes and <b>CIF</b> <b>prices</b> of crude oil by country of origin. The results indicate that the crude oil provided by former Soviet Union (FSU) countries is strongly substitutable with those imported from African and Middle Eastern countries whilst it is not substitutable with those imported from European and American countries. Predictability Information Criterion for Selecting Stochastic Pricing Models: pricing models of derivative instruments usually fail to provide reliable results when risks rise and financial crises occur. More advanced stochastic pricing models try to improve the fitting results adding risk factors and/or parameters to the models, incurring the risk of overfitted results. Drawing on these observations, it is proposed a generalization of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) suitable to evaluate forecasting power of alternative stochastic pricing models for any fixed arbitrary forecasting time-horizon. The Predictability Information Criterion (PIC) differs from the classical criteria for evaluating statistical models as it assumes that the random variable to study can (or cannot) be partially predictable, which makes it particularly suitable for studying stochastic pricing models coherently with the semimartingale definition of the price process. On the basis of this assumption the criterion measures and compares the uncertainty of the predictions of two different alternative models when prices are (or are not) predictable. We conclude with a focus on the crude oil market by comparing GBM and OU stochastic processes that are commonly used for modeling West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil spot price returns in derivative pricing models...|$|R
