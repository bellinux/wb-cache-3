Stages were categorised as third-, second-, first- and special-category, with the more difficult climbs rated higher. The most difficult climb of the race, the Alto Ermita de Alba on Stage 16, was given its own category as the Cima Alberto Fernández.

5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Most {{stages of the}} race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and hors catégorie, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Fourth-category awarded 1 rider with 1 point; third-category awarded 2 riders, the first with 2 points; second-category awarded 4 riders, the first with 5 points; and first-category awarded 6 riders, the first with 10 points; and hors catégorie awarded ten riders, the first with 25 points.

5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Points were {{awarded to the}} riders that reached {{the summit of the}} most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, first-category and hors catégorie, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. In the 2010 Tour, any hors catégorie, first-, or second-category climb awarded double points if it was the last of the stage. In 2011, only the summit stage finishes awarded double points, specifically stages 12, 14, 18 and 19. Pre-race analysis speculated that the winner would be more likely, under this system, to be a general classification contender than in years past. This speculation proved accurate, as Samuel Sánchez, who finished sixth in the general classification, won the mountains classification, and the top three finishers in the general classification were in the top five of the mountains classification. The leader wore a white jersey with red <b>polka</b> <b>dots.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1950, Kusama was {{depicting}} abstracted natural {{forms in}} watercolor, gouache, and oil, primarily on paper.

5000|$|During {{the course}} of the series' run, <b>Polka</b> <b>Dot</b> Door had three {{producers}} who significantly contributed {{to the development of the}} show: Original producer-director Peggy Liptrott (1971), L.

He went on to create and produce two multi-award-winning series for TVOntario, Join In! and <b>Polka</b> <b>Dot</b> Shorts. The accompanying background music throughout the show was played [...] "live to tape" [...] by virtuoso Canadian pianists Herbie Helbig (1971-1984) and John Arpin (1985-1993).|$|R

25|$|The bikini {{precursors}} {{as well as}} {{the first}} modern bikinis were made of cotton and jersey and were mostly striped or monochrome. Réard introduced the first printed material for bikini. By the 1970s, when American women were catching up with the more daring Europeans attitudes, bikini variants started to diversify widely. Flower patterns became popular in the late 1960s. Designers like Tom Brigance at Lord & Taylor department store cut his swimwear from colorful cottons in stripes, large prints, and <b>polka</b> <b>dots</b> to give early bikinis a more tailored look.|$|E

In February 1989, the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship was deactivated and The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin) were the final title holders. Sapphire debuted in November 1989 on Saturday Night's Main Event as a 'fan' cheering on Dusty Rhodes at ringside in his match against Big Boss Man. Sapphire began to manage Rhodes, who adapted Rhodes' gimmick as she adorned black outfits with yellow <b>polka</b> <b>dots.</b> Sapphire and Rhodes later feuded with Randy Savage and Sensational Sherri and wrestled in a tag team match at WrestleMania VI.

25|$|In 2010, Kusama {{designed}} a Town Sneaker styled bus, which she titled Mizutama Ranbu (Wild Polka Dot Dance) and whose route travels through her {{home town of}} Matsumoto. In 2011, she was commissioned to design the front cover of millions of pocket London Underground maps; the result is entitled <b>Polka</b> <b>Dots</b> Festival in London (2011). Coinciding with an exhibition of the artist's work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2012, a 120-foot reproduction of Kusama's painting Yellow Trees (1994) covered a condominium building under construction in New York's Meatpacking District. That same year, Kusama conceived her floor installation Thousands of Eyes as a commission for the new Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law, Brisbane.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, {{she moved}} to the United States, {{settling}} in New York City, where she produced a series of paintings influenced by abstract expressionism. Switching to sculpture and installation as her primary media, Kusama became a fixture of the New York avant-garde during the early 1960s when she became associated with the pop-art movement. Embracing the rise of the hippie counterculture of the late 1960s, Kusama came to public attention when she organized a series of happenings in which naked participants were painted with brightly colored <b>polka</b> <b>dots.</b> Although largely forgotten after departing the New York art scene in the early 1970s, Kusama is now acknowledged {{as one of the most}} important living artists to come out of Japan, and an important voice of the avant-garde.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Kusama {{organized}} outlandish happenings in conspicuous spots like Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge, often involving nudity {{and designed}} to protest the Vietnam War. In one, she wrote {{an open letter to}} Richard Nixon offering to have vigorous sex with him if he would stop the Vietnam war. Between 1967 and 1969 she concentrated on performances held with the maximum publicity, usually involving Kusama painting <b>polka</b> <b>dots</b> on her naked performers, as in the Grand Orgy to Awaken the Dead at the MoMA (1969), which took place at the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. During the unannounced event, eight performers under Kusama's direction removed their clothing, stepped nude into a fountain, and assumed poses mimicking the nearby sculptures by Picasso, Giacometti, and Maillol.|$|E
