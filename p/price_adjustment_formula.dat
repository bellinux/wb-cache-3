40|$|The {{standard}} quadratic <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{cost function}} makes no allowance for firm size or for scale economies. Incorporating quadratic <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs into the profit function, a firm’s speed of <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> is both {{shown to be}} a positive/negative function of its size when firms have scale economies/diseconomies with regard to these costs and to be a negative function of market power. The intuitive explanation is that large firms that can defray this type of cost have less reason to slow <b>price</b> <b>adjustment,</b> while firms with market power are better able to offset <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs by slowing their speed of <b>price</b> <b>adjustment.</b> These results are used to derive an industry error correction model of pricing where the speed of <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> is a weighted average of the firm effects. Estimation of the model is carried out on data obtained from nine two-digit Australian manufacturing industries during the period 1994 : 3 to 2002 : 2. The empirical results suggest that the speed of <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> is positively related to the size of firms within an industry and negatively related to industry concentration.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{relation}} between the stability of a competitive equilibrium (CE) and the <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism used to attain that equilibrium point. Using two specific examples, a three-commodity exchange economy with a unique competitive equilibrium (Scarf’s global instability example) and a two-commodity, two-trader type exchange economy with multiple competitive equilibria, we show that the stability of a CE depends critically upon the dynamics of the <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism. A particular CE may be unstable under one <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism but stable under another. The joint dynamics of the chosen <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism and the given economy determines the overall stability of its competitive equilibrium.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{previous}} study {{has suggested that}} drug <b>price</b> <b>adjustments</b> allow physicians in Taiwan to gain greater profit by prescribing generic drugs. To better understand the effect of <b>price</b> <b>adjustments</b> on physician choice, this study used renin-angiotensin drugs (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) to {{examine the impact of}} <b>price</b> <b>adjustments</b> on utilization of and expenditures on patented and off-patent drugs with the same therapeutic indication. Methods Using the Taiwan’s Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (2005), we identified 147, 157 patients received ACEIs and/or ARBs between 1997 and 2008. The annual incident and prevalent users of ACEIs, ARBs and overall renin-angiotensin drugs were examined. Box-Tiao intervention analysis was applied {{to assess the impact of}} <b>price</b> <b>adjustments</b> on monthly utilization of and expenditures on these drugs. ACEIs were divided into patented and off-patent drugs, off-patent ACEIs were further divided into original brands and generics, and subgroup analyses were performed. Results The number of incident renin-angiotensin drug users decreased over the study period. The number of prevalent ARB users increased and exceeded the cumulative number of first-time renin-angiotensin drug users starting on ARBs, implying that some patients switched from ACEIs to ARBs. After <b>price</b> <b>adjustments,</b> long term trend increases in utilization were observed for patented ACEIs and ARBs; a long-term trend decrease was observed for off-patent ACEIs; long-term trend change was not significant for overall renin-angiotensin drugs. Significant long-term trend increases in expenditures were observed for patented ACEIs after <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> in 2007 (200. 9 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 0088) and in ARBs after <b>price</b> <b>adjustments</b> in 2001 (173. 4 %, p[*] Conclusions <b>Price</b> <b>adjustments</b> did not achieve long-term cost savings for overall renin-angiotensin drugs.

40|$|In this paper, {{we suggest}} an {{algorithm}} for <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> towards a partial market equilibrium. Its convergence properties are crucially based on Convex Analysis. Our <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{corresponds to a}} subgradient scheme for minimizing a special nonsmooth convex function. This function is the total excessive revenue of the market’s participants [16, 18], and its minimizers are equilibrium prices. As the main result, the algorithm of <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> is shown to converge to equilibrium prices. Additionally, a market equilibrium clears on average during the <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> process. This means that the market clears by historical averages of supply and demand. Moreover, an efficient rate of convergence is obtained. Additionally, we endow our algorithm with decentralized prices by introducing the trade design. The latter suggests that producers settle and update their individual prices, and consumers buy at the lowest purchase price.

40|$|Asymmetric pricing or {{asymmetric}} <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> is {{the phenomenon}} where prices rise {{more readily than}} they fall. We offer and provide empirical support for a new theory of asymmetric pricing in wholesale prices. Wholesale prices may adjust asymmetrically in the small but symmetrically in the large, when retailers face cost of <b>price</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Such retailers will not adjust prices for small changes in their costs. Manufacturers then see a region of inelastic demand where small wholesale price changes do not translate into commensurate retail price changes. The implication is asymmetric—a small wholesale price increase is more profitable because manufacturers will not lose customers from higher retail prices; yet, a small decrease is less profitable, because it will not lower retail prices; hence, there is no extra revenue from greater sales. For larger changes, this asymmetry {{in the behavior of}} wholesale price vanishes as the <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost is compensated by the increase in retailers' revenue resulting from correspondingly large retail price changes. We present a formal economic model of a channel with forward-looking retailers and cost of <b>price</b> <b>adjustment,</b> test the derived propositions on the behavior of manufacturer prices using a large supermarket scanner data set, and find that the results are consistent with the predictions of our theory.
