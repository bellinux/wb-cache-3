25|$|Japanese Buddhist {{architecture}} is {{the architecture of}} Buddhist temples in Japan, consisting of locally developed variants of architectural styles born in China. After Buddhism arrived the continent via Three Kingdoms of Korea in the 6th century, an effort was initially made to reproduce original buildings as faithfully as possible, but gradually local versions of continental styles were developed both to meet Japanese tastes and to solve problems posed by local weather, which is more rainy and humid than in China. The first Buddhist sects were Nara's six , followed during the Heian period by Kyoto's Shingon and Tendai. Later, during the Kamakura period, in Kamakura were born the Jōdo and the native Japanese sect Nichiren-shū. At roughly the same time Zen Buddhism arrived from China, strongly influencing all other sects in many ways, including architecture. The social composition of Buddhism's followers also changed radically with time. In the beginning it was the elite's religion, but slowly it spread from the noble to warriors, merchants and finally to the population at large. On the technical side, new woodworking tools like the framed <b>pit</b> <b>saw</b> and the plane allowed new architectonic solutions.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the lords}} and princes of the <b>pit</b> <b>saw</b> the flaming desire {{that was in}} Diabolus to devour the miserable town of Mansoul, they left off to raise any more objections, but consented to lend him what {{strength}} they could, though had Apollyon's advice been taken, they had far more fearfully distressed the town of Mansoul. But, I say, {{they were willing to}} lend him what strength they could, not knowing what need they might have of him, when they should engage for themselves, as he. Wherefore they fell to advising about the next thing propounded, namely, what soldiers they were, and also how many, with whom Diabolus should go against the town of Mansoul to take it; and after some debate, it was concluded, according as in the letter the Diabolonians had suggested, that none were more fit for that expedition than an army of terrible doubters. They therefore concluded to send against Mansoul an army of sturdy doubters. The number thought fit to be employed in that service was between twenty and thirty thousand. So then the result of that great council of those high and mighty lords was--That Diabolus should even now, out of hand, beat up his drum for men in the land of Doubting, which land lieth upon the confines of the place called Hell-Gate Hill, for men that might be employed by him against the miserable town of Mansoul. It was also concluded, that these lords themselves should help him in the war, and that they would to that end head and manage his men. So they drew up a letter, and sent back to the Diabolonians that lurked in Mansoul, and that waited for the back-coming of Mr. Profane, to signify to them into what method and forwardness they at present had put their design.

Back in the day sawing licenses could be issued by the Forestry Department, but because there was still an extensive amount of illegal <b>pit</b> <b>sawing</b> taking place, the sawing season has been closed since 2007. But of course the <b>pit</b> <b>sawing</b> did not stop. The black market for cedar wood grew, and has not been stopped, yet. All cedar wood sawn after 2007 is illegal wood, and can be confiscated by Forestry, MMCT and the Malawi Police.Since 2009 there are also Armed Forestry Groups patrolling the Cedar clusters, to stop the illegal pit sawyers.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>pit</b> <b>saw</b> was {{a two-man}} rip saw. In parts of early colonial North America, {{it was one}} of the {{principal}} tools used in shipyards and other industries where water-powered sawmills were not available. It was so-named because it was typically operated over a saw pit, either at ground level or on trestles across which logs that were to be cut into boards. The <b>pit</b> <b>saw</b> was [...] "a strong steel cutting-plate, of great breadth, with large teeth, highly polished and thoroughly wrought, some eight or ten feet in length" [...] with either a handle on each end or a frame saw. A pit-saw was also sometimes known as a whipsaw. It took 2-4 people to operate. A [...] "pit-man" [...] stood in the pit, a [...] "top-man" [...] stood outside the pit, and they worked together to make cuts, guide the saw, and raise it. Pit-saw workers were among the most highly paid laborers in early colonial North America.|$|E
50|$|The “village of Richmond”, {{located between}} Edgars and Cox’s Creek {{was divided into}} lots in 1859. The streets now known as Regina, Kingsley, Livingstone, Webber and Edgars were then laid out. Logs for the early houses were floated up Cox’s Creek and <b>pit</b> <b>sawn</b> on site.|$|R

50|$|While most Maleny {{district}} {{houses of}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries were built of <b>pit</b> <b>sawn</b> local timber, few surviving houses of this type were identified in the 1995 Caloundra City Cultural Heritage Study. Included amongst these was Fairview, listed as Armstrong's House 56, identified for its historic, aesthetic, representative value and integrity. A 2001 review of over 350 places identified in the 1995 survey resulted in a much shorter list of locally significant places. While some farm houses were noted the new list did not include any houses constructed of <b>pit</b> <b>sawn</b> local timber. The only building constructed of local pit-sawn timber included in the listing was {{the first stage of}} the Maleny Hotel 26, erected in 1907. Fairview House (1907) {{was not included in the}} preliminary register as a place sufficiently well known or documented for its cultural heritage significance, but was included as a place worthy of further investigation.|$|R
5000|$|All sawmills use rip saws {{of various}} types {{including}} the circular saw and band saw. Historically sawmills used one or more reciprocating saws more specifically known as an [...] "up-and-down" [...] or [...] "upright saw" [...] which are of two basic types, the frame saw or a muley (mulay) saw {{which is similar to}} the hand powered <b>pit</b> <b>saw.</b> Some sawmills also use crosscut saws to cut boards and planks to length.|$|E
50|$|The frame <b>pit</b> <b>saw</b> was the {{mainstay}} of resawing before stiff, unframed two-man saws called a muley or mulay saw, circular saws, and band saws took over. In some early sawmills a frame saw was powered from a water wheel, wind mill or other rotary motion through a crankshaft and connecting rod. Frame saws are now largely obsolete, though woodworkers who eschew power tools still make them for personal use in many sizes and styles of assembly.|$|E
50|$|The Geraldine area {{started to}} be settled by Europeans in the 1840s {{and it was in}} 1854 that Samuel Hewlings built the first bark hut in Talbot Street. He married a Māori woman, Nga Hei, and the totara tree that he planted to mark the birth of their {{daughter}} still stands. Sheep runs were quickly established in the area together with <b>pit</b> <b>saw</b> milling of the native bush. When the bush had been cleared, wheat crops were grown across the plains.|$|E

50|$|It is {{not certain}} whether the {{building}} was constructed as an inn, or whether an existing building was modified, but it had both slabs and sawn boards for wall cladding {{at an early stage}} of its existence. A <b>saw</b> <b>pit</b> is still visible behind the building. In the use of bush pole frames for the building and window openings, <b>pit</b> <b>sawn</b> weatherboards, pegged floorboards, adzed slabs and other details, the inn provides examples of a range of early building techniques and demonstrates what could be achieved in a remote spot using the materials available to hand.|$|R

50|$|Several early sawmills in England {{were burned}} by sawyers who were fearful {{of losing their}} livelihoods. However, the {{increased}} efficiency of the sawmill, and the back-breaking nature of the <b>saw</b> <b>pit</b> work, resulted in <b>saw</b> <b>pits</b> generally going out of use in the United Kingdom {{at the time of}} the industrial revolution. Old OS maps circa 1860 often show the location of <b>saw</b> <b>pits,</b> but by the start of the 20th century very few remained and most are no longer in use. Roy Underhill tells the tall tale, or tongue-in-cheek story, that, after the development of steam-powered <b>sawing</b> machines, <b>saw</b> <b>pits</b> were unnecessary, and therefore were cut up and sold as post-holes.|$|R
50|$|Other {{structures}} that {{remain on the}} farm include three timber sheds located {{on either side of}} the entry driveway and timber cattle yards positioned to the east of the driveway. The sheds are all in very poor condition due to the effects of termites and weathering. Further investigation of the site might reveal remnants of earlier buildings such as a smoke house and kitchen, thought to have been built on the site of the new extension, a brick making facility in or near the dam and the remains of a <b>pit</b> <b>saw</b> and wharf in the adjoining park.|$|E
50|$|The {{circular}} saw was invented {{around the end}} of the 18th century as a rip-saw to convert logs into lumber (timber) in sawmills and various claims have been made as to who invented the {{circular saw}}. Before the design was invented logs were sawn by hand using a <b>pit</b> <b>saw</b> or using powered saws in a sawmill using an up-and-down saw with a reciprocating motion. The rotary nature of the circular saw requires more power to operate but cuts faster because the teeth are in constant motion. The sound of the circular saw is different from the sound of an up-and-down saw and earned it the nickname buzz-saw.|$|E

50|$|William Rounsevell, {{with his}} wife Grace (née Rowe) and son John (c. 1836 - 15 May 1902), emigrated from Boscastle in his native Cornwall, on the City of Adelaide, {{arriving}} on 6 July 1839, having been persuaded to emigrate by Sir Rowland Hill. William was a farmer, but having brought <b>pit</b> <b>saws</b> with him, proceeded immediately to fell and saw timber for the South Australia Company. He then joined the police force, soon reaching the rank of senior sergeant but resigned after a few years, perhaps in 1842.|$|R
5000|$|Of all Queensland's natural {{resources}} [...] "timber {{was the most}} visible and abundant to the first Europeans". Early European accounts of Queensland frequently refer to the extensive stands of timber which lined the coast and river banks. In south-east Queensland the dominant timber species were softwoods such as Hoop (Araucaria cunninghamii) and Kauri pine (Agathis robusta). When Moreton Bay was opened up to free settlement in 1842 the colony {{did not have a}} sawmill and logged timber was either <b>pit</b> <b>sawn</b> and used locally, or sent south for milling and/or export.|$|R
