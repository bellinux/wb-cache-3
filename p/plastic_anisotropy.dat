50|$|Most {{polycrystalline}} {{metals and}} alloys usually deform via shear caused by dislocations, twins, and / or shear bands. This leads to pronounced <b>plastic</b> <b>anisotropy</b> at the grain scale and to preferred grain orientation distributions, i.e. crystallographic textures. Cold rolling textures of most face centered cubic {{metals and alloys}} for instance range between two types, i.e. the brass-type texture and the copper-type texture. The stacking fault energy {{plays an important role}} for the prevailing mechanisms of plastic deformation and the resultant textures. For aluminum and other fcc materials with high SFE, dislocation glide is the main mechanism during cold rolling and the {112}<111> (copper) and {123}<634> (S) texture components (copper-type textures) are developed. In contrast, in Cu-30 wt.% Zn (alpha-brass) and related metals and alloys with low SFE, mechanical twinning and shear banding occur together with dislocation glide as main deformation carriers, particularly at large plastic deformations. The resulting rolling textures are characterized by the {011}<211> (brass) and {01 1}<100> (Goss) texture components (brass-type texture). In either case non-crystallographic shear banding plays an essential role for the specific type of deformation texture evolved.|$|E
50|$|Forming limit curves (FLC) {{for four}} steel sheet grades are {{displayed}} in the attached figure. All forming limit curves have essentially the same shape. A minimum of the curve exists at the intercept with the major strain axis or close thereby, the plane strain forming limit. With {{the definition of the}} onset of local necking (e. g. membrane force reaches an extreme value) and the assumption of a hardening law according to Hollomon (σ = K εn) it can be shown that the corresponding theoretical plane strain forming limit is identical with the strain hardening coefficient, n. There is no thickness effect. Taking into account the strain rate sensitivity of the material, which is obvious in steel, along with the sheet thickness, the fact can be explained that practical forming limits, obtained by the use of the above described method, lie well above theoretical forming limits. Thus the basic influence parameters for the forming limits are, the strain hardening exponent, n, the initial sheet thickness, t0 and the strain rate hardening coefficient, m. The lankford coefficient, r, which defines the <b>plastic</b> <b>anisotropy</b> of the material, has two effects on the forming limit curve. On the left side there is no influence except that the curve extends to larger values, on the right hand side increasing r values reduce the forming limits.|$|E

40|$|International audienceStrong {{incompatibility}} stresses {{may develop}} at grain or twin boundaries because of elastic and <b>plastic</b> <b>anisotropies.</b> Their knowledge at Σ 3 twin boundaries {{may be of}} interest for {{a better understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour of f. c. c. materials that can display lamellar twin structures such as TWIP steels or general nanotwinned materials. In this paper, incompatibility stresses arising at general twin boundaries are explicitly derived for a given twin volume fraction. They are deduced from the solutions of the general infinite bicrystal, which is equivalent to a periodic layered structure. In the case of pure elasticity and Σ 3 twin boundaries, the result is of remarkable simplicity. The incompatibility stress field reduces to a shear stress acting upon a plane orthogonal to twin plane. Simple analytical expressions of the resolved shear stresses are also determined according to the twin boundary orientation, the twin volume fraction and the elastic anisotropy factor. Such expressions allow performing a comprehensive study of slip initiation. In particular, there exists a large physical domain, depending on the three above parameters, where simultaneous slip parallel to twin plane in the parent and in the twin is greatly promoted. There is also a restricted domain where simultaneous single slip parallel to twin plane is promoted. The conditions for these promotions are realistic considering the literature data on TWIP steels. The present results hence support the high ductility and strong contribution of kinematic hardening observed in TWIP steels and agree with composite hardening models with single and multislip deforming grains...|$|R

The columnar grains in FSS develop the rotated cube texture after plane strain rolling and are not easily recrystallized. In addition, the slab does not undergo α to γ or γ to α phase transformation during all processes. Therefore, long grain colonies with similar orientations develop from the columnar grains in the slab during cold rolling and survive even after annealing. These colonies and matrix are likely to show different <b>plastic</b> <b>anisotropies,</b> resulting in undesirable surface corrugations with peaks {{on one side of}} the sheet coinciding with valleys on the other side without change in the thickness, known as ridging, when pulled in the rolling direction (RD). The ridges have a depth in the range of 20 - 50 µm. In ridging, or roping, observed in AA 6 xxx Al alloys pulled in the transverse direction (TD), the distribution of ridges and valleys is irregular. The roping phenomenon is associated with in-plane banded clusters of the cube { 001 } and Goss { 110 } oriented grains. When pulled in TD, the Goss oriented grains are much harder than the cube oriented grains, and hence retains a higher surface level than the cube oriented grains. Thus, ridging is promoted by the presence of grain clusters of the cube and Goss components.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the current work is on {{investigating}} the orientation dependent micromechanical response of face-centered cubic (fcc) polycrystals using crystal-based elastoplastic finite element simulations. This dissertation contains three related studies examining {{the evolution of the}} lattice strains and the crystal stresses in fcc polycrystalline aggregates subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. These three studies, which can be read independently, are presented in Chapters 1, 2 and 3. Chapter 1 contains an investigation into the evolution of the orientation dependent lattice strain response in fcc polycrystals under monotonic tensile loading, particularly in the elastic-plastic transition regime leading up to fullydeveloped plasticity. The lattice strains, when plotted {{as a function of the}} macroscopic stress, begin to deviate from linear behavior in the elastic-plastic transition regime when certain sets of crystals begin yielding before others. It is demonstrated that the progression of yielding in different sets of crystals is influenced by a combination of the single crystal elastic and <b>plastic</b> <b>anisotropies,</b> which can be quantified by the directional strength-to-stiffness ratio [1]. Chapter 2 examines the evolution of the lattice strains and the crystal scale stress distributions in fcc polycrystals under fully-reversed, strain-controlled cyclic loading with respect to the concepts of the directional strength-to-stiffness ratio [1] and the vertices of the single crystal yield surface [2], which have previously only been applied to monotonic tensile loading. These two concepts are derived from the single crystal elastic and plastic anisotropic properties and are used to explain observed behaviors in the lattice strain response such as the size and shape of the lattice strain hysteresis loops. Chapter 3 presents a coordinated approach to quantifying the evolution of lattice strains in an AA 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloy under in situ zero-tension cyclic loading using high-energy synchotron x-ray diffraction experiments and crystal-based finite element simulations. This dissertation involves only the computational aspect of this coordinated approach. Lattice Strain Pole Figures (SPFs) are constructed from both measured and computed lattice strains and comparisons are made at the same macroscopic stress on several cycles in the loading history. Trends in the evolution of crystal quantities such as the crystal stresses, slip system activity and the slip system strengths, which are available from the simulation data, are examined and explained in a consistent manner with respect to the single crystal yield surface topology.

40|$|A crystal {{plasticity}} {{finite element}} method constitutive model was developed to investigate the anisotropic mechanical behaviors of (001), (011), and (111) initially orientated copper (Cu) single crystals during nanoindentation deformation. The numerical load-indentation depth curve and hardness-indentation depth curve were compared with experimental observations to validate the established three-dimensional (3 D) CPFEM model. The difference of indentation loads between (111) crystal and (001) crystal is ~ 10. 68 pct, and the difference of indentation modulus between (111) surface and (001) surface is ~ 10. 80 pct. The numerical results show the noticeable indentation size effect for three crystals, and slightly different hardness values on different crystallographic planes. The equivalent plastic strain and lattice rotation angles were also analyzed on three through-thickness cross sections to study the <b>plastic</b> deformation-induced texture <b>anisotropy...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new {{expression}} for the plastic constitutive model for materials with initial anisotropy is proposed. A plastic strain rate tensor {{should be permitted}} to follow, to a certain extent, the rotation of the stress rate tensor, which rotates instantly {{from the direction of the}} current stress tensor as in the case of plastic instability. For this purpose, a non-associated normality model, in which the plastic potential function is defined independently of the yield function, has been adopted in the proposed model. An explicit {{expression for}} the equivalent plastic strain rate, which is plastic-work-conjugated with the defined equivalent stress corresponding to the proposed yield function, is also presented. This is important for expressing a generalized work-hardening rule for materials with <b>plastic</b> flow stress <b>anisotropy.</b> The proposed theory is expected to overcome the serious problems in the associated plastic flow theory...|$|R
