5000|$|Lead and copper: Elevated {{concentrations}} of lead are rarely found in source water. Lead is {{commonly found in}} household <b>plumbing</b> <b>materials.</b> Homes built before 1986 {{are more likely to}} have lead pipes, fixtures, and solder. Lead can leach into water systems when these <b>plumbing</b> <b>materials</b> corrode. Your water’s acidity or alkalinity (often measured as pH—the measure of acidity or alkalinity of a chemical solution, from 0-14. Anything neutral, for example, has a pH of 7. Acids have a pH less than 7, bases (alkaline) greater than 7.) greatly affects corrosion. Temperature and mineral content also affect how corrosive it is. Lead in drinking water can cause a variety of adverse health effects. Exposure to lead in drinking water can cause delays in physical and mental development in babies and children.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects, caused by {{electrochemical}} corrosion processes occurring in distribution pipes, on drinking water quality. These studies focus on copper tubes, as this metal is widely used as <b>plumbing</b> <b>material</b> and is considered toxic by the WHO (World Health Organization), that recommends a maximum drinking water concentration of 2 mg l- 1. To investigate the dependence of copper release on both water composition and contact time between water and copper, several experiments were carried out and a mathematical model was also developed. On metal release, both effects of different concentrations of bicarbonates, sulphates, phosphates and chlorides and different stagnation times, between 15 and 90 minutes, were studied. As experimental apparatus, a special corrosion cell was used. To verify {{the existence of a}} direct correlation between the corrosion potential of the metal surface and the total dissolved copper concentration in the stagnating water, measurements of both parameters, respectively, were taken during {{and at the end of}} each stagnation episode.

Mature (3 ̆e 1 year old) biofilms were developed before inoculation with sterilized DW (control, Con), Lp, or Lp and A. polyphaga (LpAp). Comparison of uPVC and Cu biofilms indicated significant differences between bacterial (P = 0. 001) and eukaryotic (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) members attributable to the unique presence of several family taxa: Burkholderiaceae, Characeae, Epistylidae, Goniomonadaceae, Paramoebidae, Plasmodiophoridae, Plectidae, Sphenomonadidae, and Toxariaceae within uPVC biofilms; and Enterobacteriaceae, Erythrobacteraceae, Methylophilaceae, Acanthamoebidae, and Chlamydomonadaceae within Cu biofilms. Introduction of Lp alone or with A. polyphaga had no effect on bacterial community profiles (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) but did affect eukaryotic members (uPVC, P 3 ̆c 0. 01; Cu, P = 0. 001).

40|$|Quesada, Gonzalez, Mueller & Mueller (2010) have {{identified}} that organisations {{spend at least}} one-third of their overall budget on procurement of products and services. Hence the importance of reducing procurement costs through an efficient supply chain should be a priority for any senior manager. E-procurement {{is one of the}} components that can assist management in streamlining the operations resulting in an efficient supply chain process. The usage of qualitative research for this study ensured that appropriate answers were identified to address the research question and a clear understanding was obtained to establish the factors that affect the adoption of e-procurement technologies. The scope of the research was focused on the suppliers and manufactures of <b>plumbing</b> <b>material</b> in South Africa. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish the factors that influence organisation in adopting e-procurement technologies. The data reflected that e-procurement adoption improves organisation’s productivity, ability to better control costs resulting in an efficient and effective supply chain process. This is only possible with the support of senior management, end-user buy-in and allocation of financial resources. The three major findings identified were that e-procurement adoption is driven by internal needs, reduces labour costs and improves customer relations.

Since depolarized 3 He will produce a background, relaxation of the polarized 3 He, characterized by the probability of depolarization per bounce, Pd, was measured for materials that will be in contact with polarized 3 He. Depolarization probabilities were determined from measurements of the longitudinal relaxation time of polarized 3 He in bulk liquid 4 He inside an acrylic cell coated with the wavelength shifter deuterated tetraphenyl butadiene (d-TPB), which will be used to coat the nEDM measurement cell. Relaxation measurements were also performed while rods, made from <b>plumbing</b> <b>material</b> Torlon and valve bellows material BeCu, were present in the cell.

More particularly it is aimed at investigating metal release during stagnation of water in copper pipes. At this aim several experiments are developed, varying water quality characteristics and stagnation length, to ascertain the dependence of copper release on both water composition and contact lime between water and copper. Copper is chosen as <b>plumbing</b> <b>material</b> because of its wide use in drinking water distribution systems all around the world, and because of its recognized toxicity at high dosages. The effect of different concentrations of bicarbonates and sulphates on metal release is studied, assuming stagnation periods ranging between 15 and 90 minutes. A special corrosion cell is used as experimental apparatus, and the so called corrosion potential stagnation flow (CPSF) theory is followed for copper concentration monitoring, which means that copper concentration is monitored not only by direct measuring it, but also by measuring the corrosion potential of the metal surface during stagnation episodes. Experimental data allow to verify the formation of a protective layer on copper surface which lowers the corrosion rate, reducing the metal release. This layer {{is more likely to be}} formed at higher bicarbonate and sulphate concentrations. The effect of longer stagnation times results to be not dissimilar from that observed varying water quality characteristics. The corrosion potential always exhibits a typical and reproducible trend: it decreases at the beginning of each stagnation period, and then slightly increases once more. The minimum reached by the corrosion potential is function of the water quality, being less pronounced for higher alkalinity values and higher sulphate concentrations, and more pronounced in the apposite case. This trend is well explained {{by the development of}} the corrosion process and by the formation of the over mentioned protective layer. The experimental data allow to validate the CPSF theory, showing the existence of a direct correlation between the potential at the end of each stagnation period, and the corresponding total copper concentration in the stagnated water...|$|R
