The data contain the full population of unemployed in the period 1993 - 2000 and include multiple unemployment spells for many individuals.

The main results indicate that households with higher levels of investments in soil conservation show higher average TE than those with a lower level of investments. Constrains in the rural land and credit markets are likely explanations for these differences. The results also indicate that for farms with lower levels of investments in soil conservation access to credit is a significant factor explaining the sources of inefficiency. Conversely, households with higher levels of investments have the highest partial output elasticity for land, the highest levels of TE and the smallest farms. These results are consistent with the presence of a failure in the land market which would limit access to land to the more efficient producers.

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between age and}} creative performance {{has been found to}} follow a hump-shaped profile in the arts and sciences, and in great technological achievement. Accordingly, accelerating workforce aging raises concern about whether future capacity to innovate is endangered. This paper provides a review of existing studies exploring age effects on innovative performance, both at the individual and the macro levels. Empirical evidence confirms the hump-shaped {{relationship between}} workers’ ages and innovative performance, with the highest levels of performance seen between ages 30 and 50, depending on the domain. Industrial invention in knowledge-intensive fields, and great invention in general, seem to be a young man’s game. Yet in more experience-based fields, innovative performance peaks later, and remains stable until late in the career. Moreover, the quality of invention remains rather stable at older ages. However, individual-level evidence has to be interpreted with caution due to the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> biases and unobserved heterogeneity. Studies at the levels of firms, regions, and countries address some of these issues. Results of these studies have indicated that young professionals drive knowledge absorption, innovation, and technological progress, whereas more experienced workers are more relevant in mature technological regimes. Apart from integrating the existing empirical evidence on different levels of aggregation, a strong focus is on methodological issues and conceptual challenges. This review therefore provides a sound basis for further studies on the impact of workforce aging on innovative performance. In addition, promising directions for future research are proposed. ...|$|E

This article provides a novel probabilistic framework for assessing whether the semantics of conceptual combinations are compositional, and so can be considered {{as a function of the}} semantics of the constituent concepts, or not. While the systematicity and productivity of language provide a strong argument in favor of assuming compositionality, this very assumption is still regularly questioned in both cognitive science and philosophy. Additionally, the principle of semantic compositionality is underspecified, which means that notions of both "strong" and "weak" compositionality appear in the literature. Rather than adjudicating between different grades of compositionality, the framework presented here contributes formal methods for determining a clear dividing line between compositional and non-compositional semantics. In addition, we suggest that the distinction between these is contextually sensitive. Compositionality is equated with a joint probability distribution modeling how the constituent concepts in the combination are interpreted. Marginal selectivity is introduced as a pivotal probabilistic constraint for the application of the Bell/CH and CHSH systems of inequalities. Non-compositionality is equated with a failure <b>of</b> marginal <b>selectivity,</b> or violation <b>of</b> either system of inequalities in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> marginal <b>selectivity.</b> This means that the conceptual combination cannot be modeled in a joint probability distribution, the variables of which correspond to how the constituent concepts are being interpreted.

The standard estimator of ordered response models is therefore generalized along three directions. First, we account for the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> endogenous <b>selectivity</b> effects {{that may lead to}} inconsistent estimates of the model parameters. Second, we control for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity in response scales by allowing the thresholds to depend on a set of covariates and a random individual effect. Finally, we consider two alternative specifications of the model, one parametric and one semiparametric. In the former, the error terms are assumed to follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution and the model parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood. In the latter, the distribution function of the error terms is instead approximated by following Gallant and Nychka (1997), and the model parameters are estimated via pseudo–maximum likelihood. After discussing identification and estimation issues, we present an empirical application using the second wave of the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Specifically, we estimate an ordered response model for self-reported health on different domains by accounting for both sample selection bias due to survey nonresponse and reporting bias in the self-assessments of health. ...|$|R

The products of the reaction of ¹⁵NO and ¹⁴NH₃ were determined using mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography. In the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> excess (1. 8 %) O₂, the addition of 1. 5 % H₂O decreases NO and NH₃ conversions over amorphous chromia for all temperatures below 275 °C. For α-Cr₂O₃, the effect of water varies with reaction temperature: at temperatures less than 225 °C, NO conversion is lower with water present, whereas above 225 °C, higher NO conversions are observed under wet gas conditions. The effect of water on activity and selectivity is reversible. Labelling experiments show that water addition significantly decreases the formation of products arising from ammonia oxidation reactions. The formation of ¹⁴N₂O and ¹⁴NO is completely inhibited for both forms of chromia. For α-Cr₂O₃, ¹⁴N₂ is the dominant form of nitrogen under dry feed conditions. Increasing water vapour pressures suppress the formation of ¹⁴N₂, and ¹⁴N¹⁵N becomes the dominant nitrogen species in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5 % H₂O.

The results indicate that the impact of the process variables on the conversion, yield, and <b>selectivity</b> <b>of</b> the HDN reactions is in the following decreasing order: T>W/F>R̅. The initial aromatic ring saturation reactions of pyridine and quinoline were all reversible at the conditions studied. The removal of nitrogen in pyridine HDN occurred primarily through the pentylamine intermediate, and pentane was the major hydrocarbon produced. The removal of nitrogen in quinoline HDN occurred through the decahydroquinoline intermediate, and propylcyclohexane was the major hydrocarbon produced. The Ni-Mo/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst exhibited higher selectivity for the reaction pathway of pyridine HDN than that of quinoline HDN. Cracking and hydrocracking took place at temperatures above 648 K. The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> pyridine in the HDN of a pyridine-quinoline mixture resulted in an increase in the rate of conversion of quinoline and a decrease in that of pyridine. On the other hand, the rate of formation of propylcyclohexane (PCH) had increased while the amount of decahydroquinoline (DHQ) produced had decreased, which indicates that the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> pyridine had enhanced the transformation of DHQ to PCH.
