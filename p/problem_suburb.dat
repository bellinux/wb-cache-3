This paper will use the 2005 riots as a means of exploring the sociocultural situation in the ‘quartiers sensibles’; and, on a larger scale, the challenge posed by these areas to the ideological concept of French republicanism and the historically-rooted notion of the ‘one and indivisible French Republic’. </p...|$|R

The p-median problem is a location-allocation problem that takes into account the average (total) distance between demand points (pupil’s home) and facility (pupil’s school).

40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} {{the nature of the}} medial {{compartment}} regarding the reporting of problems in conjunction with suburbs. Previous research on discrimination in the media shows that people living in the suburbs considers suburbs being portrayed negatively in the media. They perceive that this has a negative effect on integration which in turn increases the risk of stigmatization. This study strives to contribute to the clarification of whether medias means of reporting around this area can help in the development of <b>problems</b> in <b>suburbs</b> by examining whether there is a reflection of actual political focus in the media or if media only plays a stigmatizing role.   The research method used has been quantitative content analysis, making an overview of how much space is given to the different types of reporting. The thesis concludes that the reporting examined in this study {{did not appear to be}} of a structurally discriminatory nature, even if that type of reporting occurred. Overall, the study showed that when media reported about problems in conjunction with suburbs, there actually was a slightly larger space given for reporting of stigmatizing character than that was given to reporting with focus on illustrating problems in combination with how to politically enable their solutions. ...|$|R

Developed in the 1950 s, Aranui and {{neighbouring}} Wainoni are an example of the large-scale, state-funded subdivisions of the time, yet, unlike similar developments in the North Island, they have received little to no attention from researchers. In light of the recent Canterbury earthquakes, this dissertation aims to trace the evolution of these suburbs until the 1970 s and act as the first stage of a more comprehensive review of state housing and the Aranui/Wainoni area. By critically reviewing existing literature on state housing and housing policy in New Zealand, as well as undertaking archival research, this dissertation addresses the international influences on state housing in New Zealand generally and the development of the Aranui and Wainoni area more specifically in order to provide a foundation for answering the question, "What went so wrong?...|$|R
40|$|Today, many {{communities}} {{located on the}} periphery of central cities confront traditionally "urban" <b>problems.</b> Detroit's inner <b>suburbs</b> struggle with aging infrastructure, limited governmental capacity, commercial disinvestment, population decline, poverty, failing schools, and racial and ethnic tensions. These challenges are compounded by growing fiscal difficulties fueled by shrinking revenues and increasing costs. This thesis asks what strategies an inner suburban government facing population decline, economic disinvestment, and fiscal constraints can use to retain local vibrancy. Focusing on three inner suburban communities, I describe how metro Detroit local governments are attempting to: redefine their community's identity; provide "good government" for residents; facilitate redevelopment; wage promotional campaigns; engage in inter-jurisdictional collaboration; and attempt annexation. I conclude that local government intervention can be a powerful catalyst for positive change in inner suburbs but that structural constraints limit success. by Amy J. Kohn. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|In Sweden many suburbs {{built at}} the end of the 1960 s are in need of {{physical}} renovation to comply with new energy regulations. Some of these neighbourhoods face serious social challenges which also need to be tackled. The three largest Swedish contractors, usually very active in providing technical and environmentally friendly renovation, claim now they can provide social sustainability solutions on a commercial basis. For many years the <b>problems</b> of deprived <b>suburbs</b> have attracted the attention and the care of the public institutions, and though many initiatives have been carried out to address these issues, results have been sometimes quite limited. To discuss the social challenges linked to suburbs’ renovation, an alternative method is proposed: the analysis of literary accounts. The goal is to assess whether stories relating the lives of residents in deprived Swedish suburbs can inform and therefore contribute to the development of socially sustainable solutions. Referring to the literature on social sustainability, this qualitative and explorative study uses critical discourse analysis as the method. Results suggest that focusing on renovated housing, employment, social services and leisure activities is not enough to rehabilitate disadvantaged neighbourhoods. They also indicate some specific problems linked to the built environment that contractors could help to solve...|$|R

These suburbs with an estimated population of 156. 975 are unique {{in that they are}} not connected to the Harare main water sewer system. A baseline survey was conducted to determine the quantity of biodegradable human and kitchen waste (N= 60). Biodigester sizing and costing was done for various scenarios mainly household standalone, single centralised suburb and combined suburbs centralised biogas models. In addition potential biogas conversion to electricity was done for single centralised suburb and combined suburbs centralised biogas models. This was followed by a cost benefit analysis of employing combined suburbs biogas technology. A combined suburbs centralised biogas model was found to be the most feasible scenario producing 7378 m 3 of biogas per day with electricity production capacity of 384 kW. There was a potential of wood savings of 6129 tonnes/year, paraffin savings of 2. 556 tonnes/year and greenhouse benefits of 980 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent emissions/ year and which would attract U$ 2940 from carbon credits sales per year.

Media presented a different view and emphasized the inhuman livingenvironment and the social <b>problems</b> of the <b>suburbs.</b> Nationwide there have been local attempts to avoid this negative publicity by adjusting identified suburban problems. Due to medial presentation the suburbs are still associated with segregation, criminality and social problems. The presentation of suburbs and immigrants affects not only the process of integration and the general public idea of integration processes, but also the individual perception of themselves and their living. Media have opened on to a collective discrimination of the neighborhood and its inhabitants. This essay aim to contribute to the understanding of how identities arise and are maintained when people are associated with certain geographical spaces, that is suburbs.

40|$|Nowadays in {{our society}} we find it hard for some groups of people to {{integrate}} in society. It’s known by media, that the suburbs are presented by a negative view, which often highlights the social <b>problems</b> in these <b>suburbs.</b> We {{can see that the}} suburbs still get associated with social problems such as segregation, different attitudes and behaviors, cultural conflicts, poorness etc. This kind of presentation of the suburbs affects not only the society but also the individual living and the personal perception of the individual.

Our purpose with this essay is to research on what these youths living in the suburb think about their future career and further on investigate what kind of reasons there might be that makes them feel confident or non-confident about reaching their future career. Our ambition of this essay is to create understanding of what role identity, place identity and neighborhood effects plays in order {{to find out what they}} think about their future career. In order to reach our purpose, we used semi structured interviews.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{representative}} sociological research of Hungarian cities and their centres are showing a Hungarian way in the general development tendencies of the European and East Central-European city centres. The processes of transition, the impacts of European and global economic integration have adjusted the characteristic features of Hungarian big city centres to the inner space character of European big cities. According {{to the results of}} research the central areas of Hungarian big cities following the major features of West European big cities re concentrating high social classes: people with high educational level and high professional qualifications and with high incomes. The marketable, younger and more active demographic groups also prefer settling down in the internal zones of urban space 10. The presence of low social classes is higher in suburbs and in backwarded urban peripheries. However handicapped social classes are present in city centres as well and the members of high social classes have also emerged in urban peripheries. The controversial situation of European and East Central European city centres can be well illustrated by the fact that Hungarian big city centres are concentrating not only high social classes and advanced economy (with high-tech infrastructure and sophisticated institutional system and services) but the majority of physical and social problems as well. The central zones of Hungarian big cities are facing much more social <b>problems</b> than their <b>suburbs</b> and peripheries.

40|$|Unigov {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} pieces of legislation in Indianapolis and Indiana history. In the often times hostile environment of Indiana politics it is nothing short of a miracle that the leaders in the Republican Party were able to get the Unigov bill approved and have it be as successful for the city as it has been. Unigov also created a modern day political machine for the Republican Party of Indianapolis. The new city of Indianapolis under the leadership of Republican Mayors Richard Lugar and William Hudnut has earned national name recognition on the convention circuit and for hosting amateur athletics events. Over time the growth attributed to Unigov has proven to be unsustainable. Unigov has also been inefficient at solving many of the social problems the city had when it was created. Unigov and the initial growth of the city from its consolidation were dependent on the suburban tax base that used to exist in the outer townships of Marion County. Unigov has had the effect of pushing that tax base even further out from the central business district. Many of the problems Indianapolis faces today were the same problems it faced when Unigov expanded the city. This has had the effect of building a new city on old <b>problems.</b> As the <b>suburbs</b> have expanded they now compete directly with Indianapolis for jobs, entertainment, and cultural events.

It discusses the problems of suburbanization in the agglomeration of České Budějovice, specifically the suburbs of the southern and south-western sectors. Exploration included various aspects of suburban geography, where there were elaborate social, economic and demographic problems. I observe suburban transformation from the socialist and post-socialist period to the present. Due to the complex problems of the topic, three main aims were identified to reflect the substance of the work. To achieve them, the literature review revealed useful information and thematic maps were created. Data was collected in the chosen localities and analysis of dates, terrain mapping, dialogues and examinations with mayors of the municipalities were carried out. The theoretical part describes chosen characterizations of the social-geographical world, for example inhabitants, industry, agriculture, services, travelling and transport. The following chapters discuss aspects of the exploration of suburbanization, according to theories and literature. They explain reasons and conditions of suburban actions in the worlds? developed countries, suburbanization in the U. S. A. and in the western and post-socialist Europe.

40|$|Urban {{consolidation}} involving increasing densification around existing nodes {{of urban}} infrastructure {{is a strategy}} pursued by {{all levels of government}} for addressing rapid population growth in urban regions. This has both positive and negative impacts on the everyday lives of residents (or their urban liveability as perceived by them), even though urban consolidation is commonly resisted by residents. This paper aims to better understand impacts of urban consolidation on liveability by comparing similarities and differences in impacts between two Brisbane suburbs: an outer fringe suburb (Wynnum) and an inner city suburb (West End). Wynnum residents generally expressed less resistance to urban consolidation, with some residents willing to trade additional densification for additional amenities. Two issues concerning residents in both suburbs were aesthetics of high-rise development and traffic congestion. Building heights more than a few storeys above surrounding buildings were commonly seen as detracting from urban liveability, though buildings up to 30 stories were accepted by some if close to the Commercial Business District. Traffic congestion was seen as a <b>problem</b> in both <b>suburbs</b> reflecting widespread car dependency. Other impacts differed between suburbs, reflecting their different values and ways of living. For example, most West End residents were concerned about losing social diversity with declining housing affordability while many Wynnum residents were concerned about gaining more public or social housing and disadvantaged residents. The impacts of urban consolidation on liveability differ between suburbs, and local neighbourhood plans should be sensitive to local notions of urban liveability because residents often stay after urban consolidation, even if they perceive negative impacts on their liveability. These interviews reinforce liveability as primary focus for urban planning, and thus urban consolidation at the expense of liveability is a poor outcome for both local residents and urban planning...|$|R
