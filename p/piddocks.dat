5000|$|Pidocks {{are unique}} in that each side of their shells is divided into 2 or 3 {{separate}} sections. Furthermore, one of the <b>piddock's</b> shells has a set of ridges or [...] "teeth", which they use to grind away at clay or soft rock and create tubular burrows. The shape of these burrows {{is due to the}} rotating motion of the <b>piddock</b> as it grinds the rock to make its home. The <b>piddock</b> stays in the burrow it digs for the entirety of its eight-year lifespan, with only its siphon exposed to take in water that it filters for food. When the <b>piddock</b> dies and leaves an empty tubular burrow, other marine life such as sea anemone, crabs and other molluscs may use the burrow.|$|R

40|$|Bioerosion {{increases}} the topographic complexity of soft rock habitats, thereby increasing species diversity. This increase in species diversity may either {{be associated with}} an increase in complexity or may simply be a consequence of the increase in available surface area for colonisation. The influence of habitat modification by <b>piddocks</b> on intertidal species richness was investigated through field survey using fractal geometry to assess topographical complexity. The relationship between topographical complexity and species diversity was examined using the species spacing technique, which uses fractal dimensions to normalise the species richness data in relation to topographical complexity. Six sites were chosen, comprising either clay or chalk substratum, which had a range of rock hardness. Through their rock-boring activities, <b>piddocks</b> significantly increased the topographical complexity of the shore. Associated with this increase was an increase in species richness at all sites. Using species spacing, at 5 of the 6 sites, the increased species richness was found to be area-independent, with more species being observed than would be expected for a simple increase in surface area alone. However, <b>piddocks</b> are also known to significantly increase the erosion of soft rock habitats, many of which are regarded as being of particular conservation importance because of their rarity within Europe. <b>Piddocks</b> thus increase intertidal biodiversity {{while at the same time}} significantly contributing to erosion of the substratum...|$|E
40|$|Biometry {{and growth}} of three piddock species Pholas dactylus, Barnea candida and B. parva, from chalk and clay substrata were {{investigated}} between 1999 and 2000 at five low shore locations along the south coast of England. Piddock burrow shape was significantly different (P < 0. 01) amongst the locations. Burrows at Lyme Regis showed the largest (height/maximum diameter) ratio (4. 86 +/- 2. 00) whilst those at Compton the lowest (3. 73 +/- 1. 62). Using the method of Bhattacharya, the population structure of P. dactylus, B. candida and B. parva was separated into eight, three and five modal size classes, respectively. Age and shell growth were determined from the number and spacing, respectively, of annual growth lines present in acetate peel replicas of shell sections. The von Bertalanffy growth (VBG) equation fitted the size at age data obtained for P. dactylus and B. candida (L-infinity and K were 79. 3 +/- 13. 8 mm and 0. 0011 +/- 0. 22 and 29. 6 +/- 1. 5 mm and 1. 17 +/- 0. 47, respectively) whilst the size at age data for B. parva were linearly related and did not fit the assumptions of the VBG equation. Male and female gonads were mature and <b>piddocks</b> competent to spawn between June and September 1999, with settlement of juveniles observed between November 1999 and February 2000. A significant relationship between burrow aperture diameter and age of the occupant piddock was established for the three species. Burrow morphology and spatial distribution of burrows were influenced by substratum hardness and population density. Based on estimates at Lyme Regis, <b>piddocks</b> are capable of removing up to 41 % of the shore substratum {{to a depth of}} 85 mm over their lifespan (12 years), significantly compromising the structural stability of the soft rock shores they inhabit and contributing to bioerosion...|$|E

40|$|Very {{probably}} the American piddock {{has been introduced}} in England around 1890 with the American oysters Crassostrea virginea. In less than 20 years, P. pholadiformis succeeded to conquer all countries along the North Sea from France to Norway. Already immediately after the introduction of this American species in Europa, malacologists noticed that P. pholadiformis was living together with the autochtonous White piddock B. candida. The “invader" was so successful that one thought the White piddock would not survive the invasion of its American rival. Although P. pholadiformis became (in general) more common than B. candida, it did not succeed to drive out our indigenous piddock. At the Belgian coast, B. candida seems nowadays {{to be even more}} common than P. pholadiformis. Actually, the American piddock occurs along the coasts of Northwest Europe, the Mediterranean (less common), North America (Atlantic Eastcoast and California, San Francisco), South America (till Uruguay) and the Atlantic coast of West Africa. Both <b>piddocks</b> are living in the intertidal zone of the beach. In Belgium, they {{can be found in a}} clay or peat substrate. The silting-up of the beaches are a threat for both species; B. candida however has more chance to survive, because of its longer siphocanal. There is no unanimousness among European authors about the size of the two <b>piddocks.</b> During my field- work at Belgian beaches, I found that in habitats where the American piddock is very common, the size of the species rarely exceeded 57 mm. The largest specimen has been found near the French-Belgian border (maximum 63 mm). Although was meant that the size of P. pholadiformis is larger in Europe than in North America, I found no evidence to prove this, on the contrary. The White piddock has mostly been described as smaller than the American one, but at the Belgian coast, opposite results have been found. The shell shape of both species is very variable, probably because of their boring activities. The shell-morphology of the American piddock however is even more variable than our indigenous White piddock. The so-called "left-right-phenomenon" has also been studied. It has been proved that on each beach, or the left, or the right valve is dominant. The results I found for both species along the Belgian coast, are very similar...|$|E
