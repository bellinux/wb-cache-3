50|$|Sir David Cox {{observed}} {{that if the}} proportional hazards assumption holds (or, is assumed to hold) then {{it is possible to}} estimate the effect parameter(s) without any consideration of the hazard function. This approach to survival data is called application of the Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model,</b> sometimes abbreviated to Cox model or to <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model.</b> However, Cox also noted that biological interpretation of the proportional hazards assumption can be quite tricky.|$|E

40|$|The author {{considers}} {{a class of}} models that generalizes the popular mixed <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>model</b> for duration data: the generalized accelerated failure-time model. He shows that the generalized accelerated failure-time model is nonparametrically identified (up to a normalization). He then reconsiders the nonparametric identification of the mixed <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>model.</b> He shows that the class of mixed <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>models</b> is not closed under normalization. This implies that a finite mean of the mixing distribution is {{a necessary condition for}} (nonparametric) identification of the mixed <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>model.</b> It is impossible to test this hypothesis without imposing arbitrary restrictions on the base-line hazard and/or the regression function.

40|$|The semiparametric {{efficiency}} bound of {{the mixed}} <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>model</b> is derived. The density factors {{in such a}} way that there exists a complete sufficient statistic for the individual heterogeneity. The efficient score is shown to be the difference between the score in the parametric direction and its conditional expectation given the sufficient statistic. Applying this result to the single-spell Weibull mixed <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>model,</b> it is shown that its information matrix is singular and there cannot exist any [square root]n-consistent estimator sequence.

50|$|The {{generic term}} {{parametric}} proportional hazards models {{can be used}} to describe proportional hazards models in which the hazard function is specified. The Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model</b> is sometimes called a semiparametric model by contrast.|$|E
50|$|The term Cox {{regression}} model (omitting proportional hazards) is sometimes {{used to describe}} the extension of the Cox model to include time-dependent factors.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new identification {{conditions for}} the mixed <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>model.</b> In particular, the baseline hazard {{is assumed to be}} bounded away from 0 and ∞ near t = 0.

40|$|Cross-sectional genetic {{association}} {{studies can}} be analyzed using Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>models</b> with age as time scale, if age at onset of disease is known for the cases and age at data collection is known for the controls. We assessed to what degree and under what conditions Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>models</b> have more statistical power than logistic regression models in cross-sectional genetic association analyses. Analyses were conducted in an empirical study on the association of 65 polymorphisms and risk of coronary heart disease among 2400 familial hypercholesterolemia patients, and in a simulation study that considered various combinations of sample size, genotype frequency, and strength of association between the genotype and coronary heart disease. We applied Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>models</b> and logistic regression models, and compared effect estimates (hazard ratios and odds ratios) and statistical power. In the empirical study, Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>models</b> generally showed lower P-values for polymorphisms than logistic regression models. In the simulation study, Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>models</b> had higher statistical power in all scenarios. Absolute differences in power did depend on the effect estimate, genotype frequency and sample size, and were most prominent for genotypes with minor effects. For example, when the genotype frequency was 30 % in a sample with size n = 2000 individuals, the absolute differences were the largest for effect estimates between 1. 1 and 1. 5. In conclusion, Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>models</b> can increase statistical power in cross-sectional genetic association studies, especially {{in the range of}} effect estimates that are expected for genetic associations in common disease...|$|R

5000|$|The Cox {{model may}} be {{specialized}} if a reason exists {{to assume that}} the baseline hazard follows a particular form. In this case, the baseline hazard [...] is replaced by a given function. For example, assuming the hazard function to be the Weibull hazard function gives the Weibull <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Kaplan-Meier {{estimator}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently used methods of survival analysis. The estimate may be useful to examine recovery rates, the probability of death, and the effectiveness of treatment. It is limited in its ability to estimate survival adjusted for covariates; parametric survival models and the Cox <b>Proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model</b> may be useful to estimate covariate-adjusted survival.|$|E
50|$|He {{has made}} {{pioneering}} and important contributions to numerous areas of statistics and applied probability, {{of which the}} best known is perhaps the <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model,</b> which is widely used {{in the analysis of}} survival data. An example is survival times in medical research that can be related to information about the patients such as age, diet or exposure to certain chemical substances. The Cox process was named after him.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{relationship}} between <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>models</b> and Poisson regression models which is sometimes used to fit approximate <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>models</b> in software for Poisson regression. The usual reason for doing this is that calculation is much quicker. This was {{more important in the}} days of slower computers but can still be useful for particularly large data sets or complex problems. Laird and Olivier (1981) provide the mathematical details. They note, [...] "we do not assume Poisson model is true, but simply use it as a device for deriving the likelihood." [...] McCullagh and Nelder's book on generalized linear models has a chapter on converting <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>models</b> to generalized linear models.|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{there is}} little {{empirical}} research that has been taken {{to understand how the}} underlying economy affects customers’ subsequent financial product purchase behaviours. A better understanding of this influence and being able to predict the probability of purchasing are important for financial service industries. This paper undertakes an examination of the impacts of social-demographic and economic variables on the probability of purchasing financial products. In particular two most common, the Cox and Weibull, <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>models</b> are compared to examine their adequacy in terms of predictive ability. The results show that the change of external economic environment is an important source that drives customers’ financial products purchasing behaviours. Furthermore, the results also that indicate Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>models</b> are superior to Weibull <b>proportional</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

The SAPS 2 was used to adjust for admission severity.|$|R
50|$|The Weibull {{distribution}} (including the {{exponential distribution}} {{as a special}} case) can be parameterised as either a <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model</b> or an AFT model, {{and is the only}} family of distributions to have this property. The results of fitting a Weibull model can therefore be interpreted in either framework. However, the biological applicability of this model may be limited {{by the fact that the}} hazard function is monotonic, i.e. either decreasing or increasing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interpretation}} of [...] in accelerated failure time models is straightforward: [...] means that {{everything in the}} relevant life history of an individual happens twice as fast. For example, if the model concerns {{the development of a}} tumor, it means that all of the pre-stages progress twice as fast as for the unexposed individual, implying that the expected time until a clinical disease is 0.5 of the baseline time. However, {{this does not mean that}} the hazard function [...] is always twice as high - that would be the <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{well-known}} {{example of}} a semiparametric model is the Cox <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model.</b> If {{we are interested in}} studying the time [...] to an event such as death due to cancer or failure of a light bulb, the Cox model specifies the following distribution function for :where [...] is the covariate vector, and [...] and [...] are unknown parameters[...] Here [...] is finite-dimensional and is of interest; [...] is an unknown non-negative function of time (known as the baseline hazard function) and is often a nuisance parameter.

In addition, asymptotic properties of the estimator that maximize the pseudo-partial likelihood are derived.

5000|$|In the {{statistical}} area of survival analysis, an accelerated failure time model [...] (AFT model) is a parametric model that provides {{an alternative to}} the commonly used proportional hazards models. Whereas a <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model</b> assumes that the effect of a covariate is to multiply the hazard by some constant, an AFT model assumes that the effect of a covariate is to accelerate or decelerate the life course of a disease by some constant. This is especially appealing in a technical context where the 'disease' is a result of some mechanical process with a known sequence of intermediary stages.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{proportional}} hazards models, {{in which}} Cox's semi-parametric <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model</b> is more widely used than parametric models, AFT models are predominantly fully parametric i.e. a probability distribution is specified for [...] (Buckley and James proposed a semi-parametric AFT but its use is relatively uncommon in applied research; in a 1992 paper, Wei {{pointed out that}} the Buckley-James model has no theoretical justification and lacks robustness, and reviewed alternatives.) This can be a problem, if a degree of realistic detail is required for modelling the distribution of a baseline lifetime. Hence, technical developments in this direction would be highly desirable.|$|E
50|$|Proportional hazards {{models are}} {{a class of}} {{survival}} models in statistics. Survival models relate the time that passes before some event occurs {{to one or more}} covariates that may be associated with that quantity of time. In a <b>proportional</b> <b>hazards</b> <b>model,</b> the unique effect of a unit increase in a covariate is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate. For example, taking a drug may halve one's hazard rate for a stroke occurring, or, changing the material from which a manufactured component is constructed may double its hazard rate for failure. Other types of survival models such as accelerated failure time models do not exhibit proportional hazards. The accelerated failure time model describes a situation where the biological or mechanical life history of an event is accelerated.|$|E

40|$|Bayesian {{bootstrap}} {{was proposed}} by Rubin (1981) and its theoretical properties and application to survival models without covariates was studies by Lo (1993) and others. Bayesian bootstrap, empirical likelihood and bootstrap are dierent approaches {{based on the}} same idea, approximating the nonparametric model with the family of distributions whose supports are the set of observations. Based on this observation, we extended the Bayesian bootstrap framework to survival models with covariates and studied its large sample theory.
