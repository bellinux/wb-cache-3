40|$|The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) is the {{principal}} foodborne-disease component of the CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP). FoodNet is a collaborative project among CDC, the eight EIP state health department sites, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FoodNet augments, but does not replace, longstanding activities at CDC, FSIS, FDA, and in states to identify, control, and prevent foodborne disease hazards. FoodNet is a sentinel network that is producing more stable and accurate national estimates of the burden and sources of specific foodborne diseases in the United States through active surveillance and additional studies. Enhanced surveillance and investigation are integral parts of developing and evaluating new prevention and control strategies that can improve {{the safety of our}} food and the public's health. Ongoing FoodNet surveillance is being used to document the effectiveness of new food safety control measures, such as the USDA Pathogen Reduction and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) Rule, in decreasing the number of cases of foodborne diseases in the United States each year.

40|$|The Article {{begins in}} <b>Part</b> <b>II</b> with a <b>summary</b> {{of the nation}} 2 ̆ 7 s failure, over nearly eight decades of trying, to create a health care system {{providing}} broad access to care. It then reviews several political and economic explanations for that failure. Next, <b>Part</b> <b>II</b> describes disparities in health and in {{health care in the}} United States as compared with other nations. Parts III provides background information. It describes the SCHIP program and unsuccessful efforts in 2007 and 2008 to renew and expand the program. The story of these efforts illustrates the Article 2 ̆ 7 s central claim—that implicit class competition played a significant part in undermining efforts to create a system of universal health care coverage in the United States. Part IV links opposition to SCHIP 2 ̆ 7 s expansion with class competition by examining a wide set of responses—especially negative responses—to the proposed expansion of SCHEP. These responses illustrate the intensity of class competition—for both health care access and, less openly, for signs of health presumably provided by access to health care—underlying opposition to SCHIP 2 ̆ 7 s expansion. Finally, Part V, again invoking the failed efforts to expand SCHIP in 2007 and 2008 as an illustration, suggests that, the nation 2 ̆ 7 s opposition to universal health care notwithstanding, the United States has been moving for several years toward the sort of moment referred to as a 2 ̆ 2 tipping point 2 ̆ 2 —and thus toward the sort of significant health care reform that became manifest in 2009. That seemed to be the case before the economic downturn of 2008 and was, ironically perhaps, even more the case after the start of the Great Recession...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] By 2002, {{the decline}} of {{organizing}} in the U. S. manufacturing sector has reached crisis proportions. In the 1930 s it was industrial organizing that built the labor movement and brought a decent standard of living to millions of industrial workers, their families, and communities across the country. Absent intensive efforts to organize the nation 2 ̆ 7 s most mobile industries, U. S. workers will lose their only hedge against the worst effects of the global economy, and American manufacturing employers will lead the {{race to the bottom}} in workplace democracy, wages, working conditions, and living standards. The American labor movement needs its industrial base in order to regain both union density and the political and economic power that goes with it. The question is not whether manufacturing will disappear in the U. S., for there will always be goods produced in this country; the question is what kinds of manufacturing jobs those will be and whether they will be unionized. It is because of this crisis that the AFL-CIO asked us to research the current state of organizing in manufacturing and make recommendations for strategies that would be effective at taking on and winning against the large multinational corporations that dominate the manufacturing sector. This report summarizes the findings from our research. The first section, Part I, examines changes that have occurred in manufacturing industries {{over the last five years}} in employment, union membership, union density, workforce demographics, and trade and investment relative to changes in other sectors and industries. <b>Part</b> <b>II</b> presents <b>summary</b> data for all NLRB elections in the last five years, comparing changes in certification election activity and outcomes in manufacturing industries relative to changes in other sectors and industries. In this section we also analyze NLRB election activity in the context of the changes in employment, union density, workforce demographics, and trade and investment summarized in Part I...|$|R
40|$|Armed {{conflict}} and occupation are by definition necessarily violent for all participants, be they civilians or combatants. However, for women it heralds an exacerbation in existing violence, discrimination and inequalities. While {{international humanitarian law}} (IHL) has dedicated or ‘special’ provisions for women, feminist legal scholars have done much to expose the gendered nature of this branch of international law. In recent decades, the United Nations’ campaign of mainstreaming of women’s issues has impacted significantly on relevant human rights law (HR Law), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has actively sought to investigate and address women’s concerns. However, there has been limited flow through of these efforts {{in the sphere of}} private military and security companies (PMSCs). This report provides but an overview of the main issues and legal concerns raised by the impact of the privatisation of war on women during military engagements. It is divided into four parts. Part I highlights how armed {{conflict and}} occupation generally have a detrimental effect upon the lives of women with particular reference to safety, displacement, health and economic disadvantage. <b>Part</b> <b>II</b> provides a <b>summary</b> of existing IHL and HR provisions in this field. Part III examines recent developments within the United Nations (and its members states), the work of the ICRC, and international criminal law jurisprudence shaping these existing protections.

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} {{regulatory}} situation for clinical {{stem cell research}} in the People’s Republic of China since the early 2000 s. The paper is structured in four parts. Part I examines the regulatory conditions for the donation of human gametes and embryos and their use in basic and preclinical research. This involves an overview of China’s regulatory rules for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and its approach to the governance of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research. <b>Part</b> <b>II</b> offers a <b>summary</b> of the regulatory and legal instruments that govern clinical trials {{and other forms of}} human subjects research in China. These instruments, most of which have been launched in the 1990 s and early 2000 s, do not specifically address stem cell research, but they influence clinical stem cell research as horizontal regulatory rules. Part III focuses more specifically to the regulation of clinical stem cell research and applications, including the regulation of experimental (for-profit) interventions with stem cells that do not classify as clinical trials or systematic forms of clinical research. This part documents the formation of a regulatory approach for clinical stem cell applications since the mid- 2000 s, which was still ongoing at the time of writing. The conclusions discuss open questions and the repercussions of China’s regulatory approach for stem cell research for domestic researchers, clinicians, and corporations in China, as well as for international clinical and corporate collaborations...|$|R
