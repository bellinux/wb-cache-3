40|$|When activated, B {{cells can}} {{differentiate}} either into memory B <b>cells,</b> or into <b>plasma</b> <b>cells,</b> which secrete the B cells antibody at high rates. <b>Plasma</b> <b>cells</b> can be shortlived or long-lived. Long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> are maintained {{mostly in the}} bone marrow, in privileged survival niches, which are organised by dedicated stroma <b>cells</b> [1]. Long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> constitute a discrete type of immunological memory cells, providing humoral protection to recurrent pathogens. In immune-mediated diseases, like allergy or inflammatory rheumatic diseases, however, memory <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> can turn detrimental, constantly providing pathogenic antibodies. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoreactive memory <b>plasma</b> <b>cells,</b> secreting antibodies against self antigens such as DNA, are readily detectable. These cells represent a therapeutic challenge. While short-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells,</b> respectable their precursors and their generation, are targeted by conventional immunosuppression with drugs such as cyclophosphamide, memory <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> do not respond, continue to secrete antibodies, and thus sustain persistence of disease [2, 3]. New therapies, targeting memory <b>plasma</b> <b>cells,</b> have to be developed, to meet this challenge. Several different therapeutic strategies have been proposed so far.

40|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>cells</b> provide {{long-lasting}} {{humoral immunity}} by secretion of specific antibodies. After gastrointestinal application of antigens they are generated in gut-associated lymphoid tissue and their draining mesenteric lymph nodes. Depending on the antigen the spleen also participates in generation of intestinal induced <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> The resulting <b>plasma</b> blasts predominantly express IgA isotype and migrate into the lamina propria {{of the small}} intestine. Secreted IgA antibodies are transported into the gut lumen where they specifically mark and neutralize pathogens and toxins, respectively. The results show that immunizing mice two times orally can induce antigen-specific <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> that can become long-lived within the lamina propria and bone marrow. Histologic investigations of the lamina propria regarding the incidence of known survival factors for <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> show that long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> do not co-localize with eosinophils as they doin bone marrow after systemic immunization (44). The survival factor APRIL is constitutively expressed in the lamina propria but analysis permit no preferential accumulation of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> in APRIL-enriched regions. This observation {{can be explained by}} the presence of solu- ble APRIL in the lamina propria. Moreover, other factors might be part of the intestinal survival niche. Whereas the small intestine harbors long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> of the IgA isotype exclusively, IgA+ and IgG 1 + <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> specific for orally administered antigens accumulate in the bone marrow.

In {{generating}} {{an immune}} {{response to an}} antigen, the B-cells go {{through a process of}} maturation, from surface IgM production, to serum IgM production, to maturation into a <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> producing IgG. Graft recipients who generate an immune response have both IgM and IgG. The IgM can be used directly in hemagglutination assays, depicted on the right. IgM has 10 antigen binding regions per molecule, allowing cross-linking of cells. An antiserum specific for HLA-A3 will then agglutinate HLA-A3 bearing red blood cells if the concentration of IgM in the antiserum is sufficiently high. Alternatively, a second antibody to the invariable (Fc) region of the IgG can be used to cross-link antibodies on different cells, causing agglutination.|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{study of}} the <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> in the hamster vagina reveals that a {{cyclical}} variation of these cells, parallel {{to the level of}} oestrogen in the animal, exists in the mucosa under normal and experimental con-ditions. At oestrus, the lamina propria shows a small number of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> At di-oestrus, the <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> increase in number and accumulate beneath the epithelium. A few <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> are found between the epithelial cells. The concentration of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and their migration is greater still after castration. Administration of oestrogen to castra-ted animals provokes a remarkable {{decrease in the number of}} <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> situated in the lamina propria and their disappearance from the epithelium. These findings demonstrate that a cyclical variation of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> in the hamster vagina exists which can be regulated by oestrogens.

The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize peripheral blood immature <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and the migration mechanisms of such immature <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> to inflamed sites in UC. The characteristics of peripheral blood immature <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and chemokine receptor expression were examined by flow cytometry. Expression of mucosal chemokine was quantified using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The number of peripheral blood immature <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> was significantly higher in patients with active UC and active Crohn's disease (CD) than in healthy controls. The proportion of immature <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> was correlated positively with clinical activities of UC and CD.

25|$|Some {{chemotherapy}} {{drugs are}} used in diseases other than cancer, such as in autoimmune disorders, and noncancerous <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> dyscrasia. In some cases they are often used at lower doses, {{which means that the}} side effects are minimized, while in other cases doses similar to ones used to treat cancer are used. Methotrexate is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis. The anti-inflammatory response seen in RA is thought to be due to increases in adenosine, which causes immunosuppression; effects on immuno-regulatory cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pathways; reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines; and anti-proliferative properties. Although methotrexate is used to treat both multiple sclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis, its efficacy in these diseases is still uncertain. Cyclophosphamide is sometimes used to treat lupus nephritis, a common symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus. Dexamethasone along with either bortezomib or melphalan is commonly used as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Recently, bortezomid in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone has also shown promise as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Other drugs used to treat myeloma such as lenalidomide have shown promise in treating AL amyloidosis.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{overproduction}} of immuno-globulins by short-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> ac-companying {{an immune}} response links with their apoptosis, how long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> adapt {{to ensure their}} longev-ity {{in this context is}} obscure. Here, we show that apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1 (ASK 1) contributes to apoptosis of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> because ASK 1 activity was induced during differentiation of short-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells,</b> and, when pro-duced by ASK 1 -deficient mice, these cells survived better than those of control mice.

The co-expression of both of these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen. B cell activation follows engagement of the cell-bound antibody molecule with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and differentiate into an antibody-producing cell called a <b>plasma</b> <b>cell.</b> In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody in a secreted form rather than a membrane-bound form. Some daughter cells of the activated B cells undergo isotype switching, a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA, or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system.|$|E

2500|$|Hybridomas are cells {{obtained}} by fusing tumor cells (which can divide infinitely) and immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes (plasma cells). Hybridomas can {{be expanded to}} produce large quantities of immunoglobulins with a given unique specificity (monoclonal antibodies). One problem is to single out the hybridomas from the large excess of unfused cells after the cell fusion. One common way to solve this is to use thymidine kinase negative (TK−) tumor cell lines for the fusion. The thymidine kinase negative cells are {{obtained by}} growing the tumor cell line {{in the presence of}} thymidine analogs, that kill the thymidine kinase positive (TK+) cells. The negative cells can then be expanded and used for the fusion with TK+ plasma cells. After fusion, the cells are grown in a medium with methotrexate or aminopterin that inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase thus blocking the de novo synthesis of thymidine monophosphate. One such medium that is commonly used is HAT medium, which contains hypoxanthine, aminopterinand thymidine. The unfused cells from the thymidine kinase-deficient cell line die because they have no source of thymidine monophosphate. The lymphocytes eventually die because they are not [...] "immortal."
