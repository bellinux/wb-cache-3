40|$|Experimental {{results on}} lithium-containing solar cells point toward the lithium donor density {{gradient}} dN sub L/dw {{as being the}} crucial parameter in the prediction of cell behavior after irradiation by electrons. Recovery measurements on {{a large number of}} oxygen-rich and oxygen-lean lithium cells have confirmed that cell recovery speed is directly proportional to the value of the lithium gradient for electron fluences. Gradient measurements have also been correlated with lithium diffusion schedules. Results have shown that long diffusion times (25 h) with a <b>paint-on</b> <b>source</b> result in large cell-to-cell variations in gradient, probably due to a loss of the lithium source with time...|$|E
