50|$|A MIL-STD-1553 {{multiplex}} {{data bus}} system {{consists of a}} Bus Controller (BC) controlling multiple Remote Terminals (RT) all connected together by a data bus providing a single data path between the Bus Controller and all the associated Remote Terminals. There may also be one or more Bus Monitors (BM); however, Bus Monitors are specifically not allowed {{to take part in}} data transfers, and are only used to capture or record data for analysis, etc. In redundant bus implementations, several data buses are used to provide more than one data path, i.e. dual redundant data bus, tri-redundant data bus, etc. All transmissions onto the data bus are accessible to the BC and all connected RTs. Messages consist of one or more 16-bit words (command, data, or status). The 16 bits comprising each word are transmitted using Manchester code, where each bit is transmitted as a 0.5 μs high and 0.5 μs low for a logical 1 or a low-high sequence for a logical 0. Each word is preceded by a 3 μs sync pulse (1.5 μs low plus 1.5 μs high for data words and the opposite for command and status words, which cannot occur in the Manchester code) and followed by an odd parity bit. Practically each word could be considered as a 20-bit word: 3 bit for sync, 16 bit for payload and 1 bit for odd <b>parity</b> <b>control.</b> The words within a message are transmitted contiguously and {{there has to be a}} minimum of a 4 μs gap between messages. However, this inter-message gap can be, and often is, much larger than 4 μs, even up to 1 ms with some older Bus Controllers. Devices have to start transmitting their response to a valid command within 4-12 μs and are considered to not have received a command or message if no response has started within 14 μs.|$|E
40|$|The parity {{modulation}} of {{the ground}} state of a superconducting island is {{a direct consequence of}} the presence of the Cooper pair condensate preferring an even number of charge carriers. The addition energy of an odd, unpaired quasiparticle equals to the superconducting gap, Δ, suppressing single electron hopping in the low temperature limit. Controlling the quasiparticle occupation is of fundamental importance for superconducting qubits as single electron tunneling results in decoherence. In particular, topological quantum computation relies on the <b>parity</b> <b>control</b> and readout of Majorana bound states. Here we present parity modulation for the first time of a niobium titanite nitride (NbTiN) Cooper-pair transistor coupled to aluminium (Al) leads. We show that this circuit is compatible with the magnetic field requirement in the range of 100 mT of inducing topological superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled nanowires. Our observed parity lifetime exceeding 1 minute is several orders of magnitude higher than the required gate time of flux-controlled braiding of Majorana states. Our findings readily demonstrate that a NbTiN island can be parity-controlled and therefore provides a good platform for superconducting coherent circuits operating in a magnetic field...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) are omnipresent in {{a multitude}} of applications. One of the important common requirements of these applications is the data security. Indeed, the exchanged data in WSNs are often considered as a preferred target, {{which can be a}} subject of several threats, such as eavesdropping, replay, falsification, alteration, etc. Another important common requirement of WSNs applications is data aggregation. Indeed, the limitations of such networks in terms of energy, bandwidth and storage accentuate the need of data aggregation. In this paper, we address these two issues. We propose a new efficient approach for data integrity and credibility protection for WSNs, while ensuring the data aggregation. We consider a cluster-based network architecture, where sensor nodes are equally distributed in clusters. Each sensor node is in charge to deliver one bit of the sensed data {{and at the same time}} observe the remaining parts through a <b>parity</b> <b>control</b> based encryption approach. In this manner, the sensed data could be effectively and securely controlled with a low overhead compared to the classical aggregation approaches, where all the nodes transmit individually the sensed data. To validate the proposed protocol we have simulated it using the simulator CupCarbon and in order to evaluate its efficiency in terms of energy, we have developed a prototype with the TelosB platform, where the obtained results show that our method is less energy consuming...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) is {{a bacterial}} infection commonly occurring during pregnancy. The incidence of UTI in pregnant women depends on parity, race, {{and socioeconomic status}} and can {{be as high as}} 8 %. Objective: The objective was to determine the association of UTI with genital hygiene practices and sexual activity in pregnant women. Patients and Methods: From January 2011 to June 2014, a total of 200 pregnant women attending prenatal clinics in Al-Zahra Hospital and King Khalid Hospital in Saudia Arabia Kingdom were selected. Eighty pregnant women, who had positive urine cultures (cases), were compared with the remaining 120 healthy pregnant women matched for age, social, economic and education status, and <b>parity</b> (<b>controls).</b> Results: In the present work, Escherichia coli were the infecting organism in 83 % of cases. Factors associated with UTI included sexual intercourse ≥ 3 times/week (odds ratio [OR] = 5. 62), recent UTI (OR = 3. 27), not washing genitals precoitus (OR = 2. 16), not washing genitals postcoitus (OR = 2. 89), not voiding urine postcoitus (OR = 8. 62) and washing genitals from back to front (OR = 2. 96) [OR = odds ratio].
