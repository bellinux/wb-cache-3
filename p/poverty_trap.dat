People in poverty in Canada more often access food banks, are often homeless, or in low-cost, sub-standard housing; {{they are part of the}} 'working poor' who rely on low wages, or are stuck in the <b>poverty</b> <b>trap</b> of welfare, and face hunger.|$|E
25|$|During {{the mass}} high school {{education}} movement from 1910–40, {{there was an increase}} in skilled workers, which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work. In fact, it differs from the present {{high school education}}, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a <b>poverty</b> <b>trap.</b> It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth, which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the book}} The End of Poverty, Jeffrey Sachs {{discusses}} how many factors can affect a country's ability {{to enter the}} world market, including government corruption; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as AIDS and malaria; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; protectionism; and geographic barriers. [...] Jagdish Bhagwati, a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth. However, economic growth {{does not necessarily mean}} a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist. Economic growth is conventionally measured using indicators such as GDP and GNI that do not accurately reflect the growing disparities in wealth. Additionally, Oxfam International argues that poor people are often excluded from globalization-induced opportunities [...] "by a lack of productive assets, weak infrastructure, poor education and ill-health;" [...] effectively leaving these marginalized groups in a <b>poverty</b> <b>trap.</b> Economist Paul Krugman is another staunch supporter of globalization and free trade with a record of disagreeing with many critics of globalization.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of {{coordination and cooperation}} are widely used in economics, and particularly in game theory. They were also at the foundation of development economics {{at the time of}} WWII, with Paul Rosenstein-Rodan highlighting the existence of intersectoral spillovers effects, multiple equilibria and underdevelopment traps. These concepts returned to the forefront of development theory in the 1970 s with the notions of coordination failure and <b>poverty</b> <b>traps,</b> as well as the research on social norms. One example was Samuel Bowles’ seminal concept of ‘institutional poverty traps’, i. e. highly inegalitarian institutions that persist even though they are inefficient. Membership institutions are of particular relevance in developing countries, and therefore in development economics. The paper explores the cognitive dimensions of coordination failures and institutional traps; it reveals that local institutions in developing countries may be efficient and examines the conditions in which norms create <b>poverty</b> <b>traps,</b> in particular membership norms. Firstly, it is argued that institutions and norms are key causes of the formation and persistence of <b>poverty</b> <b>traps.</b> Institutions and norms are complex cognitive devices, some beliefs and norms appear to be particularly resilient and difficult to revise. Secondly, it is shown that no particular institutional form is ex ante a cause of poverty traps: depending on contexts, the same institutional forms can be efficient or inefficient. It is the combination of multiple elements – economic and political environment, and social norms - that create thresholds effects and entrap groups into low equilibria. Thirdly, it is argued that the norms that organise group membership, because they involve beliefs that are difficult to revise, are typical factors of <b>poverty</b> <b>traps.</b> <b>Poverty</b> <b>traps,</b> coordination failures, social norms...|$|R

5000|$|Jeffrey Sachs, in {{his book}} The End of Poverty, {{discusses}} the <b>poverty</b> <b>trap</b> and prescribes a set of policy initiatives intended to end the trap. He recommends that aid agencies behave as venture capitalists funding start-up companies. Venture capitalists, once they choose {{to invest in a}} venture, do not give only half or a third of the amount they feel the venture needs in order to become profitable; if they did, their money would be wasted. If all goes as planned, the venture will eventually become profitable and the venture capitalist will experience an adequate rate of return on investment. Likewise, Sachs proposes, developed countries cannot give only a fraction of what is needed in aid and expect to reverse the <b>poverty</b> <b>trap</b> in Africa. Just like any other start-up, developing nations absolutely must receive the amount of aid necessary (and promised at the G-8 Summit in 2005) for them to begin to reverse the <b>poverty</b> <b>trap.</b> The problem is that unlike start-ups, which simply go bankrupt if they fail to receive funding, in Africa people continue to die at a high rate {{due in large part to}} lack of sufficient aid.|$|E
