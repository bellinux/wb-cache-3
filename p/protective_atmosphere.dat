5|$|Outside a <b>protective</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and {{magnetic}} field, {{there are few}} obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.|$|E
5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} {{cryogenics}} (its {{largest single}} use, absorbing {{about a quarter of}} production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a <b>protective</b> <b>atmosphere</b> for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The surface {{reactivity}} of magnesium alloys at high temperatures required for their processing in solid, semisolid and liquid states is reviewed, emphasizing presently existing barriers of its understanding and control. In addition to general aspects of magnesium oxidation, {{other forms of}} reactivity such as ignition and flammability are discussed. Since surface oxide composed of pure MgO, does not offer a sufficient protection, operations of raw alloy melting and component manufacturing require <b>protective</b> <b>atmospheres</b> which have detrimental implications on process economy and product performance. Efforts to develop ignition resistant magnesium alloys through modification of their chemistry are described with a particular role of rare earths and other elements with high affinity to oxygen. It is concluded that all forms of magnesium reactivity in solid and liquid state could be explained through diffusion characteristics of surface oxides formed during processing and service...|$|R
50|$|In some {{pressing}} operations, such as hot {{isostatic pressing}} (HIP) compact formation and sintering occur simultaneously. This procedure, together with explosion-driven compressive techniques, is used extensively {{in the production of}} high-temperature and high-strength parts such as turbine blades for jet engines. In most applications of powder metallurgy the compact is hot-pressed, heated to a temperature above which the materials cannot remain work-hardened. Hot pressing lowers the pressures required to reduce porosity and speeds welding and grain deformation processes. It also permits better dimensional control of the product, lessens sensitivity to physical characteristics of starting materials, and allows powder to be compressed to higher densities than with cold pressing, resulting in higher strength. Negative aspects of hot pressing include shorter die life, slower throughput because of powder heating, and the frequent necessity for <b>protective</b> <b>atmospheres</b> during forming and cooling stages.|$|R
