50|$|Ionic EAPs are {{polymers}} {{that can}} be actuated through the diffusion of ions in an electrolyte solution (in addition to the application of electric fields). Current examples of ionic electroactive polymers include <b>polyelectrode</b> gels, ionomeric polymer metallic composites (IPMC), conductive polymers and electrorheological fluids (ERF). In 2011, it was demonstrated that twisted carbon nanotubes could also be actuated by applying an electric field.|$|E
40|$|A {{square wave}} current {{technique}} {{has been used}} to obtain the cathodic overvoltage parameters for hydrogen evolution on aluminium but was found inadequate by itself for determining the anodic parameters for aluminium dissolution, mainly because of the complicating effects of solution IR drop. A method was developed, however, for the determination of αa and the ratio C/i oa from the analysis of the initial potential fall 20 μsecs during and just after cutting. By combining these results with the square wave results, the IR drop and i oa were found and hence C could be obtained from C/i oa. It shown that the potential time behaviour in the first few milliseconds on freshly exposing an aluminium, surface to aqueous salt solutions cannot be explained simply in terms of the electrode kinetic parameters applicable to the existing <b>polyelectrode.</b> The observations have been accounted for using <b>polyelectrode</b> parameters if the ratio of cathodic to anodic area changes rapidly (T. C. 0. 2 ms) with time after an effective delay of approximately 20 μsecs...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of photoresist pattern on charging damage of gate oxides during high current arsenic implantation is studied. Metal-oxide- semiconductor (MOS) capacitors of 10 mu m/sup 2 / active area and 4. 5 nm oxide thickness connected with {{various types of}} poly antennas and resist patterns on top were processed, whereby the resist overlapped and/or enclosed the gate electrode during ion implantation. The evaluation of the devices was performed by leakage current and charge to breakdown (Qbd) measurements. The {{influence of}} resist size, perimeter, and coverage of <b>polyelectrodes</b> is described in detail...|$|R
