The functions of justices as to such rates are sometimes but not quite accurately described as ministerial, for their powers of inquiry though limited are judicial and of a quasi-criminal character.|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this diploma thesis is the Incidental {{disputes}} arising from the <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of judgments (execution). This topic is very actual because of {{the increasing number of}} execution proceedings.

Thereupon, the referee ordered the suspension of all <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of the mortgages for five years, and that the possession of the mortgaged property, subject to liens, remain in Radford, {{under the control of}} the court, as provided in paragraph 7 of subsection (s). The referee fixed the rental for the first year at $325, and ordered that for each subsequent year the rental be fixed by the court. All the orders of the referee were, upon a petition for a review, approved by the District Court; and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on February 11, 1935.|$|R

40|$|This article investigates two {{questions}} that may arise in Australian <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> {{of a foreign}} arbitral award where the award-debtor is not named in the relevant arbitration agreement and asserts {{that it is not}} a party to that agreement. The first question that may be contested in those circumstances is whether the award-debtor is for some reason precluded from denying its privity to the relevant arbitration agreement. Where this is not the case, the allocation of the onus of proof with regard to the award-debtor’s privity to the agreement may become relevant. In the context of investigating these {{two questions}}, this article discusses the views expressed in IMC Aviation Solutions Pty Ltd v Altain Khuder LLC, decided in 2011 by Croft J as trial judge and then by the Victorian Court of Appeal...|$|R
40|$|This article {{concentrates}} on certain consumer protection issues in Estonian and Norwegian law in <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of security rights in residential immovable property. These issues {{are discussed in}} the context of European Union (EU) law as the recent Aziz case of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the new Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) have begun to set new standards <b>for</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>proceedings</b> which Member States must follow. The authors conclude that no legislative amendments are currently required in either of the two countries: the Estonian and Norwegian rules on acceleration and default interest clauses, as well as on enforcement proceedings, seem to be well in line with the requirements set by Azizand by the MCD. Some of the national provisions allow for rather wide discretion, however, and {{it is possible that the}} future case law of the CJEU regarding the Unfair Terms Directive, the MCD and the Charter of Fundamental Rights will continue to create new standards for the effective protection of consumers in the enforcement of security rights. The current wave of developments seems to include a growing fundamental rights aspect as the individual’s right to housing is being increasingly promoted through consumer protection norms...|$|R
40|$|Whenever a {{party who}} has {{obtained}} a judgment {{in one state}} or county has occasion to take <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> its <b>enforcement</b> in another, he finds-perhaps to his surprise-that his judgment as such has no extra-territorial force, but that in other jurisdictions it is merely evidence of a settled demand, upon which judgment must be obtained in a new suit before there can be process <b>for</b> its <b>enforcement.</b> A creditor cannot, for example, upon a judgment recovered in New York, have an execution in Pennsylvania; for courts issue executions only upon their own judgments; and while it would no doubt be within the competency of legislative power to authorize courts to issue final process upon the transcripts of judgments produced to them from other jurisdictions, it has not, either in the United States or in Great Britain, been deemed wise to do so. By international law judgments properly obtained are entitled to respect everywhere; but when relief is to be given upon them it must be given according to the local law and the local judicial practice; and this involves the necessity of obtaining judgment in the jurisdiction where process of enforcement is desired: Mcbure v. Benceni, 2 Ired. Eq. 513; s. c. 40 Am. Dec. 437; Savings Inst. v. Guber, 34 N. J. Eq. 130...|$|R
40|$|International {{human rights}} are {{important}} factors in the shaping of private international law in family matters. In fact, the latter has to measure up to the standards set by the former, like any domestic field of law should. Accordingly, respect for family and private life, as internationally guaranteed, shows that a self-contained regime merely defined by reference to the classic definitional categories and techniques of national law is less and less suitable to deal with cross-border cases. In essence this paper, while considering cross-border cases and international practice, argues that fundamental rights prescribe an inherent and positive obligation of result to recognize and enforce a family relationship lawfully created abroad. This approach entails, firstly, a derogation from the <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> recognition and <b>enforcement</b> {{set forth in the}} national system of PIL, and, secondly, a positive obligation to be fulfilled by public authorities. In this human-rightsbased perspective, PIL requirements must then be re-shaped, where possible by means of interpretation, to safeguard the fundamental rights of the individuals concerned...|$|R
