40|$|Circular {{polarisation}} {{is commonly}} induced through the multiple scattering of light by aerosols in a planetary atmosphere and the multiple reflection of light by a rough surface. More interestingly, light reflected by organisms displays unique spectral circular polarisation behaviour, presenting {{the possibility of}} circular polarimetry {{for the detection of}} life. It has previously been neglected due its relatively small signal and the need for advanced instrumentation in its measurement. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the circular polarisation that can be induced by the atmosphere of an exoplanet and the impact it would have on the measurement of surface features. This was done through the modelling of the multiple scattering of light by aerosols for varying aerosol and atmospheric conditions. The influence of partial cloud cover was also modelled. A degree of circular polarisation between 10 - 3 or 10 - 5 was typically observed. The maximum values were found at phase angles of 30 ° to 70 °, with an additional peak at 110 ° to 140 ° and near-zero values around 90 °. The particle size, real refractive index and cloud and gas optical thickness values were the most significant parameters. The introduction of partial cloud cover increased the variability of circular <b>polarisation</b> <b>values</b> and high cloud symmetry with respect to the equator led to a decrease in the circular polarisation. The modelled circular polarisation may be measurable for some cases but not all. The best phase angles for observation are around 40 ° and 140 °, where the circular polarisation is near peak value and the linear polarisation is relatively small. The symmetry of the clouds is advantageous for the observation of surface features, as circular <b>polarisation</b> <b>values</b> cancel out due to having opposite sign. However, a fully cloudy planet would make surface observations very challenging. This work can be built upon with the modelling of surface and biological circular polarisation. Most importantly, observations of organism-dense areas are required to determine the potential of circular polarimetry for the detection of life. Aerospace EngineeringPlanetary Science...|$|R

The surface charge density of destacked thylakoids from greenhouse-grown untreated plants, containing extensive grana stacking, was - 34. 3 ± 2. 5 mC m- 2.

40|$|Polarised {{electron}} and positron beams are key {{ingredients to}} the physics programme of future linear colliders. Due to the chiral nature of weak interactions in the Standard Model - and possibly beyond - {{the knowledge of}} the luminosity-weighted average beam polarisation at the $e^+e^-$ interaction point is of similar importance as {{the knowledge of the}} luminosity and has to be controlled to permille-level precision in order to fully exploit the physics potential. The current concept to reach this challenging goal combines measurements from Laser-Compton polarimeters before and after the interaction point with measurements at the interaction point. A key element for this enterprise is the understanding of spin-transport effects between the polarimeters and the interaction point as well as collision effects.

40|$|Abstract. The {{issue of}} the net charge at {{insulating}} oxide interfaces is shortly reviewed with the ambition of dispelling myths of such charges being affected by covalency and related charge density effects. For electrostatic analysis purposes, the net charge at such interfaces {{is defined by the}} counting of discrete electrons and core ion charges, and by the definition of the reference polarisation of the separate, unperturbed bulk materials. The arguments are illustrated for the case of a thin film of LaAlO 3 over SrTiO 3 in the absence of free carriers, for which the net charge is exactly 0. 5 e per interface formula unit, if the polarisation response in both materials is referred to zero bulk values. Further consequences of the argument are extracted for structural and chemical alterations of such interfaces, in which internal rearrangements are distinguished from extrinsic alterations (changes of stoichiometry, redox processes), only the latter affecting the interfacial net charge. The arguments are reviewed alongside the proposal of Stengel and Vanderbilt [Phys. Rev.

40|$|HERMES {{is a new}} {{experiment}} at HERA (DESY) {{designed to}} study the spin structure of the nucleon by deep inelastic scattering of polarised electrons or positrons at 27 GeV, off polarised protons and neutrons. The aims, the design, {{the preparation of the}} analysis and the first results are presented. HERMES malkes use of two novel techniques: a longitudinally polarised electron (positron) beam in a storage ring and an internal polarised gas target. In May 1994 for the first time longitudinal electron polarisation was produced in a high energy storage ring. The polarisation is naturally in the transverse direction due to the Sokolov-Ternov effect. Spin rotators are used to rotate the pin into the longitudinal direction. A fast Compton polarimeter monitors the polarisation and allows for its interactive optimisation of the <b>polarisation.</b> <b>Values</b> of up to 70 % have been reached. HERMES uses the ''storage cell'' technique to obtain optimal luminosity. A storage cell increases the density of the target gas by two orders of magnitude compared to a free gas jet. Data taking will begin in 1995 with measurements of polarised spin structure functions and also of semi-inclusive polarised hadron production. The inclusive physics program is in competition with experiments at CERN and SLAC. The semi-inclusive physics program of HERMES promises to solve basic questions of the spin structure of matter by decomposing the spin contributions from gluons, from angular momentum and from the different quark flavours.

The data obtained just before the subsequent periastron passage (December 12) show statistically lower polarisation in all photometric bands (p(V) ~ 3. 9 %) and a different position angle theta ~ 167 - 168 degrees. From observations of a nearby field star, the interstellar component of the measured polarisation was estimated as p_is(V) ~ 0. 65 % and theta_is ~ 153 degrees. This estimate was used with the previous "V"-band estimation by "field-stars method" (p(V) ~ 2 % and theta_is ~ 165 degrees) of Yudin (2014) to identify the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic polarisation in HESS J 0632 + 057.

These values of the atomic polarisations are discussed in relation to the force constants for the bending vibrations of the chelate rings and the effective dipole moments of the rings. It was found that the large atomic polarisations observed by previous workers for the acetylacetonates are apparently general for all inner-complex compounds in which the chelate ring contains six atoms. Exceptions may occur when the ring is held rigidly by some means, as in the salicylaldoxime complexes, where hydrogen bonding between the two oxime residues has been postulated to explain their unusually low atomic polarisations. For the other six-membered ring complexes, atomic <b>polarisation</b> <b>values</b> of between 29 and 67 c. c. were found for complexes containing two chelate rings in the molecule, and between 45 and 94 c. c. when three chelate rings are present, the variations being due to changes in the ring moment and the force constant. It was found that the force constants were considerably affected by changes in the strain of the chelate ring, since an increase in the strain of the ring increased its rigidity. Complexes of copper and nickel which contained five-membered rings have quite small atomic polarisations, this being attributed to the large force constants for the vibration of the rings which in these compounds are greatly strained. <p...|$|R

The second chapter is devoted to a description of the development and final form of a polarised proton target for use in the 70 - 150 Mev region for proton-proton scattering. Radiation damage resulted in a decay of the polarisation produced in this target, and a brief study of this phenomenon (described in Chapter II) was required to supplement the polarisation decay data collected in the spin correlation experiment {{reported in}} the third chapter. The third and fourth chapters contain the experimental method and analysis of experiments using the polarised target to determine the spin correlation parameter Cnn in proton-proton scattering at 90 ° centre of mass for three energies: 74, 98, and 143 Mev; and at 61. 8 ° centre of mass at 143 Mev only. A typical precision of ± 0. 05 was obtained for this parameter. The fifth chapter contains a description of the apparatus and methods used for measurements of polarisation in the 98 Mev region: the experiment at 98 Mev to determine P(θ) in p-p scattering is described and analysed in chapter six. Due to a recent remeasurement of the polarisation of the Harwell 142 Mev polarised proton beam, absolute <b>polarisation</b> <b>values</b> were obtained, to a typical precision of ± 2 % of the peak value of the asymmetry. The 98 Mev data provide a notably more stringent restriction on phase-shift fits at this energy than previous polarisation information. The preliminary results of a measurement of the absolute differential cross section for p-p scattering at 98. 8 Mev are briefly discussed, and the chapter concluded with a compilation of the N-N scattering data now available in the energy range 60 - 160 Mev...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Optical R-band polarimetric {{variability}} {{observations of}} the TeV Blazar W Comae are presented. Data obtained from 2008 February to 2013 May (∼ 5. 2 years) are analyzed. The source presented a maximum flux variability of ∼ 3 mJy. The minimum variability time scale displayed by the source during the monitored period is ∆t ∼ 3. 3 d. A maximum linear <b>polarisation</b> degree <b>value</b> of P = (33. 8 ± 1. 6) % was observed in 2013 May 12. A rotation of the position angle from 78 ◦ (2008 March 10) to 229 ◦ (2008 July 11) was observed. This rotation corresponds to a large change of ∆θ ∼ 150 ◦ {{in a period of}} 123 d or to a rotation of ∼ 1. 2 ◦ per day. After the high activity state observed in 2008, the position angle shows a preferential value of ∼ 56 ◦, with variations of ∼ 60 - 120 ◦. From the Stokes parameters we infer the existence of two optically-thin synchrotron components that contribute to the optical polarized flux. One of them is stable, with P∼ 11 %. ...|$|R

Innovative coupling of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with gas chromatography measurements {{was carried out}} to characterise the anode material using an operando approach. The experiments were conducted in a symmetric anode/electrolyte/anode cell prepared by slurry coating resulting in 100 mu m-thick anode layers. The electrochemical performance was assessed using a two-electrode arrangement between 400 degrees C and 650 degrees C, in a methane-rich atmosphere containing CH 4, O- 2 and H 2 O in a 14 : 2 : 6 volumetric ratio. The insertion of a Pt-CeO 2 based catalyst with high specific surface area inside the cermet layer was found to promote hydrogen production from the Water Gas Shift reaction and consequently to improve {{the electrochemical}} performances. Indeed, a promising <b>polarisation</b> resistance <b>value</b> of 12 Omega cm(2) was achieved at 600 degrees C with a catalytic loading of only 15 wt. %. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In this study, the {{interferometric}} coherence {{calculated from}} 12 -day Sentinel- 1 image pairs was analysed {{in relation to}} mowing events on agricultural grasslands. Results showed that after a mowing event, median VH (vertical transmit, horizontal receive) and VV (vertical transmit, vertical receive) <b>polarisation</b> coherence <b>values</b> were statistically significantly higher than those from before the event. The shorter the time interval after the mowing event and the first interferometric acquisition, the higher the coherence. The coherence tended to stay higher, even 24 to 36 days after a mowing event. Precipitation caused the coherence to decrease, impeding the detection of a mowing event. Given the three analysed acquisition geometries, {{it was concluded that}} afternoon acquisitions and steeper incidence angles were more useful {{in the context of this}} study. In the case of morning acquisitions, dew might have caused a decrease of coherence for mowed and unmowed grasslands. Additionally, an increase of coherence after a mowing event was not evident during the rapid growth phase, due to the 12 -day separation between the interferometric acquisitions. In future studies, six-day pairs utilising Sentinel- 1 A and 1 B acquisitions should be considered...|$|R
40|$|There {{seems to}} be much {{agreement}} that cultures within general and specialist further education colleges in the United Kingdom have metamorphosed since 1993. This has been a result of many pressures. The most fundamental of these {{can be traced back}} to long-term processes of economic and social change. However, the proximal factors can be related to changes in government policy, with strong pressures to enhance student learning and outcomes and to reduce costs. This article eviews a range of research which addresses the consequences of these changes for college cultures. It considers the managerialist interpretation which posits an increasing <b>polarisation</b> of <b>values</b> between managers and lecturers, suggesting that, while there are elements of truth in this, the picture is a more complex one with a variety of groupings - managers at various levels, lecturers, support staff and students - acting to pursue their preferred values and interests within arenas where patterns of power are shifting in complex ways. The article concludes by proposing a number of directions in which research might usefully be progressed, including studies that move beyond the simple dichotomy of managers and lecturers, to explore changes within colleges on a more systemic basis, and that consider change over time. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether reinforcing steel can be protected with activated fly ash cement as effectively as with Portland cement is explored in this study. Corrosion potential (Ecorr) and <b>polarisation</b> resistance (Rp) <b>values</b> for steel electrodes embedded in Portland cement mortar and two fly ash mortars, respectively activated with NaOH and waterglass+NaOH solutions, are monitored. Chloride-free activated fly ash mortars are found to passivate steel reinforcement as speedily and effectively as Portland cement mortars, giving no cause to fear that corrosion may limit the durability of reinforced concrete structures built with these new types of activated fly ash cement. The polarisation curves and the response to short-term anodic current pulses (galvanostatic pulse technique) obtained further corroborate the full and stable passivation of the steel by the concrete manufactured with these binders.

30|$|The QD {{samples were}} characterised by micro-photoluminescence {{spectroscopy}} (microPL) at cryogenic temperatures. The {{core of the}} setup consists of a tuneable pulse repetition laser diode emitting at 633 nm, a helium closed-cycle cryostat and two spectrometers equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) or an array of InGaAs detectors. High-resolution, polarisation-resolved measurements of the FSS were carried out by placing a half-wave retardation plate and a linear polarizer in the optical axis of the system. Due {{to the presence of}} the FSS, the spectral positions of exciton and biexciton transitions typically follow counterphase sinusoids while changing <b>polarisation</b> angle. The <b>value</b> of the FSS is obtained by subtracting the corresponding biexciton-exciton positions. The resulting sinusoid amplitude gives the value of the FSS. The actual spectral resolution of approximately 18 μeV at 870 nm wavelength combined with a peak fitting procedure [19] enables a total resolution of approximately 4 μeV.|$|R
