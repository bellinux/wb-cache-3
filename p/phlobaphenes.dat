25|$|While yellow maizes {{derive their}} color from lutein and zeaxanthin, in red-colored maizes, the kernel {{coloration}} {{is due to}} anthocyanins and <b>phlobaphenes.</b> These latter substances are synthesized in the flavonoids synthetic pathway from polymerisation of flavan-4-ols by the expression of maize pericarp color1 (p1) gene which encodes an R2R3 myb-like transcriptional activator of the A1 gene encoding for the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (reducing dihydroflavonols into flavan-4-ols) while another gene (Suppressor of Pericarp Pigmentation 1 or SPP1) acts as a suppressor. The p1 gene encodes an Myb-homologous transcriptional activator of genes required for biosynthesis of red phlobaphene pigments, while the P1-wr allele specifies colorless kernel pericarp and red cobs, and unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1) modifies P1-wr expression to confer pigmentation in kernel pericarp, as well as vegetative tissues, which normally do not accumulate significant amounts of phlobaphene pigments. The maize P gene encodes a Myb homolog that recognizes the sequence CCT/AACC, in sharp contrast with the C/TAACGG bound by vertebrate Myb proteins.|$|E

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{genetic and}} molecular {{characterization of the}} flavonoid pathway’s structural and regulatory genes has provided {{some of the most}} detailed knowledge of gene interactions in plants. In maize flavonoid biosynthesis, the A 1 gene is independently regulated in the anthocyanin and <b>phlobaphene</b> pathways. Anthocyanin production requires the expression of the C 1 or PI and R or B regulatory genes, whereas <b>phlobaphene</b> production requires only the P regulatory gene. By deletion analysis of the A 7 promoter, we show that the sequences between- 123 and- 88 are critical for activation by anthocyanin and <b>phlobaphene</b> regulatory genes. Linker-scanner mutations indicated that the- 123 to- 100 region is more important for transactivation by the P protein. The- 98 to- 88 region is more important for B/C 1 transactivation and shows a strong homology with the region of the Bzl anthocyanin structural gene promoter shown to be activated by WC 1 and not by P.

50|$|Ordinary or warm soluble {{quebracho}} (also {{known as}} insoluble quebracho) {{is the natural}} extract obtained directly from the quebracho wood.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} Unstable {{factor for}} orange 1 (Ufo 1), a dominant, allele-specific modifier of {{expression of the}} maize pericarp color 1 (p 1) gene. The p 1 gene encodes an Myb-homologous transcriptional activator of genes required for biosynthesis of red <b>phlobaphene</b> pigments. The P 1 -wr allele specifies colorless kernel pericarp and red cobs, whereas Ufo 1 modifies P 1 -wr expression to confer pigmentation in kernel pericarp, as well as vegetative tissues, which normally do not accumulate significant amounts of <b>phlobaphene</b> pigments. In the presence of Ufo 1, P 1 -wr transcript levels and transcription rate are increased in kernel pericarp. The P 1 -wr allele contains approximately six p 1 gene copies present in a hypermethylated and multicopy tandem array. In P 1 -wr Ufo 1 plants, methylation of P 1 -wr DNA sequences is reduced, whereas the methylation state of other repetitive genomic sequences was not detectably affected. The phenotypes produced by the interaction of P 1 -wr and Ufo 1 are unstable, exhibiting somatic mosaicism and variable penetrance. Moreover, the changes in P 1 -wr expression and methylation are not heritable: meiotic segregants that lack Ufo 1 revert to the normal P 1 -wr expression and methylation patterns.

The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulphiting process which transforms the <b>phlobaphenes</b> into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The chemical structure of these extracts can be described as polymers of epicatechin. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency). Quebracho tannins give an important added value to the quality of leathers, such as vacchetta, belts and garments, making them more compact and tear resistant with a pleasant touch. The sulphited quebracho extract may be carcinogenous in mice. Other recent studies show that quebracho tannins present a strong anti-mutagenic activity. The heartwood contains from 20 to 30 percent tannin and 3 or 4 percent water-soluble nontannin. It is said to not ferment.|$|E

40|$|The maize P gene is {{required}} for the production of red <b>phlobaphene</b> pigments in the pericarp and cob. The P-vv allele, which specifies variegated pericarp and cob, contains an insertion of the transposable element Ac in the P gene. A new P-ovov allele (orange variegated pericarp and cob) was obtained as a single event mutation from P-vv. In contrast to the progenitor P-vv allele, P-ovov provides substantial pericarp and cob pigmentation and produces significant amounts of normal-sized P transcripts. The Ac element is not detectably altered in the P-ovov allele, but it has transposed to a new position within P that is 161 bp distant and inserted in the opposite orientation. This example provides molecular confirmation for the hypothesis that changes in expression of genes bearing insertions of transposable elements can occur via movement of the element to new sites within the gene...|$|R
