40|$|I draw on an ethnographic based {{research}} study of gendered communication practices related to land ownership and adult education programme practice, in one village in Uttaranchal (India), {{in order to}} (re) conceptualize the space for democratic discursive practices in adult education <b>programme</b> <b>processes.</b> Through ethnographic accounts I explore the (im) possible experience of hearing the Other as a need for self-deconstruction in adult education <b>programme</b> <b>processes.</b> This I claim may open spaces for hearing and acknowledging the voices and silences of gendered adult education subjects speaking for themselves within adult education <b>programme</b> <b>processes.</b> I construct the ‘ideal’ adult education programme as an ‘empty signifier’ (Laclau 1989) {{in order to create}} spaces for officially recognising conflict and strategically creating consensus within adult education <b>programme</b> <b>processes.</b> The concept of the empty signifier enables me to move beyond discursive practices framing adult education processes as ‘bottom-up’ learner centred adult education programmes. I argue that such conceptualisations of adult education programmes create closure and silence around the discursive practices which reveal that any democratic process for adult education programmes does not transcend hegemonic discursive practices. I claim that it is only through the recognition of hegemony, within democratic adult education <b>programme</b> <b>processes,</b> that hegemonic relations can be transformed...|$|R

In order to inspire designers to realize innovation design, {{this paper has}} proposed a concept of process innovation design regarding Web <b>process</b> <b>case</b> base system model.

The <b>process</b> <b>case</b> prototype system is established under the model of browser/server, and 5 kinds of search models, i. e. processing methods, processing focus, design depth, innovation approaches and user-defined model are integrated.

40|$|The {{evidence}} base {{on social}} protection programmes is expanding rapidly, largely pointing towards their positive impacts. Most evaluations {{rely heavily on}} quantitative techniques and experimental methods to allow for attribution of impacts. In this paper, we argue that new ways of investigation and analysis are needed to expand and deepen the evidence base in support of improved design and implementation of social protection. Greater emphasis on qualitative research, mixed methods and participatory evaluation is crucial, given current evidence gaps about programme dynamics and impacts. This paper proposes a new evaluation framework that goes beyond conventional approaches, by highlighting relatively neglected aspects related to <b>programme</b> <b>processes,</b> social dynamics and feedback loops in programme evaluations...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} {{procedural}} due {{process can be}} understood as a choice of-law doctrine. Many procedural due <b>process</b> <b>cases</b> require courts to choose between a procedural regime characteristic of the common law—personal notice, oral hearing, neutral judge, and jury trial—and summary procedures employed in administrative agencies. This way of thinking about procedural due process is at odds with the current balancing test associated with the Supreme Court’s opinion in Mathews v. Eldridge. This Article aims to show, however, that it is consistent with case law over a much longer period, indeed, most of American history. It begins with a reading of due <b>process</b> <b>cases</b> in state courts before the Civil War, and argues that, in many of these cases, courts were asked to negotiate the institutional conflict between themselves and various summary bodies, including non-common-law courts, magistrates, commissioners, corporations, and even legislatures, which {{played a significant role in}} the administration of government. The Article then reconstructs federal due <b>process</b> <b>cases</b> in the period from 1870 to 1915, arguing that the Supreme Court limited the use of summary procedures by testing their fit with the so-called public interest, or public right, ostensibly at issue. Finally, the Article turns to the due process “revolution” and “counter-revolution,” showing how the traditional choice-of-law framework broke down, resulting in the Mathews decision...|$|R

The first two views [...] process as flows and <b>process</b> as <b>programmes</b> [...] tend {{to build on the}} assumption that processes take place within relatively stable contexts, such as the organization or the institutional environment.
