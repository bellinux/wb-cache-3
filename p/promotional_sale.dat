Weekly time series, referring separately to quantities of regular and <b>promotional</b> <b>sales,</b> are available. Their joint inspection highlighted the presence of compensatory dynamics suggesting the study with the LVch to estimate whether competition between regular and <b>promotional</b> <b>sales</b> exists and how it affects product life-cycle. The study of sales under promotion with respect to regular ones represents a new way of dealing with promotional activities effects, whereas the innovation diffusion literature on new product growth has typically considered the effect of pricing and advertising through the generalized Bass model (Bass et al., 1994). In that model, the total amount of <b>sales,</b> regular plus <b>promotional</b> <b>sales,</b> is analyzed with a univariate approach, while price and advertising expenditures are used as exogenous inputs, without a feedback control. Conversely, exploiting the availability of two distinct time series and studying their interaction, our results show that competition has a symmetric character. Regular sales may access the residual market of those under promotion indicating the beneficial effect of promotional efforts, but the reverse effect is also present. Short-term forecasts on the evolution of the two series are then built with a two stage procedure based on an iterated SARMAX. The predicted values are further validated with observed real data.

40|$|The study {{sought to}} analyse the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> {{activities}} as key fundamentals in the improvement of BIMCOsâ€™ performance. The objectives {{of the study were}} to: identify the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities being used by BIMCO, to determine the impact of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities on <b>sales</b> turnover, to determine the impact of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities on market share, to determine the impact of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities on customer retention, to establish weaknesses of the current promotional activities and finally to identify other factors other than <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities that can improve on the companyâ€™sâ€™ performance. The literature review was used to gain a more in-depth knowledge of the researched problem. The descriptive research design was used to review literature from different authors and websites in relation to the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities to improve the organisation. The literature review chapter will focus on the following subtopics: the definition of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities, the objectives of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> strategies, growth of sales promotion, some types of promotional activities, impact of sales promotion on company performance, other factors that influence changes in company performance and the summary of the chapter. The representative population was the employees and customers (credit and cash) in Zimbabwe. The researcher used descriptive and exploratory research. The data used was collected through questionnaires and secondary data sources and a sample of 30 individuals who included both employees and customers at BIMCO. 20 questionnaires were distributed and 15 were returned, giving a response rate of 75 % and 10 interviews were carried out and 8 were successful giving a response rate of 80 %. Questionnaires and interviews were used as data collection instruments. Microsoft Excel was used in data presentation. In the analysis and interpretation, frequencies, percentages was used and closed and open ended questions were used to gather data from the respondents. Presentation then followed through the use of tables, in an attempt to make the data usable by decision makers. Data collected from the respondents was presented in the form of tables, bar graphs and pie charts. The data was also analysed and interpreted in a descriptive way. In view of the findings of the research study, it is evidenced that price discounts, exhibitions and free samples are the most common <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities being used by BIMCO. The findings revealed that the companyâ€™s current <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities are ineffective therefore there is need to improve the promotional activities to cub the problem accruing for not improving the company performance. The findings also revealed that, other factors to consider that might help in improving the companiesâ€™ performance include the price, quality, brand image, flexibility of payment terms, advertisements as well as skills training. On the conclusions the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> activities currently in use at BIMCO may not be effective in improving company performance as they have a relatively low influence to the variations in sales performance. It was observed in the study that BIMCO is not concurrently active in sales promotion and yet maintain higher sales volume and profitability. The researcher recognized that sales promotion has a great impact on customers and performance of the organisation as well. Irrespective of the sales increasing it is short lived because there is excitement among customers on price discounts. Recommendations are also suggested for the improvement of the current problem. A number of strategies were recommended which include adding more sales promotion activities, knowing when it is time to use promotional activities and on-the-job training for employees to enhance their experience. Since it has immerged that sales promotion alone can not increase the companyâ€™s market share, it is recommended that the company should produce quality products for their customers. For BIMCO to avoid customers from switching brands unnecessarily, the organisation should embrace more relationship strategies...|$|R

From these models we derive several hypotheses that are tested for a unique data set of the German fresh food retail market. The data set consists of weekly prices for ten food items in 131 grocery shops over the period from 1995 to 2000. Following Varian sales should lead to reduced expenditures, while the loss leader argument assumes that consumers are lured into the shop by <b>promotional</b> <b>sales</b> which are covered by higher prices for other products. The results indicate that expenditures decrease with the number of sales in the short run but this effect is outweighed by a dynamic price adjustment thereafter.

40|$|We {{define a}} class of bias {{problems}} that arise when purchasers shift their expenditures among sellers charging different prices for units of precisely defined and interchangeable product items that are nevertheless regarded as different {{for the purposes of}} price measurement. For business-to-business transactions, these shifts can cause sourcing substitution bias in the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Import Price Index (MPI), as well as potentially in the proposed new true Input Price Index (IPI). Similarly, when consumers shift their expenditures for the same products temporally to take advantage of <b>promotional</b> <b>sales</b> or among retailers charging different per unit prices, this can cause a promotions bias problem in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or a CPI outlet substitution bias. We recommend alternatives to conventional price indexes that make use of unit values over precisely defined and interchangeable product items.

40|$|Price {{promotions}} {{are important}} marketing activities for (food) retailers; brand loyalty {{is a major}} requisite to foster brands' assets. Several theoretical papers have analyzed the relationship between price promotions and brand loyalty resulting in mixed or perhaps contradictory outcomes; only a few empirical studies for (European) grocery markets are available to test which model(s) might be most relevant to reflect pricing strategies in food retailing. In this analysis, two detailed data sets for the German ready-to-eat breakfast cereals market are merged to investigate the relationship between price promotions and brand loyalty. We find significant empirical evidence that stronger brands tend to be promoted less frequently at lower discounts compared to weaker brands. The reason might be that price reductions are more costly for brands having loyal customers {{who are willing to}} accept higher mark-ups. Therefore stronger brands might need to come up with alternative measures to recruit new customers instead of offering attractive <b>promotional</b> <b>sales.</b> Price Promotion, Brand Loyalty, Food Retailing, Ready-to-Eat Cereals, Germany, Instruments, Tobit, Demand and Price Analysis, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of price}} {{promotions}} for fast moving consumer goods (FMCG’s) by supermarkets has increased substantially {{over the last}} decade, with significant implications for all stakeholders (suppliers, service providers & retailers) in terms of profitability and waste. The overall impact of price promotions depends on the complex interplay of demand and supply side factors, which has received limited attention in the academic literature. There is anecdotal evidence that in many cases, and particularly for products supplied by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), price promotions are implemented with limited understanding of these factors, resulting in missed opportunities for sales and the generation of avoidable promotional waste. This is particularly dangerous for SMEs who are often operating with tight margins and limited resources. A better understanding of consumer demand, {{through the use of}} disaggregated sales data (by shopper segment and store type) can facilitate more accurate forecasting of promotional uplifts and more effective allocation of stock, to maximise <b>promotional</b> <b>sales</b> and minimise <b>promotional</b> waste. However, {{there is little evidence that}} disaggregated data is widely or routinely used by supermarkets or their suppliers, particularly for those products supplied by SMEs. Moreover, the bulk of the published research regarding the impact of price promotions is either focussed on modelling consumer response, using claimed behaviour or highly aggregated scanner data or replenishment processes (frameworks and models) that bear little resemblance to the way in which the majority of food SMEs operate. This thesis explores the scope for improving the planning and execution of supermarket promotions, in the specific context of products supplied by SME, through the use of dis-aggregated sales data to forecast <b>promotional</b> <b>sales</b> and allocate <b>promotional</b> stock. An innovative case study methodology is used combining qualitative research to explore the promotional processes used by SMEs supplying the UK’s largest supermarket, Tesco, and simulation modelling, using supermarket loyalty card data and store level sales data, to estimate short term promotional impacts under different scenarios and derive optimize stock allocations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). ii The results suggest that promotions are often designed, planned and executed with little formalised analysis or use of dis-aggregated sales data and with limited consideration of the interplay between supply and demand. The simulation modelling and MILP demonstrate the benefits of using supermarket loyalty card data and store level sales data to forecast demand and allocate stocks, through higher promotional uplifts and reduced levels of promotional wast...|$|R

Results showed that consumers buy larger quantities when paying lower prices, both within and across brands, and that consumers who buy larger quantities tend to pay lower prices, both within and across brands. The results also indicated that intra-brand price variations, especially those associated with consumers switching across package sizes, account for the largest portion of changes in quantity.
