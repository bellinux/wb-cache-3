40|$|Abstract Background In Denmark, it has {{recently}} become mandatory for all dairy farmers {{with more than}} 100 cows {{to sign up for}} a herd <b>health</b> <b>programme.</b> Three herd <b>health</b> <b>programmes</b> are available. These differ in a number of aspects, including the frequency of veterinary visits and the farmer’s access to prescription drugs. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether dairy farmers’ behavioural intentions, i. e. to call a veterinarian or start medical treatment on the day that they detect a cow with mild clinical mastitis (MCM), are different depending on the type of herd <b>health</b> <b>programme.</b> Methods A questionnaire survey based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was conducted. TPB proposes that a person’s behavioural intention is strongly correlated with his or her actual behaviour. Three behavioural factors determine the behavioural intention: attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. Each of these factors is decided by a set of beliefs, each of which in turn is weighted by an evaluation: 1) the expected outcomes of performing the behaviour, 2) what a person believes that others think of the behaviour, and 3) the person’s perceived power to influence the behaviour. A set of statements about the treatment of MCM based on interviews with 38 dairy farmers were identified initially. The statements were rephrased as questions and the resulting questionnaire was distributed to 400 randomly selected Danish dairy farmers who use the two most restrictive herd <b>health</b> <b>programmes,</b> either Core or Module 1, and to all 669 farmers with the least restrictive herd <b>health</b> <b>programme,</b> Module 2. The association between intention and the herd <b>health</b> <b>programme</b> was modelled using logistic regression. Results The farmers with the Module 2 herd <b>health</b> <b>programme</b> had a significantly higher behavioural intention to perform the behaviour, when compared to farmers with a more restrictive herd <b>health</b> <b>programme</b> (OR = 2. 1, p Conclusion Danish dairy farmers who participate in Module 2 herd <b>health</b> <b>programme</b> had a higher intention to treat cases of MCM, compared to farmers who participate in a more restrictive herd <b>health</b> <b>programme</b> in which the veterinarian initiates treatments. </p...|$|R

40|$|The United Kingdom has a {{long history}} of <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> {{programs}} and policies. The first legislation granting direct statutory authority (at that point to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) for <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> protection was the Destructive Insects Act of 1877, which had the objective of preventing the introduction and establishment of the Colorado Beetle. Early <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policy was aimed at specific pests considered to be of particular concern due to the potential damage and the apparent threat of entry. Some measures were created for specific pests but then expanded to include other species of concern. The current European-wide programme incorporates a notification and pest management regime for over 472 harmful organisms that have entered into European Union (EU) 1 jurisdiction 2. Most countries have followed a similar course of focusing a <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policy on pests of particular concern, and eventually creating more general authorities and methodologies for protecting national <b>plant</b> <b>health.</b> In the United Kingdom, the <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> Act is the primary legislative vehicle for ensuring the sound delivery of optimal <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policy.

40|$|The {{decision-making}} {{basis in}} health and medicine needs to be expanded by economic evaluations on public <b>health</b> <b>programmes,</b> to avoid that these are rejected without grounds when priorities are established. The first aim of this thesis is thus to assess the cost-effectiveness of three public <b>health</b> <b>programmes,</b> which were implemented in the Metropolitan area of Stockholm, Sweden during the period 1995 - 2004. The programmes evaluated represent different stages in {{the historical development of}} public <b>health</b> <b>programmes,</b> where the focus has shifted from healthcare sector-based to community-based that seek to create supportive environments for health. The smoking cessation program (Quit smoking, Gals; study I) was estimated to lead to societal cost-savings four times the programme costs and to health gains measured in QALYs (qualityadjusted life-years). The elderly safety promotion programme (Safe Seniors in Sundbyberg; study II) was estimated to impose zero societal costs and QALY gains. The diabetes prevention programme (SDPP; study III) might have been cost-effective in one programme area, cost-saving but without health gains in another area, and not cost-effective in the third programme area. The analyses were performed with the methodology recommended for economic evaluations of pharmaceuticals in Sweden to enable comparisons with other medical technologies. The thesis has shown that different types of public <b>health</b> <b>programme</b> can be cost-effective and that similar programmes potentially constitute a good way to use societal resources. Cost-effectiveness, however, is not a necessary condition for implementation of public <b>health</b> <b>programmes,</b> but financing is. The financing of community-based programmes was explored from two angles: the economic on incentives and resource allocation and the public health on whether local community participation had been achieved. Programme costs might be used as an indicator of local community participation, whereas a subsector financial analysis showed that the key local collaborator in Sweden, the municipalities, have clear financial incentives to collaborate in community-based elderly safety promotion programmes (study IV). The second aim of the thesis is to explore the appropriateness of the cost-effectiveness methodology for public <b>health</b> <b>programmes,</b> and both constraints and opportunities with the methodology were revealed. The monetary consequences of the programmes revealed opportunities to discuss the financing of community-based programmes. The constraints were found in the programme effects included in the cost-effectiveness analyses. Several valued outcomes from public <b>health</b> <b>programmes</b> that affect societal welfare and individual wellbeing are not reflected adequately, which lead to underestimates of the societal value of successful public <b>health</b> <b>programmes.</b> There are alternative methods for economic evaluations which might better reflect the societal value of public <b>health</b> <b>programmes,</b> currently discussed internationally and in Sweden. It remains an important task for future research to investigate whether, and which, alternative methods are more appropriate for public <b>health</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Several child <b>health</b> care <b>programmes,</b> {{though often}} well conceived, are poorly {{implemented}} {{at field level}} and focus primarily on quantitative achievements {{to the neglect of}} quality of care. This paper presents a quality of care (QOC) framework for child <b>health</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspectives of the management system of an organization and the provider-client interface at point of service delivery. The paper subsequently describes the application of qualitative and quantitative research tools drawn from the social sciences and health sciences for planning and evaluating quality of care. An integrated and complementary use of these tools is recommended. It is suggested that minimum standards, which are region specific, be articulated for quality maintenance in child <b>health</b> <b>programmes.</b> These standards may be upgraded as quality improves. Finally, the challenges which a partnership of the health and social sciences may have to take up are discussed. These include advocacy for prioritization of QOC in child <b>health</b> <b>programmes,</b> facilitating an environment which supports quality of care, promoting inter-disciplinary action research, training students in social science research in universities and research organizations, documenting success stories. quality of care child <b>health</b> <b>programmes</b> developing countries...|$|R

It is well recognized that farmers {{have an important role}} in shaping <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policies at a time of major structural changes in agricultural industries. However, the role of consumers has also much potential to improve sustainability of plant disease management options.

Interdisciplinary approaches in research on <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> as well as an increasing involvement of stakeholders in the management of plant epidemics, are to be welcomed. Plant diseases also influence (and are influenced by) land use and environmental regulations in general. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency and magnitude of new plant disease outbreaks, particularly when combined with globalization of trade, intensification of land use and structural evolution of the agricultural sector.
