40|$|Background Thyroid hormone {{is crucial}} for brain {{development}} during foetal and neonatal life. In very preterm infants, transient low levels of plasma T 4 and T 3 are commonly found, a phenomenon referred to as transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity. We Investigated whether breast milk is a substantial resource of thyroid hormone for very preterm neonates and can alleviate transient hypothyroxinaemia. Both the influence of breast feeding on <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> levels and the thyroid hormone concentration in preterm human milk were studied. Methods Two groups were formed from the placebo group of a randomized thyroxine supplementation trial In infants born at < 30 weeks' gestational age {{on the basis of}} the mean breast milk intake during the third, fourth and fifth weeks of life. One group received more than 50 % breast milk (mean breast milk Intake 84 %, n= 32) and the other group less than 25 % breast milk (mean breast milk Intake 3. 3 %, n= 25). <b>Plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations were compared between the two groups.

Results No significant differences were found between both groups in plasma concentrations of T 4, free T 4, T 3, TSH, rT 3 and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which were measured once a week. Thyroxine concentration in breast milk ranged between 0. 17 μg/l and 1. 83 μg/l (mean 0. 83, SD 0. 3 μg/l) resulting in a maximum T 4 supply of 0. 3 μg/kg via ingested breast milk.

Feeding T 3 decreased plasma thyroxine but elevated plasma T 3 concentrations compared to CON. The KI diet {{had no effect on}} <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations, but feeding THIO depressed plasma thyroxine with no effect on T 3, resulting in an elevated ratio of the two hormones compared to the CON ratio. Feeding KI decreased egg volume and T 3 increased egg density compared to CON, but no effects on egg weight, surface area, width, or length were noted. Dietary T 3 depressed eggshell water vapor conductance compared to CON. Dietary iodine resulted in thinner eggshells with fewer pores than the CON, whereas THIO caused significantly more pores in eggshells than CON but had no effects on shell thickness. Dietary KI had no effects on maternal <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations, suggesting that the effects were due to iodine availability rather than to thyroid hormones.

Design: We assessed plasma selenium, plasma total antioxidant status and the individual components thereof, erythrocyte antiox-idant status, and <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> in 24 PKU and 10 HPA patients and in 42 age-matched control subjects. Results: Selenium was significantly lower in both PKU and HPA patients than in control subjects and the PKU patients had lower values than did the HPA patients. Total antioxidant status was lower in both patient groups than in the control group, whereas -tocopherol, albumin, and uric acid were not significantly different among groups. Plasma selenium correlated well (r = 0. 76) with erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase.

Plasma tri-iodothyronine (T 3), thyroxine (T 4), thyrotropin (TSH), thyroid hormone binding capacity, and free thyroxine index were measured in the donor blood and in the infant at the start and at intervals during the transfusion. Before transfusion the plasma TSH levels of the infants fell as postnatal age indreased and plasma T 3 and T 4 were correlated with one another. In 20 transfusions the mean infant/donor ratio of TSH was approximately 10, of T 4 3, and of T 3 2. During these transfusions there was a progressive fall in the infant's plasms TSH, T 4, and T 3 concentration.

Daily, feed was supplied at 5 % body weight. For blood samples, the fishes were anesthetized with benzocaine 10 %, and plasmatic level...|$|R
40|$|In the 1970 s Mick Statham and I {{undertook}} {{some studies}} {{in a group}} of goitrous horses resident on a well known equine stud in Northern Tasmania. Our major work was associated with measuring circulating <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> levels of triiodothyronine, thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone along with radioactive 131 -Iodine thyroid uptakes in several of the horses who presented with a palpable or visible goitre. The study was duly completed, however an opportunity arose to measure the plasma circulating, thyroid hormones in a newly born foal over time following a cord blood sample directly after birth. This was to be of major interest in the preliminary studies which I progressed in the development of neonatal screening in 1977...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{identify}} physical and physiological differences between lambs of different birth ranks at birth, and to use this information to identify practical on-farm management strategies which could improve triplet-born lamb survival. Triplet-born lambs, especially the lightest-triplet-born lambs, not only had a greater capacity to lose heat but also had a reduced capacity to produce heat when compared to twin-born lambs. Due to their lighter birth weights, triplet-born lambs had lower plasma thyroxine (T 4) concentrations within the first 24 hours of life than twin-born lambs, and within twin- and triplet-born litters, the lightest- and medium-triplet-born lambs had greater plasma lactate concentrations than all twin-born lambs and the heaviest-triplet-born lambs. Independent of lamb birth weight, triplet-born lambs had lower plasma tri-iodothyronine (T 3) concentrations within five minutes of birth, and within twin- and triplet-born litters, the lightest- and medium-triplet-born lambs had lower plasma T 4 and T 3 concentrations within five minutes of birth than all twin-born lambs and the heaviest-triplet-born lambs. It was hypothesised that because triplet-born lambs had a lighter birth weight and lower <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations, they would have inadequate thermoregulatory capabilities when compared to twin-born lambs. The lower rectal temperatures of triplet-born lambs within the first hour {{of life and the}} lower heat production on a per lamb basis at 24 to 36 hours of age, and the lack of difference in maximum heat production on a per kg of birth weight basis at 24 to 36 hours of age support this hypothesis. Two practical on-farm management strategies trialled in this thesis to improve triplet-born lamb thermoregulation were offering concentrate supplement during late pregnancy to improve lamb birth weights, and maternal iodine supplementation to improve lamb <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations. While offering concentrate showed positive effects such as increasing lamb birth weights, colostrum uptake and triplet-born lamb heat production on a per kg of birth weight basis, the results were either inconsistent across experiments or between birth ranks suggesting additional work is required to determine the repeatability and cost effectiveness of these findings. Maternal iodine supplementation offered no iv | P a g e benefits in terms of lamb birth weights, <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations or lamb heat production. Further investigations identified that lamb birth weights, thyroid hormone concentrations, glucose and NEFA concentrations are positively associated with maximum heat production at 24 to 36 hours of age. Practical on-farm management strategies which could target these physical and physiological factors may improve triplet-born lamb heat production, and therefore the survival rates of triplet-born lambs...|$|E
40|$|The {{endocrine}} profile (umbilical venous plasma) {{of three}} groups of infants was compared. Samples were taken after eight vaginal deliveries, 11 emergency caesarean sections during labour, and 13 elective caesarean sections before labour. Mean umbilical plasma concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine were significantly higher and cortisol concentration were lower after elective caesarean section compared with the two labour groups. Mean umbilical plasma thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration was significantly lower after vaginal delivery compared with elective caesarean section. These results suggest that labour reduces <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations at birth in association with a rise in cortisol. These adaptations may be the stimulus for the subsequent surge in triiodothyronine previously reported to occur over the first few hours after birth in vaginally delivered infants...|$|E

40|$|Congenital {{hypothyroidism}} in Dutch goats {{is due to}} a thyroglobulin (TG) synthesis defect that is inherited in an {{autosomal recessive}} manner. Minute amounts of mutated TG messenger RNA are translated into glycosylated TG fragments that contain the N-terminal hormonogenic site and are able to form T 4, albeit less efficiently. We analyzed the effects of maternal thyroid status on fetal <b>plasma</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> and growth {{during the second half of}} gestation (E 90 -E 150). Maternal hypothyroidism, present from midgestation, resulted in decreased brain and cerebellum weights of affected goitrous fetuses, most evident at term gestation (E 150). Brain and cerebellum weights of affected fetuses from unaffected mothers were not decreased. T 4 and FT 4 levels in affected fetuses were dependent on the maternal phenotype, as was the degree of enlargement of the goiter at E 150. Newborn unaffected lambs from affected mothers had plasma T 4 levels within the normal range. The present data show that in late gestation, fetal goats have to rely on their own thyroidal T 4 production. The results suggest that affected fetuses are able to maintain sufficiently high T 4 and T 3 levels to prevent severe adverse effects of <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency on the brain if maternal iodide supply is adequate, although a possible increased transfer of maternal T 4 to affected fetuses cannot be excluded. Under normal conditions, sufficient amounts of iodine are provided by the efficient iodine metabolism in euthyroid mothers. In affected mothers, much iodine is wasted because the thyroid also iodinates proteins other than the aberrant TG, resulting in insufficient iodine provision of the fetus and, consequently, in severe hypothyroidis...|$|R
40|$|Thyrotoxicosis is a {{well defined}} {{clinical}} entity, determined by an increase of <b>plasma</b> levels of <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> (T 3 and T 4). A number of causes of thyrotoxicosis are known, and it is therefore {{very important for the}} treatment to establish its etiology. In fact, metimazole or propylthiouracil are indicated for the thyrotoxic states caused by thyroid gland's hyperfunction (hyperthyroidism), but are not effective when thyrotoxicosis is determined by a follicular damage and disruption with leakage of preformed <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones,</b> or in case of thyrotoxicosis factitia. Besides medical therapy, other two therapeutic options are available for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis: radioiodide administration (131 I) and surgery. The physician can decide the best therapy {{on the basis of the}} following factors: etiology of thyrotoxicosis; patient's age and needs; presence/absence of concomitant diseases or pregnancy; presence of ophthalmopathy; goiter's size; advantages and disadvantages of each therapeutic option. A problem of particular regard is when and if to treat subclinical thyrotoxicosis (low TSH values, and normal <b>plasma</b> levels of <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones).</b> On the basis of the natural history and of its consequences on the cardiovascular system and skeletal integrity, the authors propose to begin therapy whether subclinical thyrotoxicosis develop in the following four subgroups of subjects: patients with nodular goiter; women in post-menopause; patients with cardiac diseases; patients with osteoporosis...|$|R
