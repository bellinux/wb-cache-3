50|$|The Parliament of Ireland had {{recently}} gained a large measure of legislative independence under the Constitution of 1782. Many {{members of the}} Irish <b>Parliament</b> jealously <b>guarded</b> this autonomy (notably Henry Grattan) and a motion for union was legally rejected in 1799.|$|R
50|$|Assault rifle-armed AFP {{officers}} are situated in both chambers of the Australian Parliament as of 2015. It {{is the first}} time in Australian history that <b>parliament</b> has been <b>guarded</b> by armed personnel.|$|R
50|$|Constable Kamlesh Kumari of the Central Reserve Police Force was {{the first}} to spot the terrorists and was shot by them as she raised the alarm. She died on the spot. One gunman's suicide vest {{exploded}} when he was shot dead; the other four gunmen were also killed. Five policemen, a <b>Parliament</b> security <b>guard,</b> and a gardener were killed and 18 others were injured. The ministers and MPs escaped unhurt. The total number of deaths was 14 and at least 22 people were injured in the attack.|$|R
50|$|As benefactor of {{the city}} between 1736 and 1761, Duke of Belle-Isle {{initiated}} the modernization of the centre of Metz. Belle-Isle awarded royal architect Jacques-François Blondel in 1755 for the embellishment of the town square and the construction {{of the city}} hall, the <b>parliament,</b> and the <b>guard</b> lodging. He stimulated development of the Royal Governor palace and an opera house, and in 1760 created the National Academy of Metz, which still operates.|$|R
5000|$|On Cromwell's death Haselrig refused {{support to}} Richard Cromwell, and was {{instrumental}} in his downfall. He was elected MP for Leicester for the Third Protectorate Parliament in 1659 {{and became one of}} the most influential men in both the Council of State and Parliament. He tried to keep a republican Parliamentary administration, [...] "to keep the sword subservient to the civil magistrate". He opposed the schemes of John Lambert who was resisting parliamentary control over the military. In one altercation Lambert complained that the army was being held at ransom; Haselrig replied that [...] "You are only at the mercy of Parliament who are your friends" [...] to which Lambert replied [...] "I know not why they should not be at our mercy as well as we at theirs." [...] Anger at the independence of the army resulted in nine leading officers, including Lambert, being cashiered. Lambert reacted by calling out the army and blocking all routes to <b>parliament</b> putting <b>guards</b> upon its doors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{occupation}} of Denmark by Nazi Germany began on 9 April 1940, severing communications between Iceland and Denmark. As a result, on 10 April, the Parliament of Iceland took temporary control {{of foreign affairs}} (setting up {{what would be the}} forerunner of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) and the Coast <b>Guard.</b> <b>Parliament</b> also elected a provisional governor, Sveinn Björnsson, who later became the Republic's first president. Iceland became de facto fully sovereign with these actions. At the time, Icelanders and the Danish King considered this state of affairs to be temporary and that Iceland would return these powers to Denmark when the occupation was over.|$|R
5000|$|Each House of <b>Parliament</b> {{possesses}} and <b>guards</b> various ancient privileges. The House of Lords {{relies on}} inherent right. In {{the case of}} the House of Commons, the Speaker goes to the Lords' Chamber {{at the beginning of each}} new Parliament and requests representatives of the Sovereign to confirm the Lower House's [...] "undoubted" [...] privileges and rights. The ceremony observed by the House of Commons dates to the reign of King Henry VIII. Each House is the guardian of its privileges, and may punish breaches thereof. The extent of parliamentary privilege is based on law and custom. Sir William Blackstone states that these privileges are [...] "very large and indefinite", and cannot be defined except by the Houses of Parliament themselves.|$|R
25|$|After {{the death}} of Yuan Shikai, Li Yuanhong succeeded him as president. Duan Qirui was re-appointed prime minister, and the old {{parliament}} was restored. However, Li and Duan had a major disagreement shortly after {{on whether or not}} to enter World War I and declare war on Germany. Duan insisted on joining the war while Li and the <b>parliament</b> were more <b>guarded</b> on the matter. Li Yuanhong removed Duan from office and called for national military support. Monarchist general Zhang Xun took the opportunity to enter Beijing with force. He then dissolved the parliament and attempted to restore Puyi and the Qing Dynasty on July 1, in {{what is known as the}} Manchu Restoration. The restoration was repressed by Duan Qirui five days later. Li resigned from the presidency and was succeeded by Feng Guozhang. Duan re-established the new government and, with Liang Qichao, convoked a new senate.|$|R
500|$|A {{dissident}} Catholic, Guy Fawkes, {{was discovered}} in the cellars of the parliament buildings {{on the night of}} 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the state opening of the second session of James's first English <b>Parliament.</b> He was <b>guarding</b> a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which Fawkes intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, [...] "not only... of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general". The sensational discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons. Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth. Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed.|$|R

5000|$|On June 3, 2015 it was {{reported}} that [...] "RCMP officers have started openly carrying MP5 submachine guns on Parliament Hill as part of a visible increase to Parliament Hill security following last October’s terrorist attack" [...] in 2014. Conservative senator Vern White, a former RCMP officer and a former Ottawa police chief states that [...] "...some RCMP officers <b>guarding</b> <b>Parliament</b> Hill against potential terrorist attacks should be armed with rifles similar to those carried by Canadian troops in Afghanistan ," [...] the [...] "...more powerful Colt C8 is popular with police tactical teams and Canadian and other NATO alliance troops." [...] White argues that the C8 carbines would give officers a much longer shooting range than the short-barreled MP5 submachine guns. [...] "The RCMP is issuing more than 2,200 C8 carbines to its officers ," [...] but the RCMP has not indicated whether the C8s will be issued to Parliament Hill officers.|$|R
5000|$|James's {{difficulties}} {{with his first}} parliament in 1604 ended the initial euphoria of his succession. On 7 July, he prorogued the parliament, having achieved his aims neither for the full union nor for the obtaining of funds. [...] "I will not thank where I feel no thanks due," [...] he remarked in his closing speech. [...] "...I am not of such a stock as to praise fools...You see how many things you did not well...I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come". The parliament of 1604 {{may be seen as}} shaping the attitudes of both sides {{for the rest of the}} reign, though the difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On the eve of the state opening of the next parliamentary session on 5 November 1605, a soldier called Guy Fawkes was discovered in the cellars of the <b>parliament</b> buildings <b>guarding</b> a pile of slaves, not far from about twenty barrels of gunpowder with which he intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, [...] "not only...of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general". A Catholic conspiracy led by a disaffected gentleman called Robert Catesby, the Gunpowder Plot, as it quickly became known, had in fact been discovered in advance of Fawkes's arrest and deliberately allowed to mature in order to catch the culprits red-handed and the plotters unawares.|$|R
5000|$|On 26 February 2014, {{thousands}} of pro-Russian and pro-Ukraine protesters clashed {{in front of}} the parliament building in Simferopol. Two days later, Russian forces occupied airports and other strategic locations in Crimea which the interim Government of Ukraine described as an invasion and occupation. Gunmen, either armed militants or Russian special forces, occupied the Crimean <b>parliament.</b> Under armed <b>guard</b> and with the doors locked, members of parliament reportedly elected Sergey Aksyonov as the new Crimean Prime Minister. The de facto Crimean Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov said that he asserted sole control over Crimea's security forces and appealed to Russia [...] "for assistance in guaranteeing peace and calmness" [...] on the peninsula. The central Ukrainian government did not recognize the Aksyonov administration and considers it illegal. Ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich sent a letter to Putin asking him to use military force in Ukraine to restore law and order. The Russian foreign ministry stated that [...] "movement of the Black Sea Fleet armored vehicles in Crimea (...) happens in full accordance with basic Russian-Ukrainian agreements on the Black Sea Fleet".|$|R
