25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand against the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E

500|$|Bryan's opening claimed no {{personal}} prestige for himself—but nevertheless placed {{him as the}} spokesman for silver. According to Bensel, the self-deprecation helped disarm the delegates. As Bryan was not deemed a major contender for the nomination, even delegates committed to a candidate could cheer him without seeming to betray their allegiance. Bryan then recounted {{the history of the}} silver movement; the audience, which had loudly demonstrated its approval of his opening statements, quieted. Throughout the speech, Bryan had the delegates in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand; they cheered on cue. The Nebraskan later described the audience as like a trained choir. As he concluded his historical recitation, he reminded the silver delegates that they had come to crown their victory, [...] "not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain people of this country".|$|E
500|$|The method {{eliminated}} the psychoanalytic doctrine of neutrality.

He would press his thumb or the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand hard (and painfully) on their jaws, necks, chests, backs, or thighs, aiming to dissolve their muscular, and thereby characterological, rigidity.

If the session worked, he would see waves of pleasure move through their bodies, which he called the [...] "orgasm reflex." [...] According to Sharaf, the twin goals of Reichian therapy were the attainment of this orgasm reflex during sessions and orgastic potency during intercourse. Reich briefly considered calling it [...] "orgasmotherapy," [...] but thought better of it.|$|E

It later became a signature part of the opening stages of the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour which followed, usually appearing as the ultimate song or during the encore. Throughout the tour, Jared Leto chose audience members to join Thirty Seconds to Mars on stage for [...] "Up in the Air". The song was later moved {{to the beginning of the}} setlist as a set opener along with [...] "O Fortuna", a movement from Carl Orff's scenic cantata Carmina Burana. Fans and critics responded favorably to the song in a live setting. Danny Crandall of The Sun Chronicle commended the theatrics of the performance, while Grace Carroll from Gigwise noted that until the last note of the song, Leto had the audience [...] "completely in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand".|$|E

500|$|Mercury {{was noted}} for his live performances, which were often {{delivered}} to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked {{a great deal}} of participation from the crowd. A writer for The Spectator described him as [...] "a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself." [...] David Bowie, who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song [...] "Under Pressure" [...] with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: [...] "Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make [...] "the last person {{at the back of the}} furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected". Mercury's main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand, which after accidentally snapping off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised could be used in endless ways.|$|E
500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{intended}} [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] – a song {{he later}} characterised as a [...] "kid's story" [...] – {{as a vehicle}} for Starr's limited vocal range. The lyrics were written by McCartney and Lennon, with assistance from Scottish singer Donovan, and tell of life on a sea voyage accompanied by friends. Gould considers the song's childlike qualities to be [...] "deceptive" [...] and that, once in the studio, it became [...] "a sophisticated sonic pastiche". On 1 June, the Beatles and a group of their friends created a nautical atmosphere over the pre-recorded basic track, by mixing sounds such as gongs, whistles and bells with an assortment of Studio 2's sound effects. To fill the portion after the lyrics refer to a brass band playing, Martin and Emerick used a Sousa march recording, sourced from EMI's library, splicing up the taped copy and rearranging the melody. Lennon recorded the track's superimposed voices in an echo chamber, supporting Starr's lead vocal in a manner that Gould likens to [...] "an old vaudevillian with the crowd in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand". Riley recognises the song's mix of comedy as reminiscent of The Goon Show with satire inspired by Spike Jones. Donovan later said that [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] represented the Beatles' predicament as prisoners of their international fame, to which they reacted by singing an uplifting, communal song.|$|E

500|$|Two {{hundred years}} after Johnson's death, the posthumous {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell [...] "he commonly held {{his head to}} one side... moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand... e made various sounds" [...] like [...] "a half whistle" [...] or [...] "as if clucking like a hen", and [...] "... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile.

[...] There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to [...] "perform his gesticulations" [...] at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: [...] "From bad habit." [...] The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report, and Tourette sundrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as [...] "the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome".
