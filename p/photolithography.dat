5|$|Because an ASIC is (by definition) {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV <b>photolithography.</b> This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in {{only one or two}} chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.|$|E
25|$|Microarrays can be {{fabricated}} using {{a variety}} of technologies, including printing with fine-pointed pins onto glass slides, <b>photolithography</b> using pre-made masks, <b>photolithography</b> using dynamic micromirror devices, ink-jet printing, or electrochemistry on microelectrode arrays.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photolithography</b> {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of semiconductors, integrated circuit components, and printed circuit boards. <b>Photolithography</b> processes used to fabricate electronic integrated circuits presently use 193nm UV and are experimentally using 13.5nm UV for extreme ultraviolet lithography.|$|E
25|$|Microlithography and {{nanolithography}} refer {{specifically to}} lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. <b>Photolithography</b> {{is one of}} these methods, often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. <b>Photolithography</b> is also commonly used for fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. <b>Photolithography</b> generally uses a pre-fabricated photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.|$|E
25|$|In {{semiconductor}} <b>photolithography</b> applications, {{depth of}} field is extremely important as integrated circuit layout features must be printed with high accuracy at extremely small size. The difficulty is that the wafer surface is not perfectly flat, but may vary by several micrometres. Even this small variation causes some distortion in the projected image, and results in unwanted variations in the resulting pattern. Thus <b>photolithography</b> engineers take extreme measures to maximize the optical {{depth of field}} of the <b>photolithography</b> equipment. To minimize this distortion further, semiconductor manufacturers may use chemical mechanical polishing to make the wafer surface even flatter before lithographic patterning.|$|E

25|$|Microelectromechanical systems (or MEMS) {{barometers}} {{are extremely}} small devices between 1 and 100 micrometres in size (i.e. 0.001 to 0.1mm). They are created via <b>photolithography</b> or photochemical machining. Typical applications include miniaturized weather stations, electronic barometers and altimeters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the optical}} {{frequency}} regime developing the superlens may allow for imaging below the diffraction limit. Other potential applications for negative-index metamaterials are optical nanolithography, nanotechnology circuitry, {{as well as}} a near field superlens (Pendry, 2000) that could be useful for biomedical imaging and subwavelength <b>photolithography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of movable type from the 11th century, printing using woodblocks remained dominant in East Asia until {{the introduction}} of lithography and <b>photolithography</b> in the 19th century. To understand this {{it is necessary to}} consider both the nature of the language and the economics of printing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photolithography</b> {{involves}} {{exposing a}} light source to a photoresist-coated silicon wafer; a mask with the desired pattern is {{place between the}} light source and the wafer, thereby selectively allowing light to filter through and create the pattern on the photoresist. Further development of the wafer brings out the pattern in the photoresist. <b>Photolithography</b> performed in the near-UV is often viewed as the standard for fabricating topographies on the micro-scale. However, because the lower limit for size {{is a function of}} the wavelength, this method cannot be used to create nanoscale features. In their 2005 study, Mahoney et al. created organized arrays of polyimide channels (11µm in height and 20–60µm in width) were created on a glass substrate by <b>photolithography.</b> Polyimide was used because it adheres to glass well, is chemically stable in aqueous solution, and is biocompatible. It is hypothesized that the microchannels limited the range of angles that cytoskeletal elements within the neurite growth cones could accumulate, assemble, and orient. There was a significant decrease in the number of neurites emerging from the soma; however, there was less decrease as the range of angles over which the neurites emerged was increased. Also, the neurites were on average two times longer when the neurons were cultured on the microchannels versus the controls on a flat surface; this could be due to a more efficient alignment of filaments.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{method of}} {{top-down}} fabrication includes <b>photolithography</b> {{to define the}} geometry of channels on a substrate wafer. The geometry is created by several thin-film deposition and etching steps to form trenches. The substrate wafer is then bonded to another wafer to seal the trenches and form channels. Other technologies to fabricate nano-channels include surface micromachining with sacrificial layers, nano-imprinting lithography, and soft-lithography.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum UV, or VUV, {{wavelengths}} (shorter than 200nm) {{are strongly}} absorbed by molecular {{oxygen in the}} air, though the longer wavelengths of about 150–200nm can propagate through nitrogen. Scientific instruments can therefore utilize this spectral range by operating in an oxygen-free atmosphere (commonly pure nitrogen), {{without the need for}} costly vacuum chambers. Significant examples include 193nm <b>photolithography</b> equipment (for semiconductor manufacturing) and circular dichroism spectrometers.|$|E
25|$|Fabrication of nano-channels is {{categorized}} into top-down and bottom-up methods. Top-down {{methods are}} the conventional processes utilized in the IC industry and Microelectromechanical systems research. It begins with <b>photolithography</b> on a bulk silicon wafer. Bottom-up methods, in contrast, starts with atoms or molecules with intrinsic nano-scaled dimension. By organize and combine these building blocks together, it {{is able to}} form a nanostructures as small as only a few nanometers.|$|E
25|$|A {{technical}} barrier to overcome is the fabrication of gratings with high aspect ratio and small periods. The production of these gratings {{out of a}} silicon wafer involves microfabrication techniques like <b>photolithography,</b> anisotropic wet etching, electroplating and molding. A very common fabrication process for X-ray gratings is LIGA, which involves several of the microfabrication techniques mentioned above and was invented in the 1980s by German scientists of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).|$|E
25|$|Following the {{development}} of clean rooms to reduce contamination to levels never before thought necessary, and of <b>photolithography</b> and the planar process to allow circuits {{to be made in}} very few steps, the Si–SiO2 system possessed the technical attractions of low cost of production (on a per circuit basis) and ease of integration. Largely because of these two factors, the MOSFET has become the most widely used type of transistor in integrated circuits.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of deep UV excimer laser <b>photolithography</b> by Kanti Jain at IBM c.1980 has enabled the smallest features in ICs to shrink from 800 nanometers in 1990 to {{as low as}} 10 nanometers in 2016. Prior to this, excimer lasers had been mainly used as research devices since their development in the 1970s. From a broader scientific perspective, the {{invention of}} excimer laser lithography has been highlighted {{as one of the}} major milestones in the 50-year history of the laser.|$|E
25|$|In August 1959, Noyce {{formed at}} Fairchild {{a group to}} develop {{integrated}} circuits. On May 26, 1960, this group, led by Jay Last, produced the first planar integrated circuit. This prototype was not monolithic – two pairs of its transistors were isolated by cutting a groove on the chip, according to the patent by Last. The initial production stages repeated the Hoerni's planar process. Then the 80-micron-thick crystal was glued, face down, to the glass substrate, and additional <b>photolithography</b> was carried on the back surface. Deep etching created a groove down to the front surface. Then the back surface was covered with an epoxy resin, and the chip was separated from the glass substrate.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photolithographic}} {{technology is}} the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes {{as small as a}} few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than <b>photolithography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gas lasers, {{laser diodes}} and {{solid-state}} lasers can be manufactured to emit ultraviolet rays, and lasers are available which {{cover the entire}} UV range. The nitrogen gas laser uses electronic excitation of nitrogen molecules to emit a beam that is mostly UV. The strongest ultraviolet lines are at 337.1nm and 357.6.6nm, wavelength. Another type of high power gas laser is the excimer laser. They are widely used lasers emitting in ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet wavelength ranges. Presently, UV argon-fluoride (ArF) excimer lasers operating at 193nm are routinely used in integrated circuit production by <b>photolithography.</b> The current wavelength limit of production of coherent UV is about 126nm, characteristic of the Ar2* excimer laser.|$|E
25|$|In {{semiconductor}} {{research and}} industry, PMMA aids as a resist in the {{electron beam lithography}} process. A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this {{can be made by}} an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard <b>photolithography</b> process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made. Smooth PMMA surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured PMMA surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation.|$|E
25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or <b>photolithography</b> techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E

[...] These systems are mostly fabricated from silicon (Si), silicon nitride (Si3N4), or polymers. A common component used for radio frequency filtering (and MEMS applications generally), is the cantilever resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, <b>photolithography</b> and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip.|$|E

Raytheon believed that Hoerni repeated the patent held by Jules Andrews and Raytheon and filed a court case.
