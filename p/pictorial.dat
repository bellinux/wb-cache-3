40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} a sample of Italian users comprehended safety <b>pictorials</b> used on agricultural machinery. A questionnaire with 12 safety <b>pictorials</b> was administered to 248 users of agricultural machinery.

5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the <b>pictorial</b> space. Another man stands, echoing and {{opposing}} the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} <b>pictorial</b> space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E

However, Fingleton's initiation into his new workplace was difficult as the Telegraph <b>Pictorial</b> had just merged with the Daily Telegraph and around half the workforce were to be made redundant.

In such crime-ridden and turbulent working-class area, Fingleton was productive in break stories and was soon restored to the regular staff.|$|E

40|$|Rarely are {{messages}} {{devoid of}} visual information. Yet, theoretical {{explanations for the}} effect of visual elements on persuasion is limited. Marketers have shown that incongruent visual elements in advertisements can affect memory outcomes. This study bridged communication and consumer behavior research to develop a theoretical framework to explain the affect of incongruent visual elements on (1) attitude toward the ad, and (2) purchase intention. The {{results of this study}} provided limited support for the proposed framework. Findings indicated that relevant <b>pictorials</b> will yield more positive evaluations and purchase intentions than irrelevant <b>pictorials.</b> Expected <b>pictorials</b> were also found to impact evaluations. Several moderating variables are speculated to explain the impact of visual elements in an advertising context...|$|R
