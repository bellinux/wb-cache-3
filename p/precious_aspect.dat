40|$|The term “piracy” is {{accompanied}} by considerable amounts of ethical, moral and legal baggage. Indeed, it is often discussed as “nothing but robbery,” a heinous act that offends “the most <b>precious</b> <b>aspects</b> of our capitalist system, which protect individuals’ property, creativity, and investment” (Pang 2004, 19). Within popular and much academic discourse {{it is hard to}} escape the understanding that pirates are nothing more than deviant thieves. On the rare occasions that pirates can escape this categorization, there is still little space to be seen as anything other than subversive radicals or potential consumers. This chapter focuses on a particular form of digital piracy, the circulation of East Asian films within file sharing forums, and asks how the file sharers within this context perceive themselves and to what extent these perceptions are shaped by external discourses on the nature of piracy...|$|R

The NEM also emphasises that the multi-racial composition of the Malaysian population is still its outstanding feature, and that this ethnic diversity will always remain. The Keynote speech delivered by Wilson, J. A. J. reflects on means of managing change, in connection with culture and the central role that Nation Branding and religion can play in this process. It is suggested that this can be achieved by galvanising public opinion, and constructing a tenable sense of societal shared identity, whilst preserving the unique spirit and <b>precious</b> <b>aspects</b> of individual culture. Central to this argument was a consideration to the role of education, forums for critical argument, and an examination of Hofstede's cultural dimensions...|$|R

40|$|Play is a <b>precious</b> <b>aspect</b> {{of living}} and irreplaceable {{importance}} for not only child well-being and development but for adults and communities, too. Complex current living conditions often minimize the importance of child play and it becomes even more necessary that educational policies support it. The subject of the research {{is based on the}} role child play has in educational policy and the aim is formulation of measures and actions which can support child play in educational policy. We examined measures and actions of official educational policies and non government organizations of the United Kingdom of England and Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Republic of Serbia. The results show that the problem is deeper than current nonexistence of systemic support to play in Serbia and open the question on which paradigm official educational policy in Serbia approaches to education, and {{the question of how to}} bring to awareness the importance of play in order to support it. Relaying on the frameworks of play support policy in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland we suggest some guidelines for social support of child play which might prove sensible and feasible in Serbia...|$|E
40|$|Italy {{represents}} one of the most suitable environment for fruit trees and vines and since the origin of their domestication and introduction in extremely varying environments, depending on the species adaptability and local culture, a complex mosaic of landscapes has been originated by Nature, farmers or gardeners. In the study of the landscape it must be considered that the relationship between fruit trees or vines and landscapes represents a <b>precious</b> <b>aspect</b> of the Italian culture and has been studied by History, represented in Art and Literature, analyzed by science like Architecture and Agronomy, but at first has been created by Agriculture. Owing to the evolution of the relationship land and farmers, the development of agricultural practices, the change of marked requirements and objectives, different agricultural landscapes have been created, each having an unique meaning and functions. Nonetheless, the physiognomy of tree cropping systems has changed rapidly starting from half of the past century because of the introduction of new genetic resources, the change in the meaning of the product’s quality, the industrialization of the agronomic technique. These recent developments have turned out in loss of landscape diversity, biodiversity erosion, environment resources depletion. The actual physiognomy of the Italian countryside, from the plan to the most represented mountain areas, is characterized by modern and traditional agricultural landscapes, not even distinguished, frequently overlaid. They represent the “forms” of the today’s arboriculture visible in the historic and contemporary gardens, in the remnants of the coltura promiscua, in the polycultural growing systems, {{as well as in the}} specialized orchards. The contemporary landscape of fruit trees and vines witnesses its history, characters and functions particularly in terms of biological and environmental diversity maintenance. This review is focused on the traditional fruit tree and vine’s landscapes still well rooted in the Italian agricultural landscape, but differently conserved, managed and perceived. The aim of the historical excursus is to go through their development phases and to underline the changing functions. A survey of the multifunctionality recognisable in the traditional agricultural landscape, in particular their role in the preservation of environmental resources, agro-ecosystems functionality, landscape diversity and cultural memory justifies the interest in the preservation and valorisation of these productive landscapes and of the traditional agricultural techniques, thank to which they are maintained. The preserving strategies adopted in the European countries as well as the modern study approaches based on multidisciplinary methodologies are also analysed...|$|E

There, I focused specifically on the history and politics of Cape Verde, {{as well as the}} scientific, cultural, economic, environmental, historical, and social importance of the oceans. The main course was AAF 390 Directed Study: Documentary film production of fishing industry and environmental sustainability. With the footage acquired from the trip, I have created a documentary film that portrays the situations within the fishing communities. Properly managing natural resources is crucial for Cape Verdeans. They must get the most use out of what little resources they have without being dependent on anyone else. The biggest resource for the archipelago of Cape Verde is the Atlantic Ocean. Because of its location, a major source of food as well employment that the islands have is fish. The fishermen of Cape Verde work diligently every day to provide food for their family, their community, as well {{as the rest of the}} country. The ocean and the fishing industry are <b>precious</b> <b>aspects</b> of the country that need protection and recognition. There are various issues throughout the nation that are hurting the fisheries. The best way to prevent the decay of the industry is through proper investment from the government and through agreements with other countries. Expansion of the industry depends on this financial investment into the maintenance of the local ships and processing plants. Negotiations with foreign markets and other fisheries will help build a better and more sustainable fishing economy. One of the subjects of the film focuses on meeting the fishermen organization of the Artisanal Fisheries as well as ones in the community of São Tome. This is an important aspect to the film because it captures the efforts of the fishermen as they discuss their work ethic, problems, and solutions they look forward to achieving. We also spent multiple days filming the fish market and touristic fisheries in São Vicente. There, we gathered numerous interviews with the men and women selling fish as well as fishermen coming in on their boats. There is a major focus on this section of the documentary, because it depicts the working environment of the daily procedures for a variety of people in the industry. I plan on continuing to create documentaries on subjects that promote positive social change. My documentary on the fisheries in Cape Verde sheds light on the overlooked struggles and hard work that the country is dealing with...|$|R

While this area of research is rather broad, we will assume a particular perspective: the starting point is the discussion of analogue models for gravity, which have so far provided <b>precious</b> insights on <b>aspects</b> of physics on curved spacetimes, on extensions of Riemannian geometry and on the possible role of high energy Lorentz symmetry violations in low energy physics. The first part {{is devoted to}} the study of the most relevant kinematical features of emergent spacetimes typical of condensed matter analogue models. In particular, it will be shown that a natural framework for the description of the geometrical properties of emergent spacetimes is Finsler geometry, which thus represent an interesting candidate for extensions of special (and eventually general) relativity. We will present the basic concepts of this particular generalization of Riemannian geometry, and hence we will pass to the careful analysis of the main issues to be solved and of the features that can be of major interest for physical applications, in particular the geometrical interpretation of modified dispersion relations and the fate of Lorentz symmetry at the Planck scale. Some emphasis will be given to the conditions under which pseudo-Riemannian geometrie...|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} combinatorics, finite calculus, formal series, recurrences, and approximations of sums. Readers will find not only coverage of {{the basic elements of}} the subjects but also deep insights into a range of less common topics rarely considered within a single book, such as counting with occupancy constraints, a clear distinction between algebraic and analytical properties of formal power series, an introduction to discrete dynamical systems with a thorough description of Sarkovskii’s theorem, symbolic calculus, and a complete description of the Euler-Maclaurin formulas and their applications. Although several books touch on {{one or more of these}} <b>aspects,</b> <b>precious</b> few cover all of them. The authors, both pure mathematicians, have attempted to develop methods that will allow the student to formulate a given problem in a precise mathematical framework. The aim is to equip readers with a sound strategy for classifying and solving problems by pursuing a mathematically rigorous yet user-friendly approach. This is particularly useful in combinatorics, a field where, all too often, exercises are solved by means of ad hoc tricks. The book contains more than 400 examples and about 300 problems, and the reader will be able to find the proof of every result. To further assist students and teachers, important matters and comments are highlighted, and parts that can be omitted, at least during a first and perhaps second reading, are identified...|$|R
