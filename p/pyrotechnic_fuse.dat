50|$|The {{oldest and}} {{simplest}} type of cap, fuse caps are a metal cylinder, closed at one end. From the open end inwards, there is first an empty space into which a <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>fuse</b> is inserted and crimped, then a pyrotechnic ignition mix, a primary explosive, {{and then the}} main detonating explosive charge.|$|E
5000|$|Another type of time pencil had a {{percussion}} cap but no detonator attached. Instead {{there was a}} crimping attachment at one end to allow <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>fuse</b> to be crimped on. When a time pencil of this type fired, it would light the fuse which would burn towards a detonator crimped onto the other end. Because standard safety fuse burns at around half a metre per minute, it is not practicable to provide delays {{of more than a}} few minutes in this way. It was also possible to connect a pencil detonator to so-called [...] "instantaneous fuse" [...] (not to be confused with detonating cord) which had an unusually fast burn rate of over 7 metres per second.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2013 Todner started {{representing}} Michael Piggin, {{a youngster}} who anti-terror detectives believed was planning an operation {{to carry out}} mass murder {{on a list of}} six potential targets including his school in Leicestershire, the town's university, council offices and a local cinema. The attack was believed to be inspired by the infamous Columbine High School massacre {{that took place in the}} US in 1999. [...] Piggin was just 16 when he was accused of plotting the attack. Entering his bedroom police discovered an arsenal of bombs and weapons which included partially assembled petrol bombs, pipe bombs and IEDs and <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>fuse</b> cords. Officers also found pictures drawn by Piggin, depicting notorious Batman villain 'The Joker' and a note he wrote in his notebook quoting from the Batman film The Dark Knight which stated [...] "introduce anarchy, upset the established order and create chaos. In his notes he indicated himself as [...] "an agent of chaos". Shortly after the arrest Piggin was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and during the trial special arrangements had to be made to help him follow proceedings. In 2014 Piggin was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after the court was told about his diagnosis, coupled with depressive symptoms and [...] "mental disorders of a nature and degree to warrant ongoing treatment in a hospital setting". Piggin admitted collecting weapons and having a fascination with mass killings, especially the Columbine Massacre. He had faced two trials for terrorism-related offences but in both cases the jury failed to reach a verdict. Throughout the case, Piggin denied any real plans for attacks and said it had all [...] "just been in his head". During the trial, in his defence Piggin told the jury that he had no intention to carry out any attacks and tested explosives [...] "simply for entertainment".He told the jury he collected airguns and knives because it was [...] "cool". Todner commented that Piggin's condition is to blame for his morbid fantasies and said that he had been just ‘retreating into fantasy’. BBC lawyer Nicola Cain commented that Piggin's case had implications for thousands of court cases involving youngsters with Asperger's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The Filling Factories {{produced}} {{their own}} <b>pyrotechnics,</b> such as <b>fuses</b> and screening smokes; {{as many of}} these were sensitive materials. They were then filled or assembled directly into the munitions.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{consists}} of a cylindrical steel main body containing a 60 millimeter mortar shell body (originally the M49A2), linked to a tall thin fuze stand. The fuze stand held either a pin based tripwire fuze or a combination pressure tripwire fuze with a pronged pressure cap. Later fuzes were sensitive to pressure or pull and could be used with a tripwire. When the mine is triggered a black powder charge launches the mortar shell out of {{the main body of}} the mine and into the air. A <b>pyrotechnic</b> delay <b>fuse</b> triggers the mine when it has risen to between two and three meters in height. The lethal radius of the mine is reported to be approximately ten meters.|$|R
