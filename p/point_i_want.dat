500|$|Later that year, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that the September 18 show in Honolulu {{would be the last}} performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Reznor told the newspaper [...] "at this <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to switch things around a bit. [...] Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again. [...] I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. [...] I don't want it to go stale". [...] In the same article, Reznor also admitted that [...] "the idea of five guys playing loud music [...] two hours ... has got to change once finances come into play, especially performing in markets outside of the mainland U.S. I want to whittle things down".|$|E

6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, [...] "I have a {{sufficient}} inducement {{for doing what}} I can. Still, you will excuse me. There are one or two <b>points</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to talk over with Captain Farquhar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} sergeant, [...] "there are {{one or two}} <b>points</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> explained, {{and as you know}} the man, it's {{possible}} that you can help me. How did he come to be here with only about three days' rations?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absence?" [...] {{said the}} soldier, still smiling blandly over his stock. [...] "That's the very <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to get at. He is away in Africa--at the diamond fields. A {{wonderful}} interprise, conducted with remarkable energy, {{but also with}} remarkable rashness, sir--yes, bedad, inexcusable rashness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But for all that," [...] {{continued}} the lawyer, [...] "there's one <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to ask: I {{want to ask}} {{the name of that}} man who walked over the child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that," [...] he answered. [...] "That's the <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> some advice on. You see this {{document}} {{calls for a}} lady {{to fill out the}} bill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my nature's {{not like}} yours. To {{come to the}} <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to sell my ships and retire. I need rest. Freights are very depressed. I've got my family to think of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I cannot leave the works quite so often. Yes--we are {{progressing}} {{at least as}} well as anyone could expect," [...] he said. [...] "I will come and consult you whenever I can. In fact, there are several <b>points</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> your advice upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to mention}} to you--one {{of the reasons}} why I wished to speak to you alone. Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay in this neighborhood. He has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he wishes me to conduct that, and also to help him in other ways." ...|$|R
30|$|You {{have all}} these great {{insights}} and all these great ideas, {{but it does not}} mean anything if no one’s going to operationalize it at the end. So the stakeholders are bought in: “Oh, these are fantastic pain <b>points.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to fix them. But I don’t have any money, I don’t have any time. My targets and my objectives for the year are locked in”.|$|R
60|$|However, {{let that}} go. The <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to develop {{is that the}} modern doctor's {{business}} is an extremely simple one, which could be acquired in about two weeks. This {{is the way it}} is done.|$|E
60|$|The third <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to make {{concerns}} the model farm. If {{we are to}} have resettlement on any large scale and base our farming on crops in future, the accessibility of the best practical advice is an absolute essential.|$|E

"Clear out," [...] said he, {{and watched}} him till he had {{disappeared}} in the stair.--"Now, gentlemen," [...] he went on, [...] "I understand you're a joint-stock sort of crew, and that's why I've had you all down; for there's a <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> made clear. You see what sort of a ship this is--a good ship, though I say it, and you see what the rations are--good enough for sailor-men." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{just the}} <b>point</b> which <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to come to, Mrs. Douglas. You have known your husband only in England, have you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are coming}} out in quite a new light, Bob, as a squire of dames. But I won't laugh at you, now; <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to hear the last news. I {{overhauled}} that craft, {{not so much to}} capture her, as to get the last news. There were reports, before I started, that the Moors were joining the Spaniards, and that their ports were closed to us; and what you say confirms that. That was one of the <b>points</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to know, as I could not tell whether I could run in there safely, were I chased. Now, as to getting into the Rock, are their cruisers active, at present?" ...|$|R
60|$|And herein is the <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to drive}} home in my tribute to Lone Angler. No one can say how many fish he catches. He never tells. Always he has a fine, wonderful, {{beautiful}} day on the water. It matters not to him, the bringing home of fish to exhibit. This roused my admiration, and also my suspicion. I got to believing that Lone Angler caught many more fish than he ever brought home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, Johnson, {{that is what}} I {{thought was}} likely. Now, the <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to know, Johnson, and this lady here is, I may tell you, {{interested}} {{in the matter of}} this will being found, is as to whether there is in your opinion any one of the maids at the Hall who could be trusted to aid us in this business? Of course we should make it worth her while to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You didn't {{go to the}} Book for {{the point}} you made against me. But {{if you go to}} it now for the <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you to make for me, {{what are you going to}} find? Are you going to find the promise of a life any {{different}} from the life we have here? I accept it all,--all that the Old Testament says, and all that the New Testament says; and what does it amount to on this point?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... “I've {{come to a}} <b>point</b> where <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to make genuine music, {{without too}} many constraints. Not some product {{manufactured}} with hard disc recording to cater to a carefully selected target audience. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to record music that is human, organic and genuine and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to do it with}} a band. As it used to be done, really.” (Bonebakker) ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{got to a}} <b>point</b> where <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to get my name on a {{board and}} did that, wanted my name on a shoe and did that, wanted other endorsements, awards, and to win certain competitions, and did those, too ...

5000|$|James Siena (born October 28, 1957) is an American {{contemporary}} artist {{based in}} New York City. His art is typically created {{through a series}} of self-imposed constraints also sometimes referred to as visual algorithms —rules Siena decides on before sitting down to work. In most of his work he establishes a basic unit and action and repeats it indefinitely. [...] Siena commented that, [...] "at a certain <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to make drawings and works that act as machines. The way they act as machines is you have to find your way into them and find your way out of them. As you undo the making of them they come to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In one way, it's good," [...] {{replied the}} man. [...] "We're selling out {{as fast as}} we can get the truck; but there's a <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> your views about. The cheque I gave you wiped off most all the capital I had, {{wholesalers}} put up their prices if you make them wait, and a number of the boys have a bad habit of letting their bills run on. Now, if you can give me some advice----." ...|$|E
60|$|But the <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to make is}} that if the sceptic plays a Bickleyan part {{as regards}} what has been written, it seems {{probable}} that his attitude will be accentuated as regards that which it still remains for me to write. If so, I cannot help it, and must decline entirely to water down or doctor facts and thus pander to his prejudice and ignorance. For my part I cannot attempt to explain these occurrences; I only know that they happened and that I set down what I saw, heard and felt, neither more nor less.|$|E
6000|$|Then Devine made a {{sign that}} he desired attention. [...] "When I told you this, I had a purpose," [...] he said. [...] "We are going to spend a pile of dollars on the Dayspring, and my part of the {{business}} lies in the city. Wilkins stays right at the Canopus, and while Allonby goes along with the mine it's too big a contract to reform him. That brings me to the <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> a man to take charge at the Dayspring under him, and though you were not exactly civil when I made you an offer once before, we might make it worth your while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he is {{off on his}} own business," [...] {{continued}} Burke, [...] "and {{what sort}} of a princely concern he's got on hand I don't know. Anyway, he wouldn't want me followin' him about and botherin' him, and so I thought of everybody I could, and at last {{it struck me that}} there wasn't anybody better than you, Mrs. Cliff, to give me the <b>points</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted,</b> for <b>I</b> always liked you, Mrs. Cliff, and I consider you a woman of good sense down to the keel.

5000|$|Everyday I {{watch the}} news and look at how crazy the world is. It humbles you to see other people's {{problems}} {{and to see the}} amount of adversity others seem to be going through. If you think you're going through hard times, you can always turn on the TV to see someone else who's going through things 10 times worse than you. But then again, the media will also dedicate a majority of their time focusing on topics that I feel are not as news worthy, often times making celebrity gossip their main focal <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do a record with some social commentary but also not be too heavy handed when it comes to discussing the stuff that we should really be focusing on. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to find the perfect balance and go right down the middle."

40|$|Emotions involve {{transformations of}} the {{relationships}} {{that exist in the}} “natural ” world as well as in social worlds. Thus, the emotions that humans construct are based on affective processes that exist independently from human society and are not necessarily constituted by the interplay of culture and genetic or physiological processes. Keywords biology, emotion theory, sociocultural I appreciate Parkinson’s (2012) point that social processes influ-ence emotional behavior at several different levels. However, emotional behavior is different from emotional structure, and I had hoped that the article would elucidate how social processes are involved in the construction of different sorts of emotions and the relation between nature and culture.

"Well now, Ethel," [...] Cecil Mitford {{went on as}} gaily as he could, [...] "that {{brings me}} {{up to the second}} <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you to sell out these wretched New Zealands, so as to take the money with me to invest on good {{mortgages}} in Jamaica. My experience in West Indian matters--after three years in the Department--will enable me to lay it out for you at nine per cent.--nine per cent., observe, Ethel,--on absolute security of landed property. Planters want money to improve their estates, and can't get it at less than that rate.

But let that pass. The money is safe enough; but, Mr. Hathaway,--and this is the <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to discuss with you,--it begins {{to look as if}} the SECRET was safe no longer!" [...] He had raised himself with some pain and {{difficulty}} to draw nearer to Paul, and had again fixed his eyes eagerly upon him. But Paul's responsive glance was so vague that he added quickly, [...] "You understand, sir; I believe that there are hounds--I say hounds!--who would be able to blurt out at any moment that that girl at Santa Clara is Kate Howard's daughter." ...|$|E
40|$|I’ll {{discuss some}} open {{problems}} related to differential algebra for which experiments in computations may be helpful. Examples showing {{how to set up}} such experiments will be given. There are two obvious <b>points</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to make: 1. Computations become necessary when we want to compute something, like solving a system of (differential) equations, or finding some examples or counterexamples. 2. In turns, computational consideration of effectiveness and efficiency may itself lead to mathematical problems, such as complexity, enumeration of vector space basis, encoding of input and output, etc. Some of these problems are of interest in its own right.
