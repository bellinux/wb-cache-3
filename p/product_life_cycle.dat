25|$|Determining {{the balance}} of how the several effects of reuse {{interact}} is often best accomplished by a formal life cycle assessment. For example, {{research has shown that}} reusing a product can reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint by more than 50% relative to the complete <b>product</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle.</b> A relatively unknown effective way to reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint is reusing products. Often the relative carbon footprint of manufacturing and the supply chain is unknown. A scientific methodology has been developed to calculate how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used or second hand hardware versus new hardware, the so-called durability greener network calculator.|$|E
25|$|Cradle-to-gate is an {{assessment}} of a partial <b>product</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> from resource extraction (cradle) to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations (EPD) termed business-to-business EDPs. One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.|$|E

Brought together in this paper are some well-known theories dealing with consumer behaviour, buying behaviour and <b>product</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> (PLCs), in a manner that provides useful information to all firms. Too often it is found that these theories are elegant in isolation, but provide little help in focusing a company's efforts. Consumer behaviour has been researched for many decades, as has <b>product</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycles,</b> but the link between consumer buying behaviour and economic <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> of <b>products</b> is mystical, with most chief executive officers (CEOs) believing it occurs like magic.

The directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple Declaration of Conformity (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification (Annex IV), Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance (Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file, [...] the technical file and the quality system deliveries. [...] The risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps.
