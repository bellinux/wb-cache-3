5|$|Bach {{structured}} {{the work}} in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives, and a closing chorale. The scoring requires only a small ensemble of a soprano soloist, three additional vocal parts for the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, strings and basso continuo. While the first aria is <b>pensive</b> and elegiac, the second aria is of dancing folk-like character.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Brooks had {{her first}} solo show at the prestigious Gallery Durand-Ruel, {{displaying}} thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls. Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against tonal backgrounds, often with <b>pensive</b> or withdrawn expressions. The paintings were generally naturalistic, showing an attentive eye for the details of Belle Époque fashion, with parasols, veils, and elaborate bonnets on display.|$|E
5|$|The Rules of the Game (original French title: La Règle du Jeu) is a 1939 French film {{directed}} by Jean Renoir. It features an ensemble cast of Nora Gregor, Paulette Dubost, Mila Parély, Marcel Dalio, Julien Carette, Roland Toutain, Gaston Modot, Pierre Magnier and Jean Renoir himself. Renoir's {{portrayal of the}} wise, mournful Octave anchors the fatalistic mood of this <b>pensive</b> comedy of manners. The film depicts members of upper-class French society and their servants just {{before the beginning of}} World War II, showing their moral callousness on the eve of impending destruction.|$|E
5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and <b>pensive,</b> presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, <b>pensive,</b> thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E
5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks <b>pensive</b> when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts in a long time.|$|E
25|$|For New York Movie (1939), Hopper {{demonstrates}} his thorough {{preparation with}} more than 53 sketches of the theater interior and {{the figure of the}} <b>pensive</b> usherette.|$|E
25|$|Kines {{has also}} written and/or {{directed}} several short films after The Closest Thing to Time Travel, including Portrait of a <b>Pensive</b> Lady (2008), Party Pooper (2008), and Ron and Nancy (2010).|$|E
25|$|Ui's father whose {{youthful}} appearance {{makes him}} look more like her little brother. He is severe and strict, although when he is <b>pensive,</b> little rats appear atop his head much like his daughter with the baby chicks.|$|E
25|$|In class, {{the boys}} study geography. Napoleon is {{angered by the}} condescending {{textbook}} description of Corsica. He is taunted by the other boys, and kicked by the two bullies who hold flanking seats. Another of the class's island examples is Saint Helena, which puts Napoleon into a <b>pensive</b> daydream.|$|E
25|$|In February 2006, {{the band}} played another three shows with No Use for a Name before heading out on a two-week tour with Unwritten Law in the {{beginning}} of March. A European tour supported by <b>Pensive</b> — including England, Scotland, France, and Italy — was scheduled to take place in May 2006. However, due to Salazar developing polyps on his vocal folds, the tour was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Either an {{ellipsis}} or an em dash can indicate aposiopesis, {{the rhetorical}} device {{by which a}} sentence is stopped short not because of interruption, but because the speaker is too emotional or <b>pensive</b> to continue. Because the ellipsis is the more common choice, an em dash for this purpose may be ambiguous in expository text, as many readers would assume interruption, {{although it may be}} used to indicate great emotion in dramatic monologue.|$|E
25|$|A {{technique}} {{used in the}} popular frescoes of Michelangelo and Raphael was to scrape indentations into {{certain areas of the}} plaster while still wet to increase the illusion of depth and to accent certain areas over others. The eyes {{of the people of the}} School of Athens are sunken-in using this technique which causes the eyes to seem deeper and more <b>pensive.</b> Michelangelo used this technique as part of his trademark 'outlining' of his central figures within his frescoes.|$|E
25|$|Plato's philosopher, {{in search}} of the real and the true, must turn away from this {{transitory}} realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The <b>pensive</b> man in Hopper's painting is positioned between the lure of the earthly domain, figured by the woman, and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain of thinking about this choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the melancholic.|$|E
25|$|In {{painting}} and drawing, Conrad figures {{in a small}} contemporary manuscript sketch of his ship sailing to Tyre in the Annals of Genoa, and various illustrations to Scott's The Talisman. There is an imaginary portrait of him, c. 1843, by François-Édouard Picot for the Salles des Croisades at Versailles: it depicts him as a handsome, rather <b>pensive</b> man in his forties, wearing a coronet and fanciful pseudo-medieval costume. He is shown with dark hair and beard; {{it is more likely}} that, like his father and at least two of his brothers, he was blond.|$|E
25|$|There {{follows a}} six-second medium shot, in the semidarkness, of a vase {{on the floor}} in the same room, in front of a shōji screen through which the shadows of leafy {{branches}} can be seen. There is a cut back to Noriko, now looking sad and <b>pensive,</b> almost in tears. Then there is a ten-second shot of the same vase, identical to the earlier one, as the music on the soundtrack swells, cuing the next scene (which takes place at the Ryōan-ji rock garden in Kyoto, the following day).|$|E
25|$|Jane Porter {{was born}} in Durham as the third of the five {{children}} of William Porter and Jane née Blenkinsop. Tall and beautiful as she grew up, Jane Porter's grave air earned her the nickname La Penserosa ("the <b>pensive</b> girl"). After her father's death, her family moved to Edinburgh, where Sir Walter Scott was a regular visitor. Some time afterwards {{the family moved to}} London, where the sisters became acquainted with a number of literary women: Elizabeth Inchbald, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Hannah More, Elizabeth Hamilton, Selina Davenport, Elizabeth Benger and Mrs Champion de Crespigny.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Smith {{recruited}} Brett Detar, guitarist of Pennsylvania emocore band <b>Pensive,</b> to {{help him}} build a new incarnation of Zao. Detar suggested a pair of his friends, guitarist Russ Cogdell and enigmatic writer / poet (and future tattoo artist) Daniel Weyandt. Both Cogdell and Weyandt had played in Christian Hardcore band Seasons in the Field, who had released a split EP with <b>Pensive.</b> Smith would drive several hours to Greensburg, where all these new members lived, to co-write and rehearse {{what would become the}} first (and in many ways, defining) album from the new Zao, Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest. The group played fewer and fewer songs from the old version of the band as Blood and Fire took hold. They toured without a bassist and set stages ablaze with their raw emotion and Weyandt's personal storytelling, which detailed the hardships that informed their songs. With a rockabilly look and Smith's oddly engaging habit of setting up his drums facing away from the audience, their live reputation grew large in the underground. Not long after recording their half of a split EP with labelmates Training for Utopia in California, Detar left the group in 1999 to focus his energy on his rock side-project The Juliana Theory, who would sign to Sony and have a successful career before disbanding in 2006.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recorded}} by Michiel that Giorgione left this piece unfinished {{and that the}} landscape, with a Cupid which subsequent restoration has removed, were completed after his death by Titian. The picture is the prototype of Titian's own Venus of Urbino and of many more by other painters of the school; {{but none of them}} attained the fame of the first exemplar. The same concept of idealized beauty is evoked in a virginally <b>pensive</b> Judith from the Hermitage Museum, a large painting which exhibits Giorgione's special qualities of color richness and landscape romance, while demonstrating that life and death are each other's companions rather than foes.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-three horses {{missed their}} {{chance at a}} Triple Crown by not winning the Belmont. Eight of these {{finished}} second: <b>Pensive</b> (1944), Tim Tam (1958), Forward Pass (1968), Majestic Prince (1969), Sunday Silence (1989), Silver Charm (1997), Real Quiet (1998), and Smarty Jones (2004). Five finished third: Northern Dancer (1964), Spectacular Bid (1979), Pleasant Colony (1981), Charismatic (1999), and Funny Cide (2003). Four finished fourth: Kauai King (1966), Canonero II (1971), Alysheba (1987), and California Chrome (2014). Carry Back (1961) finished seventh, War Emblem (2002) finished eighth and Big Brown (2008) did not finish. Finally, three Derby/Preakness winners did not race in the Belmont: Burgoo King (1932), Bold Venture (1933) and I'll Have Another (2012).|$|E
25|$|Back in the present, {{the three}} travel in a motorboat to Big Arch's mansion. After they dock at the pier, Alien is {{shot and killed}} by one of Big Arch's guards. Brit and Candy carry on, killing Big Arch's gang before confronting and killing Big Arch himself. During the assault and its aftermath, the camera pans over the dead bodies of Big Arch's gang while the girls speak in a voice-over, first heard earlier in the film, {{describing}} the beach's beauty and musing that they have discovered who they truly are. Brit and Candy, silent and wearing <b>pensive,</b> ambiguous expressions, drive home in Big Arch's Lamborghini. A final flashback shows the pair kissing Alien's dead body.|$|E
25|$|The {{isolated}} {{figures are}} given statuesque but largely unmodeled treatment, and their skin and their clothes are clean, with a waxy finish. They appear unselfconscious, {{at ease in}} their environment, and—with {{the possible exception of}} the boy to the bottom right—are locked in a <b>pensive</b> and solitary reverie. Horizontal and vertical lines at the middle and far distance contrast with arched backs and the relaxed postures of the figures toward the front. These postures, angles of heads, directions of gaze, and positions of limbs are repeated among the figures, giving the group a rhythmic unity. Distinctively coloured forms in close proximity, such as the grouping of horse-chestnut colours of the clothes on the bank, and the grouping of oranges of the boys in the water, add to the stability of the work—an effect reinforced in the cluster of shadows to the left on the bank, and the un-verisimilar play of light around the bathing figures.|$|E
25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a <b>pensive</b> {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E
500|$|Bradley Joseph (born 1965) is an American composer, arranger, and {{producer}} of contemporary instrumental music. His compositions include works for orchestra, quartet, and solo piano, while his musical style ranges from [...] "quietly <b>pensive</b> mood music {{to a rich}} orchestration of classical depth and breadth".|$|E
500|$|In this aria, an {{individual}} believer requests Jesus {{to make him}} follow, even without comprehending where and why. Mincham observes a mood or affekt of [...] "deep involvement and <b>pensive</b> commitment", with the oboe creating [...] "an aura of suffering {{and a sense of}} struggling and reaching upwards in search of something indefinable in a way that only music can suggest." ...|$|E
500|$|Somewhere {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} has a [...] "certified fresh" [...] score of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 182 reviews with an average score of 6.6 out of 10. The critical consensus states: [...] "It covers familiar territory for Sofia Coppola, but Somewhere remains a hypnotic, seductively <b>pensive</b> meditation {{on the nature of}} celebrity, anchored by charming performances from Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning". The film also has a score of 67 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 40 reviews.|$|E
500|$|Tendi {{stated that}} {{although}} he had a natural wittiness, Mugabe often hid this behind [...] "an outwardly <b>pensive</b> and austere manner and his penchant for ceremony and tradition". Heidi Holland suggested that due to his [...] "dysfunctional" [...] upbringing, Mugabe had a [...] "fragile self-image", describing him as [...] "a man cut off from his feelings, devoid of ordinary warmth and humanity". According to her, Mugabe had a [...] "marked emotional immaturity", and was homophobic, as well as racist and xenophobic.|$|E
500|$|Game Developer listed Vreeland {{in their}} 2012 Power 50 {{for his work}} on the soundtrack, which they {{described}} as [...] "atmospheric, <b>pensive,</b> and maybe even a little bit melancholy". In keeping with Fez theme of secrets, images visible only through spectrogram were embedded into the soundtrack audio. Vreeland released a remix album, FZ: Side F, a year later on April 20, 2013. It features tracks from other artists, including Jim Guthrie. Vreeland later released another remix album, FZ: Side Z, and all three albums were included in the August 2013 Game Music Bundle 5.|$|E
500|$|Later in the night, Jasmine meets Aslam at his uncle's restaurant. He {{tries to}} explain his love for her, only to be {{interrupted}} and told that she is engaged and the two should stop seeing one another. Dejected and disappointed, Aslam meets with Khan, who seems unusually <b>pensive.</b> The two lament their relationships, not knowing they are both {{in love with the}} same woman. Just before Aslam is about to reveal the name of his romantic interest, a phone rings - Khan, jubilant, announces that his proposal has been accepted and orders Aslam to pick up his new [...] "bhabhi," [...] or sister-in-law.|$|E
500|$|Hair was {{conceived}} by actors James Rado and Gerome Ragni. [...] The two met in 1964 when they performed {{together in the}} Off-Broadway flop Hang Down Your Head and Die, and they began writing Hair together in late 1964. [...] The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado's Claude being a <b>pensive</b> romantic and Ragni's Berger an extrovert. [...] Their close relationship, including its volatility, {{was reflected in the}} musical. [...] Rado explained, [...] "We were great friends. [...] It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece. [...] We put the drama between us on stage." ...|$|E
500|$|Nectoux {{rates the}} first nocturne {{as one of}} the best of the composer's early works. It is dedicated, like Fauré's song [...] "Après un rêve", to his friend and early patron Marguerite Baugnies. Morrison calls the piece [...] "cloistered and elegiac." [...] Though {{published}} as the composer's Op 33/1 in 1883, it was written considerably earlier. It opens with a slow, <b>pensive</b> melody, followed by a more agitated second theme and another melody in C major, and ends with the return of the opening theme. The pianist and academic Sally Pinkas writes that the work contains many hallmarks of Fauré's style, including [...] "undulating rhythms, syncopation of the accompaniment against the melody and layered textures are already in evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|Gil Kaufman from MTV News {{found the}} {{performance}} to be <b>pensive,</b> saying that [...] "leave it to Lady Gaga to go completely {{the other direction}} [...] ". Jon Caramanica from The New York Times complimented Gaga's [...] "easiest-to-consume" [...] performance for being [...] "taut and focused" [...] without any error in its execution. A review in Spin called {{it one of the}} most bare performances of the show. Conversely, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard was critical of the performance, feeling that it [...] "failed to be the emotional stunner it desperately deserved to be". He believed that although directors Spike Jonze and Chris Milk kept the focus on Gaga's tear-stricken face to give it an intimate feel, the screaming of the audience ruined the performance.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Ryan Hope and released on 26 February 2016 exclusively on the Apple Store. The black-and-white video finds the singer in a <b>pensive</b> state, with scenes shot in slow motion. In the beginning, Malik is first seen alone inside a home while his video co-star Nicola Peltz is outside enjoying the pool. Later, Malik sits at a piano. As the video progresses, [...] "the object of his affection is seen with another man {{at a cocktail party}} while Malik looks on. It culminates with Malik watching through a window as his former love drives away," [...] as explained by Rolling Stone Althea Legaspi. Eventually, the video was uploaded on his Vevo account on YouTube on 28 March 2016.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} art historians {{have noted the}} {{apparent}} contradiction between the man's plain looks and enigmatic expression. Meiss describes him as [...] "plain and rustic", and finds a resemblance between his rather generic face {{and a number of}} figures in the lower portions of the [...] "Adoration of the Lamb" [...] panel in the Ghent Altarpiece. Agreeing with Panofsky, he observes a [...] "thoughtfulness on the high, wrinkled forehead, visionary force in the dreamy yet steady eyes, [...] a formidable strength of passion in the wide, firm mouth". According to Panofsky, the man's face is not that of an intellectual, yet he detects a <b>pensive</b> and lonely nature, [...] "the face of one who feels and produces rather than observes and dissects".|$|E
500|$|Among Harrison's biographers, Simon Leng {{considers}} [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] a [...] "classic of Harrison's lyrical ambiguity, {{in essence}} a hopeful song, without sounding so", with a lyric that [...] "approaches Bob Dylan standard". Ian Inglis also praises the lyrics, writing: [...] "The song contains some of Harrison's most insightful and <b>pensive</b> words. 'Daylight {{is good at}} arriving at the right time' is {{a fine example of}} his... ability to position the profound within the commonplace." [...] Elliot Huntley rates it as one of Harrison's [...] "most beautiful" [...] songs, [...] "if not the very best", and suggests that the sentiments behind [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] would have made it a [...] "fitting conclusion" [...] to the final album recorded by the Beatles, Abbey Road (1969).|$|E
500|$|The opening aria, [...] "" [...] (I am {{content with}} the fortune that my dear God bestows on me.), is slow and <b>pensive,</b> {{accompanied}} by all instruments, reminiscent of the slow movement of an oboe concerto. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted in 2000 the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, noted in the project diary that Bach, who possibly was not content with his situation in Leipzig, composed music portraying [...] "ambivalence and complexity". His music is [...] "dynamic and fluctuating", capturing [...] "wistful, resigned, elegiac" [...] moods. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that the aria compares to Ich bin in mir vergnügt, BWV 204 (I am content in myself) which he describes as [...] "also a highly personal work for solo soprano with a similar theme, exploring comparable human emotions".|$|E
