40|$|Abstract—Diffraction of {{electromagnetic}} waves by a media containing <b>periodic</b> <b>changes</b> of characteristics {{is widely used}} in many optical devices and processing methods. Usually diffractive structures contain <b>periodic</b> <b>changes</b> of relative electric permittivity. In this article, we have analyzed electromagnetic wave interaction with a media containing <b>periodic</b> <b>changes</b> of both relative electric permittivity, and relative magnetic permeability. Most of this work is based on using transfer matrix approach and rigorous coupled wave method for analysis of both TE and TM polarizations. Our analytical formulation proves the possibility of polarization insensitivity in diffractive behavior of these structures under specific relationship between harmonic contents of electric permittivity and magnetic permeability.

60|$|The {{idea that}} a {{text-book}} should be regularly reset and reprinted is still quite foreign to the Professorial mind, as, indeed, {{is the idea that}} the care of text-books and publications is a University function at all. No one is startled by a proposal to apply £800 or £1000 a year to a new chair in any subject, but to apply that sum yearly as a standing charge to the revision and perfection of a specific text-book would seem, even today, quite fantastically extravagant to most University men. Yet what could be more obviously helpful to sound and thorough teaching than for a University, or a group of Universities, to sustain a Professor in each of the chief subjects of instruction, whose business would be neither teaching as it is now understood, nor research, but the critical and exhaustive editing of the College text- book of his subject, a text-book which would stand in type at the University Press, which would be revised annually and reprinted annually, primarily {{for the use of the}} matriculated students of the University and incidentally for publication. His business would be not only to bring the work up to date and parallel with all the newest published research and to invite and consider proposals of contributions and footnotes from men with new views and new matter, but also to substitute for obscure passages fuller and more lucid expositions, to cut down or relegate to smaller type passages of diminishing importance and to introduce fresh and more efficient illustrations, and his work would be carried on in consultation with the General Editor of the University Press who would also be a specialist in modern printing and book-making, and who would be constantly taking up, trying, and adopting fresh devices of arrangement, and newer, better, and cheaper methods of printing and illustration. It would not merely raise the general efficiency of the College work of adolescents very greatly to have this series of textbooks living and growing in each subject at one or (better) at several Universities or grouped Universities, but in each subject the <b>periodic</b> <b>change</b> in these books would afford a most valuable corrective to the influence of specialized work by keeping the specialist worker easily in touch with the current presentation of his science as a whole.|$|E
