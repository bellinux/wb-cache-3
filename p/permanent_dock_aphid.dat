5000|$|Following Queen Marys <b>permanent</b> <b>docking</b> in California, {{claims were}} {{made that the}} ship was haunted. [...] One of the staterooms is alleged be haunted by {{the spirit of a}} person who {{supposedly}} was murdered there.|$|R
50|$|Randolph Park covers 41 acres. It has a beach. Other {{facilities}} {{include a}} beach {{house with a}} changing room, a refreshment stand, a picnic facilities, a playground area, a <b>permanent</b> <b>docks</b> for lap swimming, a volleyball court and a basketball court.|$|R
50|$|The objects {{contained}} within the living space are in constant flux, in congruence with the transient nature of its inhabitants, who are seasonal, temporary residents of the island. Indianapolis Island is installed in 100 Acres’ 35-acre lake. It is floated on a <b>permanent</b> <b>dock</b> structure that is anchored by two concrete blocks from the shoreline.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "hybrid" [...] version, {{combining}} {{the design of}} SSVP and APAS-95, is also available, used for <b>permanent</b> <b>docking</b> of space station modules. This version uses the probe-and-drogue design of the standard SSVP, but with a hard-dock collar from APAS-95. The APAS-95 collar has twelve latches instead of the eight of standard SSVP. This variant is known as SSVP-M8000.|$|R
50|$|A yard ramp, {{sometimes}} called mobile yard ramp or container ramp, is a movable metal ramp for {{loading and unloading}} of shipping containers and vehicle trailers, {{without the need for}} <b>permanent</b> <b>docking</b> bays. A yard ramp is placed at the back of a vehicle to provide access for forklifts to ascend the ramp, quickly and safely into the container or truck body.|$|R
50|$|STS-74 was NASA's second Space Shuttle {{mission to}} {{rendezvous}} and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. During the 8-day flight the Atlantis crew successfully attached a <b>permanent</b> <b>docking</b> module to Mir and transferred over 2,000 pounds of food, water and scientific supplies {{for use by}} the cosmonauts. The STS-74 mission was accomplished in 129 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.4 million miles in 196 hours, 30 minutes, 44 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Manchester was {{established}} in the 1860s and was originally known as Brooklyn, after the borough in New York City. The name was changed to Manchester in 1892 in honor of the city of Manchester, England. Manchester was accessible by land via Shelton/Allyn/Belfair, however, the main population center, Seattle, had only boat access. After a <b>permanent</b> <b>dock</b> was built in 1908, regular steamboat service connected Manchester to nearby communities like Colby, Southworth, and Harper, and to Seattle across the water.|$|R
50|$|The Government of Canada {{provided}} {{the community of}} Gimli with a grant in 1898 to build a harbour in the community. A <b>permanent</b> <b>dock</b> was built in 1900 and a lighthouse was added in 1910. The lighthouse would later be damaged in an ice pileup in 1943 which managed to push it over. The original top of the lighthouse was saved and later and put {{on top of a}} rebuilt replica in 1974 as part of a tourist attraction. The lighthouse is currently managed by the New Iceland Heritage Museum.|$|R
5000|$|STS-74 Atlantis, {{launched}} from KSC on November 12, 1995, was NASA’s second Space Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. During the eight-day flight the crew aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis attached a <b>permanent</b> <b>docking</b> module to Mir, conducted {{a number of}} secondary experiments, and transferred [...] tons of supplies and experiment equipment between Atlantis and the Mir station. Atlantis landed at Kennedy Space Center on November 20 after accomplishing in 129 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.4 million miles in 196 hours, 30 minutes, 44 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|PS Lincoln Castle was a {{coal-fired}} side-wheel paddle steamer, which ferried passengers {{across the}} Humber from the Second World War until 1978. She {{was the last}} coal-fired paddle steamer still in regular services in the UK. Later, she served as a pub at Hessle, {{and then as a}} restaurant under <b>permanent</b> <b>dock</b> in Alexandra Dock Grimsby. In September 2010, the Hull Daily Mail reported that she was in an advanced state of demolition, despite the efforts of local people to buy the historic vessel and restore her. [...] On 31 March 2011, The Lincoln Castle Preservation Society were reported to have purchased the broken up parts of the ship for restoration.|$|R
50|$|Yard ramps {{can also}} be used either inside or outside of buildings; they avoid the need to {{construct}} expensive <b>permanent</b> concrete <b>docking</b> bays; and are ideal for short term use in peak periods or on temporary sites.|$|R
50|$|The Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum {{was able}} to obtain this Navy {{destroyer}} because of the vast amount of volunteer work put in by the board members and many outside volunteers as well. A <b>permanent</b> <b>dock</b> was built for the museum. About 140 gal of paint in two different shades of gray were ordered for the painting of the dock. While waiting to obtain {{the last of the}} additional paint that is needed to completely repaint and restore the USS Edson color, the museum received word that those who are on the Navy's delayed entry program and are waiting to be shipped off to boot camp are willing to volunteer in the restoration of the destroyer.|$|R
50|$|Using a yard ramp for {{container}} loading or unloading {{allows the}} work {{to be carried out}} by a single forklift operator. Businesses handling only one or two loads per day normally find that a yard ramp is more cost effective than a <b>permanent</b> loading <b>dock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Volkert Douw was {{appointed}} mayor in 1761. In 1763 a second fire engine was purchased. Prior to 1766 Albany had no <b>permanent</b> <b>docks,</b> {{so in that}} year the Common Council had three stone docks built. Each were 80 ft long and between 30 ft and 40 ft wide. [...] In 1770 Abraham Cuyler {{was appointed}} mayor, being the last mayor to be appointed under a British Royal Commission. Also in that year, a fourth dock was built along {{the river and the}} sloop Olive Branch became the first Albany ship to set sail for the West Indies. Additionally, the city sold its remaining land in Schaghticoke. The Gazette became the first newspaper in Albany, first published in 1771 by Alexander and James Robertson.|$|R
5000|$|For some centuries, {{commercial}} trade {{through the}} port was limited {{in part by}} the shallow waters on the approach to the quay, but mainly by the power of Exeter, which owned the dock and controlled all estuary traffic. [...] The roads {{in and out of the}} area were in a poor state and only occasionally repaired by the parishes through which they ran. A more <b>permanent</b> <b>dock</b> was built in 1825, replacing a series of apparently seasonal docks first noted on maps from 1576 as [...] "The Docke". New docks designed by Eugenius Birch were opened in 1868, and a short line connected them to the railway goods yard. The area adjacent to the docks once housed a thriving community of some 125 chalets built on the shoreline. These have been replaced by a residential marina complex known as Exmouth Quay.|$|R
50|$|At {{some point}} in or after 1922 the station was closed and {{replaced}} by the altogether more solid and <b>permanent</b> Immingham <b>Dock</b> station a short distance southeast, {{within sight of the}} dock's entrance locks. A photo of a locomotive at Immingham Dock station in Great Central Railway livery suggests that the handover took place in the early 1920s.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Associated British Ports {{agreed to}} {{terminate}} the lease on the dock to the then operators, ship repairers A&P Group, following which the caisson gates and keel blocks were removed, thus converting the <b>dock</b> to a <b>permanent</b> wet <b>dock.</b> The dock was then {{used in conjunction with}} the bulk-handling terminal at Berths 107 to 109, operated by Solent Stevedores.|$|R
50|$|Several vessels under Rivière's command were {{normally}} {{stationed in}} Cochinchina or Cambodia, including the troopship Drac, the light frigate Alouette {{and the small}} gunboats Framée and Javeline. Tilsitt, the flagship of the Cochinchina naval division, was disarmed and in <b>permanent</b> <b>dock</b> at Saigon, and served as the division’s storehouse and administrative centre. Most of the division's vessels, however, were stationed in Tonkin, where they were enforcing the right of free navigation on the Red River conceded to France by the Vietnamese government in 1874. Rivière's command in Tonkin consisted of the light frigates Hamelin, Parseval and Antilope (the latter due to be replaced shortly by Pluvier), the heavy gunboats Lynx and Vipère, the seagoing gunboats Fanfare, Léopard and Surprise, and the smaller river gunboats Carabine, Éclair, Hache, Massue, Trombe and Yatagan. The heavy gunboats had crews of 77 men and mounted four cannon, while the smaller gunboats had two cannon each. They all carried a Hotchkiss canon-revolver in their tops.|$|R
50|$|Where {{it is not}} {{practical}} to install <b>permanent</b> concrete loading <b>docks,</b> or for temporary situations, then {{it is common to}} use a mobile version of the loading dock, often called a yard ramp.|$|R
50|$|Harmony was {{the first}} {{permanent}} living space enlargement to the ISS after the Pirs docking compartment was added in 2001. The Expedition 16 crew moved the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2) on November 12, 2007 from the Destiny Laboratory to the forward berth of Harmony. The combined PMA-2/Harmony unit was subsequently berthed to its final destination at the forward end of the Destiny Laboratory on November 14, 2007. All the following Space Shuttle missions would be docked to this location. On February 11, 2008, ESA's Columbus laboratory {{was attached to the}} starboard hatch of the Harmony module during space shuttle mission STS-122. On March 14, 2008 the Experiment Logistics Module Pressurized Section (ELM-PS) of Kibō was attached to its interim location: the zenith hatch of Harmony. During STS-124 a Space Shuttle mission flown by Space Shuttle Discovery, the Pressurized Module of Kibō was added to the port side of Harmony and the ELM-PS was moved, leaving the zenith hatch empty. The zenith hatch was originally intended to be the <b>permanent</b> <b>docking</b> connector for the now canceled Centrifuge Accommodations Module (CAM).|$|R
50|$|It was a {{mechanically}} {{driven arm}} used to move modules from the forward (or axial) docking ports which had rendevouz equipment fitted to the <b>permanent</b> radial <b>docking</b> ports. The arm mated with a socket located on Mir’s multiple docking assembly node {{adjacent to the}} -XB end of the Base Block. Once connected, the module's main docking probe retracted and the arm raised the module so that it pivoted 90 degrees for docking to a radial port.|$|R
25|$|After {{restoration}} {{work was}} completed, {{she was taken}} to her <b>permanent</b> berth—Constellation <b>Dock,</b> Inner Harbor at Pier 1, 301 East Pratt Street, Baltimore, Maryland on 4 July 1961. She was designated a National Historic Landmark on 23 May 1963, and {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places on 15 October 1966. She is the last existing intact naval vessel from the American Civil War, and {{she was one of the}} last wind-powered warships built by the U.S. Navy.|$|R
50|$|The route was {{authorised}} in 1907 as {{a direct}} link between Barton-upon-Humber and Immingham Dock. Only the section between Goxhill and Immingham was built and a junction with the Barton Line created. For the line's first years the temporary southern terminus was Immingham Western jetty. This station was adjacent to the ramp carrying a line onto the jetty. At some point in or after 1922 it {{was replaced by the}} <b>permanent</b> Immingham <b>Dock</b> station a short distance nearer the dock entrance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{temporary}} station {{lasted for}} some years. The July 1922 [...] "Bradshaw" [...] shows Immingham Western jetty as the line's terminus, whilst {{a photograph of}} a locomotive in Great Central livery using the <b>permanent</b> replacement Immingham <b>Dock</b> station suggests the handover took place around 1922. The new station was nearer the dock gates.|$|R
50|$|Screw anchors {{can be used}} {{to anchor}} <b>permanent</b> moorings, {{floating}} <b>docks,</b> fish farms, etc. These anchors must be screwed into the seabed {{with the use of a}} tool, so require access to the bottom, either at low tide or by use of a diver. Hence they can be difficult to install in deep water without special equipment.|$|R
25|$|The {{opening of}} the Suez Canal (also in 1869) meant that steamships now enjoyed a much shorter route to China, so Cutty Sark spent {{only a few years}} on the tea trade before turning to the trade in wool from Australia, where she held the record time to Britain for ten years. Improvements in steam {{technology}} meant that gradually steamships also came to dominate the longer sailing route to Australia, and the ship was sold to the Portuguese company Ferreira and Co. in 1895 and renamed Ferreira. She continued as a cargo ship until purchased in 1922 by retired sea captain Wilfred Dowman, who used her as a training ship operating from Falmouth, Cornwall. After his death, Cutty Sark was transferred to the Thames Nautical Training College, Greenhithe in 1938 where she became an auxiliary cadet training ship alongside HMS Worcester. By 1954, she had ceased to be useful as a cadet ship and was transferred to <b>permanent</b> dry <b>dock</b> at Greenwich, London, for public display.|$|R
25|$|Three {{days after}} leaving Whitehorse the SS Keno arrived in Dawson City, {{becoming}} {{the last of}} Yukon's sternwheeler fleet to navigate the river under her own power. She was subsequently winched up onto {{the banks of the}} river and installed in a <b>permanent</b> dry <b>dock.</b> The HSMBC spent much of the following two years completing refurbishment and restoration work on the vessel, before the SS Keno was officially declared a National Historic Site of Canada on 1 July, Canada Day, 1962, during the opening ceremonies for the Dawson Festival. The vessel formed the first meeting and entertainment space for the newly formed Klondike Visitors Association tourism group, and it still forms a major tourist attraction in Dawson City. Following the destruction by fire of the second Casca and the Whitehorse in Whitehorse in 1974, and the Tutshi in Carcross in 1990, the Keno is one of only three Yukon sternwheelers that survive in good condition, from a fleet that numbered at least 250 in total during the century between 1855 and 1955.|$|R
500|$|Most of the city's {{landmarks}} {{and tourist}} attractions {{are related to}} its naval history. Among the attractions are the D-Day Museum and the adjacent Overlord embroidery in Southsea, which was awarded a grant of £4 million by the Heritage Lottery Fund to expand it in time for 2019. The museum's embroidery is [...] long, making it the longest {{of its kind in}} the world. The city is home to some famous ships: in the dry dock of Portsmouth Historic Dockyard lies Horatio Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory, the world's oldest naval ship still in commission. HMS Victory was preserved for the nation and placed in <b>permanent</b> dry <b>dock</b> in 1922, when the Society for Nautical Research led a national appeal to restore her. 22million people have visited her since. In 1971, the remains of Henry VIII's flagship, the Mary Rose, was rediscovered on the seabed. She was raised and brought into a purpose-built structure in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard in 1982. Britain's first iron-hulled warship, HMS Warrior, was restored and moved to Portsmouth in June 1987 after serving as an oil fuel pier at Pembroke Dock in Pembrokeshire for fifty years. The National Museum of the Royal Navy is also in the historic dockyard, and is sponsored by an independent charity which aims to promote research into the history and archaeology of the Royal Dockyard. Every November the Historic Dockyard hosts the Victorian Festival of Christmas, which features a traditional green-coloured Father Christmas.|$|R
