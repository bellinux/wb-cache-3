2500|$|Sarkar‘s {{economic}} system rests upon {{the concept of}} a tiered economic structure in which the production and distribution of goods is performed according to three distinctive business models [...] During his lifetime, he classifies and clarifies the need for these models which are; medium-scale worker-owned cooperatives, small-scale privately owned businesses and government-run large scale key industries. Sarkar justifies this economic structure by claiming that there are fundamental strengths and weaknesses embedded in each style of business which makes them more suitable for specific industries and scales of operation [...] Cooperatives, he understood, are desirable for the majority of enterprises [...] This claim has been given since that by working together and taking hold of the means of <b>production,</b> <b>cooperative</b> workers and consumers will be safeguarded against different forms of economic exploitation, offering no scope for intermediaries to interfere with their business. However, key industries vital {{to the development of the}} country and of strategic importance (such as electrical utilities or the railway system), should be run by the immediate local government. He justified this idea by claiming that these industries are to complex and large scale to be run effectively by a cooperative. Finally, Sarkar defends that small businesses can be privately owned and managed. Enterprises with few employees such as family businesses are encouraged to be self-managed. Sarkarian thought sees that some people have economic dreams that are more individual in nature and hence not suitable to be constrained by collective interests.|$|E

This mode of production assumes an urgent relevance in light of ongoing challenges posed by global neoliberal capitalism. This study endeavours to historicize the shift towards non-traditional agricultural exports (NTAEs) in the operations of self-managed agricultural <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Costa Rica; explore the social relations of production apparent in two case studies; and situate the reorientation of cooperative agriculture and transformation of cooperative labour {{within the context of}} global neoliberal capitalism. Through an ethnographic investigation of two self-managed agricultural <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> this investigation seeks to link daily realities to prevailing socioeconomic structures. Findings suggest that self-managed agricultural <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Costa Rica have assimilated the NTAE imperative of the state and capital and have concurrently intensified the employment of hired workers from outside cooperative membership in apparent conflict with the tenet of worker self-management...|$|R

Currently, many types of products are manufactured by cooperation of several producers. This means that most of plants use the various site production facilities in order to make economic competitive advantages. It is possible that particular segment of a family product is produced in different sites. The events like defection of device, the absence of operator, lack of expert work force can be of the reasons of allocation to different sites or plants.

The findings indicated that <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> were more successful in promoting farmers' income and participation of members in community activities, increasing equity and farmers' work related welfare while mechanized companies had more achievements in flexibility and participation of members in making decisions regarding farming activities and in terms of payment to farmers. In other words, <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have been more successful in achieving development goals (increasing income, participation, and work related welfare and decreasing inequity).

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} the socio-economic power {{of renewable energy}} <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> for a wider energy system transformation in Germany. Energy cooperatives have turned into important supporters of renewable and decentralised energy structures, due to their strong growth since the year 2006, their participation in local renewable energy projects and their democratic awareness. The cooperative form of coordinating local renewable energy projects applies to a decentralised energy system that is managed by many smaller firms - a system concept that is preferred {{by the majority of}} German citizens. However, there is not enough knowledge to understand to what extent this organisational form is able to unify a broad group of actors in promoting a renewable energy system (societal power) and to gather capital for elaborating renewable energy supply structures (economic power). The reflection is based on an empirical assessment of all energy cooperatives that were registered in Germany before 31 st December 2013. Their growth dynamic and their business approaches are discussed. A special focus lies on renewable energy <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> The study presents the development of their members, their capital, their profit and loss, as well as their investment intensity over a timeframe of three years (2010 - 2012). The socio-economic potential of renewable energy <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> for supporting a renewable energy system is discussed against the background of empirical results...|$|R
