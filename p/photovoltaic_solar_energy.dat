40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} are growing {{and interest in}} environmental issues is increasing {{and the idea of}} generating electricity with less pollution {{is becoming more and more}} attractive. Unlike conventional generation systems, fuel of the <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>energy</b> is available at no cost. And <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>energy</b> systems generate electricity pollution-free and can easily be installed on the roof of residential as well as on the wall of commercial buildings as grid-connected PV application. In addition to grid-connected rooftop PV systems, <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>energy</b> offers a solution for supplying electricity to remote located communities and facilities, those not accessible by electricity companies. The interest in <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>energy</b> is growing worldwide. Today, more than 3500 MW of photovoltaic systems have been installed all over the world. Since 1970, the PV price has continuously dropped [8]. This price drop has encouraged worldwide application of small-scale residential PV systems. These recent developments have led researchers concerned with the environment to undertake extensive research projects for harnessing renewable <b>energy</b> sources including <b>solar</b> <b>energy.</b> The usage of <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> as a source of energy is considered more seriously making future of this technology looks promising.
