50|$|Gold-aluminium {{intermetallic}} - {{giving rise}} to <b>Purple</b> <b>plague</b> or White plague, another failure mode for electronic components due {{to the formation of}} a crystalline substance.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 Brockway wrote {{a science}} fiction novel, <b>Purple</b> <b>Plague,</b> in which a sea liner is quarantined for a decade {{as a result of}} a plague. An egalitarian society emerges.|$|E
50|$|Wire bonding between {{gold plated}} {{contacts}} and aluminium wires or between aluminium contacts and gold wires {{under certain conditions}} develops a brittle layer of gold-aluminium intermetallics, known as <b>purple</b> <b>plague.</b>|$|E
5000|$|These {{intermetallics}} {{have different}} properties than the individual metals, {{which can cause}} problems in wire bonding in microelectronics. The main compounds formed are Au5Al2 (white plague) and AuAl2 (<b>purple</b> <b>plague),</b> which both form at high temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|Invasive exotic {{plant species}} such as Mist Flower (Ageratina riparia), <b>Purple</b> <b>Plague</b> (Miconia calvescens), Blue Star (Aristea ecklonii) and Coster's Curse (Clidemia hirta) that {{increasingly}} spread into otherwise well protected mountain forest areas and crowd away the native Sri Lankan flora are a major threat, if not the largest one, to Sri Lankan montane rain forest flora and fauna.|$|E
50|$|If {{the gold}} layer does not {{completely}} dissolve into the solder, then slow intermetallic reactions can proceed in the solid state as the tin and gold atoms cross-migrate. Intermetallics have poor electrical conductivity and low strength. The ongoing intermetallic reactions also cause Kirkendall effect, leading to mechanical {{failure of the}} joint, similar to the degradation of gold-aluminium bonds known as <b>purple</b> <b>plague.</b>|$|E
50|$|Contestants must go {{up a long}} {{staircase}} but, {{the defenders}} make the stairs really slippery by using the trademark slime balls, a foam gun and the Vile Volley. Also, the Defender {{at the top of}} the stairs uses the <b>Purple</b> <b>Plague</b> (a cart full of purple balls) and the Balls of Doom. The fastest four Attackers to overcome the obstacles, ditches the dungeon and capture the four flags advance to Round 3.|$|E
50|$|White plague is {{the name}} of the {{compound}} Au5Al2 as well as the problem it causes. It has low electrical conductivity, so its formation at the joint leads to an increase of electrical resistance which can lead to total failure. <b>Purple</b> <b>plague</b> (sometimes known as 'purple death' or Roberts-Austen's 'purple gold') is a brittle, bright-purple compound, AuAl2, or about 78.5%Au-21.5%Al by mass. AuAl2 is the most stable thermally of the Au-Al intermetallic compounds, with a melting point of 1060°C (see phase diagram), similar to that of pure gold. The process of the growth of the intermetallic layers causes reduction in volume, and hence creates cavities in the metal near the interface between gold and aluminium.|$|E
50|$|Other gold-aluminium {{intermetallics}} {{can cause}} problems as well. Below 624°C, <b>purple</b> <b>plague</b> {{is replaced by}} Au2Al, a tan-colored substance. It is a poor conductor and can cause electrical failure of the joint {{that can lead to}} mechanical failure. At lower temperatures, about 400 - 450°C, an interdiffusion process takes place at the junction. This leads to formation of layers of several intermetallic compounds with different compositions, from gold-rich to aluminium-rich, with different growth rates. Cavities form as the denser, faster-growing layers consume the slower-growing ones. This process, known as Kirkendall voiding, leads to both increased electrical resistance and mechanical weakening of the wire bond. When the voids are collected along the diffusion front, a process aided by contaminants present in the lattice, it is known as Horsting voiding, a process similar to and often confused with Kirkendall voiding.|$|E
