The pathway that induces Vibrio harveyi luminescence is controlled by two parallel pathways. The first pathway uses a typical AI-1 homoserine lactone signaling molecule. However the bacteria were also found to recognize a second auto inducer AI-2. Scientist also found that V. harveyi luminescence could be induced by 75 other bacterial species AI-2 molecules.This discovery led to the proposal of AI-2 as a universal form of communication between bacteria species. In addition to information about cell densities AI-2 can provide information on the growth phase and prosperity of cells in a population. It has a greater ability to store information than other quorum sensing molecules because its production is tied to cell growth. The production of AI-2 peaks in late log phase for many bacteria.

40|$|The {{spider silk}} <b>producing</b> <b>system</b> {{comprises}} {{a complex set}} of different gland types ending in specialized appendages called spinnerets. Using these organs, all spiders produce different types of silk that they employ {{for a wide range of}} tasks, which is a unique trait in the animal kingdom. Unfortunately, the evolutionary origin of the silk <b>producing</b> <b>system</b> is currently poorly understood. Available hypotheses proposed that the different components of the system are homologous to particular other spider organs. If this is true, then it is likely that conserved features, such as parts of the genetic program that regulates their development, are shared between different elements of the silk <b>producing</b> <b>system</b> and their postulated homologs. Examining the morphological and molecular basis of silk gland and spinneret development could therefore provide evidence for their evolutionary origin. The goals of this thesis thus were to describe the embryonic and post-embryonic development of the silk glands and spinnerets in our model species Cupiennius salei, to localize the position of the primordia of the silk glands and to investigate the genetic patterning of the developing spinneret limb buds. In order to facilitate these goals, the late embryonic and early post-embryonic staging system of C. salei was reassessed and modified. The silk glands of the first free foraging stage were described in detail and were found to be already remarkably similar to the adult glands, including a system that allows for the production of silk during molting. It was confirmed that the silk glands first appear inside the spinnerets, supporting their supposed epidermal origin. Detailed investigation of the epidermis of the spinneret limb buds showed invaginations that possibly are the earliest morphological indications of the primordia of the silk glands, and provide a lead to investigating which molecular factors are involved in their early developmental origin. Finally, the study of expression patterns of leg patterning genes in the spinneret limb buds provided a way of comparing these structures with other spider appendages. Taken together, this thesis provides a solid basis for further research to shed more light on the evolution of the spider silk <b>producing</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

Four different cases are considered: [A] pins aligned longitudinally in flowing fluid having constant temperature gradient, [B] pins aligned transversely in flowing fluid flow with constant temperature gradient, [C] pins moving lon-gitudinally towards a heated surface, and [D] pins moving transversely towards the heated surface. The Ap-propriate unsteady energy transport equations are solved and closed form {{solutions for the}} fin temperatures are obtained. Accordingly, different performance indicators are calculated. It is found that heat {{transfer to}} the swimming pin increases as the pin thermal length, Peclet number and fluid temperature difference along the pin length increase. It decreases as fluid temperature index along the motion direction increases. Moreover, the swimming pins of case C are found to <b>produce</b> the maximum <b>system</b> effective thermal conductivity. In addition, pins of case B with thermal lengths above 11 <b>produce</b> <b>system</b> thermal conductivity independent on the thermal length.

In the active phase (n = 17), serum immunoglobulin (Ig) M and E levels, B lymphocytes (surface Ig-positive cells) and their subsets, surface IgG, IgM and IgE positive cells; B gamma, B mu and B epsilon, were increased, whereas the serum IgG level and OKT 3 -reactive cells, peripheral T lymphocytes; T 3, were decreased. In the remitted phase maintained by steroid therapy (n = 17), serum Igs and B lymphocyte subsets tended to return to normal levels concomitant with decreases in T 3 and T 4, and an increase in T 8 in consequence of a marked decrease in T 4 /T 8 (helper/suppressor) ratio. In stable remission continuing with no steroid therapy (n = 14), the above abnormalities returned to normal ranges, except for serum IgM which remained at a high level and re-elevated serum IgE. These results suggest that immunological abnormalities in MCNS are characterized by acceleration of the IgE and IgM producing systems and impaired maturation of the IgG <b>producing</b> <b>system</b> despite normal differentiation from the IgM producing to IgG <b>producing</b> <b>system,</b> possibly caused by T lymphocyte dysfunction...|$|E
