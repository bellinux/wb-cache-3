2500|$|During the {{parliament}} Cokayne was accused {{by a group}} of four feoffees of violently seizing the manor of Baddesley Ensor in Warwickshire. The accusers included figures of the greatest importance in the realm: Lawrence Allerthorpe, a former Lord High Treasurer, William Gascoigne, the Chief Justice, Robert Waterton, one of a long-serving family of Lancastrian retainers who held the key manor and castle of Pontefract for the dynasty and had played a key part in Bolingbroke's return to England, and John West. They claimed that Cokayne had entered the manor with deux centz gentz arraiez a faire de guerre: 200 men dressed for warfare. The king ordered him to appear before his council at Westminster the following May. The Harthill family had held land at Baddesley Ensor since the late 13th century, when Richard de Hertewell, still a minor, is mentioned as an heir to Thomas de Edensor, the previous and eponymous lord of the manor. Sir Richard Harthill, Cokayne's maternal grandfather, made various settlements of land at the manor, some of them slightly mysterious, before his death. Secondary sources appear to minimise the issue. The History of Parliament avers that Sir John escaped punishment because of the [...] "proven validity of his claim to the property, which his mother had recently inherited," [...] while the Victoria County History maintains that he [...] "may merely have been too previous in his entry, as in 1417 Elizabeth, widow of Edmund Cokayn, daughter and heir of Richard de Herthill, released to John Cokayn, her son, all right in the manor." [...] The manor formed part of the patrimony of Elizabeth, Sir John Cokayne's mother, and was retained by her throughout her lifetime. She did not voluntarily release it to Sir John: 1417, when it was quitclaimed to her son with the rest of her estates, was the year after her death. It is unclear whether Sir John was acting in his own or his mother's interests, but <b>past</b> <b>behaviour</b> shows that he was not averse to using armed force to dispossess women. If he had a right to the property, it is unclear why he needed to use an armed force of 200 to occupy it. Clearly he did not prevail, even if he did avoid punishment, as the manor did not fall into his hands for more than decade.|$|E
2500|$|Seven years later, {{after months}} of {{bullying}} by Madison Drake (Seraphina Beh) and Alexandra D'Costa (Sydney Craven), Louise (now Tilly Keeper) is pushed onto lit candles by Alexandra at her school prom, causing her to suffer burns. She is taken to hospital and Lisa arrives. Sharon is furious with Lisa's absence and that Sonia contacted her. Lisa and Sharon argue over Phil being away in Italy and leaving Louise. Louise chooses Sharon to remain whilst she is given pain relief over Lisa and Sharon tells Lisa how Louise gained her injuries. Lisa insists on caring for Louise instead of Sharon. Lisa tells Sharon that Louise wanted to live with Phil when she got a new boyfriend, which she admits was a relief. She is furious that Sharon went to Italy with Phil and Louise {{was left in the}} care of her former sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell), who she never has met. Sharon gives Lisa the choice of being there or not for Louise and she opts to remain. Louise argues with Lisa over feeling abandoned and getting the blame, but opens up to Lisa, admitting she is scared. Lisa meets Louise's half-brother, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid) and Lisa criticises Ben's <b>past</b> <b>behaviour</b> towards Louise. Lisa apologises to Ben and they make amends as Phil turns up, who is unimpressed with Lisa's presence and Lisa, Sharon and Louise ask Phil to give Lisa a chance. Lisa apologises to Phil for the past mistakes regarding Louise and says that they both need to be there for her, but Phil physically throws Lisa out of the hospital, ordering her to stay away from Louise. Lisa stays with Louise at the hospital and Lisa stands up to Phil, telling him she is not going and Phil allows Lisa to visit Louise. Phil warns Lisa not to mess up. Lisa sees her therapist and lies that she has been doing fun things with Louise. Louise's best friend Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield) goes to see Louise, but Lisa says Louise has requested no visitors and Lisa tells Bex her plans for Louise if she was well. Louise is distressed when Lisa and Bex arrange for her boyfriend Travis Law-Hughes (Alex James-Phelps) to visit her. Lisa talks to herself as she watches Louise with Phil, Sharon and Bex. Lisa takes keys to Phil's house and lets herself in, talking to and smashing photos, but cuts herself on glass. Lisa arrives distressed in the café and Sonia consoles her. The doctor gives Lisa consent to take Louise outside and Lisa tells Louise she has been discharged. Lisa plans to take Louise, going to Liverpool Street station. Phil and Sharon find Louise's room empty and the doctor reassures them of Lisa and Louise's whereabouts, although they find Louise's belongings gone. Phil is angry as the doctor explains how Louise is at a crucial stage in her recovery and the police tell Phil and Sharon what they are doing. Phil and Sharon are told Lisa switched cabs and find Lisa's flat, which is empty. Louise wakes up and Lisa lies to her that she and Phil agreed for her to be away from the square while Phil and Sharon question Lisa's capabilities. The police, Phil and Sharon discuss Lisa being traced through her cash withdrawals in Castle Point and that she has a mental health team. [...] Louise is in agony without her medication and Lisa prevents Louise from using the phone by cutting the cord. Louise figures out Lisa is off her medication. Louise's phone dies as she tries to phone the police and Lisa prevents Louise from leaving, but when Lisa allows her to go, Louise chooses to stay with and comfort Lisa when she is distressed. Bex gives Phil and Sharon information on a hotel where Lisa and Louise are at and compared to Sharon, Phil shows a lack of regard to Lisa's mental health. Phil finds Louise and she wants him to leave. Phil gains entry to their room and Lisa hits Phil over the head with a phone. Phil shouts at a struggling Lisa as Louise deteriorates and Lisa and Louise go to hospital together.|$|E

Gurth at once accepted their submission, and hundreds returned to their homes. In other parts of Wales the feeling that resistance was vain rapidly extended. Their most fertile valleys had all been turned into deserts, and even on their own hills and among their own forests, where they had hitherto deemed themselves safe from attack, they were pursued and hunted down by the now lightly-armed Saxons.

6000|$|I am reminded, as I write, {{that the}} child is very inquiring as to the precise truth of stories. But indeed this is a very {{different}} matter, and one bound up with the subject of play, and the precise amount of playfulness, or playability, to be looked for in the world. Many such burning questions must arise in the course of nursery education. [...] Among the fauna of this planet, which already embraces the pretty soldier and the terrifying Irish beggarman, is, or is not, the child to expect a Bluebeard or a Cormoran? Is he, or is he not, to look out for magicians, kindly and potent? May he, or may he not, reasonably hope to be cast away upon a desert island, or turned to such diminutive proportions that he can live on equal terms with his lead soldiery, and go a cruise in his own toy schooner? Surely all these are practical questions to a neophyte entering upon life with a view to play. Precision upon such a point, the child can understand. But if you merely ask him of his <b>past</b> <b>behaviour,</b> as to who threw such a stone, for instance, or struck such and such a match; or whether he had looked into a parcel or gone by a forbidden path, - why, he can see no moment in the inquiry, and it is ten to one, he has already half forgotten and half bemused himself with subsequent imaginings.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Darcy's letter {{she was in}} a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her {{feelings}} towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own <b>past</b> <b>behaviour,</b> there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.|$|E

6000|$|These words {{seemed to}} justify the impulse of {{self-defence}} aroused on Isabel's part by her perceiving that her visitor's attitude was a critical one. Madame Merle, as we know, had been very discreet hitherto; she had never criticised; she had been markedly afraid of intermeddling. But apparently she had only reserved herself for this occasion, since she now had a dangerous quickness in her eye and an air of irritation which even her admirable ease {{was not able to}} transmute. She had suffered a disappointment which excited Isabel's surprise--our heroine having no knowledge of her zealous interest in Pansy's marriage; and she betrayed it in a manner which quickened Mrs. Osmond's alarm. More clearly than ever before Isabel heard a cold, mocking voice proceed from she knew not where, in the dim void that surrounded her, and declare that this bright, strong, definite, worldly woman, this incarnation of the practical, the personal, the immediate, was a powerful agent in her destiny. She was nearer to her than Isabel had yet discovered, and her nearness was not the charming accident she had so long supposed. The sense of accident indeed had died within her that day when she happened to be struck with {{the manner in which the}} wonderful lady and her own husband sat together in private. No definite suspicion had as yet taken its place; but it was enough to make her view this friend with a different eye, to have been led to reflect that there was more intention in her <b>past</b> <b>behaviour</b> than she had allowed for at the time. Ah yes, there had been intention, there had been intention, Isabel said to herself; and she seemed to wake from a long pernicious dream. What was it that brought home to her that Madame Merle's intention had not been good? Nothing but the mistrust which had lately taken body and which married itself now to the fruitful wonder produced by her visitor's challenge on behalf of poor Pansy. There was something in this challenge which had at the very outset excited an answering defiance; a nameless vitality which she could see to have been absent from her friend's professions of delicacy and caution. Madame Merle had been unwilling to interfere, certainly, but only so long as there was nothing to interfere with. It will perhaps seem to the reader that Isabel went fast in casting doubt, on mere suspicion, on a sincerity proved by several years of good offices. She moved quickly indeed, and with reason, for a strange truth was filtering into her soul. Madame Merle's interest was identical with Osmond's: that was enough. [...] "I think Pansy will tell you nothing that will make you more angry," [...] she said in answer to her companion's last remark.|$|E

The results suggest that engagement in heritage has decreased since 2007, but despite received wisdom, few demographic differences existed between the highly engaged and the non-engaged.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{compares the}} modifications {{induced by the}} heat-moisture treatment of native starch (HMT) and by the hot-air drying of corn on wet-milled starch granules. High temperatures applied during both corn drying and HMT reduced the swelling capacity of granules, increased the starch gelatinization temperatures and decreased their residual enthalpy. <b>Pasting</b> <b>behaviour</b> of pre-treated starch showed a decrease of peak and breakdown viscosity when corn drying and HMT temperatures increased. Microscopic analysis showed that after hydrothermal treatment, starch granules extracted from corn dried at lower temperature swell more significantly than those extracted from corn dried at higher temperature. All these changes suggest the occurring of structural modifications within starch granules during high-temperature pre-treatments. At similar temperatures and initial moisture contents, HMT affected the physicochemical and functional properties of cornstarch more dramatically than hot-air drying. Differences induced by these two treatments were attributed to the availability of water around granules during these two pre-treatment procedures. Peer reviewe...|$|R
