50|$|More {{challenging}} times {{lay ahead}} as Brunton performed {{a leading role}} in the prolonged <b>print</b> <b>union</b> conflict of The Times and Sunday Times during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Roy Thomson had previously purchased the titles from the Astor family in 1967 to form Times Newspapers Limited. After many years of disruption Thomson Management eventually took a particularly hard stance against the more militant elements of the <b>print</b> <b>unions,</b> which resulted in the closure of the loss making Times Newspapers from (1 December 1978 - 12 November 1979) however Times Newspapers continued to pay staff and company overheads during the closure.|$|R
50|$|Watson {{attended}} the state school in Oamaru, North Otago, New Zealand until {{ten years of}} age when he left to become a rail nipper. Then {{after a period of}} helping on the family farm, at thirteen years of age he was apprenticed as a compositor at The North Otago Times, a newspaper run by prominent reformist politician William Steward, with the public affairs exposure augmenting his minor formal schooling. Following the death of his mother and the loss of his job, he migrated to Sydney in 1886 at nineteen years of age. He worked for a month as a stablehand at Government House, then found employment as a compositor for a number of newspapers including The Daily Telegraph, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian Star. Through this proximity to newspapers, books and writers he furthered his education and developed an interest in politics and became active in the <b>printing</b> <b>union.</b> He married Ada Jane Low, a British-born Sydney seamstress, at the Unitarian Church on Liverpool Street in Sydney on 27 November 1889.|$|E
40|$|The {{significant}} {{role of the}} female printer in the American home-based print shops during the colonial and early republic periods has been documented in print history, socioeconomic, labor, and women studies, yet with the industrialization of the printing trade, women’s presence {{is thought to have}} disappeared. Contrary to the belief that industrialization of the print shop eradicated women’s involvement in skilled employments such as typesetting, the creation of the Women’s Cooperative <b>Printing</b> <b>Union</b> in California and the creation and chartering of the Women’s Typographical Union in New York, both in the late 1860 s, clearly indicate that women continued to work in printing. The assumption that industrialization brought with it the unionization of the trade denies the possibility of non-union shops, as well as the continuation of home-based businesses across the ever-expanding nation as it moved westward. This research has sought to uncover and restore to history women who {{have been involved in the}} trade from the early transition of the home shop at the beginning of the 1800 s to the signing of the WTU charter in 1869 by union employed compositors, as well as to identify establishments that hired female compositors. Digital newspaper databases have been used as a means of locating both women and opportunities available to them in the American printing trade between 1800 to 1869. Several women significant to this history, both those who have been found to be employed as compositors/typesetters and those who created opportunities for the employment of trained women compositors/typesetters, are discussed...|$|E

50|$|In 1986 and 1987, News Corp (through {{subsidiary}} News International) {{moved to}} adjust the production process of its British newspapers, over which the <b>printing</b> <b>unions</b> had long maintained a highly restrictive grip. A number of senior Australian media moguls were brought into Murdoch's powerhouse, including John Dux, who was {{managing director of the}} South China Morning Post. This led to a confrontation with the <b>printing</b> <b>unions</b> National Graphical Association and Society of Graphical and Allied Trades. The move of News International's London operation to Wapping in the East End resulted in nightly battles outside the new plant. Delivery vans and depots were frequently and violently attacked. Ultimately the unions capitulated.|$|R
