5000|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is recognized}} as {{a leading cause of}} new cases of blindness, and is associated with increased risk for painful neuropathy, heart disease and kidney failure. Many theories have been advanced to explain mechanisms leading to diabetic complications, including stimulation of glucose metabolism by the polyol pathway. Additionally, the enzyme is located in the eye (cornea, retina, lens), kidney, and the myelin sheath-tissues that are often involved in diabetic complications. [...] Under normal glycemic conditions, {{only a small fraction of}} glucose is metabolized through the polyol pathway, as the majority is phosphorylated by hexokinase, and the resulting product, glucose-6-phosphate, is utilized as a substrate for glycolysis or pentose phosphate metabolism. However, in response to the chronic hyperglycemia found in diabetics, glucose flux through the polyol pathway is significantly increased. Up to 33% of total glucose utilization in some tissues can be through the polyol pathway.Glucose concentrations are often elevated in diabetics and aldose reductase has long been believed to be responsible for diabetic complications involving a number of organs. Many aldose reductase inhibitors have been developed as drug candidates but virtually all have failed although some such as epalrestat are commercially available in several countries. Additional reductase inhibitors such as ranirestat, <b>ponalrestat,</b> rinalrestat, risarestat, sorbinil, and berberine are currently in clinical trials.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ponalrestat</b> (Statil, ICI; Prodiax, Merck Sharp and Dohme) is an aldose reductase {{inhibitor}} {{which is}} highly protein bound. <b>Ponalrestat</b> markedly displaced warfarin from its protein binding in vitro at {{a concentration of}} 500 micrograms ml- 1, but not at a concentration of 50 or 100 micrograms ml- 1. Twelve diabetic patients (six males), age range 38 - 65 years, in receipt of chronic stable warfarin therapy, were given <b>ponalrestat</b> (600 mg daily) for 2 weeks in an open trial. A matching placebo tablet was administered for 1 week {{before and after the}} active treatment period. Patients were seen ten times (four times during the <b>ponalrestat</b> phase), and during the <b>ponalrestat</b> phase, plasma samples were also taken before and at 3 h after the daily dose of <b>ponalrestat.</b> At none of the visits was there any significant change in prothrombin ratio (INR), plasma total or unbound warfarin concentrations, or percentage protein binding of warfarin. No clinical complications of combination treatment were detected. The maximum <b>ponalrestat</b> concentration observed in the patients was approximately 100 micrograms ml- 1. We conclude that no significant interaction between these drugs occurs at the doses of <b>ponalrestat</b> studied...|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that aldose reductase inhibition may prevent or delay the development of functional and structural neuropathy in the insulin-deficient diabetic Bio-Breeding rat (BB-rat), hyperglycemic rats were begun on the aldose reduc-tase inhibitor (ARI) <b>ponalrestat</b> 25 mg/kg body wt soon after the onset of diabetes and followed for 4 or 6 mo. <b>Ponalrestat</b> treatment completely prevented the characteristic nerve con-duction slowing and structural abnormalities of the node of Ranvier for 4 mo despite only partial preservation of axonal integrity. <b>Ponalrestat</b> treatment for 6 mo achieved a partial but significant prevention of nerve conduction slowing, axoglial dysjunction, and axonal degenerative changes. This incomplete but significant prevention of neuropathy by <b>ponalrestat</b> sug-gests that additional mechanisms besides polyol-pathway acti-vation may be of importance in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. Alternatively, the dosage {{used in the present}} study may not have been sufficient to achieve a complete prevention. Despite the only partial protective effect of ARI treatment on degenerative peripheral nerve changes in hyperglycemic BB-rats, 6 mo of treatment resulted in a more than threefold in-crease in regenerating nerve fibers. These data suggest that prophylactic ARI treatment may be efficacious in delaying the development of diabetic neuropathy. (J. Clin. Invest. 1990. 85 : 1410 - 1420.) diabetic neuropathy * prevention * polyol pathway- morphometry * electrophysiolog...|$|E
40|$|Rats with streptozotocin-induced {{diabetes}} have a decreased rate of {{sciatic nerve}} regeneration. We studied {{the effects on}} this defect of treatment with the aldose reductase inhibitor, <b>ponalrestat</b> (25 mg/kg per day via an endogastric tube). The nerves of diabetic rats were crush-injured at 5 weeks of diabetes and regeneration evaluated 7 days later with the pinch-reflex test. <b>Ponalrestat</b> treatment was started at day 3 after streptozotocin injection and was continued for the whole experimental period, i. e. until 6 weeks of diabetes. The treatment prevented effectively the accumulation of sorbitol and fructose in the nerves of diabetic rats, but was without effect on the sciatic nerve regeneration (controls 21. 8 ± 1. 2 mm/ 7 days (mean ± SEM, n = 6), untreated diabetics 15. 8 ± 1. 8 (n = 7), ponalrestat-treated diabetics 16. 2 ± 1. 0 (n = 10)). The results indicate {{that there is no}} connection between increased sorbitol pathway flux and impaired regeneration in streptozotocin diabetic rats...|$|E
40|$|Increased iris vessel {{permeability}} {{observed in}} diabetics {{has also been}} reported to occur in diabetic animals and galactose-fed rats. The potential role of aldose reductase in the induction of iris vessel-changes has been investigated in rats fed a 50 % galactose diet with/without the aldose reductase inhibitors AL 1576, sorbinil or <b>ponalrestat</b> for 7 to 18 months. Compared to normal control rats, long-term galactose-fed rats display {{a breakdown of the}} blood-aqueous barrier due to iris vessel changes that include focal straightening, dilation, constriction, increased permeability, ischemia and new vessel proliferation. The onset and progression of these iridal vessel changes were prevented by the aldose reductase inhibitors AL 1576 and sorbinil, and reduced by <b>Ponalrestat.</b> Computerized analyses of lumen areas of iris vessels indicated an 18 -fold decrease in the vascular area near the pupillary boarder in untreated galactose-fed rats compared with age- matched controls and galactose-fed rats treated with aldose reductase inhibitors. These observations linking iris vessel changes with galactose- feeding, coupled with the fact that aldose reductase inhibitors also prevent these changes, strongly suggest a link between the sorbitol pathway and the appearance and progression of iris vessel changes.

40|$|The polyol pathway {{has long}} been {{associated}} with diabetic retinopathy. Glucose is converted to sorbitol {{with the aid of}} the enzyme aldose reductase. Aldose reductase inhibitors can prevent changes induced by diabetes. A total of 30 patients with minimal background retinopathy were randomly divided into a ponalrestat-taking group and a placebo-taking group. All were followed for 6 months and twenty-three were followed for 12 months. The baseline microaneurysm count was 2. 6 +/- 1. 9 (mean +/- SD) for the <b>ponalrestat</b> group and 3. 5 +/- 2. 9 for the placebo group. At 6 months the counts were 3. 1 +/- 3. 5 and 2. 9 +/- 3. 6 and after 12 months 3. 0 +/- 4. 1 and 2. 9 +/- 3. 4. There is no statistically significant difference between the groups at 0, 6 or 12 months of study. The change in retinopathy severity level did not significantly differ between the two groups at either 6 or 12 months. <b>Ponalrestat</b> administration at a dosage of 600 mg daily for 12 months has no significant effect on the course of minimal retinopathy in diabetic patients...|$|E
40|$|PGF 2 α may be {{involved}} in the regulation of adipose tissue function. 1) To examine PGF 2 α release by primary preadipocytes, mature adipocytes and whole tissue explants from the subcutaneous and omental fat compartments; 2) To assess which PGF synthase is the most relevant in human adipose tissue. Fat samples were obtained by surgery in women. PGF 2 α release by preadipocytes, adipocytes and explants under stimulation by TNF-α, IL- 1 β or both was measured. Messenger RNA expression levels of AKR 1 B 1 and AKR 1 C 3 were measured by RT-PCR in whole adipose tissue and cytokine-treated preadipocytes. The effect of AKR 1 B 1 inhibitor <b>ponalrestat</b> on PGF 2 α synthesis was investigated. PGF 2 α release was significantly induced in response to cytokines compared to control in omental (p =  0. 01) {{and to a lesser extent}} in subcutaneous preadipocytes (p =  0. 02). Messenger RNA of COX- 2 was significantly higher in omental compared to subcutaneous preadipocytes in response to combined TNF-α and IL- 1 β (p =  0. 01). Inflammatory cytokines increased AKR 1 B 1 mRNA expression and protein levels (p≤ 0. 05), but failed to increase expression levels of AKR 1 C 3 in cultured preadipocytes. Accordingly, <b>ponalrestat</b> blunted PGF 2 α synthesis by preadipocytes in basal and stimulated conditions (p≤ 0. 05). Women with the highest PGF 2 α release by omental adipocytes had a higher BMI (p =  0. 05), waist circumference (p≤ 0. 05) and HOMAir index (p≤ 0. 005) as well as higher mRNA expression of AKR 1 B 1 in omental (p< 0. 10) and subcutaneous (p≤ 0. 05) adipose tissue compared to women with low omental adipocytes PGF 2 α release. Positive correlations were observed between mRNA expression of AKR 1 B 1 in both compartments and BMI, waist circumference as well as HOMAir index (p≤ 0. 05 for all). PGF 2 α release by omental mature adipocytes is increased in abdominally obese women. Moreover, COX- 2 expression and PGF 2 α release is particularly responsive to inflammatory stimulation in omental preadipocytes. Yet, blockade of PGF synthase AKR 1 B 1 inhibits most of the PGF 2 α release...|$|E
40|$|A polyol-pathway-related {{mechanism}} {{has been}} invoked in {{the pathogenesis of}} murine and human diabetic peripheral neuropathy in which progressive axonal atrophy and axo-glial dysjunction constitute the cardinal structural abnormalities. We have previously reported similar neuroanatomical changes in the optic nerve of 6 -month diabetic BB/W-rats. In the present study we demonstrate progression of axonal atrophy and axo-glial dysjunction in the optic nerve in 12 -month diabetic BB/W-rats. These structural lesions showed highly significant correlations with the associated prolongation of the latencies of the visual evoked potentials, suggesting that axo-glial dysjunction and axonal atrophy are major determinants for impaired optic nerve function. As in peripheral nerve, the polyol-pathway {{is present in the}} optic nerve and is activated by hyperglycaemia and galactosaemia. In this study we further examined the treatment effect of the aldose reductase inhibitor <b>ponalrestat,</b> given from 3 weeks of diabetes and continued throughout the study protocol. This regimen resulted in complete prevention of axo-glial dysjunction, and had a significant ameliorating effect on visual evoked potential latencies, but had no effect on optic nerve axonal atrophy. This latter finding differs from the effect of aldose reductase inhibition on diabetic peripheral nerve and suggests that axonal atrophy of central nerve tracts in diabetes may be the consequence of other metabolic abnormalities or alternatively the present regimen was insufficient to protect central axons from the effects of an increased activity of the polyol pathway...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To update readers on {{research}} being {{conducted with the}} aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) tolrestat in treating complications of diabetes mellitus. The article briefly describes early investigations with other ARIs and reviews the more recent studies of tolrestat. In addition, the article gives readers a simplified overview of the biochemical background pertinent {{to the use of}} these agents. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was performed to identify articles relating to the clinical use of, and research involving, the following ARIs: sorbinil, airestatin, ponairestat, and tolrestat. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers were contacted in an attempt to obtain data relating to ongoing investigations. STUDY SELECTION: Review articles and clinical trials of sorbinil, airestatin, and <b>ponalrestat</b> were included. Articles dealing with clinical trials of tolrestat were selected from the MEDLINE search. As {{there were only a few}} trials, all studies identified were included. No additional written data were available from the manufacturers. DATA SYNTHESIS: ARIs, which when first introduced were proclaimed to be major advances in treating diabetic complications, have never produced the expected results. Problems with efficacy and toxicity relegated most of this class of agents to historical interest. One compound, tolrestat, has continued to be tested and has potential clinical application. To date, the extent of benefit that has been realized in tolrestat-treated patients is small to moderate. Improvements have occurred in paresthesia and neuropathy, but unfortunately, not in pain symptoms. Adverse effects have been minor and are primarily confmed to elevations of hepatic alanine aminotransferase. Additional clinical trials are being conducted with this agent. CONCLUSIONS: Tolrestat is the only one of the original ARIs still undergoing clinical trials. Results so far have been encouraging, but by no means defmitive, for improvement in some aspects of diabetic neuropathy. Information from ongoing investigations is necessary before the true usefulness of tolrestat therapy can be determined...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandins are {{important}} regulators of female reproductive functions to which aldose reductases exhibiting hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity also contribute. Our {{work on the}} regulation of reproductive function by prostaglandins (PGs), lead us to the discovery that AKR 1 B 5 and later AKR 1 B 1 were highly efficient and physiologically relevant PGF synthases. PGE 2 and PGF 2 α are the main prostanoids produced in the human endometrium and proper balance in their relative production is important for normal menstruation and optimal fertility. Recent evidence suggests that PGE 2 /EP 2 and PGF 2 α/FP may constitute a functional dyad with physiological relevance comparable to the prostacyclin-thromboxane dyad in the vascular system. We have recently reported that AKR 1 B 1 was expressed and modulated in association with PGF 2 α production in response to IL- 1 β in the human endometrium. In the present study, we show that the human AKR 1 B 1 (gene ID: 231) also known as ALDR 1 or ALR 2 is a functional PGF 2 α synthase in different models of living cells and tissues. Using human endometrial cells, prostate, and vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells we demonstrate that IL- 1 β is able to up regulate COX- 2 and AKR 1 B 1 proteins as well as PGF 2 α production under normal glucose concentrations. We show that the promoter activity of AKR 1 B 1 gene is increased by IL- 1 β particularly around the multiple stress response region containing two putative antioxidant response elements adjacent to TonE and AP 1. We also show that AKR 1 B 1 is able to regulate PGE 2 production through PGF 2 α acting on its FP receptor and that aldose reductase inhibitors like alrestatin, Statil (<b>ponalrestat),</b> and EBPC exhibit distinct and characteristic inhibition of PGF 2 α production in different cell models. The PGF synthase activity of AKR 1 B 1 represents a new and important target to regulate ischemic and inflammatory responses associated with several human pathologies...|$|E
