5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E

25|$|In Holt v. City of Maumelle, 817 S.W.2d 208 (AR., 1991), Mr. Steele Holt {{sued the}} city of Maumelle, Arkansas in 1988 {{in an attempt to}} have its {{prohibition}} against pit bulls overturned {{on the grounds that the}} ordinance was impermissibly vague, that it was unreasonable to ban pit bull-type dogs, and that the city's Board of Directors committed a breach of contract by passing a pit bull ordinance that it had previously agreed to forego; Mr. Holt also asked that the city pay compensatory damages, punitive damages, and his attorney's fees. The Pulaski County circuit court made a summary judgment dismissing the suit, and Mr. Holt appealed. In 1991, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's decision, finding that the pit bull ordinance was not impermissibly vague, that the restrictions were reasonable, and that any agreement made by the city to limit its own legislative powers was null and void since the city's first duty was to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> interest.|$|E

As Higgins had noted, the High Court will not answer a constitutional question unless it is necessary. The State of Victoria had intervened in the case to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> of that State from the operation of what it said was an invalid federal law. The argument was that the common rule provisions were invalid and could not be severed from the balance of the Act, such that the entire Act was invalid.|$|E
