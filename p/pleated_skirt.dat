2500|$|In this period, children's wear {{followed}} trends {{found in}} adult fashion. [...] Wool and cashmere were popular textiles for baby cloaks while cotton was still widely accepted for toddler dresses, drawers and play wear. [...] A popular silhouette for toddlers was a cotton bodice, <b>pleated</b> <b>skirt</b> and long sleeves. [...] Small boys (ages 3 through 6) commonly wore a Tunic suit.. [...] The jackets were fitted {{to the waist}} and then flared out to a full skirt ending at knee length. [...] This was worn over trousers, or for very small boys with drawers. A round-collared shirt was usually worn underneath the jacket. [...] Elementary to older age boys wore an Eton suit, which was a short, waist-level jacket, trousers, round-collared shirts, vest and sometimes neckties. In 1840 flat caps were popularly worn for boys. [...] Small girls wore cotton drawers, cotton chemise, petticoats and stockings. [...] As girls got older in age they followed the trend of their mothers and began to wear stays or tight corsets. [...] "Barely" [...] or [...] "sugar" [...] curls became a popular hairstyle for both girls and boys: they were long, droopy curls that framed the face.|$|E

2500|$|Women's fashion {{during the}} Empire {{was set to}} a large degree by the Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais and her {{favorite}} designer, Hippolyte Leroy, who was inspired by the Roman statues of the Louvre and the frescoes of Pompeii. Fashions were also guided by a new magazine, the Journal des Dames et des Modes, with illustrations by the leading artists of the day. The antique Roman style, introduced during the Revolution, continued to be popular but was modified because Napoleon disliked immodesty in women's clothing; low necklines and bare arms were banned. The waist of the Empire gowns was very high, almost under the arms, with a long <b>pleated</b> <b>skirt</b> down to the feet. Corsets were abandoned, and the preferred fabric was mousseline. The main fashion accessory for women was the shawl, inspired by the Orient, made of cashmere or silk, covering the arms and shoulders. Napoleon's military campaigns also influenced fashion; after the Egyptian campaign, women began to wear turbans; after the Spanish campaign, tunics with high shoulders; and after the campaigns in Prussia and Poland, Polish furs and a long coat called a pelisse. They also wore jackets inspired by military uniforms, with epaulettes. In cold weather women wore a redingote, from the English word [...] "riding coat", borrowed from men's fashion, or, after 1808, a witchoura, a fur coat with a hood.|$|E
