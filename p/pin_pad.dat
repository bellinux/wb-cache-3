5000|$|A <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> or PIN {{entry device}} is an {{electronic}} device {{used in a}} debit, credit or smart card-based transaction to accept and encrypt the cardholder's personal identification number (PIN). PIN pads are normally used with automated teller machines and integrated point of sale devices in which an electronic cash register is responsible for taking the sale amount and initiating/handling the transaction. The <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> is required so that the customer card can be accessed (in the case of chip cards) and the PIN can be securely entered and encrypted before it {{is sent to the}} transaction manager of the switch or the bank. In some cases, with chip cards, the PIN is only transferred from the <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> to the chip (within the <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> itself) and it is verified by the chip card. In this case the PIN {{does not need to be}} sent to the bank or card scheme for verification. (This is known as [...] "offline PIN verification".) ...|$|E
50|$|In 2010 Verifone {{announced}} the VX Evolution product line, designed to PCI PED 2.0 specs and providing native support for VeriShield Total Protect, Verifone's encryption and tokenization solution. The VX Evolution line {{is an extension}} of Verifone's countertop and <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> products and included a number of upgrades from earlier models, such as full color display, ARM 11 processors and a fully programmable <b>PIN</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although <b>PIN</b> <b>pads</b> {{nominally}} allow {{entry of}} numeric values, some <b>PIN</b> <b>pads</b> also have letters assigned {{to most of}} the digits, to allow use of alphabetic characters or a words as a mnemonic for the numeric PIN. Not all <b>PIN</b> <b>pads</b> necessarily have the same letters for the same numbers. ISO 9564 does not mandate any particular assignment of letters, and includes two examples that differ in the digits to which Q and Z are assigned.|$|R

50|$|Financial {{institutions}} {{have become the}} target of keyloggers, particularly those institutions which do not use advanced security features such as <b>PIN</b> <b>pads</b> or screen keyboards. Anti-keyloggers are used to run regular scans of any computer on which banking or client information is accessed, protecting passwords, banking information, and credit card numbers from identity thieves.|$|R
50|$|<b>PIN</b> <b>pads</b> must be {{approved}} to the standards required by the payment card industry {{to ensure that they}} provide adequate security at the point of PIN entry and for the PIN encryption process. ISO 9564 is the international standard for PIN management and security, and specifies some required and recommended characteristics of PIN entry devices.|$|R
50|$|The Master/Session {{technique}} {{was created in}} the days before asymmetric techniques, such as Diffie-Hellman, were invented. This technique still finds widespread use in the financial industry, and is routinely used between corporate parties such as issuers, acquirers, switches. Its use in device communications (such as <b>PIN</b> <b>pads),</b> however, is in decline given the advantages of techniques such as DUKPT.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary source}} of funding is from in-store <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> {{donations}} when customers check out, as well as PetSmart employee contributions through the PetSmart Associates United to Stop Euthanasia (P.A.U.S.E.) fundraising program.|$|E
50|$|A card terminal, {{also called}} EFT-POS terminal, {{consists}} of {{hardware and software}} components. The main hardware components are the security module, the <b>PIN</b> <b>pad,</b> the printer, the display, the magnetic card reader, the chip-card reader, the communication module and the power supply.|$|E
50|$|The ticket vending {{machines}} have a touchscreen display for passengers {{to choose the}} appropriate fare and payment method, and upon payment the machine dispenses a validated ticket for the passenger. Passengers paying using a debit or credit card interact with the <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> located towards the centre to process payment.|$|E
50|$|Contactless {{smart card}} readers use radio waves to {{communicate}} with, and both {{read and write}} data on a smart card. When used for electronic payment, they are commonly located near <b>PIN</b> <b>pads,</b> cash registers and other places of payment. When the readers are used for public transit they are commonly located on fare boxes, ticket machines, turnstiles, and station platforms as a standalone unit. When used for security, readers are usually located {{to the side of}} an entry door.|$|R
50|$|The company’s {{countertop}} solutions accept various card payment options, including payment options using Near {{field communication}} (NFC) technology, mobile wallets, chip and PIN, QR code and contact-less payments. Its VX Evolution generation of countertop devices supports {{a range of}} applications, such as pre-paid products, including gift cards and loyalty programs. The VX Evolution devices also integrate the company’s NFC software technology to manage multiple NFC-based mobile wallets, applications, and programs. It also offers various other VX model countertop devices, including a hybrid device that reads both magnetic strip and chip card transactions using a single card reader, offering options {{for a range of}} connectivity choices, and battery operated and color displays. The company also supplies <b>PIN</b> <b>pads</b> that support credit and debit card, EBT, EMV, and other PIN-based transactions, and include multiple connectivity options, including a 3G option and NFC capability. Its countertop solutions also support a range of applications that are either built into electronic payment systems or connect to electronic cash registers (ECRs) and POS systems. In addition, it offers a range of certified software applications and application libraries that enable its countertop systems and <b>PIN</b> <b>pads</b> to interface with major ECR and POS systems.|$|R
40|$|A NiFe wire of 1 μm width {{with hard}} {{magnetic}} CoSm <b>pinning</b> <b>pads</b> and Cu electrodes was prepared by electron-beam lithography and lift-off technique. Using the exchange {{interaction between the}} NiFe wire and CoSm pads, magnetic structures with and without magentic domain walls were realizecd at zero external field. The electric resistance of the wall state was smaller {{than that of the}} no-wall state. The difference of the resistance {{can be explained by the}} anisotropic magnetoresistance effect in the domain walls...|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} the Avantix B8070 over the Ascom B8050 was the ability to handle credit-card payments. Initially this was by reading the magnetic stripe of the credit-card, but this was updated to handle Chip and PIN cards {{with the addition of}} a Hypercom Chip and Pin card reader and <b>pin</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E
50|$|An Encrypting <b>PIN</b> <b>Pad</b> is an {{apparatus}} for encrypting an identifier {{such as a}} PIN entered on a keypad. These are used in Automated teller machines {{to ensure that the}} unencrypted PIN is not stored or transmitted anywhere {{in the rest of the}} system and thus cannot be revealed accidentally or through manipulations of the system.|$|E
50|$|End-to-end {{encryption}} as {{the name}} suggests has the advantage over P2PE that card details are not unencrypted between the two endpoints. If the endpoints are a PCI PED validated <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> and a POS acquirer, there is no opportunity for the card details to be intercepted. It is obviously important that the endpoints (the PED and gateway) are provided by PCI accredited organisations.|$|E
40|$|Communication {{components}} (address, instruction, {{and data}} buses and associated hardware like I/O <b>pins,</b> <b>pads,</b> and buffers) are contributing increasingly to the area/cost and power consumption of microprocessor systems. To decrease costs due to address buses, we propose to use narrow widths for underutilized buses (hardware-only compression) to transmit information in multiple cycles. We analyze performance and power consumption overheads of hardware-only compression and investigate {{the use of}} “address concatenation ” to mitigate performance loss and address offsets and XORs to reduce power consumption overheads. ...|$|R
25|$|Initially PCBs were {{designed}} manually {{by creating a}} photomask on a clear mylar sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component <b>pin</b> <b>pads</b> were {{laid out on the}} mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on dry transfers of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. To fabricate the board, the finished photomask was photolithographically reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.|$|R
50|$|A filter graph in {{multimedia}} processing is a directed graph. Edges represent one-way {{data flow}} and nodes represent a data-processing step. <b>Pins</b> or <b>pads</b> identify the connection points between nodes and edges.|$|R
50|$|The Toughpad FZ-R1 is the industry's first 7-inch {{all-in-one}} mobile point-of-sale tablet running Windows 8.1 for retail environments. Powered by an Intel Celeron processor, {{the tablet}} offers a fast-charging, user-replaceable full-shift battery with optional bridge battery and high-capacity battery, ten-point capacitive multi-touch screen, integrated EMV reader with <b>PIN</b> <b>pad,</b> encrypted magnetic stripe reader, optional POS cradle, {{and a wide}} range of configuration options.|$|E
5000|$|Retailers {{that have}} {{customers}} paying by card can easily implement Pennies on their payment system. Those with electronic stock control software set up Pennies as a stock-keeping unit. Sales staff {{are not involved}} in donations; when the customer is ready to pay for goods or services, the <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> prompts the customer with the option to round up or top up their purchase and add a donation to the payment.|$|E
5000|$|Mattes {{has served}} as the {{president}} and chief executive of Diebold since 2013. He succeeded Thomas W. Swidarski. His initial goal was to reduce costs. In 2014, he oversaw the acquisition of Cryptera, a Danish <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> company. A year later, in 2015, he oversaw the merger of Wincor Nixdorf, a German company, with Diebold. He described the merger as [...] " [...] adding $2.5 billion in revenues, 9,000 employees" [...] and expanding their marketshare in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Banking {{agents are}} usually {{equipped}} {{with a combination of}} point-of-sale (POS) card reader, mobile phone, barcode scanner to scan bills for bill payment transactions, personal identification number (<b>PIN)</b> <b>pads,</b> and sometimes personal computers (PCs) that connect with the bank’s server using a personal dial-up or other data connection. Clients that transact at the agent use a magstripe bank card or their mobile phone to access their bank account or e-wallet respectively. Identification of customers is normally done through a PIN, but could also involve biometrics. With regard to the transaction verification, authorization, and settlement platform, banking agents are similar to any other remote bank channel.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of a magnetic domain wall to electric resistivity {{was measured using}} NiFe wires (width: 1 μm) partially covered with hard magnetic pads (CoSm). When the wire is covered with N <b>pinning</b> <b>pads,</b> 2 N domain walls can be produced in the wire by reversing the magnetization only at the uncovered parts. The resistance for the magnetically saturated state (no domain wall structure) and that for the magnetic structure with 2 N domain walls were compared at zero applied field. It {{was found that the}} resistance is smaller when magnetic domain walls exist, and that the domain wall resistance is almost temperature independent...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of payment card Chip and PIN, however, cloning of the chip is not feasible; only the magnetic stripe can be copied, and a copied card cannot be used by itself on a terminal requiring a PIN. The introduction of Chip and PIN coincided with wireless data transmission technology becoming inexpensive and widespread. In addition to mobile-phone-based magnetic readers like those from Square, merchant personnel can now bring wireless <b>PIN</b> <b>pads</b> to the customer, so the card is never out of the cardholder's sight. Thus, both chip-and-PIN and wireless technologies {{can be used to}} reduce the risks of unauthorized swiping and card cloning.|$|R
50|$|Internet {{purchases}} can be authenticated by {{the consumer}} entering their PIN if the merchant has enabled a secure online <b>PIN</b> <b>pad,</b> {{in which case the}} transaction is conducted in debit mode. Otherwise, transactions may be conducted in either credit or debit mode (which is sometimes, but not always, indicated on the receipt), and {{this has nothing to do}} with whether the transaction was conducted in online or offline mode, since both credit and debit transactions may be conducted in both modes.|$|E
50|$|Like some {{stand-alone}} {{point of}} sale devices, PIN pads are equipped with hardware and software security features {{to ensure that the}} encryption keys and the PIN are erased if someone tries to tamper with the device. The PIN is encrypted immediately on entry and an encrypted PIN block is created. This encrypted PIN block is erased as soon as it has been sent from the <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> to the attached {{point of sale}} device and/or the chip card. PINs are encrypted using a variety of encryption schemes, the most common being triple DES.|$|E
5000|$|Diebold {{announced}} that it was buying the Danish <b>PIN</b> <b>pad</b> maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an [...] "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers." [...] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims [...] "prevents all known forms of skimming crime." [...] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before. Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion. As of 2014, Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.|$|E
50|$|The free version (for {{non-commercial}} use) {{is limited}} to 250 connection <b>pins</b> or <b>pads</b> on two copper layers. The PCB manufacturer PCB-Pool and Conrad Electronic provide a free unlimited version, that generates only printed output or output for PCB-Pool and Conrad's PCB service. Commercial versions with all features are available.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} {{evaluate}} the relationship between bank efficiency and electronic payment systems in Iran. In this study we used the GMDH-neural network method as an instrument for complicated non- linear trends especially with the limited observations. We employed the model {{in a bid to}} delineate relationship between bank efficiency which was proxied by output of banks (net profit-average of inter-banks transactions ratio) and electronic payment system including Automated Teller Machines (ATM) - POS Terminals - Branch <b>PIN</b> <b>Pads</b> and we present two models for each type of banks ownership and a model for all banks in Iran and compare them. The results show that {{despite the fact that the}} payment systems are an easy access for everybody, they don’t have the same effects and some of them have double effects on bank efficiency in different situations...|$|R
40|$|E-banking {{has been}} {{extensively}} developed in recent decades and most banks need to have such services in their daily activities. Therefore, {{it is necessary that}} banks do a better management on banks’ liquidity risks. Electronic banking and the expansion of its scale from POSs and ATMs to telephone banking, mobile banking and internet banking have increased banking transactions, significantly. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the relationship between the development of e-banking and liquidity management using liquidity ratios. The focus of this investigation has been on the amounts of transaction of ATM machines, POSs and <b>PIN</b> <b>PADs</b> as the most important means of electronic banking. In this respect, the data obtained from 14 private and public bank representatives of banking system over the period 2007 - 2012 are considered. Our survey indicates that the characteristics of electronic banking significantly influence on liquidity...|$|R
