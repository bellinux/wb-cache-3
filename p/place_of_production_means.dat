30|$|In the agro-food sector, the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is {{connected}} to important quality features (also see previous section). Thus, sharing the same <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> may imply sharing quality and reputation. This link between the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and product reputation is twofold. In fact, the produce is reputed after the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> origin in case the last is already renowned {{for the quality of}} its products. However, also the reverse holds: some places gain status after the increased fame of their products. In this sense, sharing the same location calls for location economies and reputational linkages and is a source for the need of collective action.|$|R

40|$|Lenin is {{an author}} of a new {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> contradictions between <b>production</b> and consumption in the capitalist economy. He claims that, these contraditions spring from the law of faster growth <b>of</b> output <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>means.</b> This law is educed from Marx's reproduction schemes. Thus indirectly also the contradiction be tween production and consumption ensues from reproduction schemes. Accordingly it cannot consist in inability to implement the gross product. The essence of this contradiction {{lies in the fact that}} in the capitalism, production is mainly developed in the sphere <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>means,</b> it becomes an objective in itself, and cea ses to serve its natural objective - i. e. consumption. Parallelly there appears in Lenin's works a traditional interpretation of the discus sed contradiction in line with the subconsumption theory. Similar views are represented by a legal Marxist — Tuhan-Baranowski. Polemics between Lenin and Tuhan-Baranowski appear to have often resulted from misunderstanding.

40|$|Is back to Vygotsky enough? Vygotskys {{psychology}} has {{its roots}} in Marxs writings. Thus, Marxism is indispensable to the study of Vygotskys theory. That is why, we assert in this paper that, back to Vygotsky is back to Marx and Marxism. Furthermore any attempt to modify Vygotskys uses of Marxism with some extraneous element is not only objectively anti-Vygotsky but also distortion of his theory. Vygotsky brought into prominence the dialectic movement of social totalities, within which a complex interaction takes <b>place</b> between forces <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> social relations <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> mode production, consciousness, alienation, and activity. In these complex interactions that human mental life is formed and shaped. Aware of these pitfalls, Vygotsky did not try to build a Marxist psychology that lies {{on the side of the}} economic determinism theory. Vygotskys efforts were directed, instead, to locating psychological aspects in Marxs writings and making one of these aspects a new point of departure for examining the same totality with which Marx was concerned...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} proportions in social reproduction is that ratio between <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and <b>of</b> consumer goods under which high rates <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are combined with the fuller satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the population. Inasmuch as this relationship must be dynamically planned, its planning {{comes down to the}} establishment of the rates of growth of both subdivisions <b>of</b> social <b>production</b> and, consequently, <b>of</b> the ratio between these rates <b>of</b> growth. Moreover, <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and <b>of</b> consumer goods must be considered on a national economic scale.
