It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush revegetation and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a rootstock in the cut flower trade, but has also caused concerns about its <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a weed outside its natural habitat.|$|E

Turtle Rock and 2K collaborated with Electronic Sports League and Sony Pictures Entertainment to host a special tournament, in which players have to battle Chappie, the titular robot from the film Chappie, in February 2015. A Pro-Am Tournament of Evolve took place on March 6, 2015 during PAX East. During the tournament, they revealed that the eSport future of Evolve is determined. On June 15, 2015, another tournament was hosted by the Electronic Sports League and 2K.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the series}} had premiered, some media critics {{stated that the}} series had <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a ratings hit and {{possibly}} raise NBC from being the fourth highest-rated network out of five. Greenblatt has also stated that he has high hopes for the series. In {{order to make it}} more likely the series will be a success, NBC picked the series up for 15 episodes and opted to hold the show for mid-season in order to pair it up with the hit reality show The Voice on Monday nights. Despite this, other media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, it will be considered a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; Fear Factor and The Office. The series has also been put on Monday nights against CBS, with Monday featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season. Also, musical shows have a known record for failures, like Cop Rock.|$|E
5|$|On November 25, 2013, Moss {{signed for}} the Island Storm. He {{recorded}} a career-high 33 points versus the Halifax Rainmen on December 8. On March 24 he recorded a triple-double, with 17 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds in his team's playoff win against the Halifax Rainmen. In November 2014 Moss signed for the London Lightning {{for a second}} time in his career. In February 2015 he was signed by the Windsor Express, and was released by the Express on March 26, 2015. Moss appeared in an exhibition match of Windsor against Raptors 905 on November 12, 2015, and was named man of the match after scoring 38 points. He was re-signed by the Express a couple of days later. Windsor's coach Tony Jones commented on his signing, that Moss had the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> the team's starting point guard. He recorded 19 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists on January 1, 2016, against the Orangeville A's. On February 6, 2016, Moss was released by the Express after the team signed Eric Frederick.|$|E
5|$|As a teenager, {{he began}} to work for Los Tejas, a gang that ran the {{criminal}} activities {{in his hometown of}} Nuevo Laredo. From washing cars, running errands, and stealing car parts in Nuevo Laredo, Treviño Morales turned to the drug trade, starting with small-scale drug retail sales and smuggling. Unlike the first members of Los Zetas, he was never in the military. He was hired by them and the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s for his experience moving contraband across the border. His fluent English and his criminal contacts {{on both sides of the}} U.S.-Mexico border allowed him to gain the trust of the then-leader of the Gulf Cartel, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. When he joined the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, Los Tejas, the local gang he once worked for, was absorbed by the former groups. Around 2005, Treviño Morales became the regional boss of Nuevo Laredo; he was in charge of fighting off the incursions of the Sinaloa Cartel, which was attempting to take control of the smuggling routes in the area. The Laredo–Nuevo Laredo area is a lucrative smuggling route for narcotics because of the Interstate 35 highway, which serves as a strategic pathway to San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas for future drug distribution. While in power, he orchestrated a number of assassinations in American cities and in Mexico by young U.S. citizens whom he put on his payroll. Treviño Morales was good at identifying and grooming young teenagers who he believed had the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> professional assassins for Los Zetas. These recruits, sometimes called Zetitas ("Little Zetas"), usually joined organized crime as young as twelve-years old to work first as smugglers and later as paid assassins.|$|E

25|$|Fechner, {{along with}} Wilhelm Wundt and Hermann von Helmholtz, is {{recognized}} as one of the founders of modern experimental psychology. His clearest contribution was the demonstration that because the mind was susceptible to measurement and mathematical treatment, psychology had the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a quantified science. Theorists such as Immanuel Kant had long stated that this was impossible, and that therefore, a science of psychology was also impossible.|$|E

Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and further limits its <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a different cell type.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit {{the capabilities of}} the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> Siddha (God in Jainism). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.|$|E

30|$|According to the findings, it {{is clear}} that {{international}} students who are exposed to entrepreneurship education either formally or informally have huge <b>potentials</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> entrepreneurs in the future. This finding is relevant to the study conducted by Noorkatina et al. (2015) who reveal that university students have strong willingness to start their business in nature. However, due to the lack earlier focus toward entrepreneurial activity, most all of university students performed the negative relationships. It denotes that most of the students have passionately focused on finishing their formal education besides starting to build a business creation. This finding shows that in the current time, students put education as the priority before deciding to run their prospective business. This circumstance even seems to the finding in this paper, in which international students in Turkey incline to be focus to start their business after completing their formal education in university.|$|R
