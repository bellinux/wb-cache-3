The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent</b> to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 dinars, {{much lower than the}} rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner. To keep the execution of the agreement under surveillance, the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna.

5|$|While Governor Pataki {{supported}} this revised, $1.5 billion people mover plan, Mayor Rudy Giuliani voiced his opposition {{over the fact}} that it was not a direct rail link from Manhattan, and thus would not be profitable because of the need to transfer from Jamaica. Additionally, Giuliani did not like that the city had to effectively pay $300 million toward the new light rail system. The Port Authority was originally planning to pay for only $1.2 billion of the project, with the other $300 million to be used to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent</b> at the airport instead. In order to give his agreement, Giuliani wanted the Port Authority to study the possibility of extending the Astoria elevated to LaGuardia Airport, as well as make the light-rail system compatible with the subway or LIRR to allow possible future interoperability. In late 1997, Giuliani agreed to the plan under the condition that the state reimburse the city $300 million of the system's cost, with the city paying the $300 million for the line from 2002 through 2017. As part of the agreement, the state would also conduct a study on a similar train link to LaGuardia Airport.|$|E

5|$|Bristol Rovers Football Club is an English {{professional}} association football club based in Bristol, who play in Football League One, the Third tier of the English football league system, {{as of the}} 2016–17 season. The club was formed in 1883 under the name Black Arabs F.C. playing their home games at Purdown in Bristol, but they used the name for only a single season, becoming Eastville Rovers and moving to a site known as Three Acres in 1884. Eastville Rovers were somewhat nomadic, moving home in 1891 to the Schoolmaster's Cricket Ground, in 1892 to Durdham Down, and in 1894 to Ridgeway, before finally settling at Eastville Stadium and changing their name to Bristol Eastville Rovers in 1897. Two years later they adopted their current name of Bristol Rovers when they became founder members of the Southern League. They remained at Eastville Stadium for 99 years, before leaving in 1986 when financial pressures meant that {{they could no longer}} afford to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent,</b> whereupon they moved to Bath City's Twerton Park, a move that saved the club £30,000 a year. After playing for ten years in Bath, the club returned to Bristol in 1997 when they agreed to share Bristol Rugby's Memorial Stadium. Since joining The Football League in 1920, when the top division of the Southern League effectively became the Football League Third Division, Rovers have spent most of their time {{in the second and third}} tiers of the English football league system; the team has never played in the top flight and spent six years, 2001 to 2007, in the fourth tier.|$|E

The relationship was sometimes awkward and Orwell and Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts. Orwell was now working on Keep the Aspidistra Flying, and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the News Chronicle.

But the venture did not go well financially, which put Farrant's widow in jeopardy of defaulting on the rent to More. In November 1583, Farrant brought suit against Hunnis and Newman for default on the bond. To escape a suit by her or More, Hunnis and Newman transferred their sublease to Henry Evans, a Welsh scrivener and theatrical affectionado. This unauthorised assignment of the sublease gave More an excuse to bring suit to retake possession of the property, but Evans used legal delays and finally escaped legal action by selling the sublease to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, sometime after Michaelmas Term (November) of 1583, who then gave it to his secretary, the writer John Lyly.|$|E
