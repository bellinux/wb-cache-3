25|$|Jones {{gathered}} together all these samples of ornament as 'best' examples of decoration {{in an attempt}} to encourage designers to follow his lead in examining the underlying principles contained within the broad history of ornament and <b>polychromy.</b> The Grammar was hugely influential in design schools {{in the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, and is still in print today, maintaining its relevance as a source of inspiration for contemporary designers.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of Jones’s decoration as applied to architecture (and {{one of the few}} examples to exist today, albeit restored) was his work on Christ Church, Streatham, built in 1841 by James Wild (1814–1892), who later became Jones's brother-in-law. Jones was responsible for the interior decoration, but would most probably have also contributed to the design of the exterior which exhibits brick <b>polychromy</b> and architectural details with Byzantine and Islamic influences.|$|E
25|$|Jones was {{employed}} {{as one of}} the Superintendents of Works for the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was responsible for not only the decoration of Joseph Paxton's gigantic cast iron and glass palace, but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within, and this was the architectural project which first brought Jones to the wider public's attention. Based on his observations of primary colour <b>polychromy</b> within the architecture of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and at the Alhambra, he chose a simple palette of red, yellow and blue for the interior ironwork. Colour theories were relatively new, and his controversial paint scheme created much debate and negative publicity in the newspapers and journals of the day. Crucially, after early viewings, Prince Albert maintained his support, and Jones ploughed on regardless. The public and professional criticism gradually dissipated until the building was eventually unveiled by Queen Victoria to much critical acclaim – some commenting that Jones's colouring was similar in effect to the paintings of Turner. Jones had been offered a rare chance to put some of his theories on <b>polychromy</b> into practice on a grand scale: six million people witnessed his vision at the Great Exhibition during its short existence – roughly three times the population of London at that time.|$|E
5000|$|An {{extensive}} restoration campaign {{began in}} 1992: the stones were cleaned {{in the laboratory}} and were reinstalled. The inauguration of the restored frontage took place in 1995. It was for this occasion that the artists of Skertzò created a spectacle of multi-coloured lighting (<b>polychromies).</b> Every evening during the summer, at nightfall, the West Front of the Church of Notre-Dame-la-Grande is illuminated by a whole palette of colours, a reminder of its past and the mediaeval tradition of painting churches.|$|R
50|$|Drawn back to Caracas, he {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the integration of the visual arts into the architectural program of the Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas, a project directed and promoted by the architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva, and considered the most advanced effort in architecture and urbanism in the country. As part of a large group of Venezuelan and foreign artists (including Hans Arp, Alexander Calder, Fernand Léger, Victor Vasarely, Mateo Manaure, Francisco Narváez, and Jesús Rafael Soto) contributing to the project, Otero realized a series of large-scale public works, including murals, stained glass windows, and Policromías (<b>Polychromies),</b> facades in glass mosaic.|$|R
30|$|While {{the use of}} {{atacamite}} is {{well known}} in Chinese sculptural <b>polychromies,</b> wall paintings and other works of art [8 – 11], botallackite was rarely found as a painting pigment. However, it was identified in wall paintings from the Bingling Temple near Lanzhou, Ganzu Province [12] as well as in a painted sculpture from Yulin Grottoes [13]. In the context of degradation and corrosion of bronze objects, the presence of botallackite was also reported [14]. The rare cases in which botallackite has been characterized could be explained by its lower stability in comparison to the other copper trihydroxychlorides and its rare naturally occurrence [4, 15]. The spherical form of the crystals, as seen in Figure  4 b, suggests a synthetic origin of the pigment, rather than a source in the natural mineral [14].|$|R
25|$|Jones's {{studies of}} the Alhambra in Granada were pivotal in the {{development}} of his theories on flat pattern, geometry and <b>polychromy.</b> His travelling companion, Jules Goury, had recently been working with Gottfried Semper on his analysis of the <b>polychromy</b> of Ancient Greek buildings, and this was very likely a key factor in Jones embarking on such a scientific and detailed appraisal of the decoration at the Alhambra. Goury died of cholera – at the age of 31 – during their six-month stay at the Alhambra, and Jones returned to London determined to publish the results of their studies. The standard of colour printing at that time was not sophisticated enough to do justice to the intricate decoration of the Alhambra, therefore Jones undertook the printing work himself. Collaborating with chemists and printers, Jones took it upon himself to research the new process of chromolithography. He issued this labour of love, Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra, in twelve parts over a period of almost ten years, from 1836 to 1845. It was the world's first ever published work of any significance to employ chromolithography, and was to be a key milestone {{in the development of}} Owen Jones's reputation as a design theorist.|$|E
25|$|Campania also {{produced}} red-figure vases in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The light brown clay of Campania {{was covered with}} a slip that developed a pink or red tint after firing. The Campanian painters preferred smaller vessel types, but also hydriai and bell kraters. The most popular shape is the bow-handled amphora. Many typical Apulian vessel shapes, like volute kraters, column kraters, loutrophoroi, rhyta and nestoris amphorae are absent, pelikes are rare. The repertoire of motifs is limited. Subjects include youths, women, thiasos scenes, birds and animals, and often native warriors. The backs often show cloaked youths. Mythological scenes and depictions related to burial rites play a subsidiary role. Naiskos scsnes, ornamental elements and <b>polychromy</b> are adopted after 340 BC under Lucanian influence.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{embarked}} on a Grand Tour to the continent in 1832, having completed studies at the Royal Academy Schools, an apprenticeship with the architect Lewis Vulliamy (1791–1871) and with Vulliamy's consent, employment by William Wallen snr, thus gaining experience as a surveyor. He travelled first to Italy and then to Greece where he met the young French architect Jules Goury (1803–1834), who was assisting Gottfried Semper (1803–1879) with his radical studies of the <b>polychromy</b> of Ancient Greek buildings. Jones and Goury travelled together to Egypt to study the Islamic architecture of Cairo and the ancient sites, and continued on to Constantinople before finally arriving at Granada in southern Spain where they {{embarked on}} their studies of the Islamic decoration at the Alhambra.|$|E
50|$|Records {{mention a}} wooden church existed {{at this site}} already in the 13th century {{during the reign of}} Leo I of Halych. During {{the second half of the}} 15th century a monastery was built next to the church. A stone church was built in 1550 and in 1585 a monastery {{surrounded}} with fortifications. The church was destroyed and rebuilt several times. Damaged by Turks in 1672, it underwent a major reconstruction in 1680. In 1776 the church was connected with the previously separate chapel of the Holy Trinity, adjoining it to the north, a new classicist bell tower was built in 1820 and in the years 1821-1824 the presbytery was extended and a sacristy added. The churches present day look dates to 1902 when the southern nave was constructed symmetrically and both were topped with hexagonal domes. Inside the church holds 18th century <b>polychromies</b> and an iconostasis from 1908.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{its small}} dimension, the {{building}} cannot {{be identified with}} {{the church of the}} nunnery, but rather with a martyrion (burial chapel) or a mausoleum, which can be dated to the Palaiologan period (14th century). The building had the shape of an irregular octagon with a cross-shaped interior and an apse oriented toward East. Light penetrates into the building through windows opened on alternate sides, which illuminate the arms of the cross-shaped interior. Each window is inside a blind arch which spans the whole side. The masonry uses alternate courses of brick and ashlar, giving to the exterior the <b>polychromy</b> typical of the Palaiologan period. Remnants of walls still present in the northwest and south sides before the restoration showed that the building was not isolated, but connected with other edifices. A minaret has also been added to the restored building.|$|E
25|$|Through {{his work}} at the Great Exhibition, Jones {{developed}} a close working relationship with the civil servant Henry Cole (1808–1882) who {{went on to become the}} first director of the South Kensington Museum (later to become the V) Through his contact with Cole, Jones was able to present his theories on decoration, ornament and <b>polychromy</b> via a series of lectures at the Society of Arts and at the Government School of Design, whose headmaster was the artist Richard Burchett, and which was administered by the newly formed Department of Practical Art at Marlborough House. Jones also advised on the formation of the teaching collections at Marlborough House (much of it acquired from exhibits at the Great Exhibition) which were collated together as the Museum of Ornamental Art, and which later became the foundation collections for the South Kensington Museum.|$|E
500|$|Paley {{continued}} to work from the offices in StLeonard's Gate after Sharpe's resignation, but in 1860 he moved to offices in Castle Hill, where the practice remained {{throughout the rest of}} its existence. [...] During the 1850s he designed StPeter, Lancaster, a Roman Catholic church that later became Lancaster Cathedral (1857–59). [...] This is regarded by Brandwood et al. as his [...] "masterwork as an independent church architect". [...] Hartwell et al. agree, calling this church, with its northwest steeple [...] high, his chef d'oeuvre. [...] During the 1860s, Paley began to design churches with bare brick interior walls, rather than plastered walls, the earliest being StPeter, Quernmore (1860). [...] Although the High Victorian style was becoming popular elsewhere, it played little part in Paley's designs, other than more elaborate decorative features, such as the embellishment of the principal rafters at Quernmore. [...] He never used the more blatant features of the style, such as <b>polychromy.</b> [...] During this decade, before the arrival of Austin, he designed churches for the industrial towns of Lancashire, one of the largest being StJames, Poolstock (1863–66). [...] The rebuilding of St Peter's Church, Bolton (1867–71) with its northwest tower rising to , is considered by Brandwood et al. to be [...] "Paley's other great independent church project". [...] Hartwell et al. refer to it as a [...] "formidable new church".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{assuming}} the external form of traditional literature, Ion Creangă's interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated {{him from his}} roots: [...] "peasants do not have [...] entirely cultured gifts.... Too much 'atmosphere', too much dialogic 'humor', too much <b>polychromy</b> {{at the expense of}} linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal." [...] The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author's use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating local folklore, the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and volubility as their main purpose. According to Vianu's assessment Creangă was [...] "a supreme artist" [...] whose use of [...] "typical sayings" [...] attests [...] "a man of the people, but not an anonymous and impersonal sample." [...] These verdicts, directly contradicting Junimist theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: Pompiliu Constantinescu, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Negoițescu. Writing {{during the second half of}} the century, critic Nicolae Manolescu passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a [...] "strictly intellectual sensuousness" [...] and the notion that [...] "pleasure arises from gratuitousness", while Manolescu's colleague Mircea Braga referred to [...] "the great secret of the man who has managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one." [...] In Braga's assessment, this synthesis managed [...] "the impossible", but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: [...] "from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy".|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury ecclesiastical {{architecture}} was moving away from the Neoclassical style towards Gothic. [...] Initially the churches in Gothic Revival style incorporated Gothic-like features, such as lancet windows, and towers with pinnacles and crockets. [...] This was known as a pre-archaeological style and was used in the first phase of the Commissioners' Churches. [...] A.W.N.Pugin argued that these features should correctly and accurately reflect medieval Gothic architecture rather than mimic it, and Sharpe became an expert in this movement. [...] Paley learned much of this from Sharpe and as a consequence incorporated [...] "correct" [...] Gothic features in his own work. [...] At the same time the Cambridge Camden Society, influenced by the Oxford Movement, were advocating a more sacramental form of liturgy, which required a larger chancel than that normally provided in the Commissioners' Churches. [...] Paley was also influenced in this by his brother, Frederick, who was a member of the Camden Society and was himself an expert on medieval architecture. [...] Most of Paley's churches followed precedents from the 13th and 14thcenturies, and were in Early English, or in Decorated style, mainly the latter. [...] Their common plan consisted of open roofs, benches for the congregation, stalls in the chancel, a pulpit to the side of the entrance to the chancel, steps leading up to the chancel, and a font at the west end. [...] Paley is not seen as an innovator in church design, and he did not use devices such as <b>polychromy,</b> which was being introduced elsewhere. [...] He did however introduce Perpendicular features into some of his designs, for example, StPatrick, Preston Patrick, StPeter, Rylstone (both 1852–53), and in the rebuilding of St Paul's Church, Brookhouse (1865–67). [...] Paley's early new churches had plastered interiors, but in 1860 he introduced an interior of bare brick in StPeter, Quernmore. [...] This feature was repeated in a similar manner in later churches including StMark, Preston, and StJames, Barrow.|$|E

2500|$|Painting {{was also}} used to enhance the visual aspects of architecture. Certain parts of the {{superstructure}} of Greek temples were habitually painted since the Archaic period. Such architectural <b>polychromy</b> could {{take the form of}} bright colours directly applied to the stone (evidenced e.g. on the Parthenon, or of elaborate patterns, frequently architectural members made of terracotta (Archaic examples at Olympia and Delphi). Sometimes, the terracottas also depicted figural scenes, as do the 7th-century BC terracotta metopes from Thermon.|$|E
2500|$|By 1849, A. W. N. Pugin {{and others}} had already {{advanced}} {{the ideas of the}} Gothic Revival and its popularity was secured. Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement, proved a great popular success, and received the approval of The ecclesiologists, the influential newsletter of architectural criticism published by the Cambridge Camden Society. Effects such as the <b>polychromy</b> of High Victorian Gothic architecture may be traced to him, in a genre of [...] "Ruskinian Gothic" [...] that was practised in Britain and colonies like New Zealand and Canada, and in Anglophile strata of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Easter Aquhorthies stone circle, {{located near}} Inverurie in {{north-east}} Scotland, {{is one of}} the best-preserved examples of a recumbent stone circle, {{and one of the few}} that still have their full complement of stones. It stands on a gentle hill slope about [...] west of Inverurie, and consists of a ring of nine stones, eight of which are grey granite and one red jasper. Two more grey granite stones flank a recumbent of red granite flecked with crystals and lines of quartz. The circle is particularly notable for its builders' use of <b>polychromy</b> in the stones, with the reddish ones situated on the SSW side and the grey ones opposite. The discovery of a possible cist covered by a capstone at the centre of the circle indicates that there may once have been a cairn there, but only a conspicuous bump now remains.|$|E
2500|$|An {{exceptionally}} large Virgin & Child (36 in high) {{known as}} Our Lady of Westminster, sculpted circa 1450 in Nottingham and exported {{from there to}} France, {{can be found in}} the Lady Chapel of Westminster Cathedral, London, whence it was installed after being bought at the Paris Exhibition of 1954. This image still carries numerous traces of its original <b>polychromy,</b> such as the characteristic [...] "daisy pattern" [...] against a dark green ground on the base, red and blue in the garment folds and gilding on the crown and mantle fastenings. This image is very similar stylistically to one found buried in the churchyard of Broughton-in-Craven and may have been from the same workshop. [...] Over a dozen English alabaster statues of the Madonna and Child have been traced, mostly recovered from France; the smallest is 16inches high up to size of the Westminster statue.|$|E
2500|$|Most Greek sculptures {{were painted}} in strong and bright colors; {{this is called}} [...] "polychromy". The paint was {{frequently}} limited to parts depicting clothing, hair, and so on, with the skin left in the natural color of the stone or bronze, {{but it could also}} cover sculptures in their totality; female skin in marble tended to be uncoloured, while male skin might be a light brown. The painting of Greek sculpture should not merely be seen as an enhancement of their sculpted form, but has the characteristics of a distinct style of art. For example, the pedimental sculptures from the Temple of Aphaia on Aegina have recently been demonstrated to have been painted with bold and elaborate patterns, depicting, amongst other details, patterned clothing. The <b>polychromy</b> of stone statues was paralleled by the use of different materials to distinguish skin, clothing and other details in chryselephantine sculptures, and by the use of different metals to depict lips, fingernails, etc. on high-quality bronzes like the Riace bronzes.|$|E
2500|$|The Lucanian vase {{painting}} tradition began around 430 BC, {{with the}} works of the Pisticci Painter. He was probably active in Pisticci, where some of his works were discovered. He was strongly influenced by Attic tradition. His successors, the Amycus Painter and the Cyclops Painter had a workshop in Metapontum. They were the first to paint the new nestoris (see Typology of Greek Vase Shapes) vase type. Mythical or theatrical scenes are common. For example, the Cheophoroi painter, named after the Cheophoroi by Aeschylos showed scenes from the tragedy in question on several of his vases. The influence of Apulian vase painting becomes tangible roughly at the same time. Especially <b>polychromy</b> and vegetal decor became standard. Important representatives of this style include the Dolon Painter and the Brooklyn-Budapest Painter. Towards the mid-4th century BC, a massive drop in quality and thematic variety becomes notable. The last notable Lucanian vase painter was the Primato Painter, strongly influenced by the Apulian Lycourgos Painter. After him, a short rapid demise is followed by the cessation of Lucanian vase painting {{at the start of the}} last quarter of [...] the 4th century BC.|$|E
