50|$|There {{has also}} been some doubts about the {{validity}} and reliability of the EQ. As stated above, one study found a lack of correlation between the EQ and the 2D:4D ratio which is the ratio between the second and fourth fingers determined by prenatal testosterone and estrogen.

The authors hypothesize {{that this could be}} due either to biological factors, a theoretical problem with the E-S theory of autism, or could be due to problems with the <b>psychometric</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measures.

30|$|Before <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Teacher Stress Inventory (TSI), <b>the</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> teachers’ {{stress was}} difficult to access as it was equated with burnout. Therefore, <b>the</b> psychometric constructs <b>of</b> teachers’ stress were devised {{with the understanding that}} burnout is <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> long-standing stress (Fimian and Fastenau 1990). Thus, in an attempt to specifically assess “different stress experiences” that are particular to the teaching profession, the TSI was developed (Fimian 1984). However, such instrument should be culturally and contextually applicable in Nigeria, requiring its modification and comparison with the original version in order to achieve this. <b>The</b> original version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TSI is a psychometrically valid and reliable self-administered instrument used in <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> teacher stress developed by Fimian in 1984 for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> occupational stress in teachers (Fimian 1984). The TSI has been widely used in North America, where it was developed and also in Africa (Atindanbila 2011; Paulse 2005). This 49 -item instrument assesses issues relating to time management, work-related stressors, discipline and motivation, professional investment, emotional manifestations, fatigue manifestations, cardiovascular manifestations, gastronomical manifestations, and behavioral manifestations. <b>The</b> original version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TSI has ten factors, <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> item content was based on <b>the</b> experiences <b>of</b> public school teachers working in both regular and special education schools. When <b>the</b> <b>psychometric</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TSI was determined in South Africa, items 1 (I easily over-commit myself), 3 (I have to try doing more than one thing at a time), and 6 (I feel uncomfortable wasting time) were omitted (Boshoff 2011).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Evidence {{suggests}} that differences exist {{in physical activity}} (PA) participation among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) children and adolescents. It is possible that these differences could be influenced by variations in measurement technique and instrument reliability. However, culturally sensitive instruments for examining PA behaviour among CALD populations are lacking. This study tested <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child and Adolescent Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (CAPANS-PA) recall questionnaire among a sample of Chinese-Australian youth. Methods <b>The</b> <b>psychometric</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CAPANS-PA questionnaire was examined among a sample of 77 Chinese-Australian youth (aged 11 - 14 y) who completed the questionnaire twice within 7 days. Test-retest reliability of individual items and scales within the CAPANS-PA questionnaire was determined using Kappa statistics for categorical variables and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for continuous variables. Results The CAPANS-PA questionnaire demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability for frequency and duration {{of time spent in}} weekly Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) (ICC ≥ 0. 70) for all participants. Test-retest reliability for time spent in weekly sedentary activities was acceptable for females (ICC = 0. 82) and males (ICC = 0. 72). Conclusions The results suggest the CAPANS-PA questionnaire provides reliable estimates for type, frequency and duration of MVPA participation among Chinese-Australian youth. Further investigation into <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sedentary items within the CAPANS-PA is required before these items can be used with confidence. This study is novel in that <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> instruments among CALD groups nationally and internationally remains sparse and this study contributes to <b>the</b> wider body <b>of</b> available psychometrically tested instruments. In addition, this study is the first to our knowledge to successfully engage and investigate the basic health enhancing behaviours of Chinese-Australian adolescents. </p...|$|R
