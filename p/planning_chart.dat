40|$|There are {{computer}} programs {{that use the}} same flow of control when run on different inputs. This redundancy in their program execution traces can be exploited by preserving suitably abstracted call-graphs for subsequent reuse. We introduce a new programming transformation Call-Graph Caching (CGC) which partially evaluates the control flow of sets of such programs into a network formed from their call-graphs. CGC can automatically generate efficient state-saving structure-sharing incremental algorithms from simple program specifications. As an example, we show how a straightforward, inefficient LISP program for conjunctive match is automatically transformed into the RETE network algorithm. Simple and understandable changes to elegant functional (and other) programs are automatically translated by CGC into new efficient incremental network algorithms; this abstraction mechanism is shown for a class of conjunctive matching algorithms. We establish criteria for the appropriate application of CGC to other AI methods, such as <b>planning,</b> <b>chart</b> parsing, consistency maintenance, and analogical reasoning...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{renewal of}} {{conventional}} science teaching practices, particularly {{regarding the use}} of Experimental Work, has been a concern of official documents and experts, {{due to the lack of}} fitness and motivation on the part of teachers who use it. Since no one teaches in a scientifically accepted way what is unknown, it is essential to provide future teachers with didactic and scientific updates, in order to apply correct pedagogical-didactic practices, of experimental nature. This study included 12 future teachers of the 1 st cycle of basic education (primary education) and aimed to investigate whether these students were correctly planning experimental activities which should assist in an internship context. The planning of these activities was based on the <b>planning</b> <b>chart</b> used in the Training Program of Experimental Science Education, promoted by the Portuguese Ministry of Education.

For this, we should provide the career design <b>planning</b> <b>chart</b> from the period of career recognition(stage of elementary school), to the period of career exploration(stage of middle school) and the period of career selection(the stage of high school). What is the most essential here is to establish system that can be actively managed by individuals and also institutionally managed by school, state and society. Moreover, it is necessary to help learners'' adaptation to the future society and development of capacity, so that learners belonging to elementary/middle/high schools can actively cope with the future society. It is also needed to provide them with not only reading environment in which they can have extensive humanistic and philosophical thinking, but also ecological learning environment for establishment of identity and self-directed learning, which might be the social heritage given from the older generation and society to the future generation. 본 과제에서는 다가올 미래사회를 대비하기 위해 ‘미래세대’에서 필요로 하는 직업능력을 파악하고, 이를 토대로 ‘평생학습과 고용 연계’를 강화시키는 방안을 제시하고자 한다. 연구 목적을 구체적으로 제시하면 다음과 같다. 첫째, 미래세대가 살아갈 시대의 환경 변화를 예측하여 미래사회에서 요구되는 직업능력을 파악한다. 특히 미래 직업 트렌드, 조직 및 근무 형태, 경력 유형과 라이프스타일 등과 관련된 직업기초능력에 대해 파악한다. 둘째, 미래세대의 평생 직업능력 강화를 위한 학습-고용 연계 방안을 분석하여 실행 주체별(중앙정부, 산업체, 시·도교육청, 지자체, 학교, 그리고 기관 및 단체) 로 연계 방안을 제시한다. 셋째, 미래세대를 위한 학습-고용 연계 방안과 관련한 정책적 시사점과 인문학적·철학적 담론을 제시한다. management and attitude balanced between work and quality of life in the order. The obstacle factors of connection between lifelong learning and employment of the future generation and measures for overcoming were researched and analyzed in six aspects such as 1) the short-sighted amendment of law and institution regarding the aspect of law and institution, 2) the absence of any prediction of the future society, and securing research budget in the financial aspect, 3) in the aspect of infrastructure/facilities, discordance of equipment and facilities between lifelong learning institutes and the fields of employment, and preparing the actual field practice programs and learning programs with invited experts in each area, 4) in the aspect of providing information, the absence of portals for the future promising job groups, and strengthening/newly establishing portals that provide the latest information from domestic and foreign future research institutes, 5) in the aspect of social recognition, lack of overall recognition of the future generation and lifelong learning, and efforts to change the national-level paradigm, and 6) for other opinions, the intensified gap of investment in educational training between large enterprises and small/medium-sized companies, and correct understanding by small/medium-sized companies and expansion of investment support in educational training. As measures of strengthening connection between lifelong learning and employment for each practical main agent in accordance with changes in the future environment and the future vocational world, we suggested ① establishing national human resources plan, strengthening the future prediction ability &positive thinking and attitude, ④ coping ability to changes and lifelong learning ability, and ⑤ self-control &career management ability, ③ professionalism &practice and concentration ability, ② converging ability &cooperation, ④ challenge ability, and ⑤ personal history management ability in the order.

By conducting a survey of experts'' opinions about the future environment, changes in vocational world(job trend, organization &work type, type of experience, and lifestyle), relevant basic job skills, and measures of connecting learning with employment after selecting experts in each area of lifelong education, we drew out problems and improvement measures. The professional FGI was the advanced research for Delphi research, which was the basic research of this study. In the results, first, the survey contents related to job skills required for the future generation in accordance with the changes in the future environment were completed based on the study by Jang, Joo-Hee et al(2011). Second, the survey related to basic job skills required for the future generation was completed on the basis of KRIVET basic job skills. Chapter 2 defined the future generation of this study based on domestic &foreign future studies and the study on generations by Karl Mannheim, and also described the theoretical background of this study through literature analysis on connection between lifelong learning and employment. In Chapter 3, we researched and analyzed each job competence required for the future generation in accordance with changes in the vocational world(job trend, organization &work type, type of experience, and lifestyle). As suggestions for the current government and organizations to establish the practical policies related to connection between lifelong learning and employment, Chapter 6 suggested programs(plans) that could be possibly practiced {{based on the results of}} Delphi research, and also aimed to set up the framework of forming humanistic and philosophical discussions regarding connection between lifelong learning and employment of the future generation. The main change factors that would be encountered by the future generation included fixation of low-growth basis, intensified low-birth and aging, convergence of technologies, increase of interest in quality of life, and development of information communication technology.

Surviving for a century means that we should be able to adapt ourselves to rapidly changing society as decent human beings. The extended average life expectancy not only prolongs the period of participating in economy, but also changes the time and opportunity of participating in economy, expressed as double or triple cropping. Therefore, the education received when young is not good enough to survive the changed society, which means that lifelong {{education is}} not optional, but required. If such lifelong learning is no more than learning for self-contentment to simply enjoy learning or leisure, it will not be continued due to its lack of learning power and motivation. Human''s learning is more significant only when the opportunity of social participation is provided. Neglecting human resources with fully-invested education can be a huge waste of psychological and material resources. Especially, the generational conflicts of jobs caused by the era of physically healthy centenarians are rising as a serious problem in many countries including Korea. For this, the Park, Geun-hye administration is suggesting solutions for aiming for society in which national happiness and national development are in a virtuous circle, and every member of social community lives in harmony and also enjoys stable life. One of them is to establish the ''national lifelong learning system for the era of centenarians through providing various participation basis and customized educational programs of lifelong learning. The life design for rapidly changing times is only possible through connection between lifelong learning and employment. The connection between lifelong learning and employment of the future generations are the required conditions not only for economic aspect, but also establishment of healthy social atmosphere. Thus the connection between lifelong learning and employment is the task not only for the present, but also the older generation that prepares for the future. This study defines adolescents currently belonging to elementary/middle /high schools, who will participate in economic activities in 2020 ～ 2030 as the future generation, and also seeks for the ''measures of strengthening the connection between lifelong learning and employment for the future generation''.
