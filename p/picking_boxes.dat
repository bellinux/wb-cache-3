40|$|Abstractâ€”We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for incorporating collision avoidance into trajectory optimization {{as a method of}} solving robotic motion planning problems. At the core of our approach are (i) A sequential convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in an outer loop as necessary. (ii) An efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety and enables the algorithm to reliably solve motion planning problems, including problems involving thin and complex obstacles. We benchmarked our algorithm against several other motion planning algorithms, solving a suite of 7 -degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm-planning problems and 18 -DOF full-body planning problems. We compared against sampling-based planners from OMPL, and we also compared to CHOMP, a leading approach for trajectory optimization. Our algorithm was faster than the alternatives, solved more problems, and yielded higher quality paths. Experimental evaluation on the following additional problem types also confirmed the speed and effectiveness of our approach: (i) Planning foot placements with 34 degrees of freedom (28 joints + 6 DOF pose) of the Atlas humanoid robot as it maintains static stability and has to negotiate environmental constraints. (ii) Industrial box picking. (iii) Real-world motion planning for the PR 2 that requires considering all degrees of freedom at the same time. Fig. 1. Several problem settings were we have used our algorithm for motion planning. Top left: planning an arm trajectory for the PR 2 in simulation, in a benchmark problem.

[...] However, his most famous job at Springbok Radio was hosting the hugely popular quiz show <b>Pick</b> a <b>Box,</b> which aired for {{fourteen}} years from 1960 until 1974. Courtney toured South Africa with the show throughout its airing, attracting large crowds of fans. In one instance, the Mayor of East London sent a limousine to meet Courtney at the East London Airport, where he had arrived to host <b>Pick</b> a <b>Box</b> in the city. Courtney broadcast <b>Pick</b> a <b>Box</b> {{from a variety of}} unusual locations including Antarctica, the Cango Caves, the Union-Castle Line and a mine shaft. The popular radio show ended in 1974. <b>Pick</b> a <b>Box</b> was briefly resurrected as a television quiz show in the 1980s with Courtney once again as its host. However, the TV version was not a hit and was quickly cancelled.|$|R
