40|$|Abstract: This paper {{gives the}} theory and {{experimental}} results for a current-source parallel-resonant inverter employed for induction heating. The analysis is performed in the frequency domain using Fourier series techniques to predict output power, efficiency, dc-to-ac voltage transfer function, and component voltage and current stresses. The inverter consists of four switches, a large choke inductor, and a <b>parallel-resonant</b> <b>circuit.</b> Each switch consists of a MOSFET in series with a fast diode. An inverter was designed and constructed. The dc input voltage was 70 V and the output voltage was a sine wave with a peak value of 100 V at an operating frequency of 83 kHz. The output power at full load was 400 W. Index Terms: induction heating, parallel resonant, current source inverter...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} condenser type {{sample holder}} for {{the measurement of}} the dielectric constant and loss tangent at frequencies up to 200 Mc/s is described. The holder has one fixed and one movable plate. A metal bellows provides a law impedance flexible connection to the movable plate, and a micrometer drive ensures accurate plate separation. A micrometer projecting into a cylindrical hole {{in the side of}} the fixed plate forms a vernier condenser used to measure the loss tangent in the higher frequency range. The sample holder was used in conjunction with an inductively-coupled ratio arm bridge at audio frequencies, with a modified commercial Q-meter from 100 Kc/s to 20 Mc/s, and with a <b>parallel-resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> over the remainder of the range. Measurements made on polystyrene and an expanded artificial dielectric showed that the dielectric constant could be measured to 0. 4 percent and the loss tangent to 0. 00004...|$|E
50|$|In {{wideband}} detection, the impedance usually comprises a low Q <b>parallel-resonant</b> RLC <b>circuit.</b> This circuit {{tends to}} attenuate the exciting voltage (usually between 50 and 60 Hz) and amplify the voltage generated {{due to the}} discharges.|$|R
40|$|A {{microsystem}} for wireless long-term {{measurement of}} the intraocular pressure is presented. The sensing element is a novel distributed <b>parallel-resonant</b> inductive-capacative <b>circuit.</b> with a pressure-dependent resonance frequency. This circuit is bared upon a twofold on-chip deposited inductor. The high Q inductor is deposited by electrodeposition of copper on a micromachined chip incorporating a pressure-sensitive diaphragm. Test structures were fabricated and characterized. Q factors of 30 at 45 MHz and inductance values of 0. 4 mu H are obtained for 3 x 3 mm(2) structures. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Resonant {{inverters}} produce sine waves with LC circuits {{to remove}} the harmonics from a simple square wave. Typically there are several series- and <b>parallel-resonant</b> LC <b>circuits,</b> each tuned to a different harmonic of the power line frequency. This simplifies the electronics, but the inductors and capacitors tend to be large and heavy. Its high efficiency makes this approach popular in large uninterruptible power supplies in data centers that run the inverter continuously in an [...] "online" [...] mode to avoid any switchover transient when power is lost.(See related: Resonant inverter) ...|$|R
