25|$|The main portal {{was often}} {{used by the}} {{university}} staff to <b>pin</b> <b>up</b> messages and notices; it is generally believed that on 31 October 1517, the eve of All Saints' Day, Martin Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses on the doors of All Saints' Church. This act, meant to promote a disputation {{on the sale of}} indulgences, is commonly viewed to be a catalyst for the Protestant Reformation. Whether the event actually took place or not, however, cannot be conclusively established. Nevertheless, Luther sent his objections in a letter to Archbishop Albert of Mainz on the same day.|$|E

25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} for that is a little harder to <b>pin.</b> <b>Up</b> until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E
500|$|For {{many young}} women, {{the allure of}} Lowell was in the {{opportunities}} afforded for further study and learning. Most had already completed some measure of formal education and were resolutely bent on self-improvement. [...] Upon their arrival, they found a vibrant, lively working class intellectual culture: workers read voraciously in Lowell's city library and Reading Rooms, and subscribed to the large, informal “circulating libraries” which trafficked in novels. Many even pursued literary composition. Defying factory rules, operatives would affix verses to their spinning frames, “to train their memories,” and <b>pin</b> <b>up</b> mathematical problems in the rooms where they worked. In the evenings, many enrolled in courses offered by the mills and attended public lectures at the Lyceum, a theatre built at company expense (offering 25 lectures per season for 25 cents). The Voice of Industry is alive with notices for upcoming lectures, courses, and meetings on topics ranging from astronomy to music.|$|E

The actress, who starred in Dallas for nine years in the Seventies and Eighties, has not joined castmates Larry Hagman, 80 , Patrick Duffy, 62 , and Linda Gray, 71 , in the TNT reboot of the hit show, which premiered in the summer of 2012. But she certainly looks good enough to return to the fold to play opposite Jesse Metcalfe, 33 , who plays her grown adopted son Christopher." ...|$|E

Harvey's books, explaining 20th-century civilization, as well as a world globe, a bible, encyclopedias, and newspapers, were to be placed inside two vaults and hermetically sealed in glass. Harvey also wanted to place in this large room: [...] "numerous small items now used in domestic and industrial life, from the size of a needle and safety <b>pin</b> <b>up</b> to a Victrola." [...] It was estimated that the construction would use 16,000 bags of cement, 30,000ft³ (850m³) of sand, 58,000ft³ (1,642m³) of gravel, and tons of corrugated steel reinforcement. The Portland Cement Association donated the service of one of its experts, who pronounced that the Pyramid would not deteriorate or suffer from erosion and would last for over a million years. To prevent water in the valley from interfering with the foundation and to shore up the low knoll to support the heavy Pyramid, Harvey constructed a [...] long retaining wall of stone and concrete.|$|E

2500|$|The modern bikini {{made its}} debut in 1946, and since then it has caught the popular {{imagination}} becoming probably the most popular women's swimsuit, and not necessarily for swimming. Today, bikinis appear in competitions, films, magazines, music, literature, magazines and even video games. Despite the easy availability of more revealing glamour imagery, bikini modeling remains popular and can still create controversy. Portrayals of the bikini in popular culture led, to a large extent, to its acceptance by Western society at large. In 1960, Brian Hyland's pop song [...] "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini" [...] inspired a bikini-buying spree. The white bikini worn by Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No has been cited {{as one of the}} most famous bikinis of all time and an iconic moment in cinematic and fashion history. By 1963, the movie Beach Party, starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol. Playboy first featured a bikini on its cover in 1962. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue debuted two years later. This increasing popularity was reinforced by its appearance in contemporary movies like How to Stuff a Wild Bikini featuring Annette Funicello and One Million Years B.C. (1966) featuring Raquel Welch. Raquel Welch's fur bikini in One Million Years B.C. gave the world the most iconic bikini shot of all time in that period and the poster image became an important iconic moment in cinema history. Hollywood stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Gina Lollobrigida and Jane Russell helped the growing popularity of bikinis further. <b>Pin</b> <b>up</b> posters of Monroe and Mansfield, as well as Hayworth, Bardot and Raquel Welch distributed around the world contributed significantly to the popularity of the bikini.|$|E
2500|$|When a pin rolls back, {{the smaller}} {{diameter}} of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first. [...] The wheel brings the pin {{to the top and}} drops it into a metal tray, called a [...] "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it drop into the pan base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a conveyor belt lifts the <b>pin</b> <b>up,</b> letting it slide into one of ten spots – nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin – in a rotating metal basket called the [...] "turret" [...] (located just above the deck) with only the deck itself, protected with the attached sheet metal [...] "deck shield", visible to the bowler as it descends to handle the pins. When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or [...] "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute {{in the center of the}} turret being filled last. Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck.|$|E
