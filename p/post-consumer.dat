25|$|Because of the {{recyclability}} of PET and {{the relative}} abundance of <b>post-consumer</b> waste {{in the form of}} bottles, PET is rapidly gaining market share as a carpet fiber. Mohawk Industries released everSTRAND in 1999, a 100% <b>post-consumer</b> recycled content PET fiber. Since that time, more than 17 billion bottles have been recycled into carpet fiber. Pharr Yarns, a supplier to numerous carpet manufacturers including Looptex, Dobbs Mills, and Berkshire Flooring, produces a BCF (bulk continuous filament) PET carpet fiber containing a minimum of 25% <b>post-consumer</b> recycled content.|$|E

25|$|Staples is {{currently}} trying to pursue developing Staples brand products with green raw materials. In {{response to a}} two-year campaign targeting the company, Staples adopted an environmentally friendly paper policy, in hopes of {{increasing the amount of}} <b>post-consumer</b> recycled paper made available for sale, phasing out products originating from endangered forests.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawback}} {{to many of}} these schemes is that computers gathered through recycling drives are often shipped to developing countries where environmental standards are less strict than in North America and Europe. The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition estimates that 80% of the <b>post-consumer</b> e-waste collected for recycling is shipped abroad to countries such as China and Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|One {{standard}} in the United States Green Building Council (USGBC)’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system (LEED) requires that newly constructed buildings include materials containing pre- and <b>post-consumer</b> recycled content.

See: Copper in architecture#Recycling.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{developments}} in PVC waste management have been monitored by Vinyl 2010, established in 2000. Vinyl 2010's {{objective was to}} recycle 200,000 tonnes of <b>post-consumer</b> PVC waste per year in Europe {{by the end of}} 2010, excluding waste streams already subject to other or more specific legislation (such as the European Directives on End-of-Life Vehicles, Packaging and Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment).|$|E
25|$|Besides this {{external}} (<b>post-consumer)</b> polyester bottle recycling, {{numbers of}} internal (pre-consumer) recycling processes exist, where the wasted polymer material does not exit the production site {{to the free}} market, and instead is reused in the same production circuit. In this way, fiber waste is directly reused to produce fiber, preform waste is directly reused to produce preforms, and film waste is directly reused to produce film.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, three kayakers {{contracted}} leptospirosis {{and suffered}} bouts of delusion and lung hemorrhaging after swallowing Yarra river water. Tests {{were conducted in}} the Yarra River and the Mullum Mullum Creek and the levels of many pathogens {{were found to have}} breached local and international standards for recreational water. This is documented in a 2007 report by EPA Victoria in which levels of Human faecal matter and E. coli were recorded and documented. Other major pollutants entering the creek via stormwater drains and surface runoff include dog feces, cigarette butts, packaging and other <b>post-consumer</b> waste.|$|E
25|$|Industrialization spurred {{demand for}} {{affordable}} materials; aside from rags, ferrous scrap metals were coveted {{as they were}} cheaper to acquire than virgin ore. Railroads both purchased and sold scrap metal in the 19th century, and the growing steel and automobile industries purchased scrap in the early 20th century. Many secondary goods were collected, processed and sold by peddlers who scoured dumps and city streets for discarded machinery, pots, pans, and other sources of metal. By World War I, thousands of such peddlers roamed the streets of American cities, taking advantage of market forces to recycle <b>post-consumer</b> materials back into industrial production.|$|E
25|$|In a 2008 media article, Starbucks' vice {{president}} of corporate social responsibility acknowledged that the company continued to struggle with environmental responsibility, as none of its cups were recyclable and stores did not have recycling bins. At {{the time that the}} article was published, Starbucks gave customers who brought in their own reusable cup a 10-cent discount, in addition to using corrugated cup sleeves made from 85 percent <b>post-consumer</b> recycled fiber, which is 34 percent less paper than the original. During the same period, Starbucks entered into a partnership with Conservation International—pledging US$7.5 million over three years—to help protect the natural environment of coffee-growing communities in Mexico and Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|During {{an event}} on March 21, 2016, Apple {{provided}} a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable {{in all of}} its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from <b>post-consumer</b> recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products. Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones.

500|$|In The Globe and Mail, Canadian author Paul William Roberts {{praised the}} book, calling it [...] "... the most {{important}} use of printed word and <b>post-consumer</b> recycled fibres I have seen since Jérôme Deshusses's Délivrez Prométhée, 25 years ago." [...] Roberts explains, [...] " [...] has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous... You feel you've read volumes, though, {{not just because of}} the density of Wright's thoughts, but due to the crushing weight of the burden they carry. In prose that is balefully evocative and irreducibly precise..." [...] On the other hand, in the National Post review, Peter Foster gave a negative review, chiding Wright for [...] "not having the slightest clue about how economies work, or how, by their fundamental nature, markets are both moral and sustainable." [...] Foster ended his review by insulting Wright's intellect, [...] "What really needs some psychological excavation is Ronald Wright's mind, which carries a set of inflated, emotionally based moralistic assumptions derived from the structure of his primitive ignorance about markets and economics." ...|$|E

More than eight percent of the estimated 10,000 people working at the Mart walk, bike or take public transportation; to encourage greener methods of transportation, the Mart expanded bicycle storage capacity to more than 200. [...] In 2009, MMPI converted all stationery to a one hundred percent <b>post-consumer</b> recycled product.|$|E
2500|$|One {{strategy}} enacted {{to reach}} this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called [...] "Dream Machines" [...] in supermarkets, convenience stores, and gas stations, {{with the intent of}} increasing access to recycling receptacles. The use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight, which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain PepsiCo products. The weight of Aquafina bottles was reduced nearly 40 percent, to 15grams, with a packaging redesign in 2009. Also in that year, PepsiCo brand Naked Juice began production and distribution of the first 100 percent <b>post-consumer</b> recycled plastic bottle.|$|E
