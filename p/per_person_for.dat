5|$|Great Britain VIII was a nine-day railtour from London to Cornwall, Scotland {{and back}} to London. Various steam {{locomotives}} were scheduled to haul the train on {{each day of the}} tour, which was to have been entirely steam hauled. Participants paid between £1,995 and £2,895 <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>for</b> the nine-day tour. Despite fears that the tour would be cancelled, it was run although with changes to the locomotives hauling it. DB Schenker agreed to operate the first two days of the tour. The tour suffered a number of issues including steam locomotives being replaced by diesels, and a lack of train heating; these resulted in a significant number of passengers leaving the tour early.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{also helps}} reduce income {{inequality}} measured after taxes, due to higher {{taxes on the}} top 5% of income earners and both subsidies and Medicaid expansion for lower-income persons. CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>for</b> 10 million individuals receiving them, roughly $42 billion. For scale, the subsidy for the employer market, {{in the form of}} exempting from taxation those health insurance premiums paid on behalf of employees by employers, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total in the employer market. The employer market subsidy was not changed by the law.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2016 {{there were}} 32 states (including Washington DC) that had adopted the Medicaid extension, while 19 states had not. Those states that {{expanded}} Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on {{average in the}} first quarter of 2016, while those that did not expand Medicaid had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose Medicaid funding if they didn't expand Medicaid under the ACA, several states rejected expanded Medicaid coverage. Over half of the national uninsured population lived in those states. In a report to Congress, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>for</b> 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 million to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.|$|E

25|$|Taxis were {{permitted}} to pick up multiple fares, and operated on a zone system rather than metered fare. Manhattan was divided into four zones, with one zone {{for each of the}} other four boroughs. The base fare, for travel within one zone, was limited to US$10 a person (although few cabbies charged less) charged in advance instead of {{at the end of the}} ride, plus an additional $5 <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>for</b> each additional zone.

CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>for</b> 10 million people receiving them, roughly $42 billion.

25|$|In 1699, the Corporation {{sought to}} obtain an Act of Parliament which {{would allow them to}} improve the river from Clayhithe to Queens Mill at Cambridge. This was {{obtained}} on 27 February 1702 and created the Conservators of the River Cam, a legal body with authority to charge tolls for use of the river, which ranged from four shillings (20p) a ton for wine to one penny (0.4p) <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>for</b> passengers. The Conservators, of which there were a maximum of eleven, had powers to mortgage the tolls, in order to raise capital for improvements to the river immediately. This they did, and built sluices at Jesus Green, Chesterton, Baits Bite and Clayhithe. Most of the tolls were collected at Clayhithe.|$|E
25|$|In {{the graph}} {{to the right}} the value above the line {{represents}} the out-of-pocket cost per trip, <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>for</b> each mode of transportation; the value below the line shows subsidies, environmental impact, social and indirect costs. When cities charge market rates for on-street parking and municipal parking garages for motor vehicles, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled for these modes, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs compared to other modes of transportation. When municipal motor vehicle parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, the shortfall in tax expenditures by drivers, through fuel tax and other taxes, might {{be regarded as a}} very large subsidy for automobile use: much greater than common subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.|$|E

25|$|The cost of {{traveling}} over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing {{to a few}} hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the Midwest and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>for</b> food and other items. Families planned the trip months in advance and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between $150–$200 per person. As the trail matured, additional costs for ferries and toll roads were thought to have been about $30 per wagon.|$|E

500|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{received}} a public backlash on Twitter after the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) recommended {{that they should}} cull three red river hog piglets after an unplanned birth.

The zoo also came under criticism for plans to charge £20 <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>for</b> visitors to watch the necropsy of an animal. A OneKind spokesman criticised the idea, largely due to the timing of the event, which was scheduled to take place two months after the zoo announced a £2 million loss in profits, making the necropsy seem like a [...] "Money-making drive".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} {{geography}} on incidence of clinical episodes of malaria {{was investigated in}} a cohort of children enrolled in a longitudinal clinical trial of antimalarial therapy in Kampala, Uganda. Participant households and the boundaries of local swamps and streams were mapped and incidence of clinical malaria episodes was measured prospectively using passive surveillance during one year of follow-up. Of 316 cohort participants, 305 from 219 house-holds were followed {{for at least six}} weeks and were included in the analysis. Incidence of clinical malaria was highly variable, with no episodes occurring in 131 participants, and 367 new episodes of malaria diagnosed in the remaining 174 children. A gradient in incidence of clinical episodes of malaria was observed with distance of residence from a swamp (0. 41 episodes <b>per</b> <b>person</b> year <b>for</b> residence> 100 meters from a swamp increasing to 2. 22 episodes <b>per</b> <b>person</b> year <b>for</b> residence within a swamp), or a stream (0. 61 episodes <b>per</b> <b>person</b> year <b>for</b> residence 500 meters from a stream versus 1. 76 episodes <b>per</b> <b>person</b> year <b>for</b> residence 100 meters from a swamp.

40|$|Hedonic {{prices are}} {{estimated}} for {{summer and winter}} rentals for vacation houses located near a lake and ski-golf resort in rural western Maryland. Regressions for weekly rents are conditioned on house size, quality, and recreation features including lakefront proximity and ski-slope access. Percentage effects and marginal implicit prices indicate that access to recreation is reflected importantly in rental offers. Evaluated at the means, lakefront locations command a premium of $ 1, 100 – 1, 200 per week, and the premium for ski-slope access is $ 500 – 600 per week. Unit recreation values are about $ 18 <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>per</b> day <b>for</b> a lakefront location with a private dock and $ 7 <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>per</b> day <b>for</b> a ski-slope location.
