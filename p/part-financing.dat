Similarly, in Germany, Berthold Auerbach in his fictional work [...] "Das Landhausam Rhein" [...] aroused public opinion against slavery and the slave trade, and Heinrich Heine also spoke against slavery.

40|$|Invasive {{pests and}} {{diseases}} in trees impose {{a range of}} costs on society related to reductions in timber values, impacts on recreational opportunities and effects on forest biodiversity. These costs {{need to be considered}} when assessing control options and developing public policy. We investigate the preferences and willingness to pay of the UK general public for a range of forest disease control measures using a choice experiment with a sample of 605 people. Respondents were relatively well informed about general tree disease-related issues, such as causes and general measures to minimise the risk of disease spread. They were less knowledgeable about specific tree diseases, with Dutch elm disease and chalara ash dieback being the most well known. We find that disease control programmes in publicly-owned forests and forests owned by charitable trusts {{are more likely to be}} supported by the public than equivalent control programmes in privately-owned and/or commercial forests. The nature of scientific uncertainty about diseases does not affect peoples’ preferences for disease control measures significantly. Higher respondent income, greater ex-ante knowledge about tree diseases, and more frequent visits to forests are correlated with greater willingness to support publicly-funded tree disease control programmes in forests. Better knowledge about tree diseases also improves the clarity of respondents’ choices. We find a negative sentiment against some disease control measures, such as clear felling of a forest, and chemical or biocide spraying. We conclude that there is significant public support for <b>part-financing</b> forest disease control policies in the UK, but that this is conditional on forest ownership and the type of control measures used...|$|E
40|$|Main {{findings}} National {{policies and}} context A temporary Act relating to injection rooms ap- plies until 16 December 2009. On 31 October 2008, a consultation proposal was distributed {{in which it}} is proposed to make the Act permanent. The proposal means that {{it will be up to}} the indi - vidual municipalities to establish injection rooms as part of their overall services. It is proposed to discontinue the state grants that were available as <b>part-financing</b> during the trial period. The Regu - lations that have been issued will largely be con - tinued in their present form in order to enable the measure to be defined as a health service. In October 2007, the Government presented an action plan to the Storting (Parliament) for the drugs and alcohol field. It includes goals and me - asures for prevention, treatment and rehabilita - tion and entails a gradual escalation of funding in this field in the period up until 2010. The plan includes alcohol and drugs policy as well as na - tional and international measures. The plan aims for a policy with a clear public health perspecti - ve. The aim is to raise professional standards through research and by strengthening compe - tence and quality. As regards services, the princi - ple is that the ordinary services should also be available to people with drug or alcohol pro - blems.

40|$|Artikkeli perustuu HY:n taloustieteen laitoksella esitettyyn pro gradu -tutkielmaan maatalouspolitiikan oppiaineessa. Tutkimuksen ohjaajana on toiminut professori Jukka Kola. The {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the shaping of the rural policy in Finland and in the European Union as well as the foundations, preparation, and financing of the development programmes for rural areas in broad outline. In Finland the rural policy proper started in connection with the Vital countryside project launched by the Council of Europe in 1987. The regional and rural policies became programme-based {{as a result of the}} Act on Regional Development, which came into effect in the beginning of 1994, and in this connection the regional development work was harmonised with the European practices. The rural policy of the EU is implemented, in particular, through Objective 5 b, but Objectives 1 and 6 also contain, in addition to other measures, an extensive development package for rural areas. The financing from the EU is mainly <b>part-financing,</b> which means that national, both public and private funding must be tied to the project. The planning and implementation of the development measures of the regional and structural policy of the EU are based on the principles of centralisation, complementing, cooperation, and programme-basis. According to the subsidiarity principle, the Finnish programmes have been prepared in cooperation between the national and local authorities. The provincial associations consisting of municipalities represent the local authorities, and these were responsible for the preparation of the programmes for each province, together with other interest groups in the region in question. In cooperation between the different ministries the programmes for individual provinces were then put together into national skeleton programmes under the Ministry of the Interior, and the Commission made the final documents of the Finnish programmes on the basis of these. The follow-up committee consisting mainly of representatives from the member state and the Commission have the overall responsibility for the implementation of the programme in question. In Finland the follow-up committees are assisted by joint work groups of the provinces. vMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{assesses the}} impact of user charges {{in the context of}} consumer choice to ascertain how user charges in healthcare impact on patient behaviour in Ireland. Quantitative data is collected from a subset of the population in walk-in Urgent Care Clinics and General Practitioner surgeries to assess their responses to user charges and whether user charges are a viable source of part-funding healthcare in Ireland. Examining the economic theories of Becker (1965) and Grossman (1972), the research has assessed {{the impact of}} user charges on patient choice in terms of affordability and accessibility in healthcare. The research examined a number of private, public and part-publicly funded healthcare services in Ireland for which varying levels of user charges exist depending on patients’ healthcare cover. Firstly, the study identifies the factors affecting patient choice of privately funded walk-in Urgent Care Clinics in Ireland given user charges. Secondly, the study assesses patient response to user charges for a mainly public or part-publicly provided service; prescription drugs. Finally, the study examines patients’ attitudes towards the potential application of user charges for both public and private healthcare services when patient choice is part of a time-money trade-off, convenience choice or preference choice. These services are valued in the context of user charges becoming more prevalent in healthcare systems over time. The results indicate that the impact of user charges on healthcare services vary according to socio-economic status. The study shows that user charges can disproportionately affect lower income groups and consequently lead to affordability and accessibility issues. However, when valuing the potential application of user charges for three healthcare services (MRI scans, blood tests and a branded over a generic prescription drug), this research indicates that lower income individuals {{are willing to pay for}} healthcare services, albeit at a lower user charge than higher income earners. Consequently, this study suggests that user charges may be a feasible source of <b>part-financing</b> Irish healthcare, once the user charge is determined from the patients’ perspective, taking into account their ability to pay...|$|E
