5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the storm, the hardest hit {{residents}} faced food shortages and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing food shortages. In response, the World Food Programme and other agencies of the United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000people in the region over three months, providing about 5,900tons of food. In the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and <b>potatoes</b> <b>to</b> compensate for the damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.|$|E
5|$|Its first {{association}} with the potato plant (Solanum tuberosum) was not made until about 1859 when it began destroying potato crops {{in the region of}} Omaha, Nebraska. Its spread eastward was rapid, at an average distance of 140km per year. By 1874 it had reached the Atlantic Coast. From 1871, the American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley warned Europeans about the potential for an accidental infestation caused by the transportation of the beetle from America. From 1875, several western European countries, including Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland, banned imports of American <b>potatoes</b> <b>to</b> avoid infestation by L. decemlineata.|$|E

25|$|Potatoes are {{generally}} grown from seed potatoes – these are tubers specifically grown to be disease free and provide consistent and healthy plants. To be disease free, {{the areas where}} seed potatoes are grown are selected with care. In the USA this restricts production of seed <b>potatoes</b> <b>to</b> only 15 states out of the 50 states that grow potatoes. These locations are selected for their cold hard winters that kill pests and long sunshine hours in the summer for optimum growth. In the UK, most seed potatoes originate in Scotland in areas where westerly winds prevent aphid attack and thus prevent spread of potato virus pathogens.|$|E
25|$|As April 1586 passed, {{there was}} no sign of Grenville's relief fleet. Meanwhile, in June, bad blood {{resulted}} from the destruction of the village, and this spurred an attack on the fort by the local Native Americans, which the colonists were able to repel. Soon after the attack, Sir Francis Drake was on his way home from a successful raid in the Caribbean, and he stopped at the colony and offered to take the colonists back to England. Several accepted, including metallurgist Joachim Gans. On this return voyage, the Roanoke colonists introduced tobacco, maize, and <b>potatoes</b> <b>to</b> England. The relief fleet arrived shortly after Drake's departure with the colonists. Finding the colony abandoned, Grenville returned to England with the bulk of his force, leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh's claim to Roanoke Island.|$|E

2500|$|In 1844, Irish {{newspapers}} carried reports {{concerning a}} disease which {{for two years}} had attacked the potato crops in America. A likely source was the eastern United States, where in 1843 and 1844 blight largely destroyed the potato crops. Ships from Baltimore, Philadelphia, or New York City could have brought diseased <b>potatoes</b> <b>to</b> European ports. W. C. Paddock [...] posited that it was transported on potatoes being carried to feed passengers on clipper ships sailing from America to Ireland. Once introduced, it spread rapidly. By mid-August 1845, it had reached much of northern and central Europe; Belgium, The Netherlands, northern France, and southern England had all been stricken.|$|E

2500|$|The rate of ageing varies {{substantially}} {{across different}} species, and this, {{to a large}} extent, is genetically based. For example, numerous perennial plants ranging from strawberries and <b>potatoes</b> <b>to</b> willow trees typically produce clones of themselves by vegetative reproduction and are thus potentially immortal, while annual plants such as wheat and watermelons die each year and reproduce by sexual reproduction. In 2008 {{it was discovered that}} inactivation of only two genes in the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana leads to its conversion into a potentially immortal perennial plant. The oldest animals known so far are 15,000-year-old Antarctic sponges, which can reproduce both sexually and clonally.|$|E

He allowed the parish to store coal and <b>potatoes</b> <b>to</b> distribute to the poor during the 13-week frost.

30|$|In our study, {{the control}} group gained the highest body weight, and it likely {{decreases}} slightly with the increasing potato meal, even though the feed intake increases with the potato meal ratio. It {{might be due to}} poor nutrient utilization of potato meal. Some reported results in the literature suggested that the inclusion of sweet potato meal in broiler ration causes poor utilization of nutrient compared with maize-based diets [16, 25], thus leading to a lower body weight gain of bird. This might be responsible for the inversely linear fashion body weight gain with the amount of sweet potato meal [3]. In contrast, some other studies, with feeding 25 % <b>potato</b> <b>to</b> starter birds [18], 50 % sweet <b>potato</b> <b>to</b> broiler starter [9], 36 and 45 % sweet <b>potato</b> <b>to</b> starter and finisher birds, respectively [3, 26], reported that either potato or sweet potato in diets did not affect the body weight gain, food conversion ratio, or mortality percentages. Furthermore, we have found that dietary treatments have no notable effects on the dressing percentage and the weights of other carcass components, such as breast, thigh, drumstick, wing etc., except abdominal fat (P <  0.01). These results are in agreement with those in the reported literature [18] on dried-cooked potato meal diets up to 35 %.|$|R
