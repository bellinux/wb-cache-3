50|$|After {{falling for}} the false {{promises}} of the womanising nobleman Suprapto (Rd Mochtar), Wenangish (Sofia WD) commits suicide by throwing {{herself into the}} Solo River, leaving only a letter for her two children, Sriwulan (Ratna Ruthinah) and Hindrawati (Churiani). The former is raised by the family of nobleman Widagdo (Rd Dadang Ismail), while the latter is raised by a <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> named Kromo (<b>S</b> Waldy), eventually becoming a servant at Widagdo's home. When they are adults, Sriwulan is engaged by her adoptive father to Suprapto's son, despite loving another man. When her hitherto unknown uncle, Prawoto (Mohamad Mochtar), returns from his job in Borneo, he prevents the two from marrying, instead showing that they were both fathered by Suprapto. The marriage is cancelled, and Suprapto - seeing a vision of Wenangish, beckoning him - commits suicide by jumping into the river.|$|R
