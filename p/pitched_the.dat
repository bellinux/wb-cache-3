5|$|Crytek then <b>pitched</b> <b>the</b> game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company <b>pitched</b> <b>the</b> two projects to Microsoft. According to Nick Button-Brown, {{the general manager}} at Crytek, the game was not functional at that time, and only served {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game was fun for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 was lacking a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, they accepted to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed that the project would be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E

30|$|Mean <b>pitch</b> of <b>the</b> melody: We {{restrict}} the minimum and maximum allowed <b>pitches</b> for <b>the</b> melody to <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> range of <b>the</b> three considered instruments which is from E 3 (165 Hz) to A 6 (1047 Hz). For the experimental design, we define two levels.

Afterwards, we apply the following mechanism to prevent unnatural <b>pitches</b> w.r.t. <b>the</b> instruments. If <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> of one tone violates <b>the</b> allowed <b>pitch</b> range, <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> of all tones within the considered song extract is shifted until all pitches are valid.|$|R
