It {{was first used}} in a human patient by Dr. Ronald Colapinto, of the University of Toronto, in 1982, but did not become reproducibly successful until the development of endovascular stents in 1985. In 1988 the first successful TIPS was realized by M. Rössle, G.M. Richter, G. Nöldge and J. Palmaz at the University of Freiburg. The procedure has since become widely accepted as the preferred method for treating portal hypertension that is refractory to medical therapy, replacing the surgical <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt</b> in that role.|$|E
50|$|A {{minority}} of patients {{can be treated}} medically with sodium restriction, diuretics to control ascites, anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin, and general symptomatic management. The majority of patients require further intervention. Milder forms of Budd-Chiari may be treated with surgical shunts to divert blood flow around the obstruction or the liver itself. Shunts must be placed early after diagnosis for best results. The TIPS {{is similar to a}} surgical shunt: it accomplishes the same goal but has a lower procedure-related mortality—a factor that has led to a growth in its popularity. If all the hepatic veins are blocked, the portal vein can be approached via the intrahepatic part of inferior vena cava, a procedure called DIPS (direct intrahepatic <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt).</b> Patients with stenosis or vena caval obstruction may benefit from angioplasty. Limited studies on thrombolysis with direct infusion of urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator into the obstructed vein have shown moderate success in treating Budd-Chiari syndrome; however, it is not routinely attempted.|$|E

Etiologies of these three patients were as follows: PNF after liver transplantation, ischemic hepatitis after right hepatic artery embolization, and massive reperfusion syndrome during a liver transplantation. In the fourth patient, during the liver transplantation when hepatic artery was ligated, a kidney carcinoma in the donor graft was discovered. We decided to complete the hepatectomy and to construct a temporary <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt.</b> Mean anhepatic phases were 19 h and 15 min. All patients survived the two-stage liver transplantation procedure without major complications.

40|$|<b>Portocaval</b> <b>shunting</b> is {{recommended}} for decrease of the portal pressure and regression of the varicose veins in patients with cirrhosis. But the shunting surgery at cirrhosis {{is limited by the}} high risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy and the hepatocellular insufficiency in post-surgical period. And the disorder of the hepatic and splanchnic hemodynamics that inevitably appears at different dates after surgery is considered as the main cause of these states. Aim of research. To assess an influence of the shunting surgical interventions on the character of changes of splanchnic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis in comparison with no-operated patients with compensated and decompensated course of disease. Material and methods. 190 patients with cirrhosis were examined: 133 had gastrointestinal bleeding, 57 – diuretic-resistant ascites. 18 patients underwent surgery – <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunting.</b> 84 patients died during observation (10 after surgery). The duration of observation was from 2 - 3 weeks to 2, 5 - 3 years. All patients underwent the repeated ultrasound examination of abdominal cavity. There were defined the diameter of hepatic and splenic vessels; quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the blood flow in hepatic and splenic arteries, in portal and splenic veins.   Results of research. At assessment of splanchnic hemodynamics we noticed the differences of parameters depending on time that passed after surgery. The changes of portal blood flow in first 3 - 6 month were characterized by the moderate widening of portal and splenic veins at little decrease of its mean linear and volume speed so an inflow of the portal blood still stable. Arterial blood flow in hepatic artery was forced at the expense of both widening of diameter and increase of the mean speed of blood flow. The splenic arterial blood flow practically was not changed.    The reliable decrease of the volume blood flow in portal vein at the expense of decrease of its linear speed was observed in all patients at later dates. An unfavorable sign was an increase of an index of haemostasia in portal vein and of splenic and hepatic portal index in dynamics that took place in all operated patients and in no-operated ones at the stage of decompensation. Conclusions. The character of changes of splanchnic hemodynamics after <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunting</b> is analogous to the one in no-operated patients at transition from the compensated course of cirrhosis to decompensated one. The compensatory mechanism that preserves the volume of the portal inflow to liver is the widening of the portal vein and preservation of the splenic blood flow. The quality of life in post-surgical period is determined by the duration of compensation of hemodynamic disorders</p...|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of selective transplenic decompression of oesophageal varices by distal splenorenal shunt and splenocaval shunt was evaluated {{in the control}} of gastrointestinal haemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension of varied aetiology. (Decompression was successful in 69 out of 78 cases.) It was shown that it is superior to total portosystemic shunts, as the incidence of encephalopathy was very low compared with the data from our series of portocaval shunts. The operative mortality has been progressively lowered and has now reached levels comparable with <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt.</b> Distal splenorenal shunt when performed as an emergency procedure to arrest bleeding has limited usefulness but when performed as an elective or prophylactic procedure its results are comparable with those of <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt</b> without the untoward complications such as encephalopathy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{original}} {{method of}} liver transplantation (LT) included recipient inferior vena cava (IVC) resection {{and the use}} of extracorporeal venovenous bypass (VVB). Refinements in technique permit transplantation to be done with IVC preservation and without VVB use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between November 1993 and November 2000, 202 consecutive grafts were performed in 188 adults (>/= 16 years of age). Twelve patients (6. 4 %) received two and three retransplants (re-LT). Split grafting was performed 19 times (19 of 202 grafts, 9. 4 %). Risk factors included United Network of Organ Sharing status I (n= 30, 16 %), previous right upper abdominal surgery (n= 32, 17. 1 %), caudate lobe encirclement of IVC (n= 65, 32. 2 %), IVC (n= 24, 11. 9 %), and splanchnic venous modification (n= 58, 30. 9 %), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (n= 34, 16. 8 %), giant (> 5 kg) liver tumor (n= 6, 3 %), septic necrosis of the caudate lobe (n= 1, 0. 5 %), and previous cavocaval (n= 13, 6. 4 %) or classical LT (n= 5, 2. 5 %). RESULTS: IVC preservation, avoidance of IVC cross clamping and of VVB use were possible in 98. 9 %, 93 %, and 99. 5 % of 183 primary LT and in 89. 5 %, 84. 2 %, and 89. 5 % of 19 re-LT. Temporary <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunting</b> was never applied. Perioperative mortality was 1. 2 %. There was no allotransfusion in 73 (36 %) grafts and 45 (22 %) patients were immediately extubated. Permanent hepatic vein and caval problems were encountered in three (1. 5 %) grafts. One patient needed stent placement to treat IVC stenosis. Actual 3 - and 12 -month patient survival for whole, re-LT, and right-lobe split LT groups were 94. 7 %, 94. 1 %, 94. 7 %, 88. 2 %, 94. 1 %, and 89 %.

40|$|End-to-side <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunts</b> (PCS) were {{constructed}} in six dogs {{to evaluate the}} effect of complete portal blood flow diversion on hepatocellular structure and function, hepatic reticuloendothelial (RE) activity, and serum opsonic activity (OA). RE activity remained normal after PCS despite a 40 % reduction in estimated hepatic blood flow. Tissue distribution of injected colloid shifted away from liver to spleen, lung, and bone marrow. OA decreased to 40 % of baseline values 6 weeks after PCS and remained low. Postshunt changes in hepatic morphology primarily affected hepatocytes and included deglycogenation and loss of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Significant changes in Kupffer cell morphology were not observed. Complete portal flow diversion in the dog caused profound alterations in hepatocellular structure and function without compromising Kupffer cell phagocytic and metabolic activity. Kupffer cells may be less dependent than hepatocytes upon hepatotrophic factors contained in portal blood. OA did not correlate with changes in vascular lipid clearance, suggesting that either phagocytosis of RES test lipid in the dog is not dependent on prior opsonization, or that the assay used was neither sensitive nor specific enough to measure a critical opsonic threshold required for effective phagocytosis...|$|R

The transducer was then sequentially repositioned to visualize the portal vein, the caudal vena cava, and the right atrium through different acoustic windows. It was possible to differentiate between intrahepatic and extrahepatic shunts depending on the entry point of the microbubbles into the caudal vena cava. Portoazygos <b>shunts</b> and <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunts</b> could be differentiated based {{on the presence of}} microbubbles in the caudal vena cava and/or the right atrium.

All abnormal vessels were confirmed by exploratory laparotomy or with ultrasonographic identification of the shunting vessel.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the benefit of}} arterialisation of the portal vein {{in conjunction with a}} therapeutic end-to-side <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt,</b> a prospective randomised study, was started in december 1979 comparing these two techniques in Child A and B cirrhotic patients with a hepatopedal portal flow of at least 100 ml per min. Sixty-four patients were included in the study: 33 were submitted to <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt</b> (NART) and 31 were arterialised (ART). The two groups of patients were similar for clinical and haemodynamic parameters. Arterialisation lowered the operative mortality for the whole group (ART: 6. 5 %, NART: 12 %) and in high risk patients; Child class B patients (ART: 0 %, NART: 22 %) and emergency operation (ART: 0 %, NART: 17 %) but the difference is not statistically significant. Postoperative ascites was more frequent in arterialised patients (ART: 45 %, NART: 18 %; p = 0. 02), with an increased need for reoperation (ART: 26 %, NART: 6 %; p < 0, 05). The mean follow-up time was 56, 9 +/- 28, 1 months (SD) for the 58 surviving patients. The five-year actuarial survival rate was 68 % for ART patients and 60, 6 % for NART patients (NS). In Child B patients the five-year actuarial survival rate was 75 % in ART patients and 22 % in NART patients (p < 0, 05).

We have investigated the effects of blood from the pancreas and intestine in liver activation and lung inflammation during early stages of experimental acute pancreatitis in a rat model. A portosystemic shunt and a mesosystemic shunt were created to prevent the passage of blood coming from the pancreas and the intestine, respectively, to the liver. Pancreatitis was induced by retrograde injection of 5 % sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct. After 3 hours, the inflammatory process in the lung and intestine, plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and their soluble receptor, and mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators in the lung were evaluated. <b>Portocaval</b> <b>shunting</b> of blood prevented the inflammatory process in the lung, an increase in plasma TNF-α concentration, and the expression of TNF-α, interleukin (IL) - 1 β, and heat-shock protein (HSP) - 72 in the lung, but had no effect on plasma levels of soluble TNF-α receptor or on expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 2 in the lung.

40|$|A {{significant}} (p < 0. 001) {{difference was}} found in the rate of ammonia forma-tion and theamountformed in heparinized dogand human blood at 4 #{ 176 }C. The initial ammonia concentration and the increase in ammonia formation with time were correlated for human blood. This in vitro ammonia formation was not prevented by certain enzyme inhibitors, but it continued after cells and plasma were exhaustively dialyzed against water or saline, sug-gesting that it originates from enzyme action. BLOOD AMMONIA CONCENTRATION increases rap-idly during storage. While studying ammonia metabolism in man and dogs (1, 2), we noticed that the blood ammonia concentration of dogs did not increase as rapidly on storage as did that of human blood. Whemi large amounts of blood are used during blood transfusions the concentration of ammonia in such blood can be critical, especially in patients with cirrhosis undergoing <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunts.</b> The cause of increase in ammonia during storage is not explained. Tobe (3) showed that the concen-tration of ammonia in shed whole blood steadily and spontaneously increased, and that the maxi-mum amount of ammonia was formed after seven days. Both plasma and erythrocytes contributed to this formation. There are compounds present in both plasma and erythrocytes that increase anirnonia in stored blood (4), possibly adenine and adenylic acid derivatives. The addition of a small amount of zinc bromide partially prevented this ammonia in-crease. Itin (5) presented evidence that the ammonia level in blood increased on storage to as much as 790 Mg/i 00 ml. They also indicated that blood transfusions were accompanied by an in-crease in the concentration of ammonia in patient sera.

40|$|Background and Objective: Rapidly {{establishing}} {{the cause of}} neonatal cholestasis is an urgent matter. The {{aim of this study}} was to report on the prevalence and mortality of the diverse disorders causing neonatal cholestasis in an academic center in Germany. Methods: Clinical chemistry and cause of disease were retrospectively analyzed in 82 infants (male n= 42, 51 %) that had presented with neonatal cholestasis to a tertiary medical center from January 2009 to April 2013. Results: Altogether, 19 disorders causing neonatal cholestasis were identified. Biliary atresia was the most common diagnosis (41 %), followed by idiopathic cases (13 %), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC, 10 %) and cholestasis secondary to total parenteral nutrition in preterm infants that was mediated by total parenteral nutrition (10 %), α 1 AT deficiency, Alagille syndrome, <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunts,</b> mitochondriopathy, biliary sludge (all 2 %) and others. Infants with biliary atresia were diagnosed with a mean age of 62 days, they underwent Kasai portoenterostomy ∼ 66 days after birth. The majority of these children (∼ 70 %) received surgery within 10 weeks of age and 27 % before 60 days. The two-year survival with their native liver after Kasai procedure was 12 %. The time span between Kasai surgery and liver transplantation was 176 ± 73 days. Six children (7 %), of whom 3 patients had syndromic and 1 nonsyndromic biliary atresia, died prior to liver transplantation. The pre- and posttransplant mortality rate for children with biliary atresia was ∼ 12 % and ∼ 17 %, respectively. Conclusion: Neonatal cholestasis is a severe threat associated with a high risk of complications in infancy and it thefore requires urgent investigation in order to initiate life saving therapy. Although in the last twenty years new causes such as the PFICs have been identifyed and newer diagnostic tools have been introduced into the clinical routine biliary atresia still represents the major cause...|$|R

Few neuroimaging studies of this condition, which affects the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, have been performed. We present a patient whose symptomatology correlates with MR abnormalities of the basal gan-glia, a finding not previously described. Case Report A 66 -year-old woman had a 3 -year history of progressive incapa-citating tremor of the limbs, speech difficulties, and involuntary oro-facial movements. Chronic hepatitis (positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen) had been diagnosed when she was 47 years old. When she was 58, she had her first attack of hepatic encephalopathy. Ten more episodes occurred in the following years {{before the onset of}} fixed neurologic symptoms. On repeated examinations, she had a normal mental status, choreic movements of the face and neck, a coarse dysarthria, mild hypokinesia, a large-amplitude postural and action tremor of the limbs, and truncal ataxia. Muscular tone was normal; reflexes were brisk, but plantar responses were flexor. No Kayser-Fleischer rings were present. Liver function tests were altered, but other blood studies, including levels of copper and ceruloplasmin, were normal. CT of the head (Fig. 1 A) showed mild cortical atrophy.

On T 2 -weighted images, 2000 f 40 f 90, the same area again showed abnormal signal hyperin-tensity relative to the brain on the early-echo sequence (Fig. 1 C) that faded in the later echo (Fig. 1 D). No signal abnormalities were found in the cerebellum...|$|R
40|$|A {{decreased}} {{ratio of}} branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) to aromatic amino acids (AAA) {{is considered an}} important pathogenetic factor in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). A relationship between the deranged BCAA/AAA ratio and dopaminergic dysfunction through the formation of "false" neurotransmitters has been postulated. The intermediate lobe of the pituitary is more pronounced in dogs than in humans {{and because it is}} primarily under dopaminergic inhibitory influence, it may serve as an indicator of alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission. We investigated the effects of a diet with a high BCAA/AAA ratio (HR) and an isonitrogenous diet with a low BCAA/AAA ratio (LR) on several physical and biochemical parameters including pituitary function in dogs with <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunts</b> and 40 % hepatectomy and in sham-operated pair-fed controls, in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study. Portocaval-shunted dogs had hyperammonemia (33 +/- 3 microM (mean +/- SEM) before and 214 +/- 21 after surgery)) and signs of HE. Their BCAA/AAA ratio in plasma and CSF decreased from 4. 3 +/- 0. 3 and 2. 3 +/- 0. 3 before surgery to 1. 3 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 5 +/- 0. 1 after surgery, respectively. These parameters remained unaltered in the control dogs. The consumption of the LR diet was significantly higher than consumption of the HR diet. In the portocaval-shunted dogs, plasma ammonia concentration was higher on the HR diet than on the LR diet (344 +/- 52 v 246 +/- 45) and the HE grade was worse. The BCAA/AAA ratio remained abnormal in HE dogs during the feeding of both diets. The basal and haloperidol-stimulated release of alpha-melanotropin and cortisol in plasma were not significantly different between or within groups during any period. In contrast, urinary cortisol excretion was increased in the HE dogs after surgery (urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio (x 10 (- 6)) 8. 5 +/- 1. 4 before and 30. 4 +/- 8. 9 after surgery). The basal plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropin in HE dogs was decreased after surgery (68. 3 +/- 10. 2 ng/L before and 40. 8 +/- 4. 4 after surgery). This indicates a non-pituitary-dependent hyperresponsiveness of the adrenals. We conclude from these results that chronic HE in dogs is not associated with an abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission at least {{at the level of the}} pituitary, and that it is not the content of the dietary neutral amino acids but rather the total protein intake that may have a beneficial effect on H...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{describes}} the experience with a bridging procedure for a prolonged anhepatic period during clinical liver transplantation in case of special emergency situations. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hepatic necrosis due to fulminant hepatitis or acute graft failure, as well as severe liver trauma are well-known and accepted indications for urgent liver transplantation. Prerequisite is the allocation of a suitable donor organ. If no allograft is available in time, patients with "toxic liver syndrome" or exsanguinating hemorrhage {{have been shown to}} benefit from advanced total hepatectomy. METHODS: As a modification of the standard one-stage procedure, recipient hepatectomy and subsequent liver transplantation are performed in two separate operations. To bridge the prolonged anhepatic period and to allow decompression and return of venous blood, an end-to-side <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt</b> is constructed temporarily. RESULTS: Thirteen of thirty-two patients underwent hepatectomy but not transplantation subsequently, and died within 34 hours after progressive deterioration. In 19 of 32 patients, transplantation was realized 6 - 41 hours after hepatectomy; 9 of 19 patients died, mostly from sepsis. Ten of nineteen liver recipients survived the procedure including three unrelated late deaths; presently, seven patients are alive with a follow-up of 3 to 46 months. CONCLUSIONS: Two-stage total hepatectomy with temporary <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt,</b> and subsequent liver transplantation can be a life-saving approach in patients most likely to die of the sequelae of advanced liver or graft necrosis or exsanguination that cannot be controlled by conventional treatment or immediate liver transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Review {{the safety}} and {{long-term}} success with portosystemic shunts in children at a single institution. Methods. An IRB-approved, retrospective chart review of all children ages 19 and undergoing surgical portosystemic shunt from January 1990 &#x 2013;September 2008. Results. Ten patients were identified, 8 females and 2 males, {{with a mean age}} of 15 years (range 5 &# 8211; 19 years). Primary diagnoses were congenital hepatic fibrosis (5), hepatic vein thrombosis (2), portal vein thrombosis (2), and cystic fibrosis (1). Primary indications were repeated variceal bleeding (6), symptomatic hypersplenism (2), and significant liver dysfunction (2). Procedures performed were distal splenorenal bypass (4), side-to-side <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt</b> (3), proximal splenorenal shunt (2), and an interposition H-graft <b>portocaval</b> <b>shunt</b> (1). There was no perioperative mortality and only minor morbidity. Seventy percent of patients had improvement of their symptoms. Eighty percent of shunts remained patent. Two were occluded at a median follow-up of 50 months (range 0. 5 &# 8211; 13. 16 years). Two patients underwent subsequent liver transplantation. Two patients died at 0. 5 and 12. 8 years postoperatively, one from multisystem failure with cystic fibrosis and one from post-operative transplant complications. Conclusions. The need for portosystemic shunts in children is rare. However, in the era of liver transplantation, portosystemic shunts in selected patients with well-preserved liver function remains important. We conclude that portosystemic shunts are safe and efficacious in the control of variceal hemorrhage and symptoms related to hypersplenism...|$|E
40|$|Separating {{operations}} are recommended for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding from varicose veins of gullet {{as a result}} of <b>portocaval</b> (azygoportal) <b>shunting</b> at cirrhosis and directed to its elimination using azygoportal separation. At the same time the frequency of relapse of bleeding after operations remains rather high. And the formation of new varicose nodi {{as a result of}} disorder of hepatic and splanchnic hemodynamics that inevitably appears at different dates after operation is considered as the main cause of it. At the same time an assessment of hemodynamic changes after azygoportal separation is interpreted in different ways by different authors. Aim of research. To assess an influence of separating surgical interventions on the character of changes of splanchnic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis in comparison with non-operated patients with compensated and decompensated clinical course. Material and methods. There were examined 190 patients with cirrhosis: in 133 took place gastrointestinal bleeding from varicose veins of gullet, in 57 – diuretic resistant ascites. 16 patients underwent separating operations. 20 patients underwent endoscopic sclerotherapy of gullet veins. 84 patients died during observation (7 after surgical treatment). Duration of observation was from 2 - 3 weeks to 2, 5 - 3 years. All patients underwent the repeated ultrasound of abdominal cavity. There were assessed diameter of hepatic and splenic vessels; quantitative and qualitative characteristics of blood flow in hepatic and splenic arteries, portal and splenic veins. Results of research. At assessment of splanchnic hemodynamics the changes of portal blood flow in first months after operation characterized with moderate dilation of portal vein and decrease of linear speed in it. At the same time the volumetric blood flow did not essentially change. It was noticed the decrease of volumetric blood flow in splenic vein at the expense of constriction of its lumen and decrease of linear speed in it. Arterial blood flow characterized with decrease of inflow to liver through hepatic artery and increase of blood flow through splenic artery. At later dates the character of changes of splanchnic hemodynamics after azygoportal separation was analogous on all indicators to non-operated patients at transfer from compensated to decompensated course of cirrhosis – decrease of blood flow through the portal vein and hepatic artery at relative increase of splenic blood flow. An increase of index of stagnation in the portal vein and splenic-hepatic portal index that took place in all operated patients and non-operated ones at the stage of decompensation was an unfavorable prognostic indication. Conclusion. The character of changes of splanchnic hemodynamics after gastroesophageal separation is analogous to non-operated patients at transfer from compensated course of cirrhosis to decompensated one. Decrease of the portal blood inflow through the splenic vein is a compensatory mechanism that must decrease the portal pressure. The quality of life in postsurgical period is determined by duration of compensation of hemodynamic disorders</p...|$|R
