5|$|Raimi {{convinced}} a local theater manager to screen the film alongside The Rocky Horror <b>Picture</b> <b>Show</b> which sparked minor interest. Initially a meager success, the film screened well to test audiences and inspired a larger budget remake directed by Raimi, called The Evil Dead (1981). The film {{was the first}} in the Evil Dead franchise, and launched the careers of both Campbell and Raimi. Several of the aesthetic qualities found in Within the Woods later defined Raimi's films.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{cartoonist}} Antonucci was {{dared to}} create a children's cartoon; while designing a commercial, he conceived Ed, Edd n Eddy, designing it to resemble classic cartoons from the 1940s–1970s. He pitched the series to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, but the latter demanded creative control, leading to him making {{a deal with the}} former and the series premiering on January 4, 1999. During the show's run, several specials and shorts were produced in addition to the regular television series. The series concluded with a TV movie, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big <b>Picture</b> <b>Show,</b> on November 8, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} Eds, the other {{cul-de-sac}} kids, and the Kanker Sisters, no other characters {{appeared in the}} series until the fifth season, when the silhouettes of other people were occasionally shown, and in one episode the arms of Eddy's father and Ed's mother were seen.

5|$|At the Tiffany Theatre, the {{audience}} performance cast had the theater's full cooperation; the local performers entered early and without charge. The fan playing Frank for this theatre was a transgender performer, D. Garret Gafford, {{who was out}} of work in 1978 and trying to raise the funds for a gender reassignment while spending the weekends performing at the Tiffany.. Presently, The live action rendition of The Rocky Horror <b>Picture</b> <b>Show</b> is available for attendance in various locations in Los Angeles, typically Saturday nights at Midnight.|$|E
5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last <b>Picture</b> <b>Show</b> (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going to}} get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album {{to sound like a}} soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last <b>Picture</b> <b>Show,</b> and Vivre sa vie.|$|E

5|$|In 1971 Peter Bogdanovich, {{with whom}} Fields {{had worked on}} Targets, {{recruited}} her to edit What's Up, Doc? (1972); Bogdanovich had edited his previous films himself. The film was very successful, and is now considered as the second of Bogdanovich's 'golden period' that commenced with The Last <b>Picture</b> <b>Show</b> (1971). What's Up, Doc? established Fields as an editor on studio films. She subsequently edited Bogdanovich's final golden period film, Paper Moon (1973), {{as well as his}} less successful film Daisy Miller (1974).|$|E
5|$|Paul Oscar rediscovered {{his voice}} {{at the age of}} 18, singing bass with the Hamrahlíð college choir for two years. In 1990 he won a talent contest for his college; later that year {{at the time of his}} graduation, he played Frank-N-Furter to great success in the college's {{production}} of The Rocky Horror <b>Picture</b> <b>Show.</b> Around the same time, he began appearing in drag shows at a notorious Reykjavík nightclub. After the club closed, he became a radio jockey on independent radio station FM 90,9. He also appeared in a film, Svo á jörðu sem á himni (As in Heaven, 1992).|$|E
5|$|Rae is not {{included}} in Max Germaine's Dictionary of Women Artists in Australia, Caroline Ambrus's The Ladies' <b>Picture</b> <b>Show,</b> or Helen Topliss's Modernism and Feminism: Australian Women Artists 1900–1940.

5|$|The 300-seat {{theater was}} {{designed}} by Charles A. Duke in 1913 and opened in 1915 as The Clinton. Its main entrance faced 26th Avenue until 1922. The venue {{became known as the}} 26th Avenue Theatre in 1945 and the Encore in 1969, before reverting to a variation of its original name on May 30, 1975. At that time, a five-person collective bought the theater. The movie house had been showing X-rated films, which the collective replaced {{with a wide variety of}} movies including foreign films, The Rocky Horror <b>Picture</b> <b>Show,</b> and older films like The African Queen.|$|E
5|$|The Rocky Horror <b>Picture</b> <b>Show</b> {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} other feature films and television series over the years.

5|$|Will {{learns that}} Emma and Carl {{attended}} a midnight screening of The Rocky Horror <b>Picture</b> <b>Show,</b> which helped to lessen {{some of her}} obsessive–compulsive behaviors. As Emma is a fan, Will decides to direct the glee club in a production of the musical, casting co-captains Finn Hudson and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) in the lead roles of Brad and Janet, Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) as Dr. Frank N. Furter, and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) as Rocky. While Sam is proud of his physique and secure in his own body-image, Finn feels self-conscious {{at the prospect of}} appearing in his underwear, as the role necessitates.|$|E
5|$|Charlie is {{accepted}} by Sam and Patrick's {{group of friends}} and begins experimenting with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. At a party Charlie trips on LSD. He cannot control his flashbacks of Aunt Helen, {{who died in a}} car crash on her way to buy him a birthday gift. He ends up in the hospital after falling asleep in the snow. At a regular Rocky Horror <b>Picture</b> <b>Show</b> performance, Charlie is asked to fill in as Rocky for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who is unavailable. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks Charlie to the Sadie Hawkins dance and they enter into a desultory relationship. The relationship ends, however, during a game of truth or dare when Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. He kisses Sam, and Mary Elizabeth storms out of the room in response. Following this, Patrick suggests that Charlie stay away from Sam for a while, {{and the rest of the}} friend group shuns him. His flashbacks of Aunt Helen return.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror <b>Picture</b> <b>Show</b> (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E
