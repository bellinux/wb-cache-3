Cellular telephones can provide emergency coordinators the flexibility of wireless mobility in the field via the <b>Public</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>Network</b> (<b>PSN)</b> to coordinate emergency services. However, not all areas are covered by cellular service; existing cellular and PSN service availability could be limited by the congestion and competition for the dial tone that occurs in emergencies. It was realized that a critical need exists for a rapidly deployable stand-alone cellular capability coupled with alternate connectivity to bypass congested or damaged PSN links. Existing commercial Ku-band satellite communications have provided alternate routing links in some cases to support emergency communications. An emergency operational capability was conceived that integrates these technologies into a rapidly deployable and transportable package that provides both local and long distance telephone services to an area that has suffered widespread telecommunications outages or has been totally isolated from the world...|$|E

These segments will be received, saved in buffer and forwarded by other devices with time delay. As the time difference of arrival of these segments of a message is caused by delayed transmission and users' movements, not by the difference of geography distance, the adversary server is not able to utilize TDOA algorithm to localize the originator's real location.

40|$|Abstract—Distributed cluster {{detection}} {{has been}} widely applied {{to the problem of}} efficient data delivery in Pocket <b>Switched</b> <b>Networks</b> (<b>PSNs).</b> However, previously proposed methods can become less efficient {{over long periods of time}} as more and more transient, pair-wise connections are used to form clusters which monotonically increase in size. Monotonically increasing clusters, also known as aggregated clusters, suffer an inevitable loss of temporal information. Thus cluster relevance to individual movement patterns at particular times is diminished. This paper applies expectation-based spatio-temporal clustering to the problem of data delivery in PSNs. We will show that spatio-temporal clusters can be detected distributively and can improve the data delivery efficiency by 7 % and deliver 6 % more packets compared to aggregated methods. Furthermore, 3 data delivery strategies which utilise spatio-temporal clusters are proposed.

This work identifies a traffic engineering problem of prioritized circuit switched and packet switched (PSTN/PSN) traffic over the same shared medium as it may relate to "perceived" quality of service (QoS). A brief review of the evolution of models for communications traffic is presented. Models are then proposed and developed for the various traffic types being considered, which include voice, modem, and data. These models become the basis for running simulations using the OPNET Modeler simulation software package, modeling a prioritized shared medium with finite bandwidth under varying source and offered load conditions. Simulation results suggest that at high (but typical) concentration ratios, small numbers of data users could experience QoS degradation when combined with sufficient numbers of modem and/or voice users.
