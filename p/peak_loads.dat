5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity. A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power. According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle <b>peak</b> <b>loads,</b> as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} electrical grid, {{and local}} transformers in particular, {{may not have}} enough capacity to handle the additional power load that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume {{three times as much}} electricity as a typical home, overloading problems may arise when several vehicles in the same neighborhood recharge at the same time, or during the normal summer <b>peak</b> <b>loads.</b> To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid load is lower or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to recharge mostly overnight, when rates are lower.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The Ontario {{electrical}} grid is sized to meet <b>peak</b> electricity <b>load.</b> A reduction in <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> would allow deferring large infrastructural costs of additional power plants, thereby lowering generation cost and electricity prices. Proposed solutions for <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> reduction include demand response and storage. Both these solutions require accurate prediction of a home’s <b>peak</b> and mean <b>load.</b> Existing work has {{focused only on}} mean load prediction. We find that these methods exhibit high error when predicting <b>peak</b> <b>load.</b> Moreover, a home’s historic <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> and occupancy is a better predictor of <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> than observable physical characteristics such as temperature and season. We explore the use of Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARMA) for <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> prediction and find that it has 30 % lower {{root mean square error}} than best known prior methods.

A recent trend has developed whereby summer peak demand {{has grown to}} outpace winter <b>peak</b> <b>loads.</b> This is primarily the result of increasingly warm summer conditions.

25|$|The {{extent to}} which the intermittency of solar-generated {{electricity}} is an issue will depend on {{the degree to which the}} generation profile of solar corresponds to demand. For example, solar thermal power plants such as Nevada Solar One are somewhat matched to summer <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> in areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. Thermal energy storage systems like the small Spanish Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption. The improved capacity factor using thermal storage represents a decrease in maximum capacity, and extends the total time the system generates power.|$|E

Problems caused by <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> such as blackout and rolling blackout has occurred {{recently in the}} world because hourly <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> consumption is increased rapidly in the same time. So to solve these problems is using ESS. Especially, the most effective method is to utilize ESS and V 2 G. Electricity of the battery of parked PHEV at home area transmits through V 2 G to the ESS.

Thus hydro power stations are ending up to cater base <b>load</b> instead of <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> in non-monsoon months also (ex: Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, HP, J&K, Uttarakhand, etc.). TSO is responsible to ensure the provision of reserves (including spinning reserve for base load power plants by operating in frequency follow mode with upper & lower generation caps) that will allow for sudden contingencies by determining the optimal combination of generating stations and reserve providers for each grid trading period. The available hydro power stations in a region/grid {{should be used to}} cater peaking load only at regional/national level. Using hydro power stations to cater <b>peak</b> <b>load,</b> would improve the peaking load capability of a regional/national grid and maintain safe grid frequency and network stability. The 24 hours duration of a day should be divided into four parts only (i.e. daytime <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> period, daytime off <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> period, nighttime <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> period and nighttime off <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> period) instead of 96 number 15 minutes periods for commercially settling the power transactions to cater better to the <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> requirements within the safe frequency range.|$|R

25|$|PHEVs {{and fully}} {{electric}} cars may allow for more {{efficient use of}} existing electric production capacity, much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time. This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods (i.e., at night), or equipped with technology known as charge control to shut off charging during periods of peak demand. Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during <b>peak</b> <b>loads.</b> This is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technology. By using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power, such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities {{as well as their}} owners. Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime, and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure.|$|E

500|$|In {{stand alone}} PV systems {{batteries}} are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With grid-connected photovoltaic power system, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the electrical grid. Net metering and feed-in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. [...] Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually. When wind and solar are {{a small fraction of the}} grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. Batteries used for grid-storage stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.|$|E
