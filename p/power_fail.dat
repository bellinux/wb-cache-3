5000|$|Two major {{differences}} between UBIFS and JFFS2 are that UBIFS supports write caching, and UBIFS errs on the pessimistic side of free space calculation. UBIFS tends to perform better than JFFS2 for large NAND FLASH devices.

50|$|But 1959 was not {{all about}} action on the pitch. In this year the club became a Limited Company. But a more visible {{milestone}} was appearance of floodlighting at the Essella Road ground. The installation of the 'Do it Yourself' floodlighting was perhaps {{the best example of}} voluntary effort at the club. The self designed and installed system comprised eight 40 foot high towers each housing four 2,000 watt lamps. The total output was thus 64 kilowatts and had required an up-rated power supply to be laid to the ground. The overall cost was £1,507.10s.5d. It is reported that only once in their 28-year lifetime did the <b>power</b> <b>fail.</b> The lights were officially switched on with a Grand Opening Floodlight Game on Monday 19 October 1959 with First Division Chelsea the visitors. England forward and football legend Jimmy Greaves scored four goals in a 7-2 victory for the Londoners, with Ron Vigar and Gordon Burden netting for the home side.|$|E
5000|$|Legitimate {{power comes}} from an elected, selected, or {{appointed}} position of authority and may be underpinned by social norms. This power which means the ability to administer to another certain feelings of obligation or the notion of responsibility. [...] "Rewarding and Punishing subordinates is generally seen as a legitimate part of the formal or appointed leadership role and most managerial positions in work organizations carry with them, some degree of expected reward and punishment." [...] This type of formal power relies on position in an authority hierarchy. Occasionally, those possessing legitimate <b>power</b> <b>fail</b> to recognize they have it, and may begin to notice others going around them to accomplish their goals. Three bases of legitimate power are cultural values, acceptance of social structure, and designation. Cultural values comprise a general basis for legitimate power of one entity over another. Such legitimacy is conferred by others and this legitimacy can be revoked by the original granters, their designees, or their inheritors.|$|E

In a last effort to stop Morden, Cpt. Marco Rossi and Lt. Tarma Roving of the Peregrine Falcon Strike Force are sent to locate and eliminate his powerbase, as well as reclaim or destroy any Metal Slugs they can find so as to keep the technology out of Morden's hands. After battling their way through hordes of Morden's soldiers, the duo eventually face off against Morden himself, in a heavily armored helicopter. After defeating the helicopter and killing Morden, they destroy his base of operations. In an epilogue, one of Morden's men is shown throwing a paper airplane from a cliff face. As the credits roll, the plane flies across the various levels of the game, from the destroyed Metal Slugs on the forest and the city where a woman grieves for her slain lover who is a Rebel Army member before disappearing into outer space. If the game is completed using 2-players, the epilogue changes to show the rebel soldiers dancing around the various levels to a very upbeat tune. This time the paper plane is caught by a wounded but still alive Morden, who unfolds it before looking up to the starry sky.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The File Allocation Table (FAT) {{file system}} is {{supported}} in multiple Operating Systems (OS). Hence, FAT file system is universal exchange format for files/directories used in Solid State Drives (SSD) and Hard disk Drives (HDD). The Microsoft Corporation introduced the new file system called Extended FAT file system (ExFAT) to support larger size storage devices. The ExFAT file system is optimized {{to use with}} SSDs. But, Both FAT and ExFAT are not <b>power</b> <b>fail</b> safe. This means that the uncontrolled power loss or abrupt storage device removable from the computer system, during file system update, causes corruption of file system meta data and hence it leads to loss of data in storage device. This paper implements the Logging and Committing features to FAT and ExFAT file systems and ensures that the file system meta data is consistent across the abrupt power loss or device removal from the computer system...|$|E
40|$|This study {{argues that}} sixteenth-century map {{culture is a}} source for Shakespeare's plays, and that {{his use of the}} map, as cartographic {{language}} and as stage property, is a factor in understanding Shakespeare's representation of power. Maps empower their users and their makers, at the expense of those who are mapped those who live on the land represented. However, the stage counters the map's effectiveness as a tool of power. In Shakespeare's plays, characters using the map to achieve <b>power</b> <b>fail,</b> partly because of their inability to read maps and use them properly, and partly because the map and the stage's relationship with the space they represent is different. Land is staged refusing to yield to the map's attempts to break it down, and those living on the land are staged resisting their inclusion or exclusion from it. Plays and issues discussed include the mis-use of the map in The Second Tetralogy, the weaknesses of cartography and stage-mapping in Richard III and King Lear, the presence of death on the map in relation to Antony and Cleopatra, and mapping body-space in Cymbeline...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} power is {{contentious}} in political philosophy. Iris Marion Young provides {{an important contribution to}} our understanding of sociopolitical power in Justice and the Politics o f Difference. Young defends a relational conception of sociopolitical power by discussing its oppressive aspects. In the course of developing her view, Young argues that a distributive model of sociopolitical power cannot capture the relational dynamics of contemporary exercises of power. By conceiving power as an ???object??? that can be possessed, Young argues distributive conceptions of sociopolitical <b>power</b> <b>fail</b> to understand that power is a process, it exists in the actions of agents in relation. Further, distributive conceptions obscure structural and ideological mechanisms guiding oppressive practices. In this thesis, I critique Young???s dismissal of distributive models of power and develop an alternative distributive model of contemporary sociopolitical power based upon the relationships Young finds incompatible with distributive conceptions. My project consists of two parts. Part One discusses the ontological status of sociopolitical power and I defend my alternative distributive model. Part Two argues that sociopolitical power is the dominant social good in the contemporary liberal state and its value concerns relative agency within capital-based liberal sociopolitical systems...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{considerations}} at {{wind power}} developments require avoidance and mitigation of environmental impacts through proper citing, operational constraints, etc. However, some impacts are unavoidable for otherwise socially-beneficial projects. Criteria for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) suggest that compensation {{be provided for}} unavoidable or residual impacts on species and/or habitat from wind power development. Current environmental compensation schemes for wind <b>power</b> <b>fail</b> to demonstrate {{a connection between the}} expected ecological damage and the ecological gains through restoration. The EU-funded REMEDE project developed quantitative methods known as "equivalency analysis" to assist Member States in implementing EU Directives that require scaling of environmental compensation. This study provides a transparent framework for estimating compensation at wind facilities based on the REMEDE approach. I illustrate the approach with a hypothetical case study involving sea eagle impacts at the Smøla Wind Farm (Norway). This study assumes measures be will implemented to alleviate future impacts on the eagle population but that an interim loss of resources to the public remains. I illustrate how one could quantify the damage (debit) from sea eagle turbine collisions. A potentially-promising compensatory project that reduces eagle mortality from power line electrocution is suggested to generate the environmental gains (credit), which is quantified using hypothetical data. Pending completion of on-going research, this framework could be applied with actual data to inform future compensation at Smøla. The framework is generalizable to on- and off-shore wind development but requires targeted and thoughtful data collection. Importantly, compensation should not be used disingenuously to justify otherwise environmentally costly projects...|$|E
40|$|The Rane ME 15 S microGraphic Equalizer is a two-channel, 2 / 3 -octave {{design with}} 20 mm sliders {{in a single}} rack space unit. It {{features}} a Range switch for high slider resolution in the ± 6 dB mode, equivalent resolution to 45 mm sliders found on double rack-space models. The ± 12 dB mode provides {{a wide range of}} control over system audio. The active filter sections feature Rane’s innovative constant-Q (constant bandwidth) design. Constant-Q means the bandwidth of each individual filter is guaranteed to be narrow enough to prevent unwarranted interaction between filters, yet wide enough to produce exactly the type of correction curve demanded by even the most unusual acoustic surroundings. This differs dramatically from conventional designs of the past, encumbered with the unfortunate characteristic of changing bandwidth when changing boost/cut amounts. Front panel controls and indicators include an overall rotary Level control for each channel as well as Overload indicators. Passive pushbutton Bypass switches feature LED indicators, avoiding ambiguity by being on when the unit is Bypassed. (A passive Bypass switch requires no power to operate. This al-lows completion of the audio path should the <b>power</b> <b>fail</b> in the ME 15 S.) Inputs and Outputs are electronically balanced designs, capable of unbalanced operation when required. They accept and drive all possible signal levels into normal load impedances. Balanced applications choose between the XLR or " Tip-Ring-Sleeve balanced connectors.

40|$|The Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPSs) provide {{short term}} power {{back up to}} {{electrical}} loads when the mains <b>power</b> <b>fail.</b> Usually UPSs employ battery packs as the energy storage device. However the limitations of battery packs can affect the UPS performance. As an alternative energy storage device, the supercapacitor (SC) technology is well developed over the past 30 years. Due to recent developments, single cell commercial supercapacitors are available up to about 5000 farads. Over the past 10 years, supercapacitor direct current (DC) voltage ratings have gradually increased to about 2. 7 V/cell. New lithium based supercapacitor families have DC ratings up to 3. 5 V/cell. For the high current applications, the supercapacitors have some advantages over batteries, which are the low effective series resistance (ESR), high power densities and high surge withstand capability. This thesis {{is a continuation of}} the work begun by Kozhiparambil, P. K. on Surge Resistant Uninterrupted Power Supply (SRUPS). The reason for this continual research is due to identify weaknesses in original of SRUPS work with regard to the design of the charger. To reduce the components contain, also achieve common mode transient rejection capability, a flayback mode high current charger with power factor correction has been developed for charging the SC banks. The prototype circuit includes multiple SC banks to transfer the energy from the 240 V, 50 Hz power line to the load maintaining high isolation level. The loads receive continuous and surge free power from the SC banks, and has electrical isolation from the main power line. An IGBT is used as a switch for the flyback charger, which has the advantage of high current capability. The experimental results show the design was valid for the SRUPS and it demonstrated the capability to transfer the energy through a flyback charger with power factor correction...|$|E
