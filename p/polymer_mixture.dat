50|$|This {{technology}} {{takes advantage}} of temperature driven polymer bending by exposing the desired bending seams to focused strips of intense light. These bending seams are printed {{in a state of}} stress but do not deform until exposed to light. The active agent that induces bending in the material is heat transmitted by intense light. The material itself is made of chemical photo-reactive polymers. These compounds use a <b>polymer</b> <b>mixture</b> combined with a photoinitiator to create an amorphous, covalently cross-linked polymer. This material is formed into sheets and loaded in tension perpendicular to the desired bending crease. The material is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light, as the photoinitiator is consumed it polymerizes the remaining mixture, inducing photoinitiated stress relaxation. The portion of material exposed to the light can be controlled with stencils to create specific bending patterns. It is also possible to run multiple iterations of this process using the same material sample with different loading conditions or stencil masks for each iteration. The final form will depend on the order and resulting form of each iteration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The phase {{behavior}} of binary blends of dimethylpolycarbonate-tetramethyl polycarbonate (DMPC-TMPC) copolycarbonates and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) copolymers has been examined and then {{compared with that}} of DMPC/TMPC/SAN ternary blends having the same chemical components and compositions except that the DMPC and TMPC were present in the form of homopolymers. Both binary and ternary blends were miscible at certain blends compositions, and the miscible blends showed the LCST-type phase behavior or did not phase separated until thermal degradation temperature. The miscible region of binary blends is wider than that of the corresponding ternary blends. Furthermore, the phase-separation temperatures of miscible binary blends are higher than those of miscible ternary blends at the same chemical compositions. To explain the destabilization of <b>polymer</b> <b>mixture</b> with the increase of the number of component, interaction energies of binary pairs involved in these blends were calculated from the phase separation temperatures using lattice-fluid theory and then the phase stability conditions for the <b>polymer</b> <b>mixture</b> was analyzed with volume fluctuation thermodynamics...|$|E

40|$|Most {{research}} on polymer degradation is for single polymers, {{even though the}} thermal decomposition of <b>polymer</b> <b>mixtures</b> is of interest both practically and theoretically. Polymer degradation rates depend on the mixture type, and adding a polymer can increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the degradation rate of the first polymer.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{coarsening}} of domains in bicontinuous structure of aqueous <b>polymer</b> <b>mixtures,</b> driven by hydrodynamic flow. Taking {{into account the}} bending energy as {{a contribution to the}} interfacial energy, we derive a general expression for the coarsening rate in these mixtures. Examining the limiting behavior of small and large length scales, we find two regimes. For small length scales, the size of the domains (¿) scales with time (t) as ¿ t 1 / 3, while at large length scales, the domain size scales with time as ¿ t. The crossover between the two regimes occurs at a particular length scale, the critical radius Rc, which is dependent on the bending rigidity k, and the interfacial tension of a flat interface ¿ 0 (Rc =). In the case of aqueous biopolymer mixtures, we predict this particular length scale to be in the micron range.
