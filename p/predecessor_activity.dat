Activity on node diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret. To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named start. This [...] has a duration of zero (0). Then you draw each activity that does not have a <b>predecessor</b> <b>activity</b> (a and b in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node. Next, since both c and d list a as a <b>predecessor</b> <b>activity,</b> their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from a. Activity e is listed with b and c as predecessor activities, so node e is drawn with arrows coming from both b and c, signifying that e cannot begin until both b and c have been completed. Activity f has d as a <b>predecessor</b> <b>activity,</b> so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities. Likewise, an arrow is drawn from e to g. Since there are no activities that come after f or g, it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled finish.|$|E

50|$|SF {{is rarely}} used, and should {{generally}} be avoided. Microsoft recommends to use SF dependency for just-in-time scheduling. It {{can be easily}} shown however, that this would only work if resource levelling is not used, because resource levelling can delay a successor activity (an activity, which shall be finished just-in-time) in such a way, that it will finish later than the start of its logical <b>predecessor</b> <b>activity,</b> thus not fulfilling the just-in-time requirement.|$|E

If other types of relationships are used, they shall be used sparingly and with full understanding of how the relationships have been implemented in the scheduling software being used. Ideally, the sequence of all activities will be defined in such a way that the start of every activity has a logical relationship from a predecessor and the finish of every activity has a logical relationship to a successor".|$|E

In that case, the drag should be associated with the lag as that constraint is the delaying factor that must be addressed to shorten the project.

Changes in agricultural technology, particularly the development of fertilizer chemistry, sharply reduced the economic viability of grassland in Illinois and led to the plow-up of most of the remaining parcels of tallgrass prairie. After the Illinois greater prairie chicken population dropped to 25,000 in 1933 the hunting season was permanently closed, but this did not halt the decline. Conservation areas were purchased and set aside in 1939-1944, but the birds died out in these Northern Illinois parcels anyway. This created an incentive for the private sector to purchase grassland parcels in southern Illinois. These land purchases, which took place starting in 1961, acquired the land that now forms the Prairie Ridge SNA. As of 2014, the most recent land acquisition took place in 2001.|$|E
5000|$|A {{quick way}} to compute the drag of a {{critical}} path activity that has one or more start-to-start or start-to-start plus lag successorsis that the drag of the critical path activity that has such successors will be equal to whichever is less: {{the duration of the}} <b>predecessor</b> <b>activity</b> OR the sum of the lag plus total float of whichever SS successor has the LEAST lag plus total float. This is shown in the diagram where Activity A has four SS+lag successors: B, C, E, and F. The drag-plus-lag of B is 3 + 12 = 15. For each of C, E, and F, it is 20, 12, and 10 respectively. The lowest is F with 10. Since Activity A's duration is 20 which is higher than F's drag-plus-lag of 10, A's drag is 10. In other words, A is adding 10 units of time to the project duration.

40|$|Most {{existing}} human mobility literature {{focuses on}} exterior characteristics of movements but neglects activities, {{the driving force}} that underlies human movements. In this research, we combine activity-based analysis with a movement-based approach to model the intra-urban human mobility observed from about 15 million check-in records during a yearlong period in Shanghai, China. The proposed model is activity-based and includes two parts: the transition of travel demands during a specific time period and the movement between locations. For the first part, we find the transition probability between activities varies over time, and then we construct a temporal transition probability matrix to represent the transition probability of travel demands during a time interval. For the second part, we suggest that the travel demands {{can be divided into}} two classes, locationally mandatory activity (LMA) and locationally stochastic activity (LSA), according to whether the demand is associated with fixed location or not. By judging the combination of <b>predecessor</b> <b>activity</b> type and successor activity type we determine three trip patterns, each associated with a different decay parameter. To validate the model, we adopt the mechanism of an agent-based model and compare the simulated results with the observed pattern from the displacement distance distribution, the spatio-temporal distribution of activities, and the temporal distribution of travel demand transitions. The results show that the simulated patterns fit the observed data well, indicating that these findings open new directions for combining activity-based analysis with a movement-based approach using social medi...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 : Nepotism - CEO Succession, Ownership and Enterprise Performance By JAN-PHILIPP AHRENS, SANDRA GOTTSCHALK AND MICHAEL WOYWODE We {{consider}} {{the effects of}} CEO successions on enterprise performance in medium-sized enterprises with strong ownership concentration (family firms). By evaluating an unique data set we show that firms which install relatives or heirs as CEO successors perform worse as compared to firms which install external CEO successors. Furthermore we identify the driving forces behind this inferior performance as lower human capital and a lower propensity to implement organizational changes, which is presumably caused by limited selectivity of CEO succession contests due to concentrated ownership structures. Interestingly, no performance gap is observable for well-chosen high human capital family successors.

Chapter 2 : Inside CEO Successions in Family Firms: Should Predecessors Stay Active or Cultivate Roses? By JAN-PHILIPP AHRENS, MICHAEL WOYWODE, AND JAN ZYBURA Employing an unique data set on CEO successions, we analyze {{the circumstances under which}} departing CEOs stay active within their enterprise subsequent to a CEO succession and highlight enterprise performance implications. We find that the likelihood of <b>predecessor</b> <b>activity</b> is increased by family succession, nepotism and tacit knowledge, but reduced by the successor’s human capital, successor’s ownership and corporate age. The performance impact of prolonged <b>predecessor</b> <b>activity</b> is positive for successors with low human capital, but turns negative with increased successor human capital, while this negative impact is amplified by the degree of influence of the preceding CEO.

We find that a preference for male family heirs limits labor market selectivity: Family successions are significantly more likely to occur when a son is among the predecessor’s children as compared to daughters. Sons among the children increase the likelihood of nepotistic successions, while in turn female family successors are equipped with higher human capital due to tougher selectivity criteria. Furthermore, the regional industry supply of CEO resources influences the observed human capital of installed successors.

Chapter 4 : Restructuring, Human Capital, and Enterprise Performance in CEO Successions in Family Firms By JAN-PHILIPP AHRENS AND MICHAEL WOYWODE Devising an unique data set we analyze managerial actions and their performance impact during CEO successions in family firms. We find that corporate change unleashes additional performance due to accumulated improvement potentials from the pre-succession period. High human capital successors implement more changes and perform significantly better when compared to low human capital successors. Furthermore, the amount of observed changes is subject to the economic contingency and is highest in CEO successions in turnaround situations. In particular reviews of the supplier relations, the product portfolio, and the compensation scheme were found to significantly enhance performance.

However, applied to an international context, counterintuitive niche cases where imperfect institutions enhance the wealth of nations occur, mirroring seemingly contrary findings in the development literature. Policies and business strategies to escape imperfect institutions are discussed, casting light on medieval merchant guilds or township and village enterprises and arguing for a holistic approach when introducing policies for institutional change.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} and discursive analysis of Australian public universities from a normative perspective, based on a commitment to values of social justice and equality. I argue that ideas of universities in Australia have changed over time; {{that there were two}} major shifts of ideas since the liberal ideas that were apparent with the foundation of Australia's first university. Different ideas dominated in the 1970 s when ideas of universities are described as egalitarian and democratic, but these ideas of universities changed again with reconstruction of Australian public universities in 1988. In the last two decades Australian public universities have been based on ideas that have produced different institutions, described as neoliberal, marketised and, in effect, privatised. These neoliberal ideas privilege the economic over the social. I argue for a preferred model of equal rights based on citizenship and merit, which includes free access to a higher education in a public university. The data that are analysed are policy texts, speeches and university mission statements that are representations of identity and agency. This {{is a critical}} analysis in which themes and concepts are identified in discourse that represents universities at different times, for example in the speech for the founding of the University of Sydney by Wentworth in 1849, or a speech by Whitlam in 1972 which describes the ideas of universities as free and access based on ability. However, representations in contemporary mission statements and policy texts illustrate that the identities of Australian public universities have shifted. Findings include themes in texts of transformed relations, actors and communities, and mechanisms and strategies that illustrate changed practices, such as commercialisation, internationalisation and, most significantly, privatisation of Australian public universities. Australian public, not-for-profit universities have become more commercial than their <b>predecessors,</b> undertaking different <b>activities,</b> more governed yet in contradiction more flexible and shape-shifting. Specific neoliberal characteristics and strategies are now evident in their discourse and in practices. These neoliberal characteristics and strategies cross domains and operate at different levels, and in combination they achieve the hegemonic neoliberal project of the state. The consequences are that these neoliberal ideas have reshaped Australian universities. Australian universities have become altered commercial and international actors in disparate networks and different market relationships. Reflexive Australian universities are very successful in these markets, and take on a marketised, private identity. The mechanisms of this are in place, but the effects are still to be proclaimed. There will, in the future, be no Australian public universities. A normative alternative is offered...|$|R
