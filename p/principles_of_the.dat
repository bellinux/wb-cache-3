Thus, <b>the</b> laws <b>of</b> conservation of energy and conservation of (total) mass are equivalent and both hold true. Einstein elaborated in a 1946 essay that [...] "the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conservation <b>of</b> mass ... proved inadequate in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special theory <b>of</b> relativity.

Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

Intervention by member countries in their agricultural sectors poses an obstacle to free trade in European countries, which EU legislation, among other things, attempts to address.|$|E

All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E
