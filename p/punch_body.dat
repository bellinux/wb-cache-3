40|$|Purpose. Justification of optimum heat {{treatment}} of ball transfer unit body {{was developed and}} patented by "Victoria Ltd. " (Ukraine). These modes of {{heat treatment}} had to assure the maximum carrying capacity of ball transfer unit {{and its ability to}} withstand the load impact with given impact energy. Also the state of unit operability was investigated subject to applied static loading. Design/methodology/approach. The special experimental equipment was designed and manufactured for research. It allowed to simulate the real working conditions of ball transfer unit during the experiments. Entire test cycle was divided into three phases. Initially the units were subjected to impact loading with falling weight under increasing impact energy up to destruction of a body. The influence of steel body hardness on unit dynamic strength was estimated. Then samples of ball transfer units were loaded with static forces applied to central ball. Maximum failure load was determined and real safety factors were calculated subject to body hardness. Also unit operability at maximum load was investigated. It was estimated by possibility of full twisting central ball in the unit body. Findings. Optimum regimes of hardening of the body and the actual ultimate load safety factor at the normal loading of the unit were defined. Originality. New results on structural strength of ball transfer unit with steel <b>punching</b> <b>body</b> were obtained. ???????????? ?????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ???? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???

5000|$|Tunney was a {{thinking}} fighter who preferred {{to make a}} boxing match into a game of chess, which was not popular during the times when such sluggers as Jack Dempsey, Harry Greb and Mickey Walker were commanding center stage. Tunney's style was influenced by other noted boxing thinkers such as James J. Corbett and Benny Leonard. Nevertheless,it is incorrect to think of Tunney as a stick-and-move fighter in the Ali style. While Tunney's heavyweight fights against Gibbons, Carpentier, and Dempsey featured his fleet-footed movement and rapid-fire jabbing, his earlier bouts, especially the five against Harry Greb, demonstrated his vicious <b>body</b> <b>punching</b> and willingness to fight toe-to-toe. It was Benny Leonard who advised Tunney {{that the only way}} to beat Harry [...] "The Human Windmill" [...] Greb was to aim his <b>punches</b> at Greb's <b>body</b> rather than his head.|$|R
