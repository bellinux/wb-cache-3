5|$|In 1983, {{classification}} for swimmers with cerebral <b>palsy</b> was {{governed by}} CP-ISRA. There were five cerebral <b>palsy</b> classifications. Class 1 competitors could {{compete in the}} 25 metre freestyle event with flotation devices with or without flotation devices. Class 2 competitors could compete in the same events, but only against class 2 competitors. That year, 80 to 85 per cent of all competitors with cerebral <b>palsy</b> competed in the same classification in international competitions.|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} if the dental and oro-facial complex of cerebral <b>palsied</b> patients is {{different from that of the}} non-cerebral <b>palsied.</b> Twenty-six cerebral <b>palsied</b> patients between the ages of seven and 18 were examined. A history was taken and a data sheet was completed to record molar and cuspid relationships. The function of. the tongue and lips during swallow was also recorded. Cephalometric and hand and wrist radiographs were taken of each patient. The cephalometric measurements were statistically compared with the normative data of a non-cerebral <b>palsied</b> group. This analysis revealed the cranial flexure angle to be more acute and the gonial angle to be more obtuse. Comparison of the hand and wrist plates with normal standards did not show wide enough differences to conclude that cerebral <b>palsied</b> patients' skeletal age deviates from the chronological age. Although there was a difference in some cephalometric measurements, there is no evidence in this study to show that the incidence of malocclusion and the incidence of factors that contribute to malocclusion are found with greater frequency among cerebral <b>palsied</b> patients...|$|R

40|$|We take a {{psychological}} rehabilitation as one for cerebral <b>palsied</b> children. In the psychological rehabilitation by Naruse, the disability of the cerebral <b>palsied</b> motor action {{is understood as}} non-learning or mis-learning of the action introduced from the abnormal muscle tensin. This understanding is made from a point of behavior and differ from the medical or the orthopaedic one. Subjectively the cerebral <b>palsied</b> children learn the extinction of the abnormal muscle tension, the balance between tension and relaxation, the unit motor and basic motor action pattern, so there disabilities are improved. One-week-group-training is more effective as a rehabilitation camp for cerebral <b>palsied</b> children, and the cerebral <b>palsied</b> children are taught intensively by the man-to-man method, that is, one trainer to one trainee. In this paper, the relaxation, the training of the motor action and the one-week-group-training are summarily reported, then the group-psychotherapeutic meaning is discussed. In the field of education, the author stressed, psychological rehabilitation, {{in addition to the}} medical, especially orthopaedic, and the neurophysiological estimations, is a more useful training method, and the trainer-training project is necessary at present...|$|R

5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve <b>palsy)</b> or as facial nerve <b>palsy.</b> If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E

5|$|Severe malaria {{is usually}} caused by P.falciparum (often {{referred}} to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection. Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, nystagmus, conjugate gaze <b>palsy</b> (failure of the eyes to turn {{together in the same}} direction), opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve <b>palsy</b> therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve <b>palsy,</b> respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E
5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar <b>palsy.</b> Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E

40|$|Among the {{multiple}} causes for cranial nerve <b>palsies,</b> {{internal carotid artery}} dissection is rather uncommon. Patients usually present with unilateral head pain, Horner's syndrome, and signs of cerebral ischemia. We present {{the case of a}} 52 -year-old male patient, who showed isolated <b>palsies</b> of the tenth and twelfth nerve without any other symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (T 1) depicted a hyperintense lesion surrounding the internal carotid artery, which was mistaken for a cervical mass, and the patient underwent unnecessary surgical exploration of the neck. Angiography performed afterward could reveal the dissection of the internal carotid artery. This case shows that even in cases with mild and atypic symptoms, internal carotid artery dissection has always to be ruled out in lower cranial nerve <b>palsies...</b>|$|R
