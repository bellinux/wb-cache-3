40|$|A new micrometeorological {{technique}} {{is applied to}} measure gas emissions from soils. The technique relies on a single open-path FTIR sensor (OP-FTIR) with motorized aiming to give gas concentrations along vertically separated paths (not necessarily parallel with each other). Emission rates are inferred from the vertical difference in concentration using two alternative methods: flux-gradient and inverse dispersion calculations. Our objective is to assess the capability of the technique in a field study measuring nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and ammonia (NH 3) emitted from cattle overwintering areas during the spring thaw. Two field configurations were examined: a slant path configuration in which the OP-FTIR is aimed directly at high and low reflectors {{at the far end}} of the path (average vertical <b>path</b> <b>separation</b> ∼ 1 m), and a periscope configuration where the lower FTIR path was directed closer to ground along the whole path (average <b>path</b> <b>separation</b> ∼ 1. 5 m). Measured emission rates were generally above the detectability threshold of the system and consistent with the scientific literature showing an emission rise during thawing. At one of our sites the pulse of N 2 O emitted during thawing was among the largest reported (9. 9 kg N-N 2 O ha− 1 during April). Of the two alternatives tested for calculating emissions, the inverse dispersion approach is more flexible, but with a computation time that can be prohibitive. With large measurement fetches the flux-gradient approach can be equally good and computationally faster. We conclude that the open-path gradient system provides a practical option for studying emissions in difficult environments...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{generalized}} multipath separability condition for subspace processing and derives a novel COD (combined oversampling and displacement) algorithm to utilize both {{spatial and temporal}} diversities for <b>path</b> <b>separation</b> and DOA estimation. A unique advantage lies {{in its ability to}} cope with the situation where the number of multipaths is much larger than that of antenna elements, which arises in many practical situations. The traditional data matrix or any of its horizontally expanded versions cannot yield a sufficient matrix rank to satisfy the condition, when there is antenna deficiency. Neither can a vertical expansion via oversampling, except when there is no overlapping among intra-user paths (a much stronger condition than the asynchrony condition). The COD strategy solves the antenna deficiency problem by combining vertical expansion with temporal oversampling and horizontal expansion with spatial displacement. Another unique advantage of COD is its multiplicity of eigenvalues which greatly facilitates the later signal recovery processing.

The characteristic path length represents the most relevant of them since it achieved Spearman correlation 0.9. It tends to increase almost monotonically from 3  h to 16  days after surgery. This suggests that in the network the average shortest <b>path</b> <b>separation</b> between the nodes increased regardless of the acute or chronic phase of the pain.

The power of the laser light is estimated to be sufficiently high for device applications. The thermodynamics of the heat converter is analyzed as a heat engine operating between two reservoirs of different temperature but is generalized to include the change of internal quantum states. The von Neumann entropies for the internal degree are obtained. The sum of the internal and external entropies increases after each cycle and the second law is not violated, even if the photon entropy due to finite photon number distribution is not included.

We propose {{several new}} hybrid {{heuristics}} for the differential dis-persion problem are proposed, {{the best of}} which consists of a GRASP with sam-pled greedy construction with variable neighborhood search for local improve-ment.

In interior path relinking, paths in the neighborhood solution space connecting good solutions are explored between these solutions in the search for improvements.

Cycling represents one virtually carbon-neutral form of transport that can help to address declining levels of exercise. Methods: a systematic literature review of experimental or observational studies that objectively evaluated {{the effect of the}} built environment on cycling. Results: a total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, all of which were observational studies. Eleven studies identified objectively measured environmental factors with a significant positive association with cycling. The environmental factors identified as being positively associated with cycling included presence of dedicated cycle routes or <b>paths,</b> <b>separation</b> of cycling from other traffic, high population density, short trip distance, proximity of a cycle path or green space and for children projects promoting ‘safe routes to school’.

Using the knowledge from the literary study and the simulation environments used, we have reached the maximum analysis of the problem. The separation of metal and plastic may occur due to temperature changes if the temperature difference is sufficient. We have carried out a study of printed circuit board production so we can choose the appropriate <b>path</b> of <b>separation.</b> Furthermore, we calculated the shear stress size required to tear the conductive copper paths from the epoxy resin. The temperature field in a two-layer board was modeled in the FEMLAB and Pro/ENGINEER programming environments.

They derived the resulting relationship for calculating the resulting shear stress needed to separate the conductive paths and plastic materials of the PCB. In our own experiments, we used several ways to heat PCBs. The temperature is also sufficient for the separation of tin.

40|$|We {{define the}} idea of real path quantum theory, a realist {{generalisation}} of quantum theory {{in which it is}} postulated that the configuration space path actually followed by a closed quantum system is probabilistically chosen. This is done a postulate defining probabilities for paths, which we propose are determined by an expression involving path amplitudes and a distance function that quantifies <b>path</b> <b>separation.</b> We suggest a possible form for a path probability postulate and explore possible choices of distance function, including choices suitable for Lorentz or generally covariant versions of real path quantum theory. We set out toy models of quantum interferometry and show that in these models the probability postulate and specific distance functions do indeed give a physically sensible path ontology. These functions can be chosen so as to predict quantum interference for interference of microscopic quantum systems and the failure of interference for macroscopic quantum systems. More generally, they predict interference when the beams are close, and its failure when they are far apart, as determined by the distance function. If taken seriously in its present relatively unconstrained form, real path quantum theory thus motivates experimental tests of quantum interference in all unexplored regimes defined by potentially physically interesting parameters, including the mass of the beam object, the beam separation distance, the beam separation time, and many others. We discuss open questions raised by these ideas...|$|E

Let Γ be an infinite graph, let Π be a double ray in Γ, and let d and dΠ denote the distance functions in Γ and in Π, respectively. One calls Π a quasi-axis if lim inf d(x, y) /dΠ(x, y) > 0, where x and y are vertices of Π and dΠ(x, y) → ∞. An infinite, locally finite, almost 4 -connected, almost-transitive, 1 -ended graph is shown to be planar if and only if the complement of every quasi-axis has exactly two infinite components. Let Γ be locally finite, planar, 3 -connected, almost-transitive, and 1 -ended. It is shown that no proper planar embedding of Γ has an infinite face and hence its covalences are bounded. If Γ has bounded covalences and if Π is any double ray in Γ, it is shown that Γ − Π has at most two infinite components, at most one on each side of Π. If, moreover, Π is a quasi-axis, then Γ − Π is shown to have exactly two infinite components. With the aid of a result of Thomassen (1992), the above-stated characterization of infinite, locally finite, planar, 1 -ended graphs is then obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{path that}} humans take while walking to a goal {{is the result}} of a {{cognitive}} process modulated by the perception of the environment and physiological constraints. The path shape and timing implicitly embeds aspects of the architecture behind this process. Here, locomotion paths were investigated during a simple task of walking to and from a goal, by looking at the evolution of the position of the human on a horizontal (x,y) plane. We found that the path while walking to a goal was not the same as that while returning from it. Forward-return paths were systematically separated by 0. 5 - 1. 9 m, or about 5 % of the goal distance. We show that this <b>path</b> <b>separation</b> occurs as a consequence of anticipating the desired body orientation at the goal while keeping the target in view. The magnitude of this separation was strongly influenced by the bearing angle (difference between body orientation and angle to goal) and the final orientation imposed at the goal.

40|$|We propose an {{experiment}} {{for the first}} proof of the type I electric Aharonov-Bohm effect in an ion interferometer for hydrogen. The performances of three different beam separation schemes are simulated and compared. The coherent ion beam is generated by a single atom tip (SAT) source and separated by either two biprisms with a quadrupole lens, two biprisms with an einzel-lens or three biprisms. The beam <b>path</b> <b>separation</b> is necessary to introduce two metal tubes that can be pulsed with different electric potentials. The high time resolution of a delay line detector allows {{to work with a}} continuous ion beam and circumvents the pulsed beam operation as originally suggested by Aharonov and Bohm.

Thereby a high coherent ion detection rate is crucial to avoid long integration times that allow the influence of dephasing noise from the environment. We can determine the period of the expected matter wave interference pattern and the signal on the detector by determining the superposition angle of the coherent partial beams. Our simulations were tested with an electron interferometer setup and agree with the experimental results.
