25|$|On November 5, 2007, Hotelito Desconocido's {{ownership}} {{was transferred}} to W Arquitectos, a parent company owned by Wendy Dalaithy Amaral Arévalo. She is the wife of Gerardo González Valencia, a former suspected high-ranking drug lord of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and Los Cuinis, two allied criminal groups in Jalisco. For the land and buildings in the property, W Arquitectos paid US$7.7 million; for the construction equipment, they paid US$285,000; and for trademark rights, they paid US$250,000. Each of these transactions included three additional value-added tax payments totaling US$182,250, US$42,750, and US$37,500 respectively. The real estate <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> cost $US78,370. This meant that W Arquitectos spent over $US8.5 million dollars (approximately MXN$91.3 million in 2007) just to get Hotelito Desconocido. According to a notarized document, W Arquitectos got several loans from , a bank based in Guadalajara, to purchase Hotelito Desconocido.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of outside <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts</b> on firm risk and firm capital structure. We find that firms with more outside <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts</b> have less risky firm cash flows. Despite these less risky cash flows, our results show that these firms use less {{financial}} leverage reducing their risk of financial distress. We show that the effect of outside contracts on financial leverage is more negative when firms operate in high value-added industries. Examining firm financing decisions, we document that firms with more outside contracts are more likely to issue private securities. Our results are consistent with firms with more outside <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts</b> using less leverage to decrease the expected costs of financial distress on the firm’s implicit and explicit contracting parties...|$|R
2500|$|An {{exception}} to the law on misrepresentation – that contracts are voidable at the instance of the misrepresentee, but the right to rescission can be barred inter alia by the intervention of third party rights – arises when someone is induced by the fraudulent misrepresentation to enter an agreement through a written document at a distance (and not when a transaction is face to face). In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson a crook obtained Mr Patel's credit details and bought a Mitsubishi Shogun on hire <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> at a car dealer. Shogun Finance was faxed through Mr Patel's details, and agreed to finance {{the purchase of the}} car, letting the crook drive away. Subsequently, Mrs Hudson bought the car from the crook. The crook disappeared. Then Shogun Finance, who had predictably never been paid, found Mrs Hudson and sued to retrieve the car. A bare majority in the House of Lords held that to protect the certainty of commercial dealings through a signed document, the contract between the finance company and the crook was void (the same consequence as if there had never been any offer mirrored by an acceptance). They had only ever intended to contract with Mr Patel. And because nobody can convey property they do not have (nemo dat quod non habet) Mrs Hudson never acquired legitimate title to the car from the crook and had to give back the car. The minority held that this situation should follow ordinary law of misrepresentation, and should mean that the right of the finance company to rescind the contract would be barred by the intervention of Mrs Hudson's rights as a bona fide third party purchaser, just like all of Europe, the United States, and previous decisions of the Court of Appeal suggest. However, because of the majority's decision this special category of [...] "mistake about identity" [...] cases remains a general {{exception to}} the English law on misrepresentation.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 June 1981, Sheela's husband, John Shelfer, {{signed a}} <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> to buy {{property}} in Oregon for US$5.75 million, {{and a few}} days later assigned the property to the US foundation. The property was a [...] ranch, previously known as [...] "The Big Muddy Ranch" [...] and located across two Oregon counties (Wasco and Jefferson). It was renamed [...] "Rancho Rajneesh" [...] and Rajneesh moved there on 29 August. One Oregon professor: [...] "The initial response in Oregon was an uneasy balance in which tolerance tended to outweigh hostility with increasing distance." [...] The press reported, and another study found, that the development met almost immediately with intense local, state and federal opposition from the government, press and citizenry. Initial local community reactions ranged from hostility to tolerance, depending on distance from the ranch. Within months a series of legal battles ensued, principally over land use. In May 1982 the residents of Rancho Rajneesh voted to incorporate it as the city of Rajneeshpuram. 1000 Friends of Oregon immediately commenced and then prosecuted {{over the next six years}} numerous court and administrative actions to void the incorporation and cause buildings and improvement to be removed. 1000 Friends publicly called for the City to be [...] "dismantled". A 1000 Friends Attorney stated that if 1000 Friends won, the Foundation would be “forced to remove their sewer system and tear down many of the buildings. In 1985, the Oregon Supreme Court found that the land was not suitable for farming, and therefore did not need to satisfy the complicated land use procedures and standards, but remanded for determination on other issues. In 1987, the Supreme Court finally resolved the case in favour of the City, by which time of course, the community had disbanded. During the course of the litigation, 1000 Friends ran a fundraising ad throughout Oregon headlined [...] "Rajneeshpuram Alert. [...] Worrying about Rajneeshpuram Won't Help." [...] An Oregonian editorial commented on the ad, stating that 1000 Friends [...] "ought to be ashamed of itself" [...] for a campaign [...] "based on fear and prejudice". Ironically, the Federal Bureau of Land Management found that the highest farm use of the land in question was the grazing of 9 cattle.|$|E

40|$|A {{manufacturer}} writes {{supply contracts}} with N buyers. Then, the buyers invest in innovation, and the manufacturer builds capacity. Finally, demand is realized, and the firms renegotiate the supply contracts {{to achieve an}} efficient allocation of capacity among the buyers. The court remedy for breach of contract (specific performance versus expectation damages) affects how the firms share the gain from renegotiation, and hence how the firms make investments ex ante. The objective is to design supply contracts that will induce the buyers and manufacturer {{to make the first}} best investments. When the manufacturer is dominant and the breach remedy is expectation damages, the first best is achieved with simple advance <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts.</b> In contrast, with a dominant manufacturer and specific performance, the first best may not be achieved. A "tradable options" clause is needed to increase the buyers' incentive for investment. When the buyers have significant bargaining power and the breach remedy is expectation damages, simple advance <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts</b> will always result in underinvestment in capacity and overinvestment in innovation by the buyers. However, if the separability condition proposed in Edlin and Reichelstein (1996) holds and the breach remedy is specific performance, then the first best is achieved with simple advance <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts.</b> Finally, building on Maskin and Moore (1999) we describe more complex contracts that induce the first best where simple advance <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts</b> fail. ...|$|R
