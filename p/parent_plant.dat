5|$|Bulb offsets {{and tissue}} culture produce genetic clones of the <b>parent</b> <b>plant</b> and thus {{maintaining}} genetic {{integrity of the}} cultivars. Bulb offsets usually require {{at least a year}} before flowering. Commercially, plants may be propagated in vitro and then planted out to grow into plants large enough to sell.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Shade of Pale' is {{an unusual}} pale-pink flowered form of T.speciosissima. It is less {{vigorous}} than the <b>parent</b> <b>plant.</b> It was initially promoted as 'Light Shade of Pale' but there can only be three words in a registered cultivar name.|$|E
5|$|The {{potatoes}} {{were chosen}} {{because they were}} deemed substantially equivalent to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes. The study used two transgenic lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified <b>parent</b> <b>plant.</b> According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, {{as one of the}} transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|E

30|$|The {{samples of}} {{different}} batch and different alcoholicity of ZYQL and the 12 <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> {{were provided by}} Shanxi XinghuaCun Fen Jiu Group Co., Ltd. (Shanxi, China). The 12 <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> were identified by Professor Jincai Lu (Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China). The voucher specimen was deposited at Shenyang Pharmaceutical University (Shenyang, China) and registered under the number ZYQL 2011050101.|$|R
40|$|Plants {{obtained}} from anther {{culture of the}} African violet, Saintpaulia ionantha Wendl. `Shag' and vegetatively cloned copies of the <b>parent</b> anther donor <b>plant</b> were examined for their ploidy and ribulose- 1, 5 -biphosphate carboxylase (RuBPcase) activity. The cloned <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> were all diploid and did not vary much in their nuclear DNA, chlorophyll, and RuBPcase activity. Some of the anther-derived plants were similar to the <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> while others were not. Different levels of ploidy were observed among the androgenetic plants. RuBPcase activities {{higher than that of}} the <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> were found in some anther-derived plants. However, there was no direct correlation between ploidy and RuBPcase activity. Expression of nuclear genes from a single parent in the anther-derived plants and it's diploidization or plastid changes during early stages of microsporogenesis or androgenesis are suggested as possible reasons for the variations observed among them. This could be a useful technique to obtain physiological variants which could be agronomically desirable...|$|R
5|$|This strong odour can be {{detected}} {{half a mile away}} by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the <b>parent</b> <b>plant,</b> others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result. The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia {{plants can}} live {{for more than}} 60 years. They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the {{greatest}} number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the <b>parent</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the <b>parent</b> <b>plant,</b> and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E
50|$|Identifying the <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> of {{a chance}} {{seedling}} may be difficult. It {{may be necessary to}} genetically analyse the seedling and surrounding plants to be sure.|$|R
30|$|Seeds were {{collected}} from nearby sources such as adjoining private properties, roadside reserves, and the Nurcoung Flora and Fauna Reserve. For each species, at least 100 <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> were selected as seed sources, {{with the exception of}} Exocarpus cupressiformis and Acacia bivenosa, which are rare in the surrounding area with only 30 <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> identified. Seed-containing capsules were air dried and extracted by sieving. Cleaned seeds were stored in labelled polystyrene containers within a sealed shipping container. Hard coated seeds were scarified prior to seeding.|$|R

5|$|Banksia speciosa is serotinous, that is, it has {{an aerial}} seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release seed in large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the <b>parent</b> <b>plant.</b> Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed B.speciosa seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring Banksia species. Though this suggested B.speciosa might outcompete its conspecifics, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.|$|E
25|$|In {{many cases}} seed predators support plant populations by {{dispersing}} seeds {{away from the}} <b>parent</b> <b>plant.</b> By dispersing seeds away from the <b>parent</b> <b>plant</b> the seed predator is in effect supporting gene flow between populations. Other seed predators collect seeds and then store or cache them for later consumption. In {{the case that the}} seed predator is unable to locate the buried or hidden seed there is a chance that it will later germinate and grow, supporting the species dispersal.|$|E
25|$|Glossopteris should {{strictly}} be used {{to refer}} to the distinctive spathulate fossil leaves with reticulate venation, however, the term has also been {{used to refer to}} the <b>parent</b> <b>plant</b> as a whole.|$|E

40|$|The {{patterns}} of settlement and recruitment of propagules vary in both different {{temporal and spatial}} conditions (Vadas et al., 1992). Recruitment is recognized when seaweed germlings become 1 mm tall and visible to the unaided eye (Chapman, 1995). Settlement of propagules and macrorecruits (> 1 mm) has been observed near their <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> or {{in areas where the}} canopy has been cleared (Deysher and Norton, 1982; Kendrick and Walker, 1991). Propagules settled may interact with cohorts (germling-germling) and <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> (germlingadult) as they grow. Temporal variation in the settlement of propagules may also result in size-dependent competition between germlings, which settle at different times (Vadas et al., 1992). The <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> forming the overlying canopy adversely influence the survivorship and growth of the early post-settlement germlings (reviewed by Vadas et al., 1992). The negative effects of canopy algae have been investigated indirectly by canopy removal, which generally results in enhanced recruitment of the canopy specie...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} manure and biofertilizers {{application}} that were applied on <b>parent</b> <b>plants,</b> on the germination and emergence indices of produced seeds of fennel, two laboratory and greenhouse experiments based on completely randomized design with four replications were conducted in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. Treatments were consisted of 11 different seed types that were produced on <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> fed by: Compost (C), Vermicompost (V), Azotobacter (A), Pseudomonas (P), A+C, C+P, C+V, P+A, P+V, V+A and Control. Results of greenhouse study revealed that most studied treatments were effective on the height of fennel. Moreover, V and C+P treatments were superior in terms of emergence percentage and aerial dry weight, respectively. Results of laboratory experiment showed that C+V treatment were superior to other treatments in terms of germination percentage, germination rate, germination index and mean germination time. Overall, the experimental findings revealed that seed producing by manure and biofertilizers utilization on <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> is a suitable method for production of organic seeds that have optimal germination and early seedling growth indices...|$|R
25|$|Seeds (nuts) are {{attractive}} long-term storable food resources for animals (e.g. acorns, hazelnut, walnut); the seeds are stored {{some distance from}} the <b>parent</b> <b>plant,</b> and some escape being eaten if the animal forgets them.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{have limited}} seed {{dispersal}} mobility {{away from their}} parents, consequently relying upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the <b>parent</b> <b>plant</b> individually or collectively.|$|E
25|$|Sphagnum is {{also used}} in air layering, a method of {{propagation}} used to propagate woody stems like guavas. A ball of Sphagnum is tied against a midway ringed bark of a branch still attached on the <b>parent</b> <b>plant</b> using a translucent plastic material (vitalon).|$|E
50|$|Once {{the cereal}} plants have grown their seeds, they have {{completed}} their life cycle. The plants die, become brown, and dry. As {{soon as the}} <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.|$|R
50|$|Sympatric {{speciation}} {{events are}} quite common in plants, which {{are prone to}} acquiring multiple homologous sets of chromosomes, resulting in polyploidy. The polyploid offspring occupy the same environment as the <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> (hence sympatry), but are reproductively isolated.|$|R
50|$|Mangave {{inherit the}} drought-resisting traits of both <b>parent</b> <b>plants.</b> They can resist high {{temperatures}} and direct sunlight, but prefer shade. The plant can survive below freezing temperatures, but can become damaged if the temperature drops below -6 degrees Celsius.|$|R
25|$|In {{studies on}} grass species, with plants that produce stolons or {{rhizomes}} and plants that produce both stolons and rhizomes, morphological and physiological differences were noticed. Stolons have longer internodes and function as means of seeking out light {{and are used}} for propagation of the plant, while rhizomes are used as storage organs for carbohydrates {{and the maintenance of}} meristem tissue to keep the <b>parent</b> <b>plant</b> alive from one year to the next.|$|E
25|$|Pollination is by a {{wide range}} of bees, flies and moths and butterflies. Over a season, one plant may produce 2,000 to 2,500 yellow flowers in 20- to 60-headed, flat-topped corymbs. The number of seeds {{produced}} may be as large as 75,000 to 120,000, although in its native range in Eurasia very few of these would grow into new plants and research has shown that most seeds do not travel a great distance from the <b>parent</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
25|$|This led to {{long periods}} of {{evolution}} in near complete isolation. The isolation of the island was not absolute, given {{the rise and fall}} of sea level caused by the ebb and flow of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between Tasmania and its neighbour, mainland Australia. Thus new species came to Tasmania while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the <b>parent</b> <b>plant</b> and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the <b>parent</b> <b>plant</b> individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Birds and bats swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. Other seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of such types.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to the British rose hybridizer Henry Bennett, McGredy II grew his <b>parent</b> <b>plants</b> in pots in heated {{greenhouses}} to give {{a longer}} season for seed ripening. He produced many Gold Medal winners and was dubbed 'The Irish Wizard' by other rosarians.|$|R
50|$|After {{the iris}} has flowered, in mid June, it {{produces}} an oblong shaped seed capsule, which is visibly grooved.

25|$|Sugarcane smut infects all {{sugarcane}} species {{unless the}} species is resistant. The damage caused depends on the susceptibility of the species. Sugarcane fields are planted using vegetative cuttings from mother plants so {{they have the same}} genetic make-up of the <b>parent</b> <b>plant.</b> Seeds are not used in propagation because sugarcane is a multi-species hybrid and therefore is difficult to breed. Sugarcane smuts can also infect some other grass species outside of sugarcane. However, mostly it remains on plants of the genus Saccharum.|$|E
25|$|Layering is a {{technique}} in which rooting is encouraged from part of a plant, usually a branch, while it is still attached to the <b>parent</b> <b>plant.</b> After rooting, the branch {{is removed from the}} parent and grown as an independent entity. For bonsai, both ground layering and air layering can create a potential bonsai, by transforming a mature branch into the trunk of a new tree. The point at which rooting is encouraged can be close to the location of side branches, so the resulting rooted tree can immediately have a thick trunk and low branches, characteristics that complement bonsai aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|Pollen's sporopollenin {{outer sheath}} affords it some {{resistance}} to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects; it is also produced in huge quantities. There is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains, often disassociated from their <b>parent</b> <b>plant.</b> The discipline of palynology {{is devoted to the}} study of pollen, which can be used both for biostratigraphy and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive — which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates. Pollen is first found in the fossil record in the late Devonian period and increases in abundance until the present day.|$|E
