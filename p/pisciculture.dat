5|$|<b>Pisciculture</b> {{has made}} {{significant}} advances in the state. At the end of 2009–10, the state produced a surplus of 104.3 million fish seeds. Rubber and tea are the important cash crops of the state. Tripura ranks second to Kerala {{in the production of}} natural rubber in the country. The state is known for its handicraft, particularly hand-woven cotton fabric, wood carvings, and bamboo products. High quality timber including sal, garjan, teak and gamar are found abundantly in the forests of Tripura. Tata Trusts signed a pact with Government of Tripura in July 2015 to improve fisheries and dairy in the state.|$|E

Horticulture covers vegetable, fruits, flowers, ornamental plants, spices, medicinal and aromatic plants, tuber and other root crops, plantation crops (coconut, cashew nut, areca nuts), mushroom etc.|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se com este trabalho determinar a concentração inibitória mínima (MIC) de oxitetraciclina para isolados de Aeromonas hydrophila obtidos de pescado, água de cultivo de peixes e casos de septicemia hemorrágica em peixes. Foi determinado MIC de 100 isolados de A. hydrophila, oriundos de 12 pisciculturas localizadas nos Estados de Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro e Rio Grande do Sul, utilizando a técnica de macrodiluição em caldo. Os resultados demonstraram que 14 isolados apresentaram MIC> 100 µg/mL (resistentes) e 86 apresentaram MIC The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to oxitetracycline in Aeromonas hydrophila strains isolated from marketed fish, pond water of <b>piscicultures</b> and fish suffering hemorrhagic septicemia. These strains were obtained from 12 different <b>piscicultures</b> from Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro e Rio Grande do Sul states. It was determined the MIC to 100 strains, using the broth macrodilution method, and the results showed that 86 strains shown value of MIC 100 µg/mL (classified as resistant). No differences were observed among strains isolated from marketed fish, pond water and disease outbreaks. I was concluded that the variation detected may represent a risk of selection of resistant bacterial strains in aquatic environments under use of oxitetracycline...|$|R
40|$|Neste trabalho foi avaliada a influência do parasitismo branquial por monogenóideos no desenvolvimento de tilápias-do-nilo criadas em 4 tanques-rede, com volume de 4 m 3 cada, durante aproximadamente 5 meses. Os peixes juvenis, apresentando peso médio inicial de 37, 65 g provenientes de outras pisciculturas, foram estocados na densidade de 250 animais. m- 3 e monitorados mensalmente até sua comercialização com peso médio final de 485, 4 g. A prevalência desses ectoparasitas apresentou-se alta, entre 90 e 100 % em todos os meses. Os maiores valores de intensidade média de infestação - IMI e abundância média de infestação - AM ocorreram durante os 2 primeiros meses de cativeiro, apresentando um novo aumento no último mês de criação. Os únicos parasitos da classe Monogenoidea presentes nas brânquias dos animais examinados foram da família Dactylogyridae. Os valores de oxigênio dissolvido, temperatura, pH, nitrito e amônia estiveram dentro da normalidade. Nessas condições, não houve diferenças significativas entre o fator de condição relativo - Kn médio entre os animais parasitados e não parasitados e também nos diferentes níveis de infestação. Assim mostrou que, dentro dessas condições de criação, a relação parasito-hospedeiro-ambiente apresentou- se em equilíbrio sem causar grandes prejuízos aos animais. Tilapias are fish {{originally}} from Africa which nowadays are commercially bred in almost 100 countries, {{being one of}} the most commercially bred species in the world. In this work the trematode population of the monogenoidea group present in the branchiae of Nile tilapias bred in 4 net-ponds with volume of 4 m 3 each, was monitored during 5 months. The juvenile fish, presenting initial average weight of 37. 65 g originated from other <b>piscicultures,</b> were stocked in the density of 250 animals. m- 3 and monthly monitored until their commercialization, with final average weight of 485. 4 g. The prevalence of these ectoparisites was high, between 90 and 100 % in all months. The highest values of average intensity of infestation - AII and average abundance of infection - AAI occurred during the 2 first months of captivity, presenting a new increase in the last month of breeding. The only monogenoidea group present in the branchiae of the animals examined belonged to the Dactylogyridae family. The values of the dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, nitrite and ammonia were within normal rate. In these conditions {{there were no significant differences}} between the relative condition factor - Kn among the parasited and non-parasited animals and also in the different levels of infestation, showing that, in these breeding conditions, the relationship parasite-host-environment presented itself in balance without causing great harm to the animals...|$|R
25|$|Fish farming or <b>pisciculture</b> {{involves}} raising fish commercially {{in tanks}} or enclosures such as fish ponds, usually for food. It {{is the principal}} form of aquaculture, while other methods may fall under mariculture. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally {{referred to as a}} fish hatchery. Worldwide, the most important fish species produced in fish farming are carp, tilapia, salmon, and catfish.|$|E

25|$|Reed was intensively {{harvested}} {{during the}} Communist era. The regime {{had plans to}} transform the delta into a large agro-industrial zone. Although the first modern agricultural exploitation dates from 1939 (Ostrovul Tãtaru), only after 1960 were large areas drained and converted, {{to the detriment of}} the wetlands. In 1991 agricultural land in the delta surpassed 100,000 hectares, and more than a third of its surface has been affected by crop cultivation, forest plantation, or <b>pisciculture.</b> As a result of these changes, along with the increasing pollution and eutrophication of the waters of the Danube, and decades of exploitation and poor fishing regulations, the fish population has been visibly reduced.|$|E
500|$|On February 20, 1877, an act {{entitled}} [...] "Act {{to increase}} the supply of food fishes in the rivers and waters of this State" [...] {{was passed by the}} West Virginia Legislature creating the West Virginia Fish Commission for the purpose of propagating <b>pisciculture</b> for the stocking of streams in West Virginia to transform them into viable fisheries. White was appointed by West Virginia Governor John J. Jacob as one of the inaugural commissioners on June 1, 1877 along with John W. Harris of Greenbrier County and Henry B. Miller of Wheeling. White was appointed for a term of four years. The newly appointed commission convened on July 17, 1877, and White was elected its secretary and Harris as its president.

6000|$|We {{were then}} led down a sandy narrow {{line in the}} bush, {{striking}} south-east, and, after a few yards, we stood before two pieces of marble in a sandy hollow. The tropical climate, more adverse than that of London, had bleached and marked them till they looked like pitted chalk: the larger stump, about two feet high, was bandaged, as if after amputation, with cloths of many colours, and the other fragment lay at its feet. Tom Peter, in a fearful lingua-Franca, Negro-Anglo-Portuguese, told us that his people still venerated the place {{as part of a}} religious building; it is probably the remnant thus alluded to by Lopes de Lima (iii. 1-6): [...] "Behind this point (Padrão) is another monument of the piety of our monarchs, and of the holy objects which guided them to the conquest of Guinea, a Capuchin convent intended to convert the negroes of Sonho; it has long been deserted, and is still so. Even in A.D. 1814, D. Garcia V., the king of Congo, complained in a letter to our sovereign of the want of missionaries." [...] Possibly the ruined convent is the church which we shall presently visit. Striking eastward, we soon came to a pool in the bush sufficiently curious and out of place to make the natives hold it [...] "Fetish;" [...] they declare that it is full of fish, but it kills all men who enter it--"all men" [...] would not include white men. Possibly it is an old piscina; according to the Abbé Proyart, the missionaries taught the art of <b>pisciculture</b> near the village of Kilonga, where they formed their first establishment. The place is marked [...] "Salt-pond" [...] in Barbot, who tells us that the condiment was made there and carried inland.|$|E
