30|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} (EC) {{recorded a}} mean of 324.40  ±  17.98  µS/cm for the raw water. The settled water had a mean EC of 328  ±  22.98  µS/cm. Filtered water recorded 327.40  ±  19.69  µS/cm and the treated water had mean EC of 329.60  ±  22.08  µS/cm. The distributed water recorded mean EC of 331.90  ±  13.48  µS/cm. There was no significant change in EC in the water sampled at the different sites (p >  0.05). This means that the treatment processes did not impact significantly on EC. The average EC of typical, unpolluted rivers is 350  µS/cm (Koning and Roos 1999). The change in EC had strong correlation with total dissolved solids (TDS) (r =  0.984) at the 0.01 level. The EC of water, like TDS, is an indicator of total salt content of the water (Oluyemi et al. 2010). High salt content decreases <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and causes intestinal irritation in humans as well as laxative effects (WHO 1997).

30|$|TDS is {{a common}} {{indicator}} of polluted waters (Tay 2007). The mean levels of TDS measured in the samples were 196.60  ±  11.36  mg/L for the raw water, 199.22  ±  14.74  mg/L, for the settled water, 198.54  ±  12.54  mg/L for the filtered water, 201.26  ±  14.33  mg/L for the treated water and 202.03  ±  8.62  mg/L for the distributed water. There {{was no significant difference}} in TDS between the different sampling points (p >  0.05) and were all within acceptable levels (1, 000  mg/L) for drinking (WHO 2004 a, b). The values did not exceed the critical value (1, 000  mg/L) above which some long-term health problems might be anticipated (Kempster et al. 1997). According to MacCutcheon et al. (1983), the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> with TDS level less than 600  mg/L is generally considered to be good, whereas water with TDS greater than 1, 200  mg/L becomes increasingly unpalatable. Hence, the water from the Water treatment plant could be considered palatable since the mean TDS for the samples in the distribution system were less than 600  mg/L. Barbooti et al. (2010) reported TDS levels of 486 – 864  mg/L which is higher than what is reported for this work.|$|E

This study examined both hedonic and aversive facial/somatic reactions to taste in the rat, in order to confirm the relation of hunger and satiety to taste affect, and to assess whether affective modulation depends upon the cognitive factors that mediate human self-interpretation of affect. In the first experiment, the affective reactions of rats to sweet, bittersweet, and water tastes were assessed in five states of caloric hunger or satiety. Caloric satiety reduced positive hedonic reactions below normal levels. Conversely, 48 -h food deprivation (but not 24 -h deprivation) increased hedonic reactivity. Hedonic enhancement by hunger was not restricted to sweet astes, but also extended to the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Only the hedonic reactions to taste were changed by hunger or satiety: taste aversion was not altered. The second experiment compared the magnitude of affective change during sensory-specific satiety and caloric satiety. Taste-reactivity elicited by sucrose solution or milk was assessed after satiating meals of each of those foods. Sensory-specific satiety further reduced hedonic reactions below the level achieved by caloric satiety alone. Both for caloric satiety and for sensory-specific satiety changes in affect were restricted to positive hedonic reactions: no increase in aversion accompanied the hedonic decrements. These results confirm that taste affect is modulated during caloric hunger, caloric satiety, and sensory-specific satiety. In addition they indicate that the modulation of taste affect by hunger and satiety is confined to the positive limb of the two dimensions (hedonic vs. aversive) of palatability...|$|E

We used a water supply project in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka as a case study to investigate the performance of unit operations in water reatment plants for which the source is shallow surface water sources with high inflows of nutrients. The present case study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of prechlorination, activated carbon adsorption, dissolved air flotation (DAF), filtration and disinfection in removal of cyanotoxins, and taste and odor causing dissolved organic substances from the source water. Raw water quality was evaluated using algal concentration, algal toxin concentration, and chemical oxygen demand. To evaluate the efficacy of treatment operations, the sequence of initial unit operation was changed on each day as with prechlorination and with powdered activated carbon (PAC), with prechlorination and without PAC, without prechlorination and with PAC, and without prechlorination and without PAC. In addition, laboratory analysis was done to obtain adsorption isotherms using three types of different PAC. The primary findings of our study were that PAC was effective in removal of Microcystin and chemical oxygen demand (COD) but needs to be optimized by providing sufficient contact time, and prechlorination does not improve the performance, whereas postchlorination is effective in removing any traces of Microcystin left after PAC. 001 : 10. 10611 (ASCE) HZ. 21 S 3 -SS 1 S. 0000114. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus {{concentrations}} exceed {{water quality}} guidelines {{in most of}} the major rivers in southeastern Quebec. The problem is particularly important in the Pike River, which drains into the Missiquoi Bay of Lake Champlain. Elevated phosphorus concentrations can lead to a reduction in the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> drinking <b>water,</b> a decrease in diversity of aquatic life, and loss of recreational opportunities. These problems have been observed in the Bay. An agricultural field in southeastern Quebec was instrumented to measure and evaluate the partitioning of phosphorus between surface runoff and subsurface drainage, year round. The snowmelt event was the dominant surface and subsurface event for the 2000 / 2001 water year. The 2000 / 2001 water year was unusually dry, which resulted in a limited number of surface and subsurface runoff events. The annual depth of surface runoff at one site was 87. 5 mm. The estimated depth of subsurface runoff of the snowmelt event was 93. 7 mm. Subsurface drainage flow was 51. 7 % of the total volume of runoff from the field during the snowmelt event. The total phosphorus load in surface runoff for the spring snowmelt was 166. 4 g/ha. The estimated total phosphorus load in subsurface drainage for the spring snowmelt was 98. 2 g/ha.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} whether {{highly concentrated}} sodium solutions ([HS] 126 - 164 mmol. L- 1 NaCl) could provide viable strategies before {{during and after}} exercise in the heat to improve cardiovascular and thermoregulatory functioning and exercise performance. To do this it also examined the gustatory responses to HS drinks before, during and after exercise. All studies compared HS with a low sodium control ([LS] 10 - 27 mmol. L- 1). Chapter 4 found that during 3 h recovery from dehydration, ingestion of 120 % body mass losses of HS restored fluid balance {{to a greater extent}} (121 vs. 84 %) than LS. Chapter 7 was the first to investigate the effects of ingesting HS during exercise in the heat and in an untrained population. HS attenuated the decline in stroke volume [SVDrift] and increase in heart rate [HRDrift], but did not affect rectal temperature [TRec], cardiac output, or oxygen uptake during the second of two consecutive 45 min bouts at 55 %. In Chapters 8 and 9 untrained participants ingested either HS or LS during 30 - 45 min pre-exercise rest. HS reduced HRDrift and SVDrift but did not affect TRec during 45 - 60 min exercise at 10 % of the difference between and gas exchange threshold [∆]. HS also increased both time to exhaustion and exercise toleranceduring subsequent exercise bouts at 60 - 70 % ∆. Chapters 5 and 6 found that taste perceptions act as physiological regulators, in this case, one reflecting the priority to restore hyperosmolality over hypovolemia. Exercise-induced dehydration increased the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and decreased the palatability HS, when measured before, immediately after and during 3 h recovery. The changes were highly correlated with physiological indicators of fluid balance. The ingestion of highly concentrated sodium solutions can be both an efficient and acceptable means to improve hydration, reduce cardiovascular stress, and improve exercise performance in the heat. Whilst highly effective, caution should apply since the unpleasant taste evoked by these solutions persists for at least three hours post exercise.

40|$|The United Nations {{estimates}} that water-borne illness accounts for 80 % of deaths {{in developing nations}} and that nearly 1 in 6 {{do not have access}} to clean water (1). However, despite the ability to produce water in the developed world from complex streams such as wastewater or seawater, challenges remain in providing this basic resource in the developing world. Too often the approach has been to apply a high-tech solution, which requires significant technical expertise to run and significant financial resources to repair. Furthermore, as every developing nation faces different challenges, a new solution must be provided for each situation. The objective of this project was to design a water purification system that can be constructed from easily available materials, common to the particular country, and is capable of the complete water purification process. The designed system consisted of a treadle pump (built from wood or bamboo) to pull the water from its source, a filter (made of readily available materials such as sand) to remove contaminants and improve <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> an electrolysis system to allow chlorination from salt water (using locally sourced salt), and a car battery (which could be sourced from a scrapped car) that could be charged by pedaling a mountain bike connected to a DC motor (which could be obtained from a scrapped scooter).

The schematics will be modified according to the ability of locals to understand and construct the system and schematics will be developed for other developing nations with different material resources. Depending on the success of the project, additional funding will be requested to distribute these instructions to as many developing nations as possible. The Phase I research team, Team WaterHOGs, sought to design a simple water purification process that would clean water from alternate sources. One innovation of this system was the novel combination of previously demonstrated technologies into one system that can take water from untreated non-potable water to drinking water. Another unique innovation was the development of a set of instructions that could be used anywhere in the world with locally sourced materials and with minimal use of text. Due to the nature of this technology, the water source must be freshwater (i. e. no ability to turn seawater into drinking water) and chemical contaminants (i. e. PCBs, heavy metals) will not be removed. A higher tech approach would be able to handle seawater (i. e. reverse osmosis system or solar distillation), but at the cost of higher material and energy costs. Since most of the developing nations are dealing with water contaminated with fecal matter, the technology is focused on eliminating microbial contaminants (2). In addition, low technology solutions often provide a longer lasting and less waste-producing solution (3) ...|$|E
40|$|Adequate {{access to}} good quality {{drinking}} water {{is an important}} prerequisite for the wellbeing and survival of people. Increasing competition over scarce freshwater resources with continuous quality deterioration is becoming a serious problem {{in many developing countries}} like Ethiopia, where the technical, socioeconomic and political conditions are impeding the proper utilization of the required resource. The concern of low quality water is either due to direct health impacts of poor quality drinking water or a reduction in the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for humans or animal consumption. The use of contaminated water in food production and/or processing can also be a considerable health concern for people. In rural households, water is used for multiple purposes including income generating activities such as livestock farming. Generally, the interactions among livestock, water and rural communities are very complex. Studies addressing the extent of water scarcity and quality problems in Ethiopia in such contexts are still limited. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of water utilization by farmers and their livestock with respect to potential health and food safety impacts was carried out in two districts of Ethiopia. The specific objectives of the present study were to: (1) assess the constraints and challenges in meeting the water requirements of livestock kept by typical rural communities, (2) assess the utilization of water sources by livestock and people, (3) assess the suitability of water sources for human and livestock consumption based on microbiological and chemical quality indicators, (4) examine the microbiological quality of water at household levels and the potential health impacts, and (5) investigate the potential impacts of poor water quality on the microbiological safety of milk and milk products. The study was carried out in Lume and Siraro districts, both located in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Methodologically, the study encompassed different components: (1) a questionnaire survey complemented by focus group discussions with farmers, (2) assessments of the microbiological and chemical quality of water destined for human and/or livestock consumption, (3) microbiological assessments of milk and milk products produced and consumed by the local communities, and (4) a compilation of secondary data focusing on common human health problems in the districts. The questionnaire survey with 320 randomly selected farmers, the focus group discussions (n= 16) and the compilation of secondary data were carried out from July to October 2010. Water samples were collected from sources and household containers from December 2010 to January 2011 and July to August 2011, corresponding to dry and wet seasons, respectively. During both sampling periods, a total of 25 water sources (sites where water was utilised or fetched for the purpose of human and/or livestock consumption) were assessed for microbiological and chemical quality parameters. A total of 126 and 109 water samples from household containers were collected in the dry and wet season, respectively. In addition, a total of 53 samples of milk and milk products were collected during the wet season and analyzed for E. coli contamination. Water samples collected from ground and surface water sources were analysed for total dissolved solids, pH, manganese, chromium, fluoride, E. coli and total coliforms. The assessed parameters were selected based on their importance to health or aesthetic aspects of water for human and/or livestock uses. The water samples from household containers were only analyzed for microbiological parameters. A summary of disease reports (July 2009 -June 2010) was obtained from the Health Offices of the respective districts to assess the occurrence and impact of water-related human diseases. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the questionnaire survey data. Qualitative data collected in farmers’ group discussions were analyzed by organising the raised issues into logical categories. Mean ranks were calculated to compare the various constraints for livestock production mentioned by farmers. Non-parametric statistical tests were used to compare E. coli counts of water or milk between seasons and districts. The suitability of water sources for livestock and human consumption was evaluated by comparing the assessed quality parameters with recommended values. The study results showed that water sources intended for domestic and livestock uses were either ground water (hand-dug wells, boreholes) or surface water (river, dugout, surface runoff from roadsides). Challenges in the provision of water for livestock and/or people were associated with physical inaccessibility and high seasonal variation in the availability of water sources. Poor quality water for livestock drinking was rather a concern for communities in the proximity of urban settlements or industrial establishments. The mismanagement of harvested rainwater due to indiscriminate access of livestock to the sources was also found to pose high health risks on both livestock and people. Taking E. coli as an indicator of faecal pollution, the assessment of water samples showed that most of the surface water sources were contaminated with faecal materials and did not meet the WHO guidelines for drinking water quality. On the other hand, groundwater sources were microbiologically safe, but chemically contaminated with elements such as fluoride and manganese. In total, 76 % of the water sources (n= 25 points) assessed in this study failed to comply with WHO guidelines for human drinking water in both, the dry and the wet season for at least one parameter of health or aesthetic concern. Regarding pH, fluoride, manganese and chromium, 32 % and 20 % of the water sources were found unfit for livestock consumption in the dry and wet season, respectively. Another potential water-related health risk identified in this study was the considerable re-contamination of water after collection from sources. This can severely compromise the expected health benefits from the installation of improved water sources. For the overall assessed water samples from household containers, it was found that E. coli contamination was higher during the rainy season compared to the dry season. The microbiological assessment of milk produced and consumed in the study area showed a considerable contamination with E. coli. Although the correlation between the E. coli counts of milk and water was weak (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient r= 0. 1), the recorded poor quality water still might have contributed to the low microbiological quality and safety of dairy products produced and consumed in the area. According to the secondary data collected from health offices, water-related human health problems potentially associated with the scarcity, poor quality and mismanagement of water sources were malaria, diarrhoea and gastro-intestinal parasites. Water-related livestock health problems were also reported by the farmers to be mainly associated with drinking water from stagnant dugouts and the industrially polluted Mojo River. In conclusion, the rural communities in the Rift Valley area of Ethiopia lack reliable access to safe water sources, with potential adverse health impacts. A possible priority of action that emanates from this study is a minimization of industrially associated water quality deterioration through the enforcement of existing environmental protection rules and regulations. Concurrently, awareness creation of the owners of the industries on the proper waste disposal mechanisms and environmental accountability should be targeted as one of the key aspects to alleviate the industry-related water pollution. On the other hand, in order to minimize the health risk associated with the mismanagement of rainwater harvesting systems, farmers should be technically supported by the local government in the proper design and management of the systems. Health education remains a necessary and crucial intervention to reduce the re-contamination of water. In this respect particularly women should be addressed, since they are customarily responsible for the collection and handling of water for domestic consumption...|$|E

40|$|Phosphorous {{concentrations}} exceed {{water quality}} guidelines {{in most of}} the major rivers in southern Quebec. The problem is particularly acute in the Pike River, which drains into the Missisquoi Bay of Lake Champlain, in southeastern Quebec. Elevated phosphorus concentrations can lead to a reduction in the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> drinking <b>water,</b> a decrease in diversity of aquatic life and loss of recreational opportunities. All of these problems have been observed in the Bay. Two agricultural fields (the Marchand and Gagnon sites) located on the Pike River watershed, in southeastern Quebec were selected and equipped with instrumentation to measure and evaluate the partitioning of phosphorus between surface runoff and subsurface drainage, on a year round basis. The snowmelt event was the dominant surface and subsurface event for the 2000 / 2001 hydrological year. On the Marchand site surface flow data was incomplete {{as a result of a}} failure of the surface runoff flume. On both sites the IF 200 subsurface flow meters failed, which resulted in missing subsurface flow data during certain runoff events. Therefore, the majority of the comparisons made relate to the Gagnon site. The 2000 / 2001 hydrological year was unusually dry, which resulted in a limited number of surface and subsurface runoff events. The annual depth of surface runoff for the Gagnon site was 87. 5 mm/ha, of which only 0. 2 mm occurred outside the snowmelt event. The estimated depth of subsurface runoff of the snowmelt event at the Gagnon site based upon a water balance equation was 93. 7 mm/ha, or 51. 7 % of the total volume that occurred on the Gagnon field during the snowmelt event. The total phosphorus load in surface runoff for the spring snowmelt at the Gagnon site was 166. 4 g/ha, whereas the estimated total phosphorus load in subsurface drainage was 98. 2 g/ha, or 37. 1 % of the total load. Subsurface drains can therefore be a significant pathway for phosphorus losses...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} 19 meals of {{different}} caloric content on slides on palatability and hypothetical duration of consumption were investigated in 7 patients with anorexia nervosa, 17 patients with bulimia nervosa {{at the beginning}} and after 8 weeks of hospital treatment. Nine healthy females served as controls. At the beginning <b>of</b> treatment, <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> low caloric food was significantly higher and hypothetical duration of consumption of high caloric food was significantly longer in patients when compared to controls. After 8 weeks, in the patients <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> low caloric food had decreased. Dislike for high caloric food remained stable in anorexics...|$|R

40|$|The sugar level, fermentability, and {{acceptability}} by voles of ryegrass straw {{treated with}} different acids were compared. Sugar release was highest with HCl, but acceptability was best with H 3 PO 4 treatment. Candida utilis grew about equally well {{on all of}} the treated samples, except the one treated with 0. 5 N HCl. That sample supported no growth, possibly because the level of chloride or degradation products of monomeric sugars was too high. Fermentability and <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> straw were highest when treated with a combination of 0. 23 N HCl and 0. 15 N H 3 PO 4. Fermentation with Aureobasidium pullulans further increased the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> the acid-treated straw...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) into a country previously without arboreal mammals {{has had a}} pervasive impact on New Zealand's indigenous ecosystems (Green 1984). Possums selectively browse palatable plant species, eliminating some while favouring those that are unpalatable. This results in a progressive change in the species composition of browsed vegetation associations. Measuring diet preferences of free-ranging animals is fraught with problems (Norbury & Sanson 1992), especially when the species concerned are rare or threatened. However, it is particularly important to establish the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> such species to possums, as this will help direct their future conservation management. In this report, we propose a method for assessing the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> selected threatened plant species using captive possums...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine effectiveness of inoculants consisted of lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) combined with addition of rice bran on the physico-chemical characteristics and <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> king grass (Pennisetum hybrid) silage. The experiment was arranged on the factorial randomized design (3 x 3) consisting of the inoculants treatments (control, Lp, Lp+Sc) and the addition level of rice bran (0, 5 and 10 %). The measured variables were physico-chemical characteristics i. e. colour, odour, pH, lactic acid, Fleigh points, and <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> silage. Inoculation of Lp and Lp+Sc improved silage odour and reduced fungal contamination. Silage was treated by Lp+Sc and rice bran (5 - 10 %) showed reduction of pH and an increase of lactic acid and Fleigh points. However, interaction between inoculants and rice bran treatment was not significance. Either inoculation or addition of rice bran tended to enhance the <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> silage in cattle. It concluded that the addition of inoculants L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae with/without addition of 5 - 10 % rice bran could improve the physico-chemical characteristics of silage and its palatability to ruminant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Municipal {{tap water}} is {{increasingly}} treated {{at the point}} of use (POU) to improve the acceptability and <b>palatability</b> <b>of</b> its taste. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the bacteriologic and nutritional characteristics <b>of</b> tap <b>water</b> treated {{at the point of}} use in residential healthcare facilities for the elderly. Two types of POU devices were used: microfiltered water dispensers (MWDs) and reverse-osmosis water dispensers (ROWDs). All samples <b>of</b> <b>water</b> entering the devices and leaving them were tested for the bacteriological parameters set by Italian regulations for drinking water and for opportunistic pathogens associated with various infections in healthcare settings; in addition, the degree of mineralization <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> was assessed. The results revealed widespread bacterial contamination in the POU treatment devices, particularly from potentially pathogenic species. As expected, the use of ROWDs led to a decrease in the saline content <b>of</b> the <b>water.</b> In conclusion, the use of POU treatment in healthcare facilities for the elderly can b...|$|R
