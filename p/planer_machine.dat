The wear mechanisms have been investigated {{through a series of}} cutting experiments performed on an instrumented <b>planer</b> <b>machine.</b> Machining tests were conducted on the usual Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy (workpiece) and cemented carbide tools. Four new coatings were especially designed for the study: 1 diamond (thin layer, about 2 to 3 μm) 2 diamond+TiB 2 +CrN/DLC (diamond like carbon, about 3, 5 μm) 3 diamond (thick layer, 6 μm) 4 TiB 2 +CrN/DLC (3 μm). The performance of each coating material was analysed and compared in one hand to the uncoated carbide tools {{and on the other hand}} to the CBN reinforced carbide tools in terms of cutting forces and tool wear mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Formerly Perupuk {{wood was}} not {{recognized}} as good raw material by wood working manufacturers. Because {{of the increasing}} scarcity of ramin wood, the Perupuk wood had gained {{the benefit of the}} situation as indicated by increasing demand and price of Perupuk wood. The technical and economic studies on Perupuk wood (Lophopetalum. spp) utilization wascarried out at one wood working mill in Gresik, East Java in 1994. The objectives of the study were to identify kind of products resulted from Perupuk utilization, recovery level of each product, productivity and efficiency ofperupuk wood working machineries, and its value added. The study showed that kind of products resulted from Perupuk utilization were moulding,smooth-four-side (S 4 S), finger jointed stick, solid jointed board and finger jointed board. The average recovery of Perupuk utilization was 55 % and the highest recovery (65. 60 %) was obtained by smooth-four-side product. The double <b>planer</b> <b>machine</b> had the highest productivity because all products used the machine to get the standard dimensions. The efficiency of some Perupuk wood working machineries still low. The value added of Perupuk wood working products were 90 %, 55 %, 52 %, 37 % and 24 % for smooth-four-side, finger jointed board, moulding, solid jointed board and fingerjointed stick respectively...|$|E
40|$|Several {{causes of}} tool wear have been {{investigated}} in dry machining of aluminium alloy with cemented carbide insert; {{some of the most}} important are: adhesion and diffusion. The formation of built-up edge (BUE) and adhesive layer on the tool rake face degrades on the one hand, the shape and efficiency of cutting tool and on the other hand, the surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the finished product. This paper describes tool wear mechanisms in dry machining of a usual aluminium–copper alloy (2024) with an uncoated cemented carbide tool (WC–Co). Orthogonal cutting tests were performed using an instrumented <b>planer</b> <b>machine.</b> The morphology of chips, cutting forces and contact lengths were analyzed for several cutting conditions. The tool–chip interface temperature and the average pressure were calculated by conducting calibration–cutting experiments in conjunction with FEM simulations. This allowed to define the contact parameters associated with different cutting conditions on the tool rake face. High-speed camera movies (CCD), white light interferometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were investigated to show the development of the built-up edge and the adhesive layer on the tool rake face during machining process. The results confirmed that the wear mechanisms involve the activation of the chemical and the diffusional phenomenon...|$|E

5000|$|Johnston {{was still}} {{the owner of the}} Mount Molloy sawmill when it burnt down on 31 January 1934, William J Santowski being the manager at the time. It was {{reported}} that [...] "One 350 h.p. boiler was in the destroyed building, also one Sandycroft steam engine; one twin circular log breaking down plant, four saw benches, one <b>planing</b> <b>machine,</b> saw-dust carriers, belting, shafting and pulleys and other tools of various descriptions, 29 circular saws, one log rolling winch, two saw sharpening machines, three cross-cut sawing machines". However, the employees were able to protect the boiler, main engines and pumping plant from serious damage. There were also two other <b>planing</b> <b>machines</b> in a separate building that was not destroyed. Prior to the fire Johnston had purchased machinery for a new sawmill at Shipton's Flat near Cooktown, and after the fire he placed some of the machinery at Mount Molloy. He claimed that the latter was a paying proposition and a very essential part of his organisation. It was also essential to have the mill at Mount Molloy, as most hardwood supplies came from there.|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} noise {{pollution}} in selected sawmills (Mile 3, Mile 1 and Rumuosi sawmills) in Port Harcourt was carried out. Physical {{measurements of the}} noise levels of sawmill machines, including Table Saw, Planing Machine,Stenner 48 Bandsaw, and Sharpening Machine, were made using a digital sound level meter. The background noise of the sawmills ranged 70. 58 – 79. 70 dBA {{in the order of}} Mile 3 > Mile 1 >Rumuosi. The average noise level of sawmill machines for Mile 3, Mile 1 and Rumuosi ranged 89. 76 ± 0. 09 - 100. 49 ± 0. 20 dBA, 89. 81 ± 0. 13 - 97. 00 ± 0. 46 dBA and 89. 76 ± 0. 07 - 100. 10 ± 0. 53 dBA, respectively. In the three sawmills studied, the Sharpening machine recorded the least noise levelwhile the <b>Planing</b> <b>machine</b> had the highest. The noise dose (D) of the Sharpening machine at the three sawmills ranged 0. 97 - 0. 98, which is below the permissible limit of 1, while the D for Table Saw, <b>Planing</b> <b>Machine</b> and Stenner 48 Bandsawranged 1. 86 - 4. 27, which is in excess of 1. From the measured noise level and the estimated D, an empirical model that could predict the recommended time a worker is supposed to work with the identified sawmill machines was developed {{for each of the three}} sawmills. The values obtained for the hearing deterioration indexindicate that the risk of developing hearing loss after 35 years of exposure is likely to be in the order of <b>Planing</b> <b>machine</b> > Table saw >Stenner 48 bandsaw > Sharpening machine. It is concluded that there is noise pollution emanating from these sawmill machines...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Rotary planing {{is one of the}} most valuable machining operations in the timber processing industry. It has been established that cutting tool inaccuracy and forced vibration during the machining process are the primary causes of surface quality degradation. The main aim of this thesis is to design a control architecture that is suitable for adaptive operation of a wood <b>planing</b> <b>machining</b> in order to improve the quality of its surface finish. In order to achieve the stated goal, thorough understanding of the effects of machine deficiencies on surface finish quality is required. Therefore, a generic simulation model for synthesising the surface profiles produced by wood planing process is first developed. The model is used to simulate the combined effects of machining parameters, vibration and cutting tool inaccuracy on the resultant surface profiles. It has been postulated that online monitoring of surface finish quality can be used to provide feedback information for a secondary control loop for the machining process, which will lead to the production of consistently high quality surface finishes. There is an existing vision-based wood surface profile measurement technique, but the application of the technique has been limited to static wood samples. This thesis extends the application of the technique to moving wood samples. It is shown experimentally that the method is suitable for in-process surface profile measurements. The current industrial wood <b>planing</b> <b>machines</b> do not have the capability of measuring and adjusting process parameters in real-time. Therefore, knowledge of the causes of surface finish degradation would enable the operators to optimise the mechanical structure of the machines offline. For this reason, two novel approaches for characterising defects on planed timber surfaces have been created in this thesis using synthetic data. The output of this work is a software tool that can assist machine operators in inferring the causes of defects based on the waviness components of the workpiece surface finish. The main achievement in this research is the design of a new active wood planing technique that combines real-time cutter path optimisation (cutting tool inaccuracy compensation) with vibration disturbance rejection. The technique is based on real-time vertical displacements of the machine spindle. Simulation and experimental results obtained from a smart wood <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> show significant improvements in the dynamic performance of the machine and the produced surface finish quality. Potential areas for future research include application of the defects characterisation techniques to real data and full integration of the dynamic surface profile measurements with the smart wood <b>planing</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
