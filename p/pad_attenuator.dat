2500|$|In {{conventional}} re-amplification, a dry recorded {{signal is}} sent into a balanced XLR input. An unbalanced Â¼" [...] (Tip-Sleeve) phone connector is typically {{used for the}} output, which {{is connected to the}} guitar amp rig. Some re-amping devices offer a <b>pad</b> (<b>attenuator)</b> switch to reduce a too-hot output level. Sometimes a guitar volume pedal or buffered effects pedal can work adequately for re-amping, depending on grounding, levels, and impedance. Another approach to simulating the high impedance of a guitar pickup is to use a passive DI and add a 10 K-ohm resistor in series with the signal connection inside a 1/4" [...] plug.|$|E
5000|$|Bass amps {{come with}} a range of {{different}} input and output jacks, depending on the cost of the amplifier and its intended purpose. The least expensive practice amps may only have a single 1/4" [...] input jack and no output jacks. Some practice amps and small combo amps have RCA or 1/8" [...] inputs for plugging an MP3 player or CD player into the bass amp, to facilitate practicing with a recording. Some amps have a high-gain input, for basses which have internal preamplifiers one the instrument. The high-gain input is routed through a <b>pad</b> (<b>attenuator).</b> An amp may also have a low-gain input, which is unattenuated, for regular basses. Some combo amps have a 1/4" [...] auxiliary input, which could be used to plug in a keyboard, drum machine or second bass.|$|E

50|$|Passive, {{resistive}} <b>pads</b> and <b>attenuators</b> are bidirectional two-ports, but in {{this section}} they will be treated as unidirectional.|$|R
50|$|Although {{a passive}} {{matching}} two-port can have less loss, {{if it does}} {{it will not be}} convertible to a resistive <b>attenuator</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fixed attenuators in {{circuits}} {{are used}} to lower voltage, dissipate power, and to improve impedance matching. In measuring signals, <b>attenuator</b> <b>pads</b> or adapters {{are used to}} lower the amplitude of the signal a known amount to enable measurements, or to protect the measuring device from signal levels that might damage it. Attenuators are also used to 'match' impedance by lowering apparent SWR.|$|R

There is described the theory design input circuits such as <b>attenuator</b> <b>pads,</b> low pass filter, preamplifier, Baxandall tone control and S / PDIF. Based on the theory described are selected optimal designs and their subsequent draft.

40|$|Several {{embodiments}} of RF {{source resistance}} measuring devices are disclosed. Common to all embodiments in the {{feature of the}} inclusion {{of at least one}} variable resistor, and a peak readout meter. In one embodiment, two ganged unloaded potentiometers are employed while another embodiment comprises an automaticnulling RF power bridge circuit with a variable rather than a fixed bridge reference resistance. A third embodiment comprises a calorimeter with a varible rather than a fixed resistor, while in another embodiment <b>attenuator</b> <b>pads</b> with variable resistors are employed...|$|R
40|$|Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) {{are gaining}} {{widespread}} {{popularity in the}} indoor wireless market. Most of the existing research literature on this subject has focused on comparing the advantages of DAS systems with traditional macro cells. The goal of this thesis is to define a performance platform for CDMA based distributed antenna systems which can serve as essential design guidelines for future DAS deployments. One of the major issues presented by DAS systems is the noise floor rise in the reverse link caused by the DAS noise figure. This noise rise becomes a limiting factor in determining capacity and coverage of the DAS based network. The common practice of adding an <b>attenuator</b> (<b>padding)</b> {{in front of the}} Base Station receiver can bring down the noise floor, {{but at the same time}} force the mobile units to transmit at higher power. We establish an operating platform for the DAS so that the system can be effectively operated within the limits of mobile transmit power and base station receive power, maximizing the system capacity...|$|R
