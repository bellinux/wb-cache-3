50|$|There {{are three}} kinds of {{partition}} which can be awarded <b>by</b> court: <b>partition</b> in kind, <b>partition</b> <b>by</b> allotment, and <b>partition</b> <b>by</b> sale. A <b>partition</b> in kind is {{a division of the}} property itself among the co-owners. Partition in kind is a default method of property partition. In a <b>partition</b> <b>by</b> allotment, which is not available in all jurisdictions, the court awards full ownership of the land to a single owner or subset of owners, and orders them to pay the person or persons divested of ownership for the interest awarded. <b>Partition</b> <b>by</b> sale constitutes a forced sale of the land, followed by division of the profits thus realized among the tenants. Generally, the court is supposed to order a partition sale only if the land cannot be physically divided, although this determination often rests on whether the economic value of the divided pieces is less in the aggregate than the value of the parcel as a single piece.

We also present a succession-based connection between integer partitions and set partitions, and obtain an application to the enumeration of partitions of arbitrary subsets of { 1, 2,…,n} by successions...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} a {{resource}} held in tenancy in common {{is likely to be}} underused and underinvested, and is thus better characterized as anticommons. Nevertheless, ten-ancy in common does not necessarily create tragedy, as under most legal regimes each co-tenant has a right to petition for partition at any time, and after partition, newowners are likely to utilize the resourcemore efficiently. Using data fromTaiwan, this article finds that cooperation among co-tenants does not fail as often as the literature has suggested. In 2005 – 2010, at least 82. 5 percent of the co-ownership partitions were conducted through voluntary agreements, while only about 7. 5 percent of the <b>partitions</b> were ordered <b>by</b> the <b>court.</b> In addition, using multinomial logistic regression models, this article finds that the court tends to order, and the plaintiffs tend to petition for, <b>partition</b> <b>by</b> salewhenpartitioning in kind or partial partitionwould create excessively small plots...|$|R
