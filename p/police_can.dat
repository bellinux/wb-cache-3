For group conversations, two keys are used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one from the base station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out.

Upon seeing this, Lois tries to convince Brenda to leave Jeff, but Brenda only makes excuses for Jeff's treatment of her, much to Lois' disapproval. Later, at the bar, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss the matter, asking if the <b>police</b> <b>can</b> solve the situation.

5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} there is a single police {{organization}} and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police officers have no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the <b>police</b> <b>can</b> ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack.|$|E

40|$|Much {{public order}} {{policing}} is still {{based on the}} assumption that crowds are inherently irrational and dangerous. We argue that this approach is both misinformed and counter-productive because it <b>can</b> lead to <b>policing</b> interventions that increase the influence of those advocating violence in the crowd. We challenge traditional assumptions about crowd psychology and demonstrate how widespread conflict derives from the interactions between police and crowds. From this, we develop general guidelines as to how <b>policing</b> <b>can</b> reduce crowd violence and lead crowd members themselves to self-police violent groupings in their midst. We then use examples from anti-globalisation protests and the Euro 2004 football championships to show how these guidelines can be applied in practice and how effective they can be. We conclude by arguing that such knowledge-based crowd <b>policing</b> <b>can</b> turn crowd events into opportunities to overcome seemingly intractable conflicts between the police and groups within our society...|$|R

25|$|Slum {{crime rate}} {{correlates}} with insufficient {{law enforcement and}} inadequate public policing. In main cities of developing countries, law enforcement lags behind urban growth and slum expansion. Often <b>police</b> <b>can</b> not reduce crime because, due to ineffective city planning and governance, slums set inefficient crime prevention system. Such problems is not primarily due to community indifference. Leads and information intelligence from slums are rare, streets are narrow and a potential death traps to patrol, and many in the slum community have an inherent distrust of authorities from fear ranging from eviction to collection on unpaid utility bills to general law and order. Lack of formal recognition by the governments also leads to few formal policing and public justice institutions in slums.|$|E
