40|$|<b>Melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the {{urinary bladder}} {{is a very}} rare {{condition}} characterized by an abnormal black or brownish-black pigmentation of the organ. The pigmentary disorder can involve both the urothelial cell layers and/or the submucosa. The biologic potential <b>of</b> the <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> urinary bladder remains unknown because only a few cases {{have been reported in}} medical literature. So far <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the urinary bladder is not known to occur in cattle. Here we describe the first case <b>of</b> <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the urinary bladder in an inbred red-spotted, 7 -year-old cow. Light, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemic investigations demonstrated melanin pigment in the submucosa and lamina propria but not the urothelium of the bladder. In addition, biochemical characterization of the pigment-laden cells demonstrated that the pigment of this disorder consisted mainly of eumelanin, thus corroborating the morphologic studies. Finally, virologic examination revealed the presence of bovine papillomavirus type 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The term {{melanosis}} in the {{gastrointestinal tract}} {{refers to the}} accumulation of pigment deposits in the mucosa. <b>Melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the colon is not uncommon and {{has been associated with}} certain conditions, however <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the small intestine is extremely rare.

40|$|Melanosis {{can affect}} {{various parts of}} the {{gastro-intestinal}} tract. <b>Melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the colon is not uncom-mon, while <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the ileum is extremely rare. We report a case <b>of</b> <b>melanosis</b> ilei associated with chronic ingestion of oral iron (256 mg of ferrous sul-fate once or twice daily for approximately 5 years) in a 32 -year-old woman with end-stage renal disease. The findings of a colonoscopy, which was performed as a part of her medical checkup, were normal up to the cecum; however, numerous brownish-black punctu-ate pigmentations of the ileal mucosa were observed. Microscopic examination revealed hemosiderosis in the lamina propria of the ileal mucosa, particularly at the tips of villi. The diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>melanosis</b> (hemoside-rosis) ilei was made based on the endoscopic and histological findings. (Gut and Liver 2009; 3 : 315 - 317...|$|R

30|$|PPO {{has been}} {{reported}} as the major contributor for melanosis in Pacific white shrimp (Nirmal and Benjakul 2012). However, pre-cooking at high temperature was able to decrease the melanosis in shrimp (Manheem et al. 2012). Heating or pre-cooking at a higher temperature led to the loss in cooking yield. This was mainly associated with the thermal denaturation of the muscle protein in shrimp, particularly the myosin heavy chain (Benjakul et al. 2011). To produce pre-cooked shrimp with a long shelf life, sufficient pre-cooking is required to inactivate PPO, but it may cause the enhanced cooking loss and quality changes of pre-cooked shrimp. Nevertheless, there is little information regarding the effect of pre-cooking times on quality changes and <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> pre-cooked Pacific white shrimp during refrigerated storage. Therefore, the objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the enzyme activities, properties, and microstructure of pre-cooked Pacific white shrimp as affected by pre-cooking time and to monitor <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> pre-cooked shrimp during the refrigerated storage.|$|R

30|$|PPO, proteases, and <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> pre-cooked Pacific white shrimp were {{affected}} by pre-cooking time. PPO and proteases decreased with increasing pre-cooking time.

Pre-cooked shrimp had the increased cooking loss but lowered melanosis formation after 7 days of refrigerated storage when pre-cooking time increased. Furthermore, the microstructure of shrimp meat was affected by pre-cooking times.

40|$|Background: Frictional dermal {{melanosis}} is aesthetically displeasing. Various modalities {{ranging from}} depigmenting agents to lasers {{have been tried}} but {{it continues to be}} a difficult problem to treat. Objective: To study and compare the efficacy of 15 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 50 % glycolic acid in the treatment <b>of</b> frictional <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the forearm. Materials and Methods: 40 patients <b>of</b> frictional <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the forearm were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups A and B. Pre-peel priming was carried out with 12 % glycolic acid and sunscreen for 2 weeks. Group A was treated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA- 15 %) peel and Group B with glycolic acid (GA- 50 %) peel. Four peels were done one every 15 days. Clinical photographs were taken to assess the response. Response to therapy was evaluated by both objective and subjective methods. The patients were followed up for 3 months after the last peel to note any relapse. Results: Both TCA and glycolic acid peels were effective in frictional melanosis. TCA showed better response compared to glycolic acid {{at the end of the}} treatment, both by subjective and objective methods. However, this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). No permanent side effects were seen in any of the treated patients and the improvement was sustained without any relapse at 3 months. Conclusion: Chemical peeling with both tricholoroacetic acid (15 %) and glycolic acid (50 %) is safe and effective for the treatment <b>of</b> frictional dermal <b>melanosis.</b> Tricholoroacetic acid was found to be marginally superior to glycolic acid...|$|R

40|$|Background Pseudomelanosis {{is due to}} {{deposition}} of pseudomelanin and {{is best known as}} the entity pseudomelanosis coli. However, pseudomelanosis in the urinary tract has never been described. Pigmentation of the urothelium, known as melanosis vesica, is characterized by {{deposition of}} melanin pigment granules without signs of atypia. Simple (true) <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> the bladder is uncommon. Case A 52 -year-old man presented with macroscopic hematuria. Cystoscopy and microscopic evaluation revealed pigmentation of the bladder urothelium diagnosed as pseudomelanosis vesica due to deposits of melaninlike pigment in the absence of detectable melanocytes and detectable by urine cytology.

The aberrant melanogenesis and tumour development were influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Furthermore, crossbreeding experiments between the transgenic mice and Wv mice suggested that the ret gene product can partially compensate for the defect of melanocyte development in Wv mice.

30|$|Protease {{activity}} of pre-cooked Pacific white shrimp {{is depicted in}} Figure[*] 1 b. As the pre-cooking time increased, the continuous decreases in the proteolytic {{activity of}} shrimp cephalothoraxes were observed (p[*]<[*] 0.05). When pre-cooking time reached 30 s, the relative proteolytic activity was sharply decreased from 9.65 % to 1.86 %. The remaining proteases {{might be able to}} activate proPPO to PPO to some degree, thereby inducing melanosis in pre-cooked shrimp during storage (Manheem et al. 2012). It has been suggested that the activation of proPPO is regulated by serine proteases in the hemolymph (Zamorano et al. 2009). Serine and cysteine proteases were reported to be the major proteases in the Pacific white shrimp (Thepnuan 2007). The accessibility of proteolytic enzymes to proPPOs is another important factor affecting <b>melanosis</b> <b>of</b> shrimp (Manheem et al. 2012). Furthermore, proteolytic enzymes leaching from the digestive tract may contribute to proPPO activation during storage (Zamorano et al. 2009). In addition, Yan and Taylor (1991) reported that the activity of PPO from Norway lobster heads including the viscera increased after being activated by endogenous proteases.|$|R

Fluorouracil (5 -fluorouracil, 5 -FU) is a {{pyrimidine}} analogue {{that was}} originally {{known for its}} widespread use as an anticancer drug. The ability of 5 -FU to reduce fibroblastic proliferation and subsequent scarring has made it an important adjunct in ocular and periorbital surgeries.
