His skin is green with purple hair and he wears eyeglasses and a <b>propeller</b> <b>cap.</b> Often in his explanations, he would include his catch phrase [...] "It's very scientific." [...] Lou Lou is his little sister. Wimzie possibly has a crush on him, and, in {{the one of the}} episodes, when Jonas was looking for a map he made to remember where his special dirt was during spring cleaning (his parents wouldn't let him hide it in their house), they thought Rousso vacuumed it up by accident when Loulou found it before he started, and, when Jonas decided they could get it out, Wimzie gave Jonas a kiss on the cheek for that brilliant idea. He, Loulou, and Horace are absent in one episode but mentioned.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe global {{price of}} oil, {{which is both}} finite and limited in quantity, has been rising {{steadily}} because of the increasing requirements for energy in both developing and developed countries. Furthermore, regulations have been strengthened across all industries to address global warming. Many studies of hull resistance, propulsion and operation of ships have been performed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emissions. This study examined the design parameters of the <b>propeller</b> boss <b>cap</b> fin (PBCF) and hub cap for 6, 000 TEU container ships to improve the propulsion efficiency. The design parameters of PBCF have been selected based on the geometrical shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with a propeller open water (POW) test was performed to check the validity of CFD analysis. The design of experiment (DOE) case was selected as a full factorial design, and the experiment was analyzed by POW and CFD analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the correlation among design parameters. Four design alternatives of PBCF were selected from the DOE. The shape of a <b>propeller</b> hub <b>cap</b> was selected as a divergent shape, and the divergent angle was determined by the DOE. Four design alternatives of PBCF were attached to the divergent hub cap, and the POW was estimated by CFD. As a result, the divergent hub cap with PBCF has a negative effect on the POW, which is induced by an increase in torque coefficient. A POW test and cavitation test were performed with a divergent hub cap with PBCF to verify the CFD result. The POW test result showed that the open water efficiency was increased approximately 2 % with a divergent hub cap compared to a normal cap. The POW test result was similar to the CFD result, and the divergent hub cap with the PBCF models showed lower open water efficiency. This was attributed to an increase in the torque coefficient just like the CFD results. A cavitation test was performed using the 2 models selected. The test result showed that the hub vortex is increased downstream of the propeller...|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{remaining}} evidence of the purpose and working life of the site is on the platform. Of the monorail above each engine, only the vertical I-beams, cut off at their base, indicate where they were situated. Engines and propellers were manoeuvred into position using a block and tackle which ran along this monorail. Four steel circles set in the concrete, {{the legs of the}} barrel-type engine stands cut off at their base, show the engine stand position. What remains of the timber sleeper and bitumen floor along the frontal width of stands 1 to 4 delineates the position of the <b>propeller</b> arc. Drum <b>caps,</b> steel plates and pieces of cloth are embedded in the bitumen.|$|R
40|$|Economic {{pressures}} and regulatory requirements have {{brought about a}} great interest in improving ship propulsion efficiency. This can be exercised by installing Energy Saving Devices (ESD) such as <b>Propeller</b> Boss <b>Cap</b> Fins (PBCF). This paper demonstrates an approach for optimising PBCF by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The conducted CFD open water model tests were validated by comparison with experimental data until the simulation was deemed satisfactory within the capabilities and limitations of the model. A design and optimisation procedure was defined to analyse the impact of ESDs on propeller efficiency and then used to evaluate the different geometric parameters and locations of the PBCF on the hub. This analysis was done at full scale using high fidelity CFD - based RANS methods. Outcomes of the study include a design and optimisation process {{that can be used for}} the analysis of other ESDs on the market. The influences of varying the geometry of the PBCF were examined with optimal solutions presented for the analysis case. The impact on the regulated Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and ESD savings were then discussed along with the influences on the energy efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulated and experimental results of propeller-rudder systems with <b>propeller</b> boss <b>cap</b> fins (PBCFs) and analyzes the hydrodynamic performance of PBCFs in propeller-rudder systems. The {{purpose is to}} study the impact of PBCFs on the hydrodynamic performance of rudders. Hydrodynamic experiments were carried out on propeller-rudder systems with PBCFs in a cavitation tunnel. The experimental energy-saving effect of the PBCF without a rudder was 1. 47 % at the design advance coefficient J[*]=[*] 0. 8. The numerical simulation {{was based on the}} Navier–Stokes equations solved with a sliding mesh and the SST (Shear Stress Transfer) k-ω turbulence model. After the grid independence analysis, the flow fields of an open-water propeller with and without a PBCF were compared, then the efficiencies of the propulsion systems including different rudders and the thrust coefficient Kr of rudders were analyzed. The results indicate that the installation of a PBCF increases the resistance of the rudder, which results in a reduction in the energy-saving effect of the PBCF. At the design advance coefficient, the energy-saving effect of the PBCF with an ordinary rudder and a twisted rudder decreases from 1. 47 % to 1. 08 % and 1. 16 %, respectively; thus, it is important to factor in the rudder of a propulsion system when evaluating the energy-saving effects of PBCFs...|$|R
