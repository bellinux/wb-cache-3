The quality of the microchannels and through-holes was observed with optical microscope and SEM images. A part-to-part variation analysis was conducted for ten parts by averaging the channel height, channel width, and hole diameter measurements obtained with an optical profilometer. The results were compared to a research study previously conducted on hot embossed and through-hole punched parts. The walls of the injection molded microchannels were observed to be smoother than the hot embossed microchannels, but ridges were detected on the outmost channels of the injection <b>molded</b> <b>parts</b> which resulted in measurement errors. The through-holes of the injection <b>molded</b> <b>parts</b> formed completely, without burrs or flash, {{in contrast to the}} through-hole punched parts where the quality of the hole varied by the substrate material.

The average channel height variance ratios were approximately the same for injection molding and hot embossing, while injection molding had less than half the variance ratio for the channel width. The hole diameter variance ratios of the injection <b>molded</b> <b>parts</b> averaged 0. 094 %, making it better than the other dimensions. No consistent expansion or shrinkage rate was observed in the injection <b>molded</b> <b>parts,</b> but the hot embossed sites primarily experienced shrinkage. by Nancy Diaz. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{report was}} carried out to study {{experimentally}} the water-assisted injection molding process of glass fiber-reinforced polyamide- 6 (Nylon- 6) composites. Experiments were carried out on an 80 ton injection molding machine equipped with a lab scale water injection system, which included a water pump, a water injection pin, a pressure accumulator, a water tank equipped with a temperature regulator, and a control circuit. The materials used were Nylon and 30 % glass fiber-filled Nylon composites. A spiral mold cavity was used to mold the composites. After molding, the lengths of water penetration in <b>molded</b> <b>parts</b> were measured. The effects of different processing parameters on the lengths of water penetration were determined: melt temperature, mold temperature, melt-filling speed, short-shot size, water pressure, water temperature, water hold, and water injection delay time.
