5|$|If {{the target}} value {{is greater than}} the {{greatest}} value in the array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar <b>problem</b> <b>will</b> occur if the target value is smaller than the least value in the array and the first index of the array is the smallest representable value of R. In particular, this means that R must not be an unsigned type if the array starts with index 0.|$|E
5|$|Relatives of the Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{arise in}} the problem of finding the minimum perimeter shape that encloses a fixed amount of area and includes three specified points in the plane. For {{a wide range of}} choices of the area parameter, the optimal solution to this <b>problem</b> <b>will</b> be a curved triangle whose three sides are circular arcs with equal radii. In particular, when the three points are equidistant from each other and the area is that of the Reuleaux triangle, the Reuleaux triangle is the optimal enclosure.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the impact}} of the predatory deaths {{resemble}} Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People, with the mayor of a small town panicking over how a <b>problem</b> <b>will</b> drive away the tourists. Another source of comparison raised by critics was Moby-Dick, particularly regarding Quint's characterization and the ending featuring a confrontation with the shark; Quint even dies the same way as Captain Ahab. The central character, Chief Brody, fits a common characterization of the disaster genre, an authority figure who is forced to provide guidance to those affected by the sudden tragedy. Focusing on a working class local leads the book's prose to describe the beachgoers with contempt, and Brody to have conflicts with the rich outsider Hooper.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies show}} that, {{although}} brats move on average every 3 years, {{they do not}} grow accustomed to moving. The constantly changing environment and openness to others has a price.

If a person does not like somebody or gets into a fight, they know {{that in a few}} years somebody will move and the <b>problem</b> <b>will</b> disappear. On the other hand, when brats marry it is generally for life; over two thirds of brats over 40 are married to their first spouse.

500|$|Since , {{it shows}} that {{a small part of}} the program which cannot be parallelized will limit the overall speedup {{available}} from parallelization. A program solving a large mathematical or engineering <b>problem</b> <b>will</b> typically consist of several parallelizable parts and several non-parallelizable (serial) parts. If the non-parallelizable part of a program accounts for 10% of the runtime (p = 0.9), we can get no more than a 10 times speedup, regardless of how many processors are added. This puts an upper limit on the usefulness of adding more parallel execution units.
