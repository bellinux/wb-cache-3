25|$|After a short stay in Cincinnati {{to work as}} {{a naturalist}} and {{taxidermist}} at a museum, Audubon traveled south on the Mississippi with his gun, <b>paintbox,</b> and assistant Joseph Mason, who stayed with him from October 1820 to August 1822 and painted the plant life backgrounds of many of Audubon's bird studies. He was committed to find and paint all the birds of North America for eventual publication. His goal was to surpass the earlier ornithological work of poet-naturalist Alexander Wilson. Though he could not afford to buy Wilson's work, Audubon used it to guide him when he had access to a copy.|$|E
500|$|In Ancient Egypt, {{green was}} {{the symbol of}} {{regeneration}} and rebirth, and of the crops {{made possible by the}} annual flooding of the Nile. [...] For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus, Egyptian artists used finely ground malachite, mined in the west Sinai and the eastern desert; a <b>paintbox</b> with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun. They also used less expensive green earth pigment, or mixed yellow ochre and blue azurite. To dye fabrics green, they first colored them yellow with dye made from saffron and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the woad plant.|$|E
500|$|John Gielgud {{has written}} that playing Prospero in a film of The Tempest was his life's ambition. Over the years, he {{approached}} Alain Resnais, Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles to direct. Eventually, the project was taken on by Peter Greenaway, who directed Prospero's Books (1991) featuring [...] "an 87-year-old John Gielgud and an impressive amount of nudity". Prospero is reimagined {{as the author of}} The Tempest, speaking the lines of the other characters, as well as his own. Although the film was acknowledged as innovative in its use of Quantel <b>Paintbox</b> to create visual tableaux, resulting in [...] "unprecedented visual complexity", critical responses to the film were frequently negative: John Simon called it [...] "contemptible and pretentious".|$|E
40|$|Two <b>paintboxes</b> of Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (1857 - 1929), {{that were}} {{probably}} used about 1920, contain 64 paint tubes of an English supplier (Winsor & Newton) and three French (Morin & Janet, C. Bourg√®s and Lefranc). There {{is a great}} variety of earths with yellow, red or brown colors. On the contrary, there is just one type of paints of white, black or green color. The most abundant tubes are those of ochre, sienna, umber, lead white and ultramarine blue pigments; the least frequent ones are those of cadmium yellow, bitumen,Van Dyck brown, cobalt blue and bone black. The most important absence is that of zinc white. In general, there is a distinct preference for traditional pigments. By X-rays fluorescence spectrometry, white materials used as fillers were detected in some tubes and it was verified that one of the paints identified in the label as ochre, in reality is umber. The <b>paintboxes</b> also contain 43 brushes, in general very worn. Although it exists in the literature one reference to the poor state of conservation of Columbano's paintings, resulting from a great use of bitumen, such statement is not supported, neither by the <b>paintboxes,</b> nor by the conservation processes in archive at the Portuguese Institute of Conservation and Restoration. In general, the pigments found in the <b>paintboxes</b> don't seem to predict significant problems in Columbano's paintings...|$|R
5000|$|In 1981, Quantel {{released}} the [...] "Paintbox", the first broadcast-quality turnkey system designed for {{creation and composition}} of television video and graphics. Its design emphasized the studio workflow efficiency required for live news production. Essentially, it was a framebuffer packaged with innovative user software, and it rapidly found applications in news, weather, station promos, commercials, and the like. Although it was essentially a design tool for still images, it was also sometimes used for frame-by-frame animations. Following its initial launch, it revolutionised the production of television graphics, and some <b>Paintboxes</b> are still in use today due to their image quality, and versatility.|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} scene {{composed}} of 2 D discrete objects is presented. A generalization of 2 1 2 D positioning features usually implemented in 2 1 2 D environments is given, treating object superimposition. The positioning representation lays on an explicit topological and geometrical encoding of object boundaries. This approach allows structured manipulations of objects (intersection, combination, : : :) {{as it is}} Euclidean 2 D objects and efficient redisplay of scene, such that every modified pixel is drawn exactly once. Moreover, this model is consistent from a geometrical and topological {{point of view and}} allows the construction of a scene from a digital image.

In 1988 the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) acknowledged the iconic status of Vanda & Young when they were inducted into the inaugural Hall of Fame, in 2005 The Easybeats were also inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) surveyed 100 music industry personalities for the APRA Top Ten Best Australian Songs of All Time where [...] "Friday on My Mind" [...] was declared No. 1.

These tracks would later appear on the album Tales of Old Grand-Daddy released in 1974 on EMI.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s, Richard Hamilton enjoyed {{international}} acclaim with {{a number}} of major exhibitions being organised of his work. Hamilton had found a new companion in painter Rita Donagh. Together they set about converting North End, a farm in the Oxfordshire countryside, into a home and studios. [...] "By 1970, always fascinated by new technology, Hamilton was redirecting advances in product design into fine art, with the backing of xartcollection, Zurich, a young company that pioneered the production of multiples with the aim of bringing art to a wider audience." [...] Hamilton realised a series of projects that blurred the boundaries between artwork and product design including a painting that incorporated a state-of-the-art radio receiver and the casing of a Dataindustrier AB computer. During the 1980s Hamilton again voyaged into industrial design and designed two computer exteriors: OHIO computer prototype (for a Swedish firm named Isotron, 1984) and DIAB DS-101 (for Dataindustrier AB, 1986). As part of a television project, 1987 BBC series Painting with Light [...] Hamilton was introduced to the Quantel <b>Paintbox</b> and has since used this or similar devices to produce and modify his work.|$|E

I like beautiful places and beautiful things, but I hate the impersonality of it all. I want to feel the touch of lace and furs and fine linen, to eat soft food, to listen to music, to ride when I want to, to sleep when I want to, to have friends who admire me, men friends worth speaking to, different from these yokels round here.

The individual boxes may vary in theme and technique depending on the artist, but as the program is city-wide, <b>PaintBox</b> has become a dynamic art installation in itself.

50|$|The {{cover for}} The Miracle, rock band Queen's studio album, was created on a Quantel <b>Paintbox</b> in 1989. It {{was used by}} six artists and designers, {{including}} David Hockney and Richard Hamilton, to create original artwork in the 1986 BBC series Painting with Light. Quantel also placed a number of <b>Paintbox</b> IV series systems in art schools in the UK. One recipient, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art had recently appointed the video artist Stephen Partridge as a lecturer who then established (1984) The Television Workshop to support artists and filmmakers' production and access to high-level broadcast technology. Over 400 productions were supported in this way from 1984 to 1992 until desktop video pre-empted the need. Artists and filmmakers using the workshop included Jeff Keen, Robert Cahen, Tamara Krikorian, Pictorial Heroes, Judith Goddard and many others. The music video for Dire Straits' Money for Nothing was created on a Bosch FGS-4000 3D animation system using a Quantel <b>Paintbox</b> for backgrounds and textures.|$|E

Though the new sound was well received, it never lived up to the energy and spark generated by Mod Fun. <b>Paintbox</b> recorded a demo tape produced by (future [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] Editor,) Jim DeRogatis which was never released, and, later, one track which ultimately appeared on Mod Fun's retrospective CD [...] "Past...Forward".|$|E

Richard Shoup ported his 1973 paint program Superpaint to Windows for demonstration purposes, and was able to demonstrate that Superpaint had particular features before Quantel's <b>Paintbox.</b> Shoup's port is available for download from his personal website.|$|E
