25|$|An {{identical}} {{phenomenon is}} much more commonly seen with Ancylostoma caninum infections in dogs, where the newborn pups can even die of hemorrhaging from their intestines caused by massive numbers of feeding hookworms. This also reflects the close evolutionary link between the human and canine parasites, which <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> common ancestor dating back to when humans and dogs first started living closely together.|$|E
25|$|Arklow, Ireland has a {{long history}} of ship-owning. According to local tradition, it extends back to the export of tin and copper by the Phoenicians. The fleet was locally owned, managed, {{mastered}} and manned. Each ship was an individual enterprise, each divided into 64 shares. A captain would <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 25% interest in his ship: that is 16 shares. The owner listed in documents was the managing owner, not necessarily the beneficial owner. The Arklow shipowners cooperated: they established their own mutual insurance company. A century ago, ownership became concentrated. In 1966 Tyrrell and Hall formed an umbrella company to operate their ships: Arklow Shipping. By November 2011 they had a modern fleet of about 45 ships.|$|E

25|$|Delayed sleep phase {{disorder}} (DSPD), {{more often}} known as delayed sleep phase syndrome {{and also as}} delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, is a chronic dysregulation of a person's circadian rhythm (biological clock), compared {{to the general population}} and relative to societal norms. The disorder affects the timing of sleep, peak period of alertness, the core body temperature rhythm, and hormonal and other daily cycles. People with DSPD generally fall asleep some hours after midnight and have difficulty waking up in the morning. People with DSPD <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> circadian period significantly longer than 24 hours. Depending on the severity, the symptoms can be managed {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, but no cure is known, and research suggests a genetic origin for the disorder.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{habitats}} of the {{black-footed ferret}} included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed ferrets use prairie dog burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover. Six black-footed ferret nests found near Mellette County, South Dakota, {{were lined with}} buffalo grass, prairie threeawn, sixweeks grass, and cheatgrass. High densities of prairie dog burrows provide {{the greatest amount of}} cover for black-footed ferrets. Black-tailed prairie dog colonies contain a greater burrow density per acre than white-tailed prairie dog colonies, and may be more suitable for the recovery of black-footed ferrets. The type of prairie dog burrow may be important for occupancy by black-footed ferrets. Black-footed ferret litters near Meeteetse, Wyoming, were associated with mounded white-tailed prairie dog burrows, which are less common than non-mounded burrows. Mounded burrows contain multiple entrances and <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> deep and extensive burrow system that protects kits. However, black-footed ferrets used non-mounded prairie dog burrows (64%) more often than mounded burrows (30%) near Meeteetse, Wyoming.|$|E
500|$|When The Chemical Brothers {{started to}} write music again after {{finishing}} the album Come with Us (2002), [...] "The Boxer" [...] {{was one of}} the earliest tracks that they wrote for their next album, Push the Button (2005). The Charlatans lead singer Tim Burgess, who had collaborated on the duo's debut album track [...] "Life Is Sweet" [...] ten years earlier, contributed the vocals to this song. According to the group, out of all collaborators, Burgess still remained a close friend to them. [...] "If he's in London, we would <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> drink together, three of us, or, you know, when we're in LA, he will come to our gig," [...] they shared.|$|E

500|$|As {{revealed}} by a video shown on C-SPAN, when questioned by a New Hampshire resident about his grades in law school, Biden had replied [...] "I think I <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> much higher IQ than you do, I suspect," [...] and then inaccurately recollected graduating in the [...] "top half" [...] {{of his class}} when he actually graduated 76th from 85, that he had attended law school on a full scholarship, and had received three degrees in college. In fact, he had earned a single B.A. with a double major in history and political science, and had received a half scholarship to law school based on financial need with some additional assistance based in part upon academics. [...] During this time, Biden also released his undergraduate grades, which were unexceptional.|$|E
500|$|Abra {{returned}} {{yet again}} to Holby in episode [...] "The Human Jungle". [...] Initially, Kyla was furious with him, and resisted {{his attempts to}} win her backblaming him {{for the death of}} her ex-husband, which occurred in his absence and resulted in her son being taken into foster care. [...] However, Abra persisted, and was able to convince her to resume their relationship, and move in with him. Ayola said of the relationship at the time: [...] "It's love! Well, she loves him but I think he loves moving around the world more. He's a drifter. I wouldn't put any money on a happy ending for them. He's such a rolling stone and she's so emotionally wrong that I don't think it's going to work. On the plus side, I think this pair <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fantastic sex life and a great time down the pub." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{controversial}} {{element of}} the CCE's plans was {{the extension of the}} railway to Golders Green. The route of the tube tunnels took the line under Hampstead Heath and strong opposition was raised, concerned about the effect that the tunnels would have on the ecology of the Heath. The Hampstead Heath Protection Society claimed that the tunnels would drain the sub-soil of water and the vibration of passing trains would damage trees. Taking its lead from the Society's objections, The Times published an alarmist article on 25 December 1900 claiming that [...] "a great tube laid under the heath will, of course, act as a drain; and it is quite likely that the grass and gorse and trees on the Heath will suffer from the loss of moisture... Moreover, it seems to be established beyond question that the trains passing along these deep-laid tubes shake the earth to its surface, and the constant jar and quiver will <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> serious effect upon the trees by loosening their roots." ...|$|E

500|$|Bell et al. {{wrote that}} while there was an ongoing debate over the origins of homosexuality, there is {{evidence}} supporting the view that homosexuality has a biological basis, and that hormonal factors could be involved. Though they acknowledged that their study {{did not have the}} necessary data to explain how sexual preference might be related to biology, Bell et al. wrote that their findings were consistent with what one would expect to find if sexual preference had a biological basis. They suggested that biological factors <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> more powerful influence on exclusive homosexuals than on bisexuals, and {{that if there is a}} biological basis to homosexuality, it probably accounts for gender nonconformity as well as sexual orientation. They also proposed that the [...] "familial factors commonly thought to account for homosexuality" [...] may actually result from the way parents react to their prehomosexual children. Bell et al. argued that demonstrating that homosexuality is biologically innate would lead to greater social tolerance, and help to relieve parents of gay people of guilt. They expressed hope that researchers would eventually produce more definitive answers about the origins of homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|It is {{very unusual}} {{to find a}} helmet of this type on a native {{ceremonial}} site. It was probably made between 25 and 50 AD, close to {{the date of the}} conquest of Britain in 43 AD; this makes it one of the earliest Roman helmets ever found in Britain. Other British examples of later date were found in isolation away from settlements, as in the cases of the Guisborough Helmet and Crosby Garrett Helmet, or on Roman sites, as with the Newstead Helmet. Various suggestions have been put forward as to why the helmet ended up at Hallaton; it may have been owned by a Briton who served in the Roman cavalry, {{it may have been a}} diplomatic gift from the Romans or it may have been captured in war. According to Dr Jeremy Hill of the British Museum, the first explanation is the most likely: [...] "Here you <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> situation where local Britons are fighting on the Roman side." [...] The Roman cavalry at this time was mostly recruited from native allies, not Italians, suggesting that Britons fought alongside the Romans as they carried out their conquest of Britain.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Diamandis took {{inspiration}} from the differing musical tastes of her parents – Dolly Parton, Enya and George Michael from her mother, and Haris Alexiou from her father – while also admiring pop acts of the era including the Spice Girls, Britney Spears and S Club 7. Diamandis has revealed that [...] "Madonna was the reason I {{wanted to be a}} pop star from the age of 15," [...] however she also stated that she did not listen to music [...] "properly" [...] until the age of 19, when she took influence from acts including PJ Harvey, Fiona Apple and The Distillers. She began smoking two years later in an attempt to sound like The Distillers' frontwoman Brody Dalle, [...] "but it never worked, and now I'm just stuck with a bad habit." [...] She has cited Dalle and Spears as her musical influences, and has expressed a particular interest in Daniel Johnston and the lo-fi production he uses. She has jokingly stated that [...] "I <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bit of a different sound because I don't really know what I'm doing!," [...] referencing her lack of formal musical training. Diamandis has synesthesia, and as a result associates particular colours with musical notes and days of the week.|$|E

They'd <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
