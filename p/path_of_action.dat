[...] "Pardon, Honorable Sirs, this digressive exultation. I cannot suppress the pride which I feel in this successful achievement of a measure so fortunate for your interests and the national honor; for that pride is the source of my zeal, so frequently exerted in your support, and never more happily than in those instances in which I have departed from the prescribed and beaten <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> and assumed a responsibility which has too frequently drawn on me the most pointed effects of your displeasure. But however I may yield to my private feelings in thus enlarging on the subject, my motive in introducing it was immediately connected with its context, and was to contrast the actual state of your political affairs, derived from a happier influence, with that which might have attended an earlier dissolution of it": and he did value himself upon [...] "the patience and temper with which he had submitted to all the indignities which have been heaped upon him" [...] (meaning, by the said Court of Directors) [...] "in this long service"; and he did insolently attribute to an unusual strain of zeal for their service, that he [...] "persevered in the VIOLENT MAINTENANCE OF HIS OFFICE." ...|$|E

6000|$|It is an {{inherent}} peculiarity {{of a mind}} like Hamlet's {{that it should be}} conscious of its own defect. Men of his type are forever analyzing their own emotions and motives. They cannot do anything, because they always see two ways of doing it. They cannot determine on any course of action, because they are always, as it were, standing at the cross-roads, and see too well the disadvantages of every one of them. It is not that they are incapable of resolve, but somehow the band between the motive power and the operative faculties is relaxed and loose. The engine works, but the machinery it should drive stands still. The imagination is so much in overplus, that thinking a thing becomes better than doing it, and thought with its easy perfection, capable of everything because it can accomplish everything with ideal means, is vastly more attractive and satisfactory than deed, which must be wrought at best with imperfect instruments, and always falls short of the conception that went before it. [...] "If to do," [...] says Portia in the Merchant of Venice,--"if to do were as easy as to know what 't were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces." [...] Hamlet knows only too well what 't were good to do, but he palters with everything in a double sense: he sees the grain of good there is in evil, and the grain of evil there is in good, as they exist in the world, and, finding that he can make those feather-weighted accidents balance each other, infers that there is little to choose between the essences themselves. He is of Montaigne's mind, and says expressly that [...] "there is nothing good or ill, but thinking makes it so." [...] He dwells so exclusively in the world of ideas that the world of facts seems trifling, nothing is worth the while; and he has been so long objectless and purposeless, so far as actual life is concerned, that, when at last an object and an aim are forced upon him, he cannot deal with them, and gropes about vainly for a motive outside of himself that shall marshal his thoughts for him and guide his faculties into the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> He is the victim not so much of feebleness of will as of an intellectual indifference that hinders the will from working long in any one direction. He wishes to will, but never wills. His continual iteration of resolve shows that he has no resolution. He is capable of passionate energy where the occasion presents itself suddenly from without, because nothing is so irritable as conscious irresolution with a duty to perform. But of deliberate energy he is not capable; for there the impulse must come from within, and the blade of his analysis is so subtile that it can divide the finest hair of motive 'twixt north and northwest side, leaving him desperate to choose between them. The very consciousness of his defect is an insuperable bar to his repairing it; for the unity of purpose, which infuses every fibre of the character with will available whenever wanted, is impossible where the mind can never rest till it has resolved that unity into its component elements, and satisfied itself which on the whole is of greater value. A critical instinct so insatiable that it must turn upon itself, for lack of something else to hew and hack, becomes incapable at last of originating anything except indecision. It becomes infallible in what not to do. How easily he might have accomplished his task is shown by the conduct of Laertes. When he has a death to avenge, he raises a mob, breaks into the palace, bullies the king, and proves how weak the usurper really was.|$|E

Gameplay that seeks out these spaces and these phenomena, that searches for such clues to the underlying construction of the virtual environment, {{is a kind of}} virtual-world naturalism, at once a return to an investigative urge that has been subsumed to the exhaustive mapping and description of the real world and a form of resistance to the very idea <b>of</b> pre-defined <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> <b>of</b> externally imposed limits, in virtual worlds as well as in our own...|$|R

50|$|Arcanum is {{an example}} of a {{non-linear}} role-playing game. At various points throughout the game, players may take the story in different directions, sometimes permanently removing different <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The game's central quest ultimately develops according to how players navigate its dichotomies, the most apparent being that of magic and technology. Many of the game's side quests allow for more than one solution depending on the player character's specializations and certain portions of the main quest can be solved more easily through dialogue than through combat. The game's magic/technology and good/evil alignments also influence what followers a character can attract throughout the game or how other NPCs will react to the player.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1990s, sociologists {{focused on}} {{different}} aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant. For Cooley (1992), pride and shame {{were the most important}} emotions that drive people to take various social actions. During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the [...] "looking glass" [...] that the gestures and reactions of others provide. Depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Retzinger (1991) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. Drawing predominantly on Goffman and Cooley's work, Scheff (1990) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.|$|R

40|$|Authors {{propose a}} {{conceptual}} model {{of participation in}} viral diffusion process composed of four stages: awareness, infection, engagement and action.

The results show that the participation in each stage of the process increases the probability of reaching the final action. Nevertheless, the majority of users involved in the virtual event did not go through each stage of the process but followed the shortcuts. That suggests that the viral diffusion process is not necessarily a linear sequence <b>of</b> human <b>actions</b> but rather a dynamic system.

50|$|Ecological {{rationality}} challenges {{rational choice}} theory (RCT) as a normative account of rationality. According to rational choice theory, an action is considered rational if the action follows from preferences and expectations that satisfy {{a set of}} principles. These principles are often justified based on consistency considerations - for example, intransitive preferences and expectations inconsistent with available information are ruled out. Rational choice theory therefore cashes out practical rationality as the optimal <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> given one's subjective representation of reality.|$|E

5000|$|Jñāna yoga, {{also known}} as Jnanamarga, {{is one of the}} several spiritual paths in Hinduism that {{emphasizes}} the [...] "path of knowledge", {{also known as}} the [...] "path of self-realization".

The other two are karma yoga (<b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> karmamarga) and bhakti yoga (path of loving devotion to a personal god, bhaktimarga). Later, new movements within Hinduism added raja yoga as the fourth spiritual path, but this is not universally accepted as distinct to other three.|$|E
50|$|In Lagrangian mechanics, if {{the system}} has holonomic constraints, then one {{generally}} adds Lagrange multipliers to the Lagrangian to account for them.

In this case, going to the Hamiltonian formalism introduces a constraint on phase space in Hamiltonian mechanics, but the solution is similar.|$|R

[...] To cope with inability to make decisions, the Doctor prescribes three therapies: the arbitrary principles of Sinistrality ("If the alternatives are side by side, choose the one on the left"), Antecedence ("if they're consecutive in time, choose the earlier") and Alphabetic Priority ("choose the alternative whose name begins with the earlier letter of the alphabet").|$|R

50|$|Later work on {{game theory}} {{established}} that {{an ability to}} commit to a clear <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> can be valuable when bargaining among {{a small number of}} players. The value of commitment arises in these situations because by “binding oneself” a party can credibly commit to a pattern of competitive actions or reactions, and therefore affect the expectations and actions of other parties and the resulting competitive dynamics. Strategic delegation models flourished in the game-theoretical industrial organization economics literature following the seminal contributions of Vickers (1985), Fershtman and Judd (1987), and Sklivas (1987) formalizing this idea of commitment through delegation to agents.|$|E

30|$|Third, {{humanitarian}} {{innovation is}} frequently both described and decried as a buzzword. However, {{there is a}} difference between these empirical claims and a critical analytical engagement with humanitarian innovation as a buzzword. This article understands buzzwords and political economy considerations to play important roles in such theories of change, but they are not theories in themselves. As Cornwall and Brock (2005) explain, buzzwords lend the legitimacy that aid actors need to justify their interventions. Buzzwords frame problems by distinguishing some aspects of a situation from others—and in so doing, define <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Buzzwords are used to create problem statements that inherently call for certain kinds of solutions (Cornwall and Brock 2005). Successful buzzwords engender institutional consequences: A political economy perspective allows for paying attention to how issues travel from being “forgotten” or “ignored” to becoming an industry that appropriates funding at the expense of attention and resources to other humanitarian needs and problems, including addressing root causes (Dijkzeul 2015).|$|R
