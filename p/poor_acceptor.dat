The ‘original’ glycosynthase, derived from Agrobacterium sp. β-glucosidase (Abg) by mutating the nucleophile glutamate to alanine (E 358 A), synthesizes oligosaccharides in yields exceeding 90 % [Mackenzie, L.

Thus <b>poor</b> <b>acceptors</b> for Abg E 358 A, such as PNP-GlcNAc, are successfully glycosylated by E 358 S, allowing the synthesis of PNP-β-LacNAc.

40|$|The {{structural}} stabilizing {{property of}} 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol (TFE) in peptides {{has been widely}} demonstrated, More recently, TFE {{has been shown to}} enhance secondary structure content in globular proteins, and to influence quaternary interactions in protein multimers. The molecular mechanisms by which TFE exerts its Influence on peptide and protein structures remain poorly understood. The present analysis integrates the known physical properties of TFE with a variety of experimental observations on the interaction of TFE with peptides and proteins and on the properties of fluorocarbons. Two features of TFE, namely the hydrophobicity of the trifluoromethyl group and the hydrogen bonding character (strong donor and <b>poor</b> <b>acceptor),</b> emerge as the most important factors for rationalising the observed effects of TFE. A model is proposed for TFE interaction with peptides which involves an initial replacement of the hydration shell by fluoroalcohol molecules, a process driven by apolar interactions and favourable entropy of dehydration.

40|$|Dextransucrase (DSR-S) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B- 512 F is a glucosyltransferase that catalyzes {{synthesis}} of soluble dextran from sucrose. In {{the presence of}} efficient acceptor molecules, such as maltose, the reaction pathway is shifted toward glucooligosaccharide synthesis. Like glucosyltransferases from oral streptococci, DSR-S possesses a C-terminal glucan-binding domain composed {{of a series of}} tandem repeats. In order to determine the role of the C-terminal region of DSR-S in dextran or oligosaccharide synthesis, four DSR-S genes with deletions at the 3 ′ end were constructed. The results showed that the C-terminal region modulated the initial velocity of dextran synthesis but that the Km for sucrose, the optimum pH, and the activation energy were all unaffected by the deletions. The C-terminal domain modulated the rate of oligosaccharide synthesis whatever acceptor molecule was used (a good acceptor molecule such as maltose or a <b>poor</b> <b>acceptor</b> molecule such as fructose). The C-terminal domain seemed to play no role in the catalytic process in dextran and oligosaccharide synthesis.

The APS-sulfite redox couple has a E0' of -60 mV, which allows APS to be reduced by either NADH or reduced ferrodoxin using the enzyme adenylyl-sulfate reductase (Apr), which requires the input of 2 electrons.

Liver, oyster, or mycobacterial glycogens {{were the best}} acceptors, whereas amylopectin had good activity, but amylose was a <b>poor</b> <b>acceptor.</b> Maltosaccharides inhibited the transfer of maltose from [14 C]maltose- 1 -P to glycogen because they were also acceptors of maltose, and they caused production of larger sized radioactive maltosaccharides. When maltotetraose was the acceptor, over 90 % of the 14 C-labeled product was maltohexaose, and no radioactivity was in maltopentaose, demonstrating that maltose was transferred intact. Stoichiometry showed that 0. 89 μmol of inorganic phosphate was produced for each micromole of maltose transferred to glycogen, and 56 % of the added maltose- 1 -P was transferred to glycogen. This enzyme has been named α 1, 4 -glucan:maltose- 1 -P maltosyltransferase (GMPMT). Transfer of maltose to glycogen was inhibited by micromolar amounts of inorganic phosphate or arsenate but was only slightly inhibited by millimolar concentrations of glucose- 1 -P, glucose- 6 -P, or inorganic pyrophosphate. GMPMT was compared with glycogen phosphorylase (GP). GMPMT catalyzed transfer of [14 C]maltose- 1 -P, but not [14 C]glucose- 1 -P, to glycogen, whereas GP transferred radioactivity from glucose- 1 -P but not maltose- 1 -P. GMPMT and GP were both inhibited by 1, 4 -dideoxy- 1, 4 -imino-d-arabinitol, but only GP was inhibited by isofagomine.

We aimed to investigate the causes of the expression of Tn antigen in the Tn-rich MCF- 7 breast cancer cell line focusing on the first step of the O-glycosylation process. Interestingly, amino acid sequences derived from "non-mammary" apomucins (MUC 5 B and MUC 6) were very good acceptor substrates for ppGalNAc-Ts, which are the enzymes catalyzing the Tn antigen synthesis. MUC 6 peptide glycosylation with MCF- 7 microsome extracts as source of ppGalNAc-T activity yielded 95 % conversion of the peptide into MUC 6 -Tn. In addition, the MUC 6 -Tn glycopeptide was a <b>poor</b> <b>acceptor</b> substrate for core 1 beta 3 Gal-T, the next enzyme involved in the saccharide chain biosynthesis, yielding only 5 % conversion of MUC 6 -Tn into MUC 6 -TF. These results indicate that non-mammary apomucin expression could be responsible, at least in part, for Tn antigen expression in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells due to a combined action on glycosyltransferases: an increase of ppGalNAc-T activity and a decrease of core 1 beta 3 Gal-T activity. Our hypothesis is supported by experiments in vivo showing that (a) native MUC 6 glycoproteins express the Tn antigen in MCF- 7 cells and (b) Tn antigen expression is increased after transfection with a construct encoding for a MUC 6 recombinant protein into the low Tn-expressing breast cancer cell T 47 D.

The results suggest that a CO-dependent CH 3 -S-CoM methylreductase system is involved in the pathway of the conversion of acetate to methane and that free formate is not an intermediate in the pathway...|$|R
40|$|Pyranose dehydrogenases (PDHs) are {{extracellular}} flavin-dependent oxidoreductases secreted by litter-decomposing fungi with a role {{in natural}} recycling of plant matter. All major monosaccharides in lignocellulose are oxidized by PDH at comparable yields and efficiencies. Oxidation takes place as single-oxidation or sequential double-oxidation reactions of the carbohydrates, resulting in sugar derivatives oxidized primarily at C 2, C 3 or C 2 / 3 with the concomitant reduction of the flavin. A suitable electron acceptor then reoxidizes the reduced flavin. Whereas oxygen is a <b>poor</b> electron <b>acceptor</b> for PDH, several alternative acceptors, e. g., quinone compounds, naturally present during lignocellulose degradation, can be used. We have determined the 1. 6 -A ̊ crystal structure of PDH from Agaricus meleagris. Interestingly, the flavin ring in PDH is modified by a covalent mono- or di-atomic species at the C(4 a) position. Under normal conditions, PDH is not oxidized by oxygen; however, the related enzyme pyranose 2 -oxidase (P 2 O) activates oxygen by a mechanism that proceeds via a covalent flavin C(4 a) -hydroperoxide intermediate. Although the flavin C(4 a) adduct is common in monooxygenases, it is unusual for flavoprotein oxidases, {{and it has been}} proposed that formation of the intermediate would be unfavorable in these oxidases. Thus, the flavin adduct in PDH not only shows that the adduct can be favorably accommodated in the active site, but also provides important details regarding the structural, spatial and physicochemical requirements for formation o...|$|R

The vertical ionization energy (IE) and electron affinity (EA) values related to the HOMO (πC=N) and LUMO (π∗C=N) have been determined by the ΔSCF and ΔMP 2 (IE only) procedures. The studied compounds prefer an anti (E) configuration between the OH and the CH 2 X group, and a gauche conformation of the C-X bond with respect to the double bond, except 2 and 4 for which a syn (Z) planar structure is nearly degenerate with the E one. The spectral data, coupled with the results of the calculations indicate that the properties of the acetone oximes are mainly governed by the mixing between the orbitals localized at the X and C=N fragments and by electrostatic interactions between hydrogen and electronegative atoms. When X has poor donor and <b>poor</b> mesomeric <b>acceptor</b> properties (X = F and OMe), the prevailing interaction is the strong charge transfer mixing of the hydroxyl oxygen lone pair with the π∗C=N orbital, and the X group moves in the main molecular plane...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{photovoltaics}} {{promise a}} number of key advantages over conventional silicon, namely: Ease of processing, low cost, physical flexibility and large area coverage. However, the solar power conversion efficiencies of pure polymer devices are <b>poor.</b> When electron <b>acceptor</b> nanocrystals are blended with a donor conducting polymer to create a bulk heterojunction structure, the optical and electronic properties of both materials combine synergistically to enhance overall performance. We use a novel single pot process to fabricate the nanocomposite photovoltaic material, where PbS nanocrystals are grown directly in a solution of the conducting polymer MEH-PPV. This study investigates the dependence of nanocrystal growth size and subsequent power conversion efficiency as a function of polymer molecular weight. It was found that a higher molecular weight polymer resulted in the formation of a broken percolation of smaller nanocrystals that act to enhance the charge separation of excitons generated at the low energy band edge of MEH-PPV. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|The key {{aspect of}} the {{remarkable}} organic catalysis that is observed to occur at the organic/water phase boundary, the so-called 'on-water' catalysis (Narayan et al 2005 Angew. Chem. 44 3275), was recently proposed to be the protruding OH groups of water molecules at the interface that interact with the transition state (TS) via hydrogen bonding and lower activation barriers (Jung and Marcus 2007 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 129 5492). In particular, the cycloaddition reaction of quadricyclane (Q) with dimethyl azodicarboxylate (DMAD) on-water was calculated {{to be more than}} 100 000 times more efficient in terms of rate constant than the neat reaction. In this paper, we review and consider a related reaction of Q with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate, where nitrogen, a good H-bond acceptor, in DMAD is replaced by carbon, a <b>poor</b> H-bond <b>acceptor.</b> A very low rate acceleration of acetylenedicarboxylate on-water relative to the neat reaction is obtained theoretically, as compared to DMAD on-water, due to the relatively low H-bonding ability of acetylenedicarboxylate with water at the TS relative to the reactants. We suggest that there may also be an 'intrinsic steric effect' or orientational advantage in the on-water catalysis in general, and both electronic and steric effects may be in operation for the smaller on-water catalysis for the cycloaddition reaction of quadricyclane and acetylenedicarboxylate. A preliminary quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulation including 1264 water molecules for the on-water reaction of DMAD + Q also suggests that there are indeed approximately two–four more H-bonds between the TS and the dangling OH groups than between the reactants and the surface...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} and spectroscopic properties of selected models of B-type carbonate defects in apatite locally compensated by fluoride or hydroxyl ions are investigated using first-principles quantum mechanical calculations. Theoretical infrared absorption spectra and 13 C, and 19 F {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} chemical shifts are determined. Among the investigated models, only the clumped (CO 3 2 −, F−) defect, with the carbonate group close to the sloping face of the tetrahedral site and the F− ion at the remaining apex, corresponds to previous experimental observations performed on carbonate-fluorapatite samples. Although the substitution of hydroxyl by fluoride ions is commonly observed in minerals, the clumped (CO 3 2 −, OH−) defects are unlikely to occur in apatite, considering both their theoretical spectroscopic properties and relative stability. Anionic F− for OH− exchange between channel and B sites displays a preference of ~ 20 kJ/mol for the local charge compensation by fluoride ions at the B-site, pointing to a significantly different behavior of F− and OH− ions in the charge compensation mechanism. This difference is ascribed to the <b>poor</b> H-bond <b>acceptor</b> character of available oxygen atoms surrounding {{the apex of the}} tetrahedral site. The explicit calculation of the infrared absorption spectra of the defect models is also used to interpret the significant difference observed in the linewidth of the ν 2 and ν 3 CO 3 infrared powder absorption bands of carbonated apatite samples.

40|$|Electron {{transport}} {{in continuous}} light {{has been investigated}} in chromatophores of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata. Ala pho+, depleted in ubiquinone- 10 and subsequently reconstituted with various ubiquinone homologs and analogs. In addition the restoration of electron transport in depleted chromatophores by the artificial redox compounds N-methylphenazonium methosulfate and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine was studied. The following pattern of activities was obtained: (1) Reconstitution of cyclic photophosphorylation with ubiquinone- 10 was saturated at about 40 ubiquinone molecules per reaction center. (2) Reconstitution by ubiquinone homologs was dependent {{on the length of}} the isoprenoid side chain and the amount of residual ubiquinone in the extracted chromatophores. If two or more molecules of ubiquinone- 10 per reaction center were retained, all homologs with a side chain longer than two isoprene units were as active as ubiquinone- 10 in reconstitution, and the double bonds in the side chain were not required. If less than two molecules per reaction center remained, an unsaturated side chain longer than five units was necessary for full activity. Plastoquinone, alpha-tocopherol, and naphthoquinones of the vitamin K series were relatively inactive in both cases. (3) All ubiquinone homologs, also ubiquinone- 1 and - 2, could be reduced equally well by the photosynthetic reaction center, as measured by light-induced proton binding in the presence of antimycin A and uncoupler. Plastoquinone was found to be a <b>poor</b> electron <b>acceptor.</b> (4) Photophosphorylation could be reconstituted by N-methylphenazonium methosulfate as well as by N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine in an antimycin-insensitive way, if more than two ubiquinones per reaction center remained.

40|$|The membrane-bound l-malate {{oxidoreductase}} of Azotobacter vinelandii strain O {{was found}} to be a flavoprotein-dependent enzyme associated with the electron transport system (R 3) of this organism. The particulate R 3 fraction, which possessed the l-malate oxidoreductase, carried out the cyanide-sensitive oxidation of l-malate, d-lactate, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, succinate, cytochrome c, tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, and p-phenylenediamine, with molecular O 2 as the terminal electron acceptor. d-Malate was not oxidized, but l-malate was oxidized to oxalacetate. Phenazine methosulfate (PMS), vitamin K 3, K 3 Fe(CN) 6, nitro blue tetrazolium, and dichloroindophenol all served as good terminal electron acceptors for the l-malate oxidoreductase. Cytochrome c was a <b>poor</b> electron <b>acceptor.</b> Extensive studies on the l-malate oxidase and PMS and K 3 reductases revealed that all were stimulated specifically by flavine adenine dinucleotide and nonspecifically by di- or trivalent cations, i. e., Ca++, Ba++, Mn++, Mg++, Fe+++, Ni++, and Al+++. All these activities were markedly sensitive to ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). The Vmax values for the l-malate oxidase, PMS, and vitamin K 3 reductases were, respectively, 3. 4, 15. 1, and 45. 5 μmoles of substrate oxidized per min per mg of protein at 37 C. Spectral studies revealed that the Azotobacter R 3 flavoprotein and cytochromes (a 2, a 1, b 1, c 4, and c 5) were reduced by l-malate. l-Malate oxidase activity was sensitive to various inhibitors of the electron transport system, namely, p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid, chlorpromazine, 2 -n-heptyl- 4 -hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, antimycin A, and KCN.

40|$|N(G) -Methylation of {{arginine}} residues in many nucleic-acid-binding proteins {{are formed}} post-translationally, catalysed by S-adenosylmethionine:protein-arginine N-methyltransferase in their glycine-rich and arginine-rich motifs. The amino acid sequences of the stimulator of HIV- 1 TAR (Tat-responsive element) RNA-binding protein (SRB) and fibronectin also show {{the presence of}} the internal -Gly-Arg-Gly- (-GRG-) sequence, which is potentially methylatable by the methyltransferase. To investigate the sequence requirement for methylation of these proteins, several synthetic oligopeptides with different chain lengths and sequences similar to the -GRG- regions of SRB and fibronectin were synthesized. Whereas the heptapeptide AGGRGKG (residues 16 - 22 in SRB) served as the methyl acceptor for the methyltransferase with a K(m) of 50 microM, the 19 -mer peptide (residues 10 - 28 in SRB) was methylated with a K(m) of 8. 3 microM, indicating that a greater peptide chain length yields a better methyl acceptor. Product analysis of the methylated [methyl-(14) C]SRB-peptide by HPLC indicated the formation of N(G) -monomethylarginine and N(G),N(G) -dimethyl(asymmetric) arginine. Synthetic peptides containing the cell attachment sequence [Arg-Gly-Asp ('RGD') ] in fibronectin, GRGDSPK, GGRGDSPK and GGGRGDSPK, were also studied; whereas GRGDSPK was a <b>poor</b> methyl <b>acceptor,</b> the longer peptides were better methyl acceptors.

This lack of inhibition by the insertion of a methyl group on the arginyl residue of the cell attachment sequence might be due to the hindrance of the binding of fibronectin peptide to integrins...|$|R

Other proteins present in the NF preparations were also used as NF-kinase substrates. Two of them might correspond to the myelin basic proteins with Mr values of 18, 000 and 21, 000. Four other substrates in the NF preparation were not identified (respective Mr values 53, 000, 55, 000, 65, 000 and greater than 300, 000). NF kinase also phosphorylated two additional brain-cell cytoskeletal elements: GFAp and vimentin. Casein, histones and phosvitin, currently used as substrates for protein kinase assays, were very <b>poor</b> phosphate <b>acceptors.</b> Half-maximal NF-kinase activity was obtained at an NF protein concentration of about 0. 25 mg/ml in heated, salt-washed, NF preparations.
