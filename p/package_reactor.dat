2500|$|Fort Belvoir, Virginia, was the {{headquarters}} of the Army Corps of Engineers and, beginning in 1954, the corps' newly created Army Reactors Branch. This unit was established by the Department of Defense to develop compact nuclear power plants that could be utilized to supply heat and power at remote locations. The army's first nuclear power reactor, the SM-1, was built at Fort Belvoir in 1955â€“57, and was located in the southeast [...] "corner" [...] of the post, alongside Gunston Cove, off the Potomac River. The SM-1 reactor, also known as the Army <b>Package</b> <b>Reactor</b> Program, was used to train nuclear operations personnel for all three services. For that reason, the MH-1A was installed and tested aboard the Sturgis while it was moored in Gunston Cove, near the SM-1 facility.|$|E
5000|$|At a {{press conference}} held on 19 August 1954, (then) Major General Sturgis, Chief of Engineers, {{announced}} the plan by the Army and the AEC to build the [...] "package" [...] power plant at Fort Belvoir. A location in a [...] "closed area" [...] of the garrison had been selected, near {{a point at which}} Accotink Bay (aka, Gunston Cove) joins the Potomac River. The general said the design of the <b>package</b> <b>reactor</b> resembles the nuclear power plant on the US Navy's (newly launched) nuclear submarine Nautilus. He also said the reactor could be housed in a building 29 feet wide, 42 feet high and 80 feet long. The Army was sending out a request for proposals, that day, to [...] "33 qualified bidders", and companies were being asked {{to come up with a}} [...] "competitive lump-sum bid", rather than a cost-plus estimate. On 14 December 1954, the AEC announced that the contract was being given to American Locomotive Company of New York, whose $2 million bid was the lowest of the 18 proposals received. Asking companies to submit a lump-sum bid was hailed, at that time, as a sign of how much progress had been made in reactor power plant design by mid-1954, such that companies now had sufficient experience and could calculate costs with confidence.|$|E

This approach provides accurate predictions of channel-averaged temperatures and void fractions and even peak assembly temperatures within an assembly.

The production of U - Al alloys {{by reduction of}} UO/sub 2 /F/sub 2 / in a cryolite slag was demonstrated. Dynamic corrosion experiments including impact tests on commercial-purity titanium samples exposed to oxygen-preseurized UO/sub 2 /SO/sub 4 / periods in excess of 500 hr indicated that no change in impact behavior occurred. Similar tests on Zircaloy 2 gave like results. Corrosion tests on stress relieved stainless steel weld specimens indicated a generally superior corrosion resistance of welds that had been heated to 1000 deg F for 6 hr compared with as-welded specimens. Data on behavior of materials stuitable for bearings and hard facings in molten fluorides are given. Materials tested in contact with liquid lead include alloys such as 25 % Mo- 75 % Ni. 2 % Si 14 % Cr- 84 % Fe, Hastelloy B, Ti, Co, Be, and 13 % Cr- 87 % Fe. Studies are in progress on the mass transfer characteritics of various structural metals in contact with fused hydroxides. Evaluation of materials for brazing alloys was continued on the Ni-P eutectic along with studies on other brazing alloys such as Ni-Ge, and Ni-Cr.

40|$|Thermal contact {{resistance}} or, its reciprocal, thermal contact conductance {{is an important}} parameter {{in a wide range}} of thermal phenomena. It plays a significant role in heat transfer applications such as electronic <b>packaging</b> and nuclear <b>reactors.</b> This parameter also appears in fin-tube heat exchangers; however, it is often neglected in the performance calculations of heat exchangers. This thesis project explores the means by which the heat transfer performance of a finned tube heat exchanger may be enhanced. It includes experimental studies and finite element analysis investigating the effects of expansion bullets and coatings on the thermal contact conductance. An apparatus has been designed and fabricated for the experimental part of the work. A finite element model established the fintube configuration to be used in the design and manufacture of the apparatus. The apparatus was specially made for measuring thermal contact conductance directly in a finned-tube heat exchanger both in vacuum and in gaseous environment. The experiments were done on hexagon shaped specimens with a single fin connecting seven tubes. Sixteen type-T thermocouples have been used to measure temperatures at several locations on the specimen. A full-scale quarter-fin model was chosen for a second finite element analysis. The model simulates the actual specimen and predicts the temperatures. The finite element analyses have been used to validate the experimental results. The experimental results from the bare contact specimens, assembled with different sizes of expansion bullet, show that while higher expansions enhance the thermal contact conductance, the effect of interstitial gas such as nitrogen is beneficial for all specimens expanded with the 9. 42 mm size bullet. Applying a coating material with high thermal conductivity is also an effective way to enhance the thermal contact conductance. The results show that the highly conductive plating materials, such as zinc, tin, silver and gold, enhance the thermal contact conductance. The presence of interstitial gas such as nitrogen also results in higher heat transfer rates and higher thermal contact conductance compared to those obtained in vacuum...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{document}} is to identify and describe strategies for the engineering control of worker exposure during the production or use of engineered nanomaterials. Engineered nanomaterials are materials that are intentionally produced and {{have at least one}} primary dimension less than 100 nanometers (nm). Nanomaterials may have properties different from those of larger particles of the same material, making them unique and desirable for specific product applications. The consumer products market currently has more than 1, 000 nanomaterial-containing products including makeup, sunscreen, food storage products, appliances, clothing, electronics, computers, sporting goods, and coatings. As more nanomaterials are introduced into the workplace and nano-enabled products enter the market, it is essential that producers and users of engineered nanomaterials ensure a safe and healthy work environment. The toxicity of nanoparticles may be affected by different physicochemical properties, including size, shape, chemistry, surface properties, agglomeration, biopersistence, solubility, and charge, as well as effects from attached functional groups and crystalline structure. The greater surface-area-to-mass ratio of nanoparticles makes them generally more reactive than their macro-sized counterparts. These properties are the same ones that make nanomaterials unique and valuable in manufacturing many products. Though human health effects from exposure have not been reported, a number of laboratory animal studies have been conducted. Pulmonary inflammation has been observed in animals exposed to nano-sized TiO 2 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Other studies have shown that nanoparticles can translocate to the circulatory system and to the brain causing oxidative stress. Of concern is the finding that certain types of CNTs have shown toxicological response similar to asbestos in mice. These animal study results are examples, and further toxicological studies need to be conducted to establish the potential health effects to humans from acute and chronic exposure to nanomaterials. Currently, there are no established regulatory occupational exposure limits (OELs) for nanomaterials in the United States; however, other countries have established standards for some nanomaterials, and some companies have supplied OELs for their products. In 2011, NIOSH issued a recommended exposure limit (REL) for ultrafine (nano) titanium dioxide and a draft REL for carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers. Because of the lack of regulatory standards and formal recommendations for many nanomaterials in the United States, {{it is difficult to determine}} or even estimate a safe exposure level. Many of the basic methods of producing nanomaterials occur in an enclosure or reactor, which may be operated under positive pressure. Exposure can occur due to leakage from the reactor or when a worker 22 Ì† 0 ac 2 Ì† 122 s activities involve direct manipulation of nanomaterials. Batchtype processes involved in the production of nanomaterials include operating reactors, mixing, drying, and thermal treatment. Exposure-causing activities at production plants and laboratories employing nanomaterials include harvesting (e. g., scraping materials out of <b>reactors),</b> bagging, <b>packaging,</b> and <b>reactor</b> cleaning. Downstream activities that may release nanomaterials include bag dumping, manual transfer between processes, mixing or compounding, powder sifting, and machining of parts that contain nanomaterials. Hazards involved in manufacturing and processing nanomaterials should be managed as part of a comprehensive occupational safety, health, and environmental management plan. Preliminary hazard assessments (PHAs) are frequently conducted as initial risk assessments to determine whether more sophisticated analytical methods are needed. PHAs are important so that the need for control measures is realized, and the means for risk mitigation can be designed to be part of the operation during the planning stage. Engineering controls protect workers by removing hazardous conditions or placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard, and, with good safe handling techniques, they are likely to be the most effective control strategy for nanomaterials. The identification and adoption of control technologies that have been shown effective in other industries are important first steps in reducing worker exposures to engineered nanoparticles. Properly designing, using, and evaluating the effectiveness of these controls is a key component in a comprehensive health and safety program. Potential exposure control approaches for commonly used processes include commercial technologies, such as a laboratory fume hood, or techniques adopted from the pharmaceutical industry, such as continuous liner product bagging systems. The assessment of control effectiveness is essential for verifying that the exposure goals of the facility have been successfully met. Essential control evaluation tools include time-tested techniques, such as airflow visualization and measurement, as well as quantitative containment test methods, including tracer gas testing. Further methods, such as video exposure monitoring, provide information on critical task-based exposures, which will help to identify high-exposure activities and help provide the basis for interventions.
