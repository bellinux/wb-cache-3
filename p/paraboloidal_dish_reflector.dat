40|$|A {{microwave}} aeronautical-telemetry {{receiver system}} includes an antenna comprising a seven-element planar array of receiving feed horns centered at {{the focal point}} of a <b>paraboloidal</b> <b>dish</b> <b>reflector</b> that is nominally aimed at a single aircraft or at multiple aircraft flying in formation. Through digital processing of the signals received by the seven feed horns, the system implements a method of enhanced cancellation of interference, such that it becomes possible to receive telemetry signals in the same frequency channel simultaneously from either or both of two aircraft at slightly different angular positions within the field of view of the antenna, even in the presence of multipath propagation. The present system is an advanced version of the system described in Spatio- Temporal Equalizer for a Receiving-Antenna Feed Array NPO- 43077, NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 34, No. 2 (February 2010), page 32. To recapitulate: The radio-frequency telemetry signals received by the seven elements of the array are digitized, converted to complex baseband form, and sent to a spatio-temporal equalizer that consists mostly of a bank of seven adaptive finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters (one for each element in the array) plus a unit that sums the outputs of the filters. The combination of the spatial diversity of the feedhorn array and the temporal diversity of the filter bank affords better multipath suppression performance than is achievable by means of temporal equalization alone. The FIR filter bank adapts itself in real time to enable reception of telemetry at a low bit error rate, even in the presence of frequency-selective multipath propagation like that commonly found at flight-test ranges. The combination of the array and the filter bank makes it possible to constructively add multipath incoming signals to the corresponding directly arriving signals, thereby enabling reductions in telemetry bit-error rates...|$|E

The aims {{of this study are}} to optimize the coupling of a <b>paraboloidal</b> <b>dish,</b> which concentrates direct solar irradiance with dual axes tracking component, and the optical fibre, which transmits concentrated solar energy. We present review previous studies on the transmission of concentrated solar energy via optical fibres (TCSEvOF), and provide a mathematical model for coupling <b>paraboloidal</b> <b>dish</b> and the optical fibre. We present the daily power obtained at the output of the optical fibre, the power supply is estimated to be 25 W at the end. Then we show that the energy transported is diffused until the enclosure then disperse inside it, this energy is absorbed by the receiver. Temperatures higher than 1600 °K may be reached while maintaining very good efficiency. Such furnaces have the extra advantage of having temperature gradients which may be perfectly determined...|$|R

40|$|In general, cavity {{receivers}} {{employed in}} the sun-tracking <b>paraboloidal</b> <b>dish</b> concentrator are subjected to various modes of heat loss. Among these, convection is the most complicated phenomenon and yet also a major contributor of the total energy loss. Hence, its characteristics need to be clarified such {{that it can be}} effectively minimized for the improvement of system efficiency. This study undertakes the numerical investigation of natural and combined convection loss from cavity receivers employed in solar <b>paraboloidal</b> <b>dishes.</b> Three different receiver geometries have been considered. One of these is the experimental model receiver for validating the numerical results. The other two are essentially the ones currently used in ANU 20 m 2 and 400 m 2 dishes.

On the combined convection loss study, several cases of varying wind speeds and directions are considered and some typical results are presented in graphical form.
