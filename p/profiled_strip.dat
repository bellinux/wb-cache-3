40|$|Abstract. Profile Strip Casting is {{a process}} {{combining}} the advantages of tailored products with those of twin-roll strip casting. The feasibility of this process has been experimentally demonstrated and a profile with a thickness difference of one millimeter across the strip width could be obtained in a stable process. However, the dimensional precision and the properties uniformity along the {{cross section of the}} produced strip were not satisfactory. In this paper, two different strategies for the improvement of the <b>profiled</b> <b>strip</b> quality are presented. The first concept focuses on the variation of the geometrical parameters of the profile. Its application allowed to cast a strip with a thickness of 1. 5 mm in the thin and 2. 0 mm in the thick profile section maintaining the absolute geometrical error over the whole strip under 0. 1 mm and improving the internal microstructural homogeneity. The second approach identifies the precise control of the heat transfer occurring between casting roll and melt as the key factor to further improve the final <b>profiled</b> <b>strip</b> quality and will be implemented by selectively coating the casting rolls. The simulations performed show that the temperature difference between the cores of the thin and thick sections at the exit of the casting gap will be reduced by 60 % in the considered test case...|$|E

Currently using the novel type of strip rolling mill, such as the work roll crossing and shifting is {{the one of the}} main methods to control the <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> quality in cold rolling. In this paper, 3 -D finite element simulation models of the thin <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> in cold rolling for the work roll crossing and shifting system were successfully developed.

Throughout rolling, the <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> is controlled by using the advanced shape control rolling mill, such as the combination of work roll crossing and shifting during asymmetrical rolling, {{the one of the}} valuable methods to control the <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> quality in rolling process. In this paper, the influences of cold rolling parameters such as the crossing angle and axial shifting value of work rolls on the <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> are analysed.

40|$|Controlling cold <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> is a {{difficult}} and significant problem {{has been found in}} industry during thin strip rolling.

In this paper, the factors affecting the low carbon steel thin <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> of asymmetrical cold rolling have been studied at a speed ratio of 1. 3 without lubricant applied. The effect of rolling parameters on the resulting microstructure was also investigated. It was found that under dry condition, work roll shifting and work roll cross angle can improve the <b>strip</b> <b>profile,</b> and the improvement is more significant with an increase of work roll cross angle rather than that of work roll shifting. A slight change in microstructure was evident with increasing work roll shifting values.

40|$|Errors {{associated}} with visual inspection {{and interpretation of}} radargrams often inhibits the intensive surveying of widespread areas using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). To automate the interpretive process, this paper presents an application of a fuzzy-neural network (F-NN) classifier for unsupervised clustering and classification of soil profile using GPR imagery. The classifier clusters and classifies soil <b>profiles</b> <b>strips</b> along a traverse based on common pattern similarities that can relate to physical features of the soil (e. g., number of horizons; depth, texture {{and structure of the}} horizons; and relative arrangement of the horizons, etc). This paper illustrates this classification procedure by its application on GPR data, both simulated and actual real-world. Results show that the procedure is able to classify the profile into zones that corresponded with those obtained by visual inspection and interpretation of radargrams. Results indicate that an F-NN model can supply real-time soil profile clustering and classification during field surveys...|$|R

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{of rolling}} parameters {{in order to}} achieve better strip shape and to reduce rolling force is a challenge in rolling practice. In this paper, thin strip asymmetrical rolling of aluminum at various speed ratios under lubricated condition has been investigated at various combinations of work rolls cross (WRC) angles and work rolls shifting (WRS) values. The effects of strip width, reduction, and rolling speed on strip shape taking WRC and WRS into consideration are discussed. Results show that <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> improves significantly when the WRC angle is increased from 0 ° to 1 °, with an associated reduction in rolling force. Increasing WRS value from 0 to 8 [*]mm improves the <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> as well but not as significantly as when WRC angle is increased. No significant improvement was found in strip shape when the strip width was increased. At higher reduction, the strip shape was improved; a decrease in the rolling force was also observed. A higher speed ratio was found to be effective only at a higher WRC angle. The effect of lubrication on the <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> was significant. Results indicate that an optimum combination of WRC, WRS, reduction, width, and speed ratio under lubricated conditions can ensure an improved exit <b>strip</b> <b>profile,</b> reduce rolling force, and obtain a better quality strip...|$|R

40|$|Accurately {{predicting}} the <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> after thin-foil cold rolling {{is very difficult}} because of the thinness of the strip. In this study, a three-dimensional (3 D) <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> model was developed to improve the accuracy of a rolled thin-foil profile. The distribution of the contact pressure between rolls (i. e., the work, intermediate, and backup rolls) and the rolling pressure between the strip and work roll were calculated by using the geometric structure of a 6 -high mill and boundary conditions imposed in the width direction by a numerical method. The rolling pressure distribution in the rolling direction was determined by Fleck's model of thin-foil rolling. The 3 D rolled-strip profile was predicted by using the pressures in the width and rolling directions. In order to investigate {{the effect of the}} rolling speed and rise in strip temperature on the lubrication, the friction coefficient was estimated through an analytical method and experiments to test the viscosity and friction. The resulting 3 D <b>strip</b> <b>profile</b> was verified by a thin-foil cold rolling test and was compared with the profile obtained using the proposed 3 D model and finite element simulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The key {{models of}} {{flatness}} analysis method are the strip plastic deformation model (SPDM) and the roll stack elastic deformation model (REDM). The traditional method uses the SPDM {{to calculate the}} distribution of rolling force, and the REDM is adopted to calculate the <b>profile</b> of exit <b>strip.</b> The reverse iteration method uses the REDM to calculate the distribution of rolling force, while the SPDM is adopted to calculate the <b>profile</b> of exit <b>strip.</b> The model coupling method integrates SPDM and REDM as one set equations through their internal relation. In this paper, the basic thoughts of three methods are introduced. Through a typical example, the convergence, calculation speed and precision of three different methods are analyzed. It is found that the calculation precision of the three methods are almost the same, but the model coupling method is more outstanding than other two methods on the convergence and calculation speed, so the model coupling method is {{the best choice for}} flatness analysis...|$|R
