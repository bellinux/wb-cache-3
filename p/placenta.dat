40|$|Background: Chronic placental inflammation, such as villitis {{of unknown}} {{etiology}} (VUE) and chronic chorioamnionitis (CCA), {{is considered a}} placental manifestation of maternal anti-fetal rejection. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate its frequency in twin pregnancies compared to singleton pregnancies. Methods: Three hundred twin <b>placentas</b> and 1, 270 singleton <b>placentas</b> were consecutively collected at a tertiary medical center in Seoul, Republic of Korea from 2009 to 2012. Hematoxylin and eosin sections of tissue samples (full-thickness placental disc and chorioamniotic membranes) were reviewed. Results: Non-basal VUE was more frequent in twin <b>placentas</b> than in singleton <b>placentas</b> (6. 0 % vs 3. 2 %, p <. 05). In preterm birth, CCA was found less frequently in twin <b>placentas</b> than in singleton <b>placentas</b> (9. 6 % vs 14. 8 %, p <. 05), reaching its peak at an earlier gestational age in twin <b>placentas</b> (29 – 32 weeks) than in singleton <b>placentas</b> (33 – 36 weeks). CCA was more frequent in twin pregnancies with babies of a different sex than with those with the same sex (13. 8 % vs 6. 9 %, p=. 052). Separate dichorionic diamniotic twin <b>placentas</b> were affected by chronic deciduitis more frequently than singleton <b>placentas</b> (16. 9 % vs 9. 7 %, p<. 05). Conclusions: The higher frequency of non-basal VUE in twin <b>placentas</b> and of CCA in twin <b>placentas</b> with different fetal sex supports the hypothesis that the underlying pathophysiological mechanism is maternal anti-fetal rejection related to increased fetal antigens in twin pregnancies. The peak of CCA at an earlier gestational age in twin <b>placentas</b> than in singleton <b>placentas</b> suggests that CCA is influenced by placental maturation...|$|R

5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the <b>placenta</b> that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a <b>placenta.</b> Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E

A number of reports from this laboratory and others (1 - 7) have clearly demonstrated the presence of C-type viruses within <b>placentas</b> from many primates. It was suggested that these viruses {{could be found in}} any given species if enough specimens were examined. For example, we did not find {{virus particles}} in the first two marmoset (Saguinus oedipus) <b>placentas</b> we examined (3, 4). How-ever, subsequent studies on other animals of that species by Semen et aI. (8) demonstrated the presence of virus. In another marmoset species (S. fuscicollis), we found that one of two <b>placentas</b> contained particles (3). Another simian genus examined in limited numbers was the chimpanzee (Pan sp.). Neither of two <b>placentas</b> studied showed any evidence of C-type particles (3, 4).

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus.

5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a <b>placenta</b> (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated <b>placentas</b> from laboring deliveries at high altitude have lower binding of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) to DNA {{than those from}} low altitude. It has recently been reported that labor causes oxidative stress in <b>placentas,</b> likely due to ischemic hypoxic insult. We hypothesized that <b>placentas</b> of high-altitude residents acquired resistance, {{in the course of}} their development, to oxidative stress during labor. Full-thickness placental tissue biopsies were collected from laboring vaginal and nonlaboring cesarean-section term (37 – 41 wk) deliveries from healthy pregnancies at sea level and at 3, 100 m. After freezing in liquid nitrogen within 5 min of delivery, we quantified hydrophilic and lipid metabolites using 31 P and 1 H NMR metabolomics. Metabolic markers of oxidative stress, increased glycolysis, and free amino acids were present in <b>placentas</b> following labor at sea level, but not at 3, 100 m. In contrast, at 3, 100 m, the <b>placentas</b> were characterized by the presence of concentrations of stored energy potential (phosphocreatine), antioxidants, and low free amino acid concentrations. <b>Placentas</b> from pregnancies at sea level subjected to labor display evidence of oxidative stress. However, laboring <b>placentas</b> at 3, 100 m have little or no oxidative stress at the time of delivery, suggesting greater resistance to ischemia-reperfusion. We postulate that hypoxic preconditioning might occur in <b>placentas</b> that develop at high altitude...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} involvement of MTHFR gene mutations C 677 T and A 1298 C implicated in vascular disease, in patients with abruptio <b>placentae</b> and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Study Design: DNA was extracted from blood samples of 54 patients with placental vasculopathy (18 patients with abruptio <b>placentae</b> and 36 with IUGR) and 114 control patients and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resulting fragments were subjected to restriction enzyme analysis and resolved by gel electrophoresis. Results: A significant association could be demonstrated between mutation A 1298 C and both abruptio <b>placentae</b> and IUGR. Combined heterozygosity for mutations C 677 T and A 1298 C was detected in 22. 2 % of abruptio <b>placentae</b> cases. Conclusions: Combined heterozygosity for MTHFR mutations C 677 T and A 1298 C may represent a genetic marker for abruptio <b>placentae.</b> Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation in {{pregnancy}} may confer some clinical benefits; however, this compound can exert pro-oxidant effects. In this study, we investigated {{the effects of}} DHA on pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance in term and preterm placental explants, assessing oxidative stress marker concentrations, antioxidant capacity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Term (n= 8) and preterm (n= 9) placental explants were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1  ng/ml), DHA (1, 10 and 100  μM), and DHA and LPS simultaneously or pre-treated with DHA for 24   h prior to LPS treatment. The production of malondialdehyde (MDA, lipid peroxidation), 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxy guanosine (8 -OHdG, oxidative DNA damage) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 6 and interferon-γ) and total antioxidant capacity were measured. DHA at a concentration of 100  μM induced oxidative stress in term <b>placentas,</b> while at all the three concentrations, it induced oxidative stress in preterm <b>placentas.</b> DHA and LPS resulted in reduced MDA levels in term (P< 0. 005) and preterm (P= 0. 004) <b>placentas</b> and reduced 8 -OHdG levels in preterm <b>placentas</b> (P= 0. 035). DHA pre-treatment, but not co-treatment with LPS, reduced 8 -OHdG levels (P< 0. 001) in term <b>placentas.</b> DHA increased antioxidant capacity only in term <b>placentas</b> (P< 0. 001), with lower antioxidant capacity being observed overall in preterm <b>placentas</b> compared with term <b>placentas</b> (P≤ 0. 001). In term <b>placentas,</b> but not in preterm ones, DHA co-treatment and pre-treatment reduced LPS-induced TNFα levels. The ability of DHA to alter placental pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance {{is dependent on the}} DHA concentration used and the gestational age of the placental tissue. DHA has a greater capacity to increase oxidative stress in preterm <b>placentas,</b> but it offers greater protection against inflammation-induced oxidative stress in term <b>placentas.</b> This appears to be a result of DHA altering placental antioxidant capacity. These data have implications for the timing and concentration of DHA supplementation {{in pregnancy}}. Michael J Stark, Vicki L Clifton and Nicolette A Hody...|$|R
