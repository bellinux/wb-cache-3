500|$|Along with deteriorating {{economic}} {{conditions in the}} 1870s {{and the start of}} a period known as the Long Depression, the dues charged by the Port of Liverpool and the railway charges from there to Manchester were perceived to be excessive by Manchester's business community; it was often cheaper to import goods from Hull, {{on the opposite side of}} the country, than it was from Liverpool. A ship canal was proposed as a way to reduce <b>carriage</b> <b>charges,</b> avoid payment of dock and town dues at Liverpool, and by-pass the Liverpool to Manchester railways by giving Manchester direct access to the sea for its imports and its exports of manufactured goods. Historian Ian Harford suggested that the canal may also have been conceived as an [...] "imaginative response to [...] problems of depression and unemployment" [...] that Manchester was experiencing during the early 1880s.

Serum samples collected at 18 weeks (post-PCV 7), 12 months (pre-PPS), 12. 5 months and 17 months (post-PPS) of age were assessed for serotype-specific IgG and opsonophagocytic responses. The most frequently carried serotypes were 6 B (N = 11), 19 F (N = 14) and 23 F (N = 23).

The considered discrete event system {{consists of three}} main groups: a chain of conveyors and a moving <b>carriage</b> to <b>charge</b> the tobacco material into silos (charging group), set of silos for temporary storage (silos group), and a chain of conveyors to discharge the material (discharging group). The system is analyzed using a sequential function chart (Grafcet tool) and discrete models are developed for both PLC level and SCADA level. Based on the developed model, a new control panel is designed using a PLC.

40|$|Abstract — As we {{all know}} the fuel prices {{especially}} the petrol is rising steadily day by day. Again the pollution due to vehicles in metro cities & urban areas is increasing continuously. To overcome these problems, an effort is being made to search some other alternative sources of energy for the vehicles. Again, it is also not affordable to purchase vehicles (mopeds, scooters or motorcycles) for all the class of society. Keeping this in mind, a search for some way to cater these economically poor people as well as to provide a solution for the environmental pollution was in progress. The solar assisted bicycle developed is driven by DC motor fitted in front or rear axle housing & operated by solar energy. The solar panels mounted on the <b>carriage</b> will <b>charge</b> the battery & which in turn drive the hub motor. When the bicycle is idle, the solar panel will charge the battery.

5000|$|The {{fighting}} {{capability of}} the Loch class was a great jump forward, being based around the new Squid ahead-throwing A/S mortar. Previously, escorts had attacked with depth charges, requiring the attacking vessel to pass over the submerged submarine and drop warheads over the stern. Consequently, the ahead-looking ASDIC (sonar) set lost contact at the vital moment before the weapons were launched, allowing a skilled submarine commander to take successful evasive action. Squid, however, lobbed three 12 in, 390 pound warheads up to 600 yd ahead of the launching vessel falling in a triangular pattern with sides of 40 yd. As the clockwork fuses detonated the warheads at a depth determined by the ships' ASDIC set, the Squid therefore attacked in full ASDIC contact for greater accuracy and lethality. Two mortars were carried, with the bombs set to explode at different depths {{in order to create}} a convergent pressure wave to crush the hull of a submarine.

Preliminary analysis with SO 2 and a selection of polyaromatic molecules point to the method been best suited for measuring the fluorescence spectra of fast fluorescence lifetime (< 1 ns) molecules and in confined environments i. e. molecular beams.

40|$|Application of iron or zinc to the apical {{surface of}} Caco- 2 cells induced an inward {{short-circuit}} current (I sc).   These I sc responses were concentration-, pH- and temperature-dependent in nature. Fe 2 + and Zn 2 + -induced transport was electrogenic {{and resulted in}} intracellular acidification.   Transepithelial proton-coupled transport appeared to involve distinct transport mechanisms for each metal.   The apical charge needed to generate the I sc responses was carried by the metal ion and protons, whereas basolateral <b>charge</b> <b>carriage</b> was accomplished by protons alone. Transport may occur in any isotonic media, provided that an inwardly-directed proton gradient is supplied across the apical membrane.   The magnitude of the I sc responses evoked by Fe 2 + and Zn 2 + was dependent upon the development of Caco- 2 cells.   When DMT 1 (IRE) mRNA levels from cells were analysed by real-time PCR, they appeared to follow a similar pattern. These transport processes may be regulated physiologically {{at the level of}} the intestine since enterocyte metal status may induce changes in the expression of DMT 1 isoforms.   Fe 2 + and Zn 2 + appeared to have different effects on transporter expression and the I sc responses evoked.   Pathophysiological and potential physiological regulation of Fe 2 + and Zn 2 + -evoked transport was demonstrated by using 8 Br-cGMP to mimic the elevation of intracellular cGMP levels observed during secretory diarrhoea.   Exposure of Caco- 2 epithelia to 8 Br-cGMP inhibited Fe 2 + and Zn 2 + -evoked transport.   By using protein kinase inhibitors, it appeared that 8 Br-cGMP-depdnent inhibition of transport was mediated by PKG II.   Identification of this pathway provides support for its manipulation as a potential strategy in preventing the diarrhoeal-induced iron and zinc malabsorption associated with enterotoxic diarrhoeal diseases.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We {{evaluated}} the immunogenicity of the 7 -valent {{pneumococcal conjugate vaccine}} (PCV 7), {{and its impact on}} pneumococcal carriage in Venezuelan children at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). METHODS: 82 children (age 2 - 59 months) with sickle cell anemia (n= 22), chronic heart disease (n= 19), HIV infection (n= 12), immune-suppressive therapy (n= 11) and other IPD-predisposing conditions (n= 18) were vaccinated with PCV 7 according to CDC-recommended age-related immunization schedules. Blood samples were taken to determine the concentration of IgG antibody, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to isolate Streptococcus pneumoniae, before the first vaccine dose and 1 month after completion of the vaccination schedule. RESULTS: Pneumococcal <b>carriage</b> <b>prior</b> to the first immunization was 27 % (n= 22), with the most frequently carried serotypes being vaccine serotypes 6 B (22 %) and 14 (13 %). One month after completion of the vaccination scheme pneumococcal carriage was 22 % (n= 17), dominated by non-vaccine serotypes 19 A (24 %) and 7 F (12 %). Before immunization, 65 % of the subjects had IgG antibody titers > 0. 35 mug/mL for five serotypes tested. Post-vaccination, 100 % of the subjects showed titers > 1. 0 mug/mL for all PCV 7 serotypes with geometric mean concentrations (GMC) ranging from 1. 75 mug/mL (serotype 23 F) to 17. 16 mug/mL (serotype 14). Children previously colonized with serotype 6 B had a significantly lower GMC to this serotype following immunization than children not carrying 6 B prior to the first PCV dose (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: PCV 7 is highly immunogenic in Venezuelan children at high-risk for IPD. Vaccination was associated with an immediate shift in nasopharyngeal carriage toward non-PCV 7 serotypes. Finally, we observed serotype-specific hyporesponsiveness to immunization after natural carriage with the same serotype in high-risk children...|$|R

Two or three of us had been resting ourselves among the tranquil and beautiful scenery of the island of Ischia, eighteen miles out in the harbor, for two days; we called it [...] "resting," [...] but I do not remember now what the resting consisted of, for {{when we got back to}} Naples we had not slept for forty-eight hours. We were just about to go to bed early in the evening, and catch up on some of the sleep we had lost, when we heard of this Vesuvius expedition. There was to be eight of us in the party, and we were to leave Naples at midnight. We laid in some provisions for the trip, engaged carriages to take us to Annunciation, and then moved about the city, to keep awake, till twelve. We got away punctually, and in the course of an hour and a half arrived at the town of Annunciation. Annunciation is the very last place under the sun. In other towns in Italy the people lie around quietly and wait for you to ask them a question or do some overt act that can be charged for--but in Annunciation they have lost even that fragment of delicacy; they seize a lady's shawl from a chair and hand it to her and charge a penny; they open a <b>carriage</b> door, and <b>charge</b> for it--shut it when you get out, and charge for it; they help you to take off a duster--two cents; brush your clothes and make them worse than they were before--two cents; smile upon you--two cents; bow, with a lick-spittle smirk, hat in hand --two cents; they volunteer all information, such as that the mules will arrive presently--two cents--warm day, sir--two cents--take you four hours to make the ascent--two cents. And so they go. They crowd you --infest you--swarm about you, and sweat and smell offensively, and look sneaking and mean, and obsequious.
