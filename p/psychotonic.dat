40|$|Ten title compds., PhCH 2 CH(NH 2) CONR 3 CHR 2 CHR 1 Ph (R 1 = H or OH; R 2 and R 3 = H or Me), were {{screened}} for antidepressant activity. The most active deriv. was N-L-phenylalanyl L- 2 -amino- 1 -phenylpropane (I) [85562 - 33 - 0]. I exhibited adrenergic activity (noradrenaline potentiation in the rat vas deferens, tetrabenozine antagonism in the mouse), cholinergic blocking activity (acetylcholine antagonism in the rat jejunum, oxotremorine antagonism in the mouse, antiaggressive activity in isolated mice), and local anesthetic activity (inhibition of conduction in the frog heart ventricular strip). In its pharmacol. behavior, I {{seemed to be}} more an antidepressant than a <b>psychotonic</b> drug. The idea that the effects of I involve the metabolic release of the amphetamine component is supported by the fact that at higher doses there was a shortening of the duration of hexobarbital narcosis and an increase in the spontaneous activity of mice. Some structure-activity relations are briefly discussed...|$|E

C., athletes in the Olympic games tried to improve their performance by eating mushrooms [...] . " (Hanley 1979). During the last century, such drugs as cocaine, strychnine, caffeine and heroin were abused of by athletes in various sports. In a survey carried out by the Italian Football Association (FIG C) in 1961, it was found that 17 % of all players took <b>psychotonics</b> and 94 % of first division clubs used some sort of drug.
