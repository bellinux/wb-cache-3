25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time <b>phase</b> <b>detection</b> autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop loss light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's <b>phase</b> <b>detection</b> AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Canon {{introduced}} hybrid autofocus {{technology to}} the DSLR in the EOS 650D/Rebel T4i, and introduced a more sophisticated version, which it calls [...] "Dual Pixel CMOS AF", with the EOS 70D. The technology allows certain pixels to act as both contrast-detection and phase-detection pixels, thereby greatly improving autofocus speed in live view (although it remains slower than pure <b>phase</b> <b>detection).</b> While several mirrorless cameras, plus Sony's fixed-mirror SLTs, have similar hybrid AF systems, Canon is the only manufacturer that offers such a technology in DSLRs.|$|E
2500|$|DSLRs {{typically}} use autofocus {{based on}} <b>phase</b> <b>detection.</b> This method allows the optimal lens {{position to be}} calculated, rather than [...] "found", as {{would be the case}} with autofocus based on contrast maximisation. Phase-detection autofocus is typically faster than other passive techniques. As the phase sensor requires the same light going to the image sensor, it was previously only possible with an SLR design. [...] However, with the introduction of focal-plane phase detect autofocusing in mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras by Sony, Fuji, Olympus and Panasonic, cameras can now employ both phase detect and contrast detect AF points.|$|E

50|$|Contrast {{detection}} places different {{constraints on}} lens design {{when compared with}} <b>phase</b> <b>detection.</b> While <b>phase</b> <b>detection</b> requires the lens to move its focus point quickly and directly to a new position, contrast-detection autofocus instead employs lenses that can quickly sweep through the focal range, stopping precisely {{at the point where}} maximal contrast is detected. This means that lenses designed for <b>phase</b> <b>detection</b> often perform poorly on camera bodies that use contrast detection.|$|E

40|$|Modern sonars provide {{high-resolution}} {{acoustic imaging}} {{for a range}} of applications, including pipeline inspection, harbor surveys and seabed mapping. Central in the signal processing of the sonar data is the beamforming, where conventional (fixed) aperture tapering (or weighting) typically is used to set the equipment’s resolution and robustness to appropriate values. This means that there are predefined weights, not necessary optimally chosen, that express a compromise between resolution and sensitivity to noise and interference. In this work, we show how we can increase the resolution of bottom detections, without reducing the robustness, by applying Low Complexity Adaptive (LCA) beamforming. LCA {{can be viewed as a}} low computational cost version of the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. It is easy to implement and improves the imaging process by adaptively choosing an appropriate weight for any point in time and space. We apply LCA beamforming on measured and simulated data. The simulated data are generated by the freely available ultrasound simulator “Field II”. The measured data was collected by a commercial echosounder. LCA beamforming gives significant reduction of the mainlobe width and sidelobe level over conventional beamforming. LCA also gives clear improvements for amplitude <b>detections,</b> and <b>phase</b> <b>detections</b> on measured data. The <b>phase</b> <b>detections</b> on simulated data are partially worse. We expect to get the same improvement for both datasets after minor modifications of the LCA algorithm...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{algorithm}} {{method for detection}} and compensation of backlight images. The proposed technique attacks the weaknesses of conventional backlight image processing methods, such as over-saturation and diminished contrast. This proposed algorithm consists of two operational <b>phases,</b> the <b>detection</b> <b>phase</b> and the compensation <b>phase.</b> In the <b>detection</b> <b>phase,</b> we use the spatial position characteristic and the histogram of backlight images to obtain two image indices which can determine the backlight degree of an image. The fuzzy inference method is then used to integrate these two indices into a final backlight index which determines the final backlight degree of an image more precisely. The compensation phase is used to solve the over-saturation problem which usually exists in conventional image compensation methods. In this phase, we propose the adaptive cubic curve method to compensate and enhance the brightness of backlight images. The luminance of a backlight image is adjusted according to the cubic curve equation which adapts dynamically according to the backlight degree indicated by the backlight index estimated in the <b>detection</b> <b>phase.</b> The performance of the proposed technique was tested against 300 backlight images covering a variety of backlight conditions and degrees. A comparison {{of the results of}} previous experiments clearly shows the superiority of our proposed technique in solving over-saturation and backlight detection problems...|$|R
