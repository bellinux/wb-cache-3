60|$|The {{situation}} of the Company, under this <b>perpetual</b> <b>variation</b> in the system of their investment, is truly perplexing. The {{manner in which they}} arrive at any knowledge of it is no less so. The letter to Lord Macartney, by which the variation is discovered, was not intended for transmission to the Directors. It was merely for the information of those who were admitted to a share of the subscription at Madras. When Mr. Hastings sent this information to those subscribers, he might well enough have presumed an event to happen which did happen,--that is, that a vessel might be dispatched from Madras to Europe: and indeed, by that, and by every devisable means, he ought not only to have apprised the Directors of this most material change in the plan of the investment, but to have entered fully into the grounds and reasons of his making it.|$|E
60|$|When {{speaking}} of the vulgar propensity to regard all bodies on the Earth as tending merely to the Earth’s centre, I observed that, “with certain exceptions to be specified hereafter, every body on the Earth tended {{not only to the}} Earth’s centre, but in every conceivable direction besides.”[11] The “exceptions” refer to those frequent gaps in the Heavens, where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no stellar bodies, but no indications of their existence:—where yawning chasms, blacker than Erebus, seem to afford us glimpses, through the boundary walls of the Universe of Stars, into the illimitable Universe of Vacancy, beyond. Now as any body, existing on the Earth, chances to pass, either through its own movement or the Earth’s, into a line with any one of these voids, or cosmical abysses, it clearly is no longer attracted in the direction of that void, and for the moment, consequently, is “heavier” than at any period, either after or before. Independently of the consideration of these voids, however, and looking only at the generally unequable distribution of the stars, we see that the absolute tendency of bodies on the Earth to the Earth’s centre, {{is in a state of}} <b>perpetual</b> <b>variation.</b>|$|E
60|$|As I before {{observed}} of mere execution, {{that one}} of the best tests of its excellence was the expression of infinity; so it may be noticed with respect to the painting of details generally, that more difference lies between one artist and another, in the attainment of this quality, than in any other of the efforts of art; and that if we wish, without reference to beauty of composition, or any other interfering circumstances, to form a judgment of the truth of painting, perhaps the very first thing we should look for, whether in one thing or another--foliage, or clouds, or waves--should be the expression of infinity always and everywhere, in all parts and divisions of parts. For we may be quite sure that what is not infinite, cannot be true; it does not, indeed, follow that what is infinite, always is true, but it cannot be altogether false, for this simple reason; that it is impossible for mortal mind to compose an infinity of any kind for itself, or to form an idea of <b>perpetual</b> <b>variation,</b> and to avoid all repetition, merely by its own combining resources. The moment that we trust to ourselves, we repeat ourselves, and therefore the moment we see in a work of any kind whatsoever, the expression of infinity, we may be certain that the workman has gone to nature for it; while, on the other hand, the moment we see repetition, or want of infinity, we may be certain that the workman has not gone to nature for it.|$|E

In {{mechanically}} drawn {{patterns of}} dress, Alhambra and common Moorish ornament, Greek mouldings, common flamboyant traceries, common Corinthian and Ionic capitals, and such other work, lines of this declared kind (generally to be classed under {{the head of}} [...] "doggerel ornamentation") {{may be seen in}} rich profusion; and they are necessarily the only kind of lines which can be felt or enjoyed by persons who have been educated without reference to natural forms; their instincts being blunt, and their eyes actually incapable of perceiving the inflexion of noble curves. But the moment the perceptions have been refined by reference to natural form, the eye requires <b>perpetual</b> <b>variation</b> and transgression of the formal law. Take the simplest possible condition of thirteenth-century scroll-work, Fig. 98. The law or cadence established is of a circling tendril, terminating in an ivy-leaf. In vulgar design, the curves of the circling tendril would have been similar to each other, and might have been drawn by a machine, or by some mathematical formula. But in good design all imitation by machinery is impossible. No curve is like another for an instant; no branch springs at an expected point. A cadence is observed, as in the returning clauses of a beautiful air in music; but every clause has its own change, its own surprises. The enclosing form is here stiff and (nearly) straight-sided, in order to oppose the circular scroll-work; but on looking close it will be found that each of its sides is a portion of an infinite curve, almost too delicate to be traced; except the short lowest one, which is made quite straight, to oppose the rest.|$|E

What you call The Universe is but his present expansive existence. He now feels his life through an infinity of imperfect pleasures—the partial and pain-intertangled pleasures of those inconceivably numerous things which you designate as his creatures, but which are really but infinite individualizations of Himself. All these creatures—all—those which you term animate, as well as those to whom you deny life for no better reason than that you do not behold it in operation—all these creatures have, in a greater or less degree, a capacity for pleasure and for pain:—but the general sum of their sensations is precisely that amount of Happiness which appertains by right to the Divine Being when concentrated within Himself. These creatures are all, too, more or less conscious Intelligences; conscious, first, of a proper identity; conscious, secondly and by faint indeterminate glimpses, of an identity with the Divine Being of whom we speak—of an identity with God. Of the two classes of consciousness, fancy that the former will grow weaker, the latter stronger, during the long succession of ages which must elapse before these myriads of individual Intelligences become blended—when the bright stars become blended—into One. Think that the sense of individual identity will be gradually merged in the general consciousness—that Man, for example, ceasing imperceptibly to feel himself Man, will at length attain that awfully triumphant epoch when he shall recognize his existence as that of Jehovah. In the meantime bear in mind that all is Life—Life—Life within Life—the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit Divine.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{coastal zone}} of Benin is the {{interface}} between the marine environment and the straightforward continental environment. It is constituted of sandy cords, lagoon system, lakes and flood plains. This zone shelters {{a population of about}} 3 million inhabitants that is more than 30 % of the Beninese population. As all coastal regions of the world, this zone remains very sensitive to climatic changes (global elevation of the sea level, <b>perpetual</b> <b>variations</b> of the weather marines conditions) and to human activities (large inland dams, harbour infrastructures, urbanization) that drive to the rupture of the equilibrium in this coastal environment with enhanced risks of beach erosion as the main consequences. This study monitors the evolution of the Beninese shorelines around Cotonou and underlines the causes mainly human that negatively affect this naturally fragile environment. Natural factors (tempests and erosive processes) and human actions (building of the port of Cotonou (1962) then Lome (1967) and hydroelectric dams on Volta (1966) and on Mono (1987) rivers) aim the coastal evolution of the Benin. They procreate, on the sandy cords at East of ports and rivers mouths, an erosion about 10 m linked to the reduction of provisions in sand and the fragilisation of cords by farms, steps and of anarchic occupations...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an information spreading problem {{in which a}} population of n agents is to determine, through random pairwise interactions, whether an authoritative rumor source X {{is present in the}} population or not. The studied problem is a generalization of the rumor spreading problem, in which we additionally impose that the rumor should disappear when the rumor source no longer exists. It is also a generalization of the self-stabilizing broadcasting problem and has direct application to amplifying trace concentrations in chemical reaction networks. We show that there exists a protocol such that, starting from any possible initial state configuration, {{in the absence of a}} rumor source all agents reach a designated "uninformed" state after O(^ 2 n) rounds w. h. p., whereas in the presence of the rumor source, at any time after at least O(n) rounds from the moment X appears, at least (1 -ε) n agents are in an "informed" state with probability 1 - O(1 /n), where ε> 0 may be arbitrarily fixed. The protocol uses a constant number of states and its operation relies on an underlying oscillatory dynamics with a closed limit orbit. On the negative side, we show that any system which has such an ability to "suppress false rumors" in sub-polynomial time must either exhibit significant and <b>perpetual</b> <b>variations</b> of opinion over time in the presence of the rumor source, or use a super-constant number of states...|$|R
60|$|Miriam {{combined}} earnestness {{of spirit}} with great practical incapacity. The house was never clean nor tidy, but always being frightfully disarranged for cleaning or tidying up, and she cooked because food {{had to be}} cooked and with a sound moralist's entire disregard {{of the quality of}} the consequences. The food came from her hands done rather than improved, and looking as uncomfortable as savages clothed under duress by a missionary with a stock of out-sizes. Such food is too apt to behave resentfully, rebel and work Obi. She ceased to listen to her husband's talk from the day she married him, and ceased to unwrinkle the kink in her brow at his presence, giving herself up to mental states that had a quality of secret preoccupation. And she developed an idea for which perhaps there was legitimate excuse, that he was lazy. He seemed to stand about in the shop a great deal, to read--an indolent habit--and presently to seek company for talking. He began to attend the bar parlour of the God's Providence Inn with some frequency, and would have done so regularly in the evening if cards, which bored him to death, had not arrested conversation. But the <b>perpetual</b> foolish <b>variation</b> of the permutations and combinations of two and fifty cards taken five at a time, and the meagre surprises and excitements that ensue had no charms for Mr. Polly's mind, which was at once too vivid in its impressions and too easily fatigued.|$|R
40|$|This {{essay will}} begin by {{providing}} an exposition of “One Manifesto Less”: Gilles Deleuze’s little known {{essay on the}} Italian actor and director, Carmelo Bene, and his only extended piece of writing on the theatre. Rethinking the presence/representation paradigm, Deleuze envisages theatre as that which can put us {{in contact with the}} reality of difference. Having introduced the essay’s key concepts of <b>perpetual</b> <b>variation,</b> virtual and actual, major and minor I will then explore {{the extent to which the}} contemporary French theatre of Georges Lavaudant takes up Deleuze’s call for theatre to affirm <b>perpetual</b> <b>variation</b> or difference-in-itself. Like Bene, Lavaudant is well known for his surgical operations upon classic texts, and indeed in the recent work La Rose et la Hache (2006), Lavaudant explicitly addresses his debt to Bene. I want to examine the relations between Deleuze, Bene and Lavaudant with a particular focus on the politics of theatre. As Fortier has argued Deleuze’s essay makes revolutionary claims for Bene’s work which Bene himself might well have rejected. Lavaudant, on the other hand, shares Deleuze’s belief in the power of theatre to constitute itself as a form of resistance to forces of homogenization and stasis. As such, we are left wondering why Deleuze did not look closer to home – to Lavaudant – for an exemplary minor theatre. By examining Lavaudant’s most recent productions, the essay will close with a reflection on the different nature of the challenges presented to theatre by the political climate that served as the context for Deleuze’s 1978 essay and today’s globalised world. We will conclude that in order to affirm difference, theatre must place itself in perpetual variation; it must perpetually vary in order to have any hope of affecting change...|$|E
40|$|The {{prominent}} use of polyptoton in In Memoriam {{is significant}} {{both for the}} way it reflects Tennyson’s deeply held beliefs and, more broadly, for its implications for elegy as a genre. As regards Tennyson in particular, his willingness to register his faith {{in the value of}} evolutionary change within the very form of his words has a dual effect: it reinforces our sense of that faith while also communicating a philosophical stance, an implied claim that language is not distinct from the natural {{world in which we live}} but fully participates in its processes. More generally, Tennyson’s use of polyptoton to embody his constant imaginative speculation offers insight into the workings of elegy, which derives its effectiveness from its ability, not to end grief, but to reimagine and transfigure it. By demonstrating at the most fundamental linguistic level the possibilities of <b>perpetual</b> <b>variation,</b> polyptoton is able to play an essential role in the adaptive work of mourning that elegy undertakes...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} an exposition of four key concepts {{emerging in the}} encounter between the philosophical man of the theatre, Antonin Artaud, and the theatrical philosopher, Gilles Deleuze: the body without organs, the theatre without organs, the destratified voice and differential presence. The article proposes that Artaud’s 1947 censored radio play To Have Done with the Judgment of God constitutes an instance of a theatre without organs that uses the destratified voice in a pursuit of differential presence – as a nonrepresentative encounter with difference that forces new thoughts upon us. Drawing from various works by Deleuze, including Difference and Repetition, The Logic of Sense, A Thousand Plateaus and ‘One LessManifesto’, I conceive differential presence as an encounter with difference, or <b>perpetual</b> <b>variation,</b> as that which exceeds the representational consciousness of a subject, forcing thought through rupture rather than communicating meanings through sameness. Contra the dismissal of Artaud’s project as paradoxical or impossible, the article suggests that his nonrepresentational theatre seeks to affirm {{a new kind of}} presence as difference, rather than aiming to transcend difference in order to reach the self-identical presence of Western metaphysics...|$|E
40|$|Origin Unknown is a 15 -minute, single-movement {{work for}} orchestra. The piece {{maintains}} an understated, meditative quality throughout, and adheres {{to the principle}} of <b>perpetual</b> <b>variation</b> of a very limited amount of material. The form of the work is process-oriented: the music unfolds slowly, according to a consistent, yet flexible, dialectic. Two basic materials—one that is tonally stable, and another that modulates—alternate throughout the piece and form a harmonic backdrop. A type of respiration occurs, as the lengths of the stable sections expand and contract, while the modulatory passages get progressively longer each time they recur. A surface layer of triplet melodies is superimposed onto this background structure, forming a subtle counterpoint. Percussive, bell-like sounds (glockenspiel, vibraphone, celesta, harp, and piano) articulate most of the pitches in the work. As these sounds decay, they often meld into a wind or string timbre which sustains the pitch after its percussive attack has faded. Eventually, these sustained sounds fade out, just as their percussive attack did, but at a slower rate with a long diminuendo. A regular rotation of the percussive timbres produces a kaleidescopic effect, while the wind and string choirs often alternate in an antiphonal fashion. As the alternating wind and string passages expand and contract in length, the orchestration of the piece effects a "respiration" in the timbral domain analogous to that built into the harmonic structure of the piece...|$|E
