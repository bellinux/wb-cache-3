5|$|Like {{previous}} missions, {{the astronauts}} took many photos of Earth from the station, over 700 in total, {{which have been}} made freely available. These Crew Earth Observations, are intended to record dynamic events on the Earth's surface such as storms, fires, or volcanoes. For example, a photo from 1 January 2001 shows Mount Cleveland, Alaska, with a <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> smoke, prior to its eruption the following month. On 23 January 2001, the crew observed a unique perspective of a <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> volcanic ash coming from Popocatépetl, an active volcano 70 kilometres southeast of Mexico City.|$|E

5|$|On December 19, 2006, a {{large white}} <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> {{condensing}} steam was observed, leading some media people to assume {{there had been a}} small eruption. However, the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume. The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming a dome in the crater.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers may {{be close}} to solving this mystery. They noticed a large <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> gas {{extending}} at least six times its stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles {{as large as the}} supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E

5|$|By September 2, the storm's {{convective}} thunderstorms warmed slightly, indicating weakening to {{just below}} Category5. An eyewall replacement cycle took place, and two eye structures formed as gradual weakening continued. By September 2, {{the storm was}} downgraded to Category3 just before it turned slightly to the west. The storm underwent another eyewall replacement cycle as winds decreased further. As the storm entered cooler waters, winds decreased to 100mph (160km/h), below major hurricane intensity. Soon Hernan was downgraded to Category1, and the eye became cloud-filled. On September 5, Hernan was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds rapidly weakened to 45mph (72km/h) despite developing a new band of convection. That same day, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression as it began to lose tropical characteristics. Strong wind shear developed, further dissipating the depression. On September 6, the system degenerated into a remnant low-pressure system which spawned a remnant <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> moisture that meandered {{off the coast of}} California, producing light showers.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the star's diameter, questions have arisen about the complex dynamics of Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere. The mass that makes up galaxies is recycled as stars are formed and destroyed, and red supergiants are major contributors, yet {{the process by which}} mass is lost remain a mystery. With advances in interferometric methodologies, astronomers may be close to resolving this conundrum. In July 2009, images released by the European Southern Observatory, taken by the ground-based Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), showed a vast <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> gas extending 30AU from the star into the surrounding atmosphere. This mass ejection was equal to the distance between the Sun and Neptune and is one of multiple events occurring in Betelgeuse's surrounding atmosphere. Astronomers have identified at least six shells surrounding Betelgeuse. Solving the mystery of mass loss in the late stages of a star's evolution may reveal those factors that precipitate the explosive deaths of these stellar giants.|$|E

Blue <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> radioactive Cesium 137 (137 Cs) and purple to red <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> radioactive Cobalt 60 (60 Co) originated from TY Tank leaks and spills around the tanks. The depths of migration indicate that these plumes have reached groundwater. The figure illustrates behavioral trends <b>of</b> <b>plumes</b> where additional contamination will follow into groundwater. In 2002, a 50 fold increase in contamination {{was found between}} tanks TY- 103 and TY- 105, demonstrating the failure to report even recent tank leaks...|$|R

5|$|The 1985 Election Day floods (also {{known as}} the Killer Floods of 1985 in West Virginia) {{produced}} the costliest floods in both West Virginia and Virginia in November 1985. The event occurred after Hurricane Juan, a tropical cyclone in the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season, meandered near the coast of Louisiana before striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October31. Juan moved northward into Canada, but spawned another system that spread moderate rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic States, wetting soils. On November3, a low pressure area developed south of Florida and moved northeastward along a cold front, bringing a <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> moisture influenced by Juan's previous track. The storm moved through the southeastern United States, stalling on November5 west of Washington, D.C. before turning out to sea the next day. The event was {{known as the}} Election Day floods due to its concurrence with elections in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|A new convoy, codenamed Operation Excess {{was on its}} {{way through}} Malta with {{ammunition}} supplies. Excess coincided {{with the arrival of the}} Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) in Sicily to support the faltering Italians in the theatre, after the failed invasion of Egypt. On 9 January the Regia Aeronautica flew a fighter sweep over the Grand Harbour. Eighteen Macchi C.200s from 6° Gruppo were engaged in aerial combat. MacLachlan climbed to 22,000 feet and spotted the enemy fighters 10,000 below. He attacked a group of six and shot one down into the sea where it left a large <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> water. MacLachlan circled the sea and noticed the Italian pilot had escaped his aircraft and survived. Capitano Luigi Armanino was taken aboard a rescue craft to a prisoner of war camp in Malta, wounded in the thigh and arm. MacLachlan claimed a second Macchi shot down minutes later. The following day he attacked an Italian Fiat CR.42 over the Excess convoy as the Italians attacked the ships once more. Four others appeared and they climbed over him and dropped onto his tail. Not risking a five to one encounter, MacLachlan flew over the Excess convoy hoping the ship's fire would protect him The British vessels fired at him in error but his aircraft was not hit.|$|E
5|$|A non-tropical low {{pressure}} area developed about 240miles (390km) south-southwest of Bermuda on April 18 through the interaction of an upper-level trough and a surface frontal trough. The surface trough, which extended from the gale center to Hispaniola, brought a <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> moisture northward from the Caribbean Sea into the circulation, which caused heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico. The non-tropical low tracked generally northward, with a ridge to its east and west, and on April 19 the system began producing sporadic convection near its center; early that day, satellite imagery indicated {{the presence of a}} tight inner core of winds. After turning to the northwest, it looped southeastward and gradually became separated from the surface frontal system, due to the deepening of the upper-level trough over the system. Convection became better organized over the center, and it is estimated the system developed into Subtropical Storm Ana early on April 20 while located about 250miles (400km) west of Bermuda. Operationally, the subtropical cyclone was not classified by the National Hurricane Center until 21hours later.|$|E
