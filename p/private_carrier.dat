25|$|As {{communication}} was difficult due to geographical reasons, a <b>private</b> <b>carrier</b> service {{was established in}} 1868. This first Colombian <b>private</b> <b>carrier</b> provided a weekly mail service of El Dorado, which transported mail from the Siecha lagoon to Bogota, which lasted to 1870. Adhesives were created, a cliché was cut, the value of postage stamps was set to 1 real (10 centavos de peso) and printed on various available papers. The paper varies from plain white stationery, blue-striped paper, paper with watermarks, and a bluish and greenish paper up to squared notebook paper. The sheet size is not known, but there are blocks of four, some with tete-beche pairs, horizontal and vertical pairs and single stamps. Ten postally used covers are recorded between March and November 16, 1870, all related to {{the work on the}} site of the lagoon.|$|E

2500|$|In this model, {{which is}} unique, {{the role of}} the Medical Director is {{substantially}} different. [...] Scope of practice and all treatment protocols are developed by the Dutch Ambulance Institute on a national basis, and cannot be unilaterally changed at the local level by individual physicians. [...] Scope and protocols are reviewed, revised, and announced every four years, and any physician who wishes a change to those protocols must provide sound reasons and present a successful argument before a committee of the DIA. [...] The medical managers for each <b>private</b> <b>carrier</b> operate in a role approximating that of Medical Director, but only for that one company; their authority does not extend to other companies operating in the same community. [...] These individuals do perform quality service functions such as chart audits and complaint investigation, but they cannot unilaterally change treatment protocols. [...] They may provide guidance, advice and direction to paramedics by telephone or radio, or they may attend the scene in person to provide care. [...] The Dutch system also operates a network of four helicopters staffed by physicians for rapid response to support paramedics in the field. [...] While many of the individuals working in the Dutch system may be occasionally described as 'emergency physicians', the majority, as in the Franco-German model, are actually anesthetists.|$|E
