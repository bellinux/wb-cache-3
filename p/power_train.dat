40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effects of 6 weeks strength vs. ballistic-power (<b>Power)</b> <b>training</b> on shot put throwing performance in novice throwers. Seventeen novice male shot-put throwers were divided into Strength (N = 9) and Power (n = 8) groups. The following measurements were performed before and after the training period: shot put throws, jumping performance (CMJ), Wingate anaerobic performance, 1 RM strength, ballistic throws and evaluation of architectural and morphological characteristics of vastus lateralis. Throwing performance increased significantly but similarly after Strength and <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> (7. 0 - 13. 5 % vs. 6. 0 - 11. 5 %, respectively). Muscular strength in leg press increased more after Strength than after <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> (43 % vs. 21 %, respectively), while <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> induced an 8. 5 % increase in CMJ performance and 9. 0 - 25. 8 % in ballistic throws. Peak power during the Wingate test increased similarly after Strength and <b>Power</b> <b>training.</b> Muscle thickness increased only after Strength training (10 %, p < 0. 05). Muscle fibre Cross Sectional Area (fCSA) increased in all fibre types after Strength training by 19 - 26 % (p < 0. 05), while only type IIx fibres hypertrophied significantly after <b>Power</b> <b>training.</b> Type IIx fibres (%) decreased after Strength but not after <b>Power</b> <b>training.</b> These results suggest that shot put throwing performance can be increased similarly after six weeks of either strength or ballistic <b>power</b> <b>training</b> in novice throwers, but with dissimilar muscular adaptation...|$|R

40|$|Background. Age-related {{decline in}} muscle power {{may be an}} early {{indicator}} of balance deficits and fall risk, even in nonfrail adults. This study examined the dose-dependent effect of <b>power</b> <b>training</b> on balance performance in healthy older adults. Methods. One hundred twelve community-dwelling healthy older adults (69 6 6 years) were randomized to 8 â€“ 12 weeks of <b>power</b> <b>training</b> at 20 % (LOW), 50 % (MED), or 80 % (HIGH) of maximal strength, or a nontraining control (CON) group. Participants trained twice weekly (five exercises; three sets of eight rapid concentric/slow eccentric repetitions) using pneumatic resistance machines. Balance, muscle performance (strength, power, endurance, contraction velocity), and body composition were measured. Results. <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> significantly improved balance performance (p. 006) in participants who underwent <b>power</b> <b>training</b> compared to controls. Low intensity <b>power</b> <b>training</b> produced the greatest improvement in balance performance (p. 048). Average contraction velocity at low load (40 % one repetition maximum [1 RM]) at baseline independently predicted improvement in balance following training (r. 29, p. 004). Conclusions. <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> improves balance, particularly using a low load, high velocity regimen, in older adults with initial lower muscle power and slower contraction. Further studies are warranted to define the mechanisms underlying this adaptation, {{as well as the}} optimum <b>power</b> <b>training</b> intensity for a range of physiological and clinical outcomes in olde...|$|R

To this end, the company commissioned a new steamboat to be constructed at Brownsville. During the winter and spring of 1814, while Shreve was on the voyage to New Orleans, the Enterprise, with an engine and <b>power</b> <b>train</b> designed and built by Daniel French, was constructed. Between June and December 1814, the Enterprise, {{under the command of}} Israel Gregg, made two successful voyages transporting passengers and cargo to ports between Brownsville and Louisville, Kentucky. By December, the company had decided to send the Enterprise to New Orleans with a cargo of munitions for General Andrew Jackson's troops to defend the city against an invasion by British forces.

500|$|Despite this setback, {{within a}} year Evans had found a client. The Philadelphia Board of Health was {{concerned}} {{with the problem of}} dredging and cleaning the city's dockyards and removing sandbars: in 1805 Evans convinced them to contract him to develop a steam-powered dredge. The result was the Oruktor Amphibolos, or [...] "Amphibious Digger". The vessel consisted of a flat-bottomed scow with bucket chains to bring up mud and hooks to clear away sticks, stones and other obstacles. Power for the dredging equipment and propulsion was supplied by a high-pressure Evans engine. The end result was a craft nearly thirty feet long, twelve feet wide and weighing some seventeen tons. To move this ungainly hulk to the waterfront, as well to give a demonstration of his long-held beliefs in the possibility of land-based steam transportation, Evans mounted the hull on four wheels (twice, as the first set collapsed under the weight) and connected the engine to them in order to drive the Oruktor from his workshop through the Philadelphia streets {{on the way to the}} Schuylkill River on July 13, 1805. The Oruktor Amphibolos is thus believed to have been the first automobile in the United States, and the first motorized amphibious craft in the world. However, very few contemporary accounts of the craft survive, and Evans's tendency to exaggerate its success in his own annals make verification of its performance difficult. Although Evans himself claimed it proceeded successfully around Philadelphia (and circled his erstwhile rival Benjamin Latrobe's Philadelphia waterworks) before launching into the river and paddling at speed to Philadelphia harbor; the great weight of the craft make land-propulsion based on its limited engine capacity and jury-rigged <b>power</b> <b>train</b> fairly improbable over any significant distance. It is similarly unknown how well, if at all, the Oruktor functioned as a steamboat, and Evans's claims on this point vary significantly over the years. Nevertheless, it is known that the invention proved ineffective for its ostensible purpose as a dredger, and it was scrapped for parts by the Board of Health in 1808. Nevertheless, [...] Evans's ideas of steam carriages were not an impossible dream. Evans would continue to promote the idea. In 1812 he published a futuristic description of a world connected by a network of Shipping lines railroad tracks and steam locomotives, accurately describing what will happen in the future. long before any such potential could be realized: ...|$|E

40|$|Legal {{regulations}} (USA, EU) {{are a major}} {{driving force}} for intensifying technological developments {{with respect to the}} global automobile market. In the future, highly efficient vehicles with very low emission levels will include low-temperature fuel-cell systems (PEFC) as units of electric <b>power</b> <b>trains.</b> With alcohols, ether or hydrocarbons used as fuels for these new electric <b>power</b> <b>trains,</b> hydrogen as PEFC fuel has to be produced on board. These concepts including the direct use of methanol in fuel-cell systems, differ considerably in terms of both their development prospects and the results achieved so far. Based on process engineering analyses for net electricity generation in PEFC-powered <b>power</b> <b>trains,</b> as well as on assumptions for electric <b>power</b> <b>trains</b> and vehicle configurations, different fuel-cell performances and fuel processing units for octane, diesel, methanol, ethanol, propane and dimethylether have been evaluated as fuels. The possible benefits and key challenges for different solutions of <b>power</b> <b>trains</b> with fuel-cell systems/on-board hydrogen production and with direct methanol fuel-cell (DMFC) systems have been assessed. Locally, fuel-cell <b>power</b> <b>trains</b> are almost emission-free and, unlike battery-powered vehicles, their range is comparable to conventional vehicles. Therefore, they have application advantages cases of particularly stringent emission standards requiring zero emission. In comparison to internal combustion engines, using fuel-cell <b>power</b> <b>trains</b> can lead to clear reductions in primary energy demand and global, climate-relevant emissions providing the advantage of the efficiency of the hydrogen/air reaction in the fuel cell is not too drastically reduced by additional conversion steps of on-board hydrogen production, or by losses due to fuel supply provision.
