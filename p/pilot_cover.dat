50|$|He went on {{to publish}} a number of large-format books {{showcasing}} his maritime photography. For his innovative Illustrated Coast Pilot, which illustrated principal landmarks and aids to navigation on the East Coast, he studied for, and passed, the examination for a licensed coastal pilot for a considerable section of the East Coast. This early photographic record {{may be the first}} publication to systematically employ photography to illustrate landmarks in a book of sailing directions, a type of navigational aid used by mariners for more than one thousand years. The first edition (1891) of the Illustrated Coast <b>Pilot</b> <b>covered</b> only the U.S. east coast between New York and Maine. Stebbins extended coverage to the entire Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast in the second edition (1896).|$|R

30|$|The {{students}} were poor at scanning the scene during most {{components of the}} cardiac arrest and may lack the use of “peripheral vision” and constant visual scanning {{due to a lack}} of experience. Kirby et al. found in a study of military helicopter pilots undertaking a high speed low level flight task that the more experience <b>pilots</b> <b>covered</b> more in the scanning of the instruments in less time, maintained a level flight altitude and spent less time looking outside for a long time compare to the novice pilots (Kirby et al. 2014). The issue may be that student paramedics are not completely familiar with managing a cardiac arrest scene so spend more time focusing on the defibrillator and concentrating on the tasks they need to perform and do not think about a constant visual “sweep” of the scene to ascertain what is happening, especially from a safety perspective.|$|R
40|$|This paper briefly {{presents}} the main {{lines of the}} European Commission's policy on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data in the Horizon 2020 programme. The respective pilot on open research data is presented in detail. The <b>pilot</b> <b>covers</b> approximately 20 percent of the H 2020 funding in 2014 and 2015 {{in the areas of}} future and emerging technologies; e-Infrastructures; leadership in enabling and industrial technologies – ICT; societal challenges related to smart cities and communities, climate action, environment, and resource efficiency, inclusive, innovative and reflective societies; and science with and for society, thus extending the move from open access to research results towards OA to research data. A next step will be to consider a more global open science ap­proach encompassing a change of culture towards more openness, accessibility, re-usability, multidisciplinary, participatory collaboration, and an approach driven by what is of benefit for society...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} work {{to implement}} the University of Edinburgh Research Data Management (RDM) policy by developing the services needed to support researchers and fulfil obligations within a changing national and international setting. This is framed by an evolving Research Data Management Roadmap and includes a governance model that ensures cooperation amongst Information Services (IS) managers and oversight by an academic-led steering group. IS has taken requirements from research groups and IT professionals, and {{at the request of}} the steering group has conducted pilot work involving volunteer research units within the three colleges to develop functionality and presentation for the key services. The first <b>pilots</b> <b>cover</b> three key services: the data store, a customisation of the Digital Curation Centre’s DMPonline tool, and the data repository. The paper will report on the plans, achievements and challenges encountered while we attempt to bring the University of Edinburgh RDM Roadmap to fruition...|$|R

40|$|The Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a {{composite}} measurement tool that indicates women’s control over critical parts {{of their lives in}} the household, community, and economy. It allows us to identify women who are disempowered and understand how to increase autonomy and decisionmaking in key domains. The WEAI is also a useful tool for tracking progress toward gender equality, {{which is one of the}} Millennium Development Goals. The WEAI measures the empowerment, agenc y, and inclusion of women in the agriculture sector in an effort to identify ways to overcome those obstacles and constraints. The Index is a significant innovation in its field and aims to increase understanding of the connections between women’s empowerment, food security, and agricultural growth. The Uganda <b>pilot</b> <b>covered</b> five spatially dispersed rural districts in the northern region (Amuru and Kole), central region (Luwero and Masaka), and eastern region (Iganga). The second pilot was conducted to develop and test a revised version of WEAI in the same districts as the original pilot.

He stated these <b>pilot</b> programs <b>cover</b> nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/tort reform.
