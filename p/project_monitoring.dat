25|$|In August 2004, HEEP {{strategic}} priorities were {{adjusted to}} become {{responsive to the}} requirements of quality and accreditation and to correspond to the government's approach to improving scientific research. The adjustment added two more dimensions: first, developing post graduate studies and scientific research and second, addressing students’ extra-curricular activities in addition to the continued implementation of the six prioritized programs during the first phase. Due to the dynamic nature of the reform strategy, which entails reconsidering priorities for each period, a Strategic Planning Unit (SPU) was established for the MOHE to ensure the sustainability of planning and <b>project</b> <b>monitoring</b> during the three phases and for future ones. A Students’ Activity Project (SAP) was also initiated as part of program accreditation similar to scientific research and post graduate studies.|$|E
25|$|World Bank: Dating back to {{the early}} 1970s, The World Bank has worked on various water supply {{projects}} for the capital city of Managua. Most recently, there is project to increase access to reliable water and sanitation services to the population of the greater Managua region. Components include: 1) securing continuous drinking water; 2) the improvement of water supply and efficiency in selected areas where the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has provided a water balance study showing that improvements in water supply can be significant; 3) the institutional strengthening and <b>project</b> <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation. A World Bank project more focused on the entire country is also under way and aims to increase coverage of rural water supply. This project supports municipalities with investments and technical assistance. Pilot water supply projects are another facet of this project and may {{serve as the basis for}} larger initiatives in rural water supply. Institutional strengthening and project management is another area of focus in this US$23 million project that was scheduled to be carried until 2014.|$|E
