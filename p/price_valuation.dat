50|$|The {{place of}} {{residence}} for Claeys has also come into question. While seeking his second term for the Kansas House of Representatives, {{it was reported that}} Claeys had filed to run for office under his sister's address. During the controversy, he claimed to live with his sister, her husband, and their three children for personal reasons. When confronted by a reporter to see that he actually had a living space within his sister's home, he declined to let the reporter enter, stating “I’m not going to be held to a different level of scrutiny than everybody else is,” and “It’s nobody’s business.” The listed address was controversial for many reasons, most of which revolved around a property owned by Claeys in Lawrence, Kansas. The property was a condominium valued at $433,400 for tax purposes. A resident who lives in the same complex in Lawrence was quoted as saying “J.R. has a two-car garage and a stall for his boat,” and “He votes on issues that come up in the Bella Sera Homeowners Association.” Claeys defended having the property stating that was the residence he used while the Kansas House of Representatives was in session. He also defended the <b>price</b> <b>valuation</b> by saying that the apartment was one of several locations he bought out of foreclosure.|$|E
