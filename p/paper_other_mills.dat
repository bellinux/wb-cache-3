50|$|During the 19th century several barracks {{were placed}} in Altdorf-Weingarten, making the city an {{important}} military site; following this in 1911 a young Erwin Rommel was based in the town. As in neighbouring Ravensburg, a significant engineering industry evolved {{during the second half}} of the century, based mainly on the local traditions of (<b>paper</b> and <b>other)</b> <b>mills</b> and textile production.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical {{engineering}} {{has traditionally}} been the main type of industry in the region. Based on the demand of the paper and textile industries (now widely reduced) and {{a long tradition of}} flour, <b>paper</b> and <b>other</b> <b>mills</b> many engineering factories arose {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Today the primary engineering firms in Ravensburg are the left-overs of the former Escher-Wyss AG (a subsidiary of the Swiss Sulzer AG) which are now subsidiaries of the Austrian [...] "Andritz Hydro".|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{there are}} {{approximately}} 350 businesses in the Wentworth area, the major ones being the SAPREF and Engen oil refineries, and the Mondi and Sappi <b>paper</b> <b>mills.</b> <b>Other</b> industries {{that make up the}} Wentworth area include landfills, and water treatment sites. In Wentworth area specifically, factories {{can be found on the}} northern, eastern, and western sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a bulk {{material}} handling facility may be to transport material from one of several locations (i.e. a source) to an ultimate destination or to process material such as ore in concentrating and smelting or handling materials for manufacturing such as logs, wood chips and sawdust at sawmills and <b>paper</b> <b>mills.</b> <b>Other</b> industries using bulk materials handling include flour mills and coal-fired utility boilers.|$|R
50|$|Niels Sigfred Nebelong {{designed}} a residence for the Drewsen family which {{was completed in}} 1850. The house was frequented by many leading Danish literary figures of the day. In 1889, Stramd,øllen merged with several <b>other</b> <b>paper</b> <b>mills</b> under the name De Forenede Paperfabrikker ("United Paper Mills"). The company decommissioned the Strandmøllen complex in 1898. Most of the industrial complex was demolished in 1918 but immediately thereafter restored by the architect Carl Brummer. In 1920 - 21, Christian Nielsen established a production of hydrogen and oxygen at Strandmållen. The company, A/S Strandmøllen, has been owned by a foundation since 1967 and is still based at the site.|$|R
50|$|Each of the Morris {{companies}} operated as {{a separate}} and virtually autonomous profit center. Rock City opened not only small set-up and folding carton plants but also facilities in Livingston and Milan, Tennessee, to meet the packaging needs of shirtmakers. A set-up box division was established in 1955. Rock City Waste Paper Co. collected, sorted, and baled wastepaper for sale to <b>paper</b> <b>mills.</b> <b>Other</b> Morris companies and plants sprouted throughout the South. Sales grew from $8 million in 1959 to $12.9 million in 1967, when all the companies were consolidated into Rock City Packaging, Inc. Morris became {{chairman of the board}} and a son-in-law, Worley Brown, became president. Sales volume reached $23 million in 1972.|$|R
50|$|For 500 years European paper makers {{could only}} produce {{what came to}} be called laid paper. In 1757 John Baskerville printed his famous edition of Virgil on a new kind of paper, called Wove (known in Europe as Vélin). This paper is now known to have been made by the elder James Whatman. Twenty-five years later (1780s) the {{manufacture}} of wove paper spread quickly to <b>other</b> <b>paper</b> <b>mills</b> in England, and was also being developed in France and America. All this took place over a decade before a machine to replace making paper by hand was conceived. With the establishment of the paper machine (1807), the manufacture of paper on a wove wire base would become the predominant standard in the world, with laid paper being relegated to certain specialist uses, such as being used as a support for charcoal drawings. Today more than 99% of the world's paper is made in this way.|$|R
5000|$|Despite all this, {{evidence}} suggests that conditions were better than in some <b>other</b> <b>mills.</b> The complex had opening windows, and an extra room per floor for workers to wash. [...] The third break of the day, in the afternoon, was also a luxury that many workers in <b>other</b> <b>mills</b> did not receive. Furthermore, the Murrays also claimed that, unlike many <b>other</b> <b>mill</b> owners, they did not use pauper children from workhouses, or knowingly employ {{children under the age}} of nine, although George Murray conceded that some parents did employ their own children below that age.|$|R

500|$|Compared {{to other}} trades, wages in cotton mills were {{relatively}} high. [...] In 1833, the average earnings {{of an employee}} at the complex was 12 shillings (60p) per week, which compared favourably with <b>other</b> <b>mills.</b> [...] However, unlike some <b>other</b> <b>mill</b> owners the Murrays did not give employees credit to buy goods from company-owned stores, or provide housing for employees beyond key workers.|$|R

50|$|Hamilton {{commissioned}} {{civil engineer}} Pierre Charles L'Enfant, {{responsible for the}} layout of the new capital at Washington, D.C., to design the system of canals known as raceways supplying the power for the watermills in the new town. As a result, Paterson became the nucleus for a burgeoning mill industry. In 1793, two years after the society's foundation, the falls was the site of the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in New Jersey. In 1812, it was the site of the state's first continuous roll <b>paper</b> <b>mill.</b> <b>Other</b> products whose construction used the falls as a power source include the Rogers Locomotive Works (1832), the Colt revolver (1837), and the USS Holland (SS-1) (1898). The oldest extant structure in the historic district is the Phoenix Mill, built in 1813. The industrial area also became the site of labor unrest, as it was a center for the 1913 Paterson silk strike. Immigrant workers, facing harsh conditions in factories staged numerous strikes, giving the United States its first organized labor movement.|$|R
50|$|At Least two <b>other</b> <b>mills</b> were in {{operation}} in Harden, both situated alongside Harden Beck {{to the south}} of the village. One of the mills is still there and now operates as a printing works. The <b>other</b> <b>mill</b> was further upstream from the existing mill and during {{the early part of the}} 20th century was turned into a café and ballroom. It was destroyed by fire in 1927.|$|R
50|$|His <b>other</b> <b>mills</b> {{included}} Bean Ings (1792), {{the first}} wool factory, Burley Mills (1798), and St Ann's Mills (1824).|$|R
5000|$|There was a [...] "Pierce" [...] (note spelling) mill on the Potomac River, {{not to be}} {{confused}} with Peirce <b>mill.</b> The <b>other</b> <b>mill</b> (Pierce Mill) is listed in the NPS records and was near Fletcher's Boathouse.|$|R

500|$|Freight {{transport}} {{started in}} 2004, when {{an agreement with}} Norske Skog was made to transport timber along the Røros, Meråker and Nordland lines to the paper mill at Skogn. The activity was further increased in 2006, when a contract worth NOK 30 million was signed to transport [...] of timber, including some to the <b>other</b> <b>paper</b> <b>mill</b> in Halden. The following year, Ofotbanen also entered the container freight market, with a train running from Narvik via Sweden to Oslo, both via the Meråker Line and via the Kongsvinger Line. The trains would continue to Drammen when necessary. Ofotbanen was also in negotiations about transporting 700 annual trains of ore for Rana Gruber, but the contract was instead awarded to CargoNet. By 2005, Ofotbanen only had a 50% utilization of their stock, but in March a contract {{for the rest of}} the year was signed securing full use of the equipment to transport timber in Southern Sweden, with two trains in continual traffic. The extraordinary traffic was needed to clean up after the Gudrun storm, and the contract gave a revenue of NOK 20 million.|$|R
