500|$|On January 21, 2016, Microsoft was sued {{in small}} claims court by a user whose computer, shortly {{after the release of}} the OS, had {{attempted}} to upgrade to Windows10 without her consent. The upgrade failed, and her computer was left in an unstable state thereafter, which disrupted the ability to run her travel agency. The court ruled in favor of the user and awarded her $10,000 in damages, but Microsoft appealed. However, in May 2016, Microsoft dropped the appeal and chose to pay the damages. Shortly after the suit was reported on by the Seattle Times, Microsoft confirmed that it was updating the GWX software once again to add more explicit options for opting out of a free Windows 10 upgrade; the final notification was a full-screen <b>pop-up</b> <b>window</b> notifying users of the impending end of the free upgrade offer, and contained [...] "Remind me later", [...] "Do not notify me again" [...] and [...] "Notify me three more times" [...] options.|$|E
500|$|PokerTracker 3 is {{also known}} for its {{integrated}} heads-up display, a transparent video overlay data presentation that makes statistics and notes are readily available during play. The HUD allows an online poker player to focus his attention on the poker table {{he or she is}} playing at, rather than on the PokerTracker application. The HUD provides a vast array of realtime statistics for in-game analysis, customizable to the user's preference. In addition to the statistics available constantly during play on the poker window, detailed statistics are available in a <b>pop-up</b> <b>window,</b> accessible via a single mouse click. Marbella Slim of the Daily Star used the vision of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator character in an analogy with the HUD: [...] "In some scenes, you get to see what the robot Terminator is seeing and he has all these data streams in front of his vision - it's a HUD or a head-up display." [...] Unlike other poker tracking products, PokerTracker 3 includes a HUD as part of the basic program. [...] The PT3 HUD, which automatically overlays a player's opponents' statistics next to their avatars, is essentially a built-in version of the formerly available PokerAce HUD.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to September 2016, a {{television}} licence {{was not required}} to stream either BBC television or radio programmes from iPlayer which had already been broadcast. However, {{a television}} licence was still {{required in order to}} watch live content. However, since 1 September 2016, a television licence is legally required in order to stream BBC television content on iPlayer, regardless of whether it is live or on-demand. Despite the requirement, the enforcement of this measure only used a trust system, under which users must acknowledge a <b>pop-up</b> <b>window</b> warning of the new requirements.

2500|$|The Priv shiped with Android 5.1.1 [...] "Lollipop" [...] a {{month after}} Android Marshmallow was launched, using a [...] "stock" [...] user {{experience}} customized with additional features and BlackBerry-developed apps. BlackBerry Hub (which originates from BlackBerry 10) aggregates notifications and content from multiple sources and allows for granular management of messages and [...] "snoozing" [...] based off time, location or network availability.

The [...] "Productivity Edge" [...] feature allows a tab to be shown on either the left or right curve of the display, which can be dragged out to display an agenda screen. A progress bar can also be displayed on an edge when the device is charging. An application's home screen widget can be made available from its respective shortcut icon by swiping, which displays the widget as a <b>pop-up</b> <b>window.</b> The DTEK app allows users to view an overview of the security and privacy status of the device based on best practices, and provide notifications when apps attempt to access sensitive information or permissions.

Three groups of students viewed illustrated texts depicting the functioning of the heart and the replication of the AIDS virus either with textual information presented below the picture, with textual information integrated within the picture, or with textual information integrated within the picture with <b>pop-up</b> <b>windows</b> The results showed that the integrated formats were more effective than the separated format when we tested the retention of textual information, comprehension, and the matching of textual elements to the appropriate illustrated elements. Furthermore, they indicated that the group working with <b>pop-up</b> <b>windows</b> performed better than the integrated groups on the retention test for illustrated information as well as when asked to find correct solutions to problems in a comprehension test. Consequently, these findings support the use of <b>pop-up</b> <b>windows</b> in learning with this kind of illustrated explanatory text...|$|R
