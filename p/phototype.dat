5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the <b>phototype</b> period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E
500|$|Monotype's original, early {{digitisation}} of Bembo {{was widely}} seen as unsuccessful. Two main problems have been cited with it: it was much lighter in type colour than the original metal type, perhaps through failure to anticipate the reduced ink spread on modern printing equipment. In addition, the digital Bembo {{was based on the}} 9 pt metal drawings, creating a font with different proportions to the metal type in the point sizes at which Bembo was most often used in books. This made the proportions of the digital font appear wrong, failing to match the subtlety of the metal type and even <b>phototype,</b> which was released in three different optical sizes for different print sizes. Future Monotype executive Akira Kobayashi commented: ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{similar but}} more {{eccentric}} design {{was created by}} Johnston's student Harold Curwen {{for the use of}} his family company, the Curwen Press of Plaistow. Named [...] "Curwen Sans" [...] or [...] "Curwen Modern", it has many similarities to Johnston also, and was occasionally used by London Transport in work printed by the Curwen Press. Curwen described it as based on his time studying with Johnston in the 1900s, although it was not cut into metal until 1928, around the same time as Gill Sans was released. Jan Tschichold, who would later make extensive use of Gill Sans while designing books for Penguin, created a similar design for an early <b>phototype</b> machine, which was at the time little-used. As described above, Linotype began work in 1955 on a Gill Sans competitor, intended to be named 'Magnus'. Designed by the German type designer Hermann Zapf with input from British Linotype manager Walter Tracy, the design was ultimately abandoned by 1963 for reasons of lack of manufacturing capacity and changing tastes, although it progressed as far as test proofs.|$|E

2500|$|The institutes {{above-mentioned}} offer a very incomplete idea of {{the historical}} work done in the Vatican archives. Many Frenchmen, Germans, Austrians, Belgians, and others flock to Rome and {{spend much of their}} time in private investigations of their own. Most of these workers attach themselves to some institute and profit by its experience. Among Americans we may mention Professor Charles Homer Haskins, who familiarized himself with the treasures contained in the archives and library, and made a report on the same for the [...] "American Historical Review", reprinted in the [...] "Catholic University Bulletin", Washington, 1897, pp.177–196; Rev. P. de Roo, who laboured for several years on the [...] "Regesta" [...] of Alexander VI; Heywood, who compiled the [...] "Documenta selecta e tabulario Sanctæ Sedis, insulas et terras anno 1492 repertas a Christophoro Columbo respicientia", which he published in <b>phototype</b> in 1892. Other American scholars have profited largely by the immemorial academic hospitality of the popes. Special mention should be made here of the studies of Luka Jelic and Conrad Eubel concerning early missionary enterprises, and of an essay by Shipley on [...] "The Colonization of America" [...] (Lucerne, 1899). For other valuable information see the tenth volume of the [...] "Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia". The time would seem to be at hand for the foundation of an American Catholic historical institute, which would take over the task of collecting and publishing in a systematic way the numerous important documents concerning the American Church preserved in many places at Rome, particularly in the Propaganda archives. Russia has sent historical commissions to Rome repeatedly, and for several years at a time. The names of Schmurlow, Brückner, Pierling, Forster, Wiersbowski, and others are sufficient reminders of the excellent work accomplished. From Japan came Dr. Murakami, to explore the Propaganda and Vatican archives for a history of the Catholic missions to Japan (1549–1690). Denmark is represented among the investigators by such names as Moltesen, Krarup, and Lindback; Norway by Storm, and Sweden by Tegnér, Elof, Karlson, and others. Moritz Stern, Felix Vernet, and others obtained at the Vatican material for a history of the Hebrews. The Spanish Government was long officially represented by the famous Spanish historian, Ricardo de Hinojosa, while researches in Portuguese history are conducted by MacSwiney. Switzerland entered into this peaceful competition by the labours of Kirsch and Baumgarten in 1899, and since the close of the last century many Swiss have visited Rome for Vatican researches, both as individuals and on official missions. We need only mention the names of Büchi, Wirz, Bernoulli, Steffens, Reinhard, and Stückelberg.|$|E
60|$|The late Mr. John Addington Symonds wrote--in a {{preface to}} certain Dante {{illustrations}} by Stradanus, a sixteenth-century artist of no great excellence, published in <b>phototype</b> by Mr. Unwin in 1892--that the illustrations of Gustave Doré, 'in spite of glaring artistic defects, must, I think, be reckoned first among numerous attempts to translate Dante's conceptions into terms of plastic art.' One can only {{account for this}} praise of a noisy and demagogic art by supposing that a temperament, strong enough to explore with unfailing alertness the countless schools and influences of the Renaissance in Italy, is of necessity a little lacking in delicacy of judgment and in the finer substances of emotion. It {{is more difficult to}} account for so admirable a scholar not only preferring these illustrations to the work of what he called 'the graceful and affected Botticelli,'--although 'Doré was fitted for his task, not by dramatic vigour, by feeling for beauty, or by anything sternly in sympathy with the supreme poet's soul, but by a very effective sense of luminosity and gloom,'--but preferring them because 'he created a fanciful world, which makes the movement of Dante's dramatis personæ conceivable, introducing the ordinary intelligence into those vast regions thronged with destinies of souls and creeds and empires.' When the ordinary student finds this intelligence in an illustrator, he thinks, because it is his own intelligence, that it is an accurate interpretation of the text, while work of the extraordinary intelligences is merely an expression of their own ideas and feelings. Doré and Stradanus, he will tell you, have given us something of the world of Dante, but Blake and Botticelli have builded worlds of their own and called them Dante's--as if Dante's world were more than a mass of symbols of colour and form and sound which put on humanity, when they arouse some mind to an intense and romantic life that is not theirs; as if it was not one's own sorrows and angers and regrets and terrors and hopes that awaken to condemnation or repentance while Dante treads his eternal pilgrimage; as if any poet or painter or musician could be other than an enchanter calling with a persuasive or compelling ritual, creatures, noble or ignoble, divine or dæmonic, covered with scales or in shining raiment, that he never imagined, out of the bottomless deeps of imaginations he never foresaw; as if the noblest achievement of art was not when the artist enfolds himself in darkness, while he casts over his readers a light as of a wild and terrible dawn.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a single DNA typing method which uses 144 sequence-specific primer (SSP) reactions to simultaneously detect all known HLA-A, B, C, DRB 1, DRB 3, DRB 4, DRB 5 and DQB 1 specificities in an allele specific or group specific manner using the same method, reagents, PCR parameters and protocols for all loci. The results from this integrated class I & II method can be visualized on a single photographic or electronic image and hence is described as “Phototyping”. <b>Phototyping</b> has an overall resolution greater than or equivalent to good serology and results can be obtained in under 3 hours making the method suitable for genotyping potential cadaver donor peripheral blood without serological backup. This in turn produces the potential for reducing cold ischaemia times in renal transplantation {{as well as the}} application of prospective matching to cardiac and liver transplantation. The method has capacity to detect new alleles, for example, novel amplification patterns suggestive of 4 new HLA-B alleles have been detected. The <b>Phototyping</b> set has been used as the sole method of HLA typing for over 1010 individuals. <b>Phototyping</b> is not problem-free; deviations from the standard protocol, poor quality DNA and unsuitable PCR machines can result in individual PCR failures or in incorrect assignment of antigens.

40|$|Introduction: Postmen are daily {{exposed to}} high levels of solar radiation, and lack of {{protection}} can result in many health damages. The present study aimed to identify cutaneous <b>phototypes</b> and evaluate the intake of oral photoprotectors by postmen. Methods: Cross-sectional study, carried out from August 2011 to December 2012 in the city of Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Socioeconomic and behavioral data regarding daily solar exposure were collected through a questionnaire. To evaluate the intake of beta-carotene, lycopene and omega- 3, two 24 -hour dietary recalls were applied. Cutaneous phototypes were assessed by Fitzpatrick’s classification.   Results: A total of 181 postmen were analyzed, whose mean age was 40. 2 ± 11. 4 years old, and 140 (77. 3 %) were male. The cutaneous <b>phototypes</b> II, III and IV were the most prevalent (n= 138), totaling 76. 3 % of the sample. The median for the oral photoprotectors intake was 1. 16 mg (0. 46 – 2. 29) of beta-carotene, 3. 60 mg (1. 01 – 6. 31) of lycopene and 0. 95 g (0. 61 – 1. 45) of n- 3 fatty acids, all values significantly lower than the minimal doses to obtain photoprotective effect (p< 0. 001). The individuals in the group of <b>phototypes</b> V and VI showed lower adherence to the use of sunscreen and lower intake of beta-carotene, comparing to the other groups. Conclusions: The intake of oral photoprotectors is low in this population. Future studies may evaluate the real effect of oral photoprotectors, so that preventive measures using this approach can be included in photoprotection education actions for outdoor workers.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the minimal erythema dose (MED) for narrowband ultraviolet B in patients receiving isotretinoin treatmentMaterial and Method: Phototesting was done by narrowband ultraviolet B irradiation on fifty patients for whom isotretinoin treatment was planned. MED values were calculated before treatment (MED 1) and during treatment after reaching half of the target dose (kgx 120 mg) (MED 2), and it was evaluated whether there was statistically significant difference between the two MED values.
