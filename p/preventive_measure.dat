Sixty per cent (60 %) of the patients were at risk of developing diabetic foot complications. The <b>preventive</b> <b>measures</b> were low in these patients. Patient knowledge was insufficient and behaviour even worse. Basal preventive shoe adaptations were absent in most patients at risk. No relation between risk category and the preventional status was found. Cross-sectional examination at a university outpatient clinic showed serious risk profiles for foot complications, which were not balanced by the application of generally accepted <b>preventive</b> <b>measures.</b> At the outpatient clinic. screening should be optimised...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Influenza viruses affect 5 – 15 % of the {{population}} annually and cause {{a broad spectrum of}} disease severity. Handwashing and wearing face masks are common <b>preventive</b> <b>measures</b> against transmission in the community. Our study investigated how different influenza-related symptoms would affect personal <b>preventive</b> <b>measures.</b> Methods We conducted a longitudinal study with 4 rounds of telephone interviews. We collected data on symptom profile and the corresponding personal <b>preventive</b> <b>measures.</b> We used generalized estimating equations to assess the effect of different influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms on <b>preventive</b> <b>measures</b> taken. Results We interviewed 3249 participants contributing to 8722 responses. ILI-related symptoms were reported in 3592 responses and 22. 2 % of these respondents have taken <b>preventive</b> <b>measures.</b> Of these, 49. 9 % and 53. 9 % increased frequency of handwashing and wore mask, respectively. Among subjects having one ILI symptom only, a small proportion adopted personal <b>preventive</b> <b>measures,</b> ranging from 3. 7 %– 2. 7 %, 2. 4 %– 25. 2 % for more handwashing and wearing mask. Subjects with more than one symptoms were more likely to take <b>preventive</b> <b>measures.</b> In the multivariable analysis, we found that younger subjects (aged 0 – 15 y) with ILI washed their hands more frequently (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 6 – 3. 6), but were less likely to wear masks (aOR = 0. 2, 95 % CI: 0. 1 – 0. 5). Subjects having fever increased their frequency of handwashing (aOR = 3. 3, 95 % CI: 2. 1 – 5. 2) and wore mask (aOR = 6. 8, 95 % CI: 3. 7 – 12. 5). Runny nose had similar effect on personal <b>preventive</b> <b>measures,</b> with aOR = 3. 5 (95 % CI: 2. 6 – 2. 7) and 4. 9 (95 % CI: 3. 5 – 6. 8) for handwashing and wearing mask, respectively, while aOR = 2. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 9 – 3. 6) and 4. 7 (95 % CI: 3. 2 – 6. 9) for cough. Discussion <b>Preventive</b> <b>measures</b> taken by subjects with ILI were in line with public health recommendations that emphasize on cough etiquette for persons with respiratory symptoms, however fever is also a major symptom enhancing personal <b>preventive</b> <b>measures.</b> This suggests that personal <b>preventive</b> <b>measures</b> taken may also depend on personal discomfort. Further understanding of the factors affecting <b>preventive</b> <b>measures</b> may help to refine public health messages during influenza season to targeted population...|$|R

5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a <b>preventive</b> <b>measure,</b> if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E

Sporadic incidents of stone pelting at municipal and private buses were reported in the reat of Maharashtra following the arrest of MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Ratnagiri.

Meanwhile, police have picked up around 100 MNS activists, including some corporators as a <b>preventive</b> <b>measure.</b> In Nashik, MNS activists set ablaze a truck near PWD minister Chhagan Bhujbal's farm and also damaged another truck at Vilholi-Phata area, police said. Incidents of stone pelting on MSRTC buses and other vehicles were reported in some areas, they said, adding vehicular traffic on the busy Mumbai-Agra-national highway was disrupted following the protest. Police rounded up 70 MNS activists in Nashik incidents and security was tightened in the city. In Solapur, incidents of stone pelting on state transport buses were also reported.

5|$|Meanwhile, serious {{divisions}} {{emerged in}} the Jordanian state over reactions to the Eisenhower Doctrine, which ostensibly aimed to stem Soviet expansion in the Middle East, but was viewed by Arab nationalists as a neo-colonialist ploy to control the region. Nabulsi and Foreign Minister Abdullah Rimawi, a Baathist, led the camp opposing the doctrine {{as a threat to}} Arab sovereignty and as means to control the region's oil assets and support Israel, while Hussein publicly embraced the doctrine as a <b>preventive</b> <b>measure</b> against growing communist influence in the country. Prior to these disagreements, Nabulsi had been clamping down on communist literature and influence in the press (the communists were generally opposed by Arab nationalists), whilst attempting to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union (USSR) without Hussein's knowledge. To that end, he dispatched Abu Nuwar to Moscow in February 1957 to serve as an initial contact with the Soviets. Later, Nabulsi publicly declared his intention to establish relations with the USSR and pursue a political union with Egypt and Syria, and requested from Hussein a confirmation of his dismissal of several royalist officials. Hussein responded by forcing Nabulsi to resign on 10 April 1957.|$|E

40|$|AIM: Twelve {{to thirty}} % of {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) patients and relatives {{with an increased}} familial risk of CRC are referred for <b>preventive</b> <b>measures.</b> New guidelines recommend genetic counselling for high-risk families and surveillance colonoscopy for moderate-risk families. Assessment of familial risk of CRC and referral rates for these <b>preventive</b> <b>measures</b> were determined 1 year after {{the introduction of new}} guidelines. METHOD: Assessment of familial risk of CRC and referral for <b>preventive</b> <b>measures</b> were measured in clinical practice among 358 patients with CRC in 18 hospitals using medical records and questionnaires. Additionally, a knowledge survey was performed among 312 clinicians. RESULTS: Sixty-seven % of patients with an increased familial risk (n = 65 / 97) were referred for <b>preventive</b> <b>measures,</b> as were 23 % (61 / 261) of low-risk patients. The uptake of genetic counselling in high-risk families was 33 % (12 / 36). The uptake of surveillance colonoscopy in moderate-risk families was 34 % (21 / 61). In the knowledge survey clinicians correctly determined familial risk in 55 % and <b>preventive</b> <b>measures</b> in 65 % of cases. CONCLUSION: Currently 67 % of individuals with an increased familial risk of CRC were referred for <b>preventive</b> <b>measures.</b> Only one-third were referred in accordance with guidelines...|$|R
