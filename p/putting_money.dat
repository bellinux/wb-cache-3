Nation started out in 2004 as Gillford Park F.C. and played in the Northern Football Alliance league and won four promotions in 8 years. In 2012 Scottish millionaire Frank Lynch who is based in America, started <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> into the club and {{changed its name to}} Celtic Nation. After two years, Lynch withdrew his financial support and the club struggled before folding.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} effort suffered several blows in 2013. In January 2013, {{a quarter}} of MSU's tenure-track faculty told Cruzado {{that they did not}} see the university <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> into hiring advanced faculty, improving research faculty salaries, improving laboratory space, or working {{to increase the number of}} graduate students—elements they said would go far to maintaining or improving the university's status as a high-activity research university. Research income for the 2012-2013 school year fell 16.6 percent to $93.7 million, which Cruzado said was due to federal budget cuts. On May 20, 2013, MSU's long-time Vice President for Research, Creativity and Technology Transfer, Thomas McCoy, left the university to take a similar position at the University of North Texas. Anne Camper, Associate Dean of the College of Engineering, was named interim vice president. That same month, an informal faculty poll showed that maintaining MSU's reputation as a high-activity research university was the highest priority of faculty. But tension between research faculty and non-research faculty was also very high. The number of graduate and doctoral students at the university also slipped. Graduate students (which included master's degree and doctoral degree students was 1,980 in 2010-2011, but just 1,888 in 2012-2013. The university strategic plan set a goal of 2,350 graduate students by 2019. The number of doctoral students was also inconsistent. There were 45 in 2010-2011, 56 in 2011-2012, but just 53 in 2013-2013. The strategic plan set a goal of 80 per year by 2019.|$|E

Thomas said he is <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> in distressed areas and reinvesting, [...] "I'm hoping I can be a catalyst for change in those areas, to get the population back into those communities and be a catalyst to make a difference." [...] Thomas is also involved in a $300 million development deal for a mixed-use complex at the Illinois Medical District Commission. Isiah Real Estate partnered with Higgins Development Partners, Thomas Samuels Enterprises, and East Lake Management & Development to develop 9.5 acres of land that would include retail space, a hotel, apartments and parking areas.|$|E

2500|$|The Knights' 1995–96 OHL season {{went down}} in history as the worst {{in the history of the}} Canadian Hockey League. The Knights set a new record for {{futility}} by finishing with nine points and a 3–60–3 record. The years following the so-called [...] "Knightmare" [...] season were improved, but the team was still a long way from the league's upper echelon. Meanwhile, the Ice House was falling apart as the Tarry family had stopped <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> into it as a part of their lobbying the city of London for a new arena. However, the re-signing of former Head Coach Gary Agnew, and the signing of future NHLers Rico Fata and Tom Kostopoulos heralded a marked turnaround for the team's fortunes. In 1999, the Knights went on an unexpected playoff run, in which they defeated the number-one-in-the-CHL Plymouth Whalers in seven games in the quarterfinals and ultimately went all the way to the OHL championship, which they lost in seven games to the Belleville Bulls.|$|E
2500|$|A Swiss project, called [...] "Solartaxi", has circumnavigated the world. This is {{the first}} time in history an {{electric}} vehicle (not self sufficient solar vehicle) has gone around the world, covering 50000km in 18 months and crossing 40 countries. It is a road-worthy electric vehicle hauling a trailer with solar panels, carrying a 6 m² sized solar array. The Solartaxi has Zebra batteries, which permit a range of 400km without recharging. The car can also run for 200km without the trailer. Its maximum speed is 90km/h. The car weighs 500kg and the trailer weighs 200kg. According to initiator and tour director Louis Palmer, the car in mass production could be produced for 16000 Euro. Solartaxi has toured the World from July 2007 till December 2008 to show that solutions to stop global warming are available and to encourage people in pursuing alternatives to fossil fuel. Palmer suggests the most economical location for solar panels for an electric car is on building rooftops though, likening it to <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> into a bank in one location and withdrawing it in another.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{weeks before}} the start of the 1989–90 season, The People {{published}} revelations that chairman Brian Hillier had put money on Swindon winning Division Three in 1987, as an insurance policy for player bonuses. Two months later the allegations worsened, with Hillier accused of <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> on the Town to lose in the FA Cup game at Newcastle United two years previously (which the team lost 5–0). Hillier was found guilty and was banned from football for six months, later increased to three years on appeal. Macari was fined £1,000 for his part in the scandal—and when he chose to appeal, West Ham United forced his resignation. The People released a third exposé in January 1990, this time alleging illegal payments to players. Despite this, Swindon Town beat table-topping Leeds United to go into third place in the league, and at the end of the season, they finished fourth, their highest league position ever, to go into the play-offs. Shortly before the last game of the season, Hillier, Macari, captain Colin Calderwood and secretary Vince Farrar were all arrested and questioned by Inland Revenue officials over a tax fraud conspiracy. Calderwood was released without charge, and the others were given bail. On the pitch, Swindon Town went on to defeat Blackburn Rovers over two legs to reach the final at Wembley, only their second appearance at the ground in their history.|$|E
