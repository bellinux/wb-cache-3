50|$|MSOT {{provides}} anatomical, {{dynamic and}} molecular information, but quantifying {{the features of}} MSOT images is not straightforward because constituents of the target tissue absorb and scatter the illuminating light. As a result, the illuminating light is attenuated as one moves deeper into the tissue, {{and the extent of}} attenuation depends on wavelength. The measured spectral signature of photoabsorbers inside tissue may therefore differ from the absorption spectrum of the same molecule measured inside the cuvette of a spectrophotometer. This discrepancy, termed “spectral coloring”, depends on the number and types of photoabsorbers in the propagation path. Spectral coloring poses a challenge to spectral unmixing, which requires accurate knowledge of the absorption spectrum. Moreover, optoacoustic imaging, with a resolution in the range of 1-100 µm, cannot resolve individual photoabsorbing molecules. As a result, the spectral response of the <b>photoabsorber</b> of interest is a linear combination of the spectral responses of background tissue constituents, such as oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, melanin, water, lipids and unknown metabolites, which further complicates unmixing. Recently, eigenspectra MSOT has been developed to model more accurately the spectral responses of different photoabsorbers in three-dimensional tissue. This may help improve spectral unmixing and therefore image quality.|$|E

We did not use any buffer layers between the n-type {{electrode}} porous TiO 2 and the selenium <b>photoabsorber</b> layer, or any additional hole-conducting layer. Hence, the Se layer worked bi-functionally as <b>photoabsorber</b> and hole conductor. The effect of the TiO 2 particle size, HCl and H 2 SeO 3 concentrations, and annealing temperature on the microstructure and photovoltaic performance was investigated thoroughly.|$|E

In this study, an AC 133 mAb was conjugated to an IR 700 <b>photoabsorber</b> dye. When activated by NIR light, the <b>photoabsorber</b> becomes activated and causes the cell to swell and ultimately leads to necrosis. Subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models with CD 133 pos glioblastoma stem cells revealed that the NIR-PIT-AC 133 mAb was able to shrink both tumor models and extend the lifespan of these mice.|$|E
50|$|MSOT detects photoechoes, i.e. {{ultrasound}} waves {{generated by}} thermo-elastic expansion {{of a sample}} (e.g. tissue) after absorption of transient electromagnetic energy. Typically, the sample is illuminated with light pulses in the nanosecond range, although intensity-modulated light can also be used. At {{least some of the}} electromagnetic energy absorbed by the sample is converted to heat; the resulting temperature rise, on the order of milli-Kelvins, leads to thermo-elastic expansion of the sample. This creates a pressure wave {{in the form of a}} broadband ultrasound wave. The ultrasound waves emitted by the sample are detected by transducers positioned near the sample, usually at multiple positions around it. The amplitude of the pressure wave provides information about the local absorption and propagation of energy in the sample, while the time interval between the illumination pulse and arrival of the ultrasound wave at the detector provides information about the distance between the detector and photoecho source. Optoacoustic data collected over time and at multiple positions around the sample are processed using tomographic reconstruction to produce images of the distribution of <b>photoabsorbers</b> in the sample. Data collected after illumination at single wavelengths allow imaging of the distribution of <b>photoabsorbers</b> that share similar absorption characteristics at the given wavelength. Data collected after illumination with multiple wavelengths allow specific distinction of <b>photoabsorbers</b> with different optical absorption spectra, such as oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, myoglobin, melanin or exogenous <b>photoabsorbers.</b> The wavelengths of light used to illuminate samples in MSOT are selected based on the absorption characteristics of the target <b>photoabsorbers.</b> To resolve the individual <b>photoabsorbers,</b> images obtained at multiple wavelengths must be further processed using subtraction or spectral unmixing techniques. Background in images can be reduced by exploiting differences in time (baseline subtraction) and in absorption spectra of the various <b>photoabsorbers</b> (spectral unmixing).|$|R
50|$|Multi-spectral. MSOT {{collects}} images {{at multiple}} wavelengths and resolves the spectral signatures in each voxel imaged, {{making it a}} multi-spectral method. Typically, MSOT is used to generate three images: one anatomical image at a single wavelength, one functional image resolving oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations, and a third image resolving additional target <b>photoabsorber(s).</b> These additional <b>photoabsorbers</b> include melanin, fat, water and other endogenous or exogenous agents.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the past}} decade, many novel {{therapeutic}} strategies {{have been introduced}} for cancer therapy. In those, photothermal therapy (PTT) gained considerable attention because of its advantages, including high specificity, precise spatial-temporal selectivity, and limited side effects [1, 2]. PTT utilizes the near-infrared region (NIR) <b>photoabsorbers</b> to generate heat for the thermal ablation of cancer cells upon NIR laser irradiation [2]. Taking the advantage of using the laser irradiation with the same wavelength, the NIR <b>photoabsorbers</b> {{can be used for}} photoacoustic imaging (PAI)-guided photothermal cancer therapy [3, 4].|$|R
40|$|Two {{designs for}} an {{integrated}} photoelectrolysis system {{that uses a}} 10 × concentrating solar collector have been investigated in detail. The system performance was evaluated using a multi-physics model that accounted for {{the properties of the}} tandem photoabsorbers, mass transport, and the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen-evolution and hydrogen-evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively). The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies and the ohmic losses associated with proton transport in the solution electrolyte and through the membrane of the photoelectrolysis system were evaluated systematically {{as a function of the}} cell dimensions, the operating temperatures, the bandgap combinations of the tandem cell, and the performance of both the photoabsorbers and electrocatalysts. Relative to designs of optimized systems that would operate without a solar concentrator, the optimized 10 × solar concentrator designs possessed larger ohmic losses and exhibited less uniformity in the distribution of the current density along the width of the photoelectrode. To minimize resistive losses while maximizing the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, η_(STH), both of the designs, a two-dimensional “trough” design and a three-dimensional “bubble wrap” design, required that the electrode width or diameter, respectively, was no larger than a few millimeters. As the size of the electrodes increased beyond this limiting dimension, the η_(STH) became more sensitive to the performance of the photoabsorbers and catalysts. At a fixed electrode dimension, increases in the operating temperature reduced the efficiency of cells with smaller electrodes, due to degradation in the performance of the <b>photoabsorber</b> with increasing temperature. In contrast, cells with larger electrode dimensions showed increases in efficiency as the temperature increased, due to increases in the rates of electrocatalysis and due to enhanced mass transport. The simulations indicted that cells that contained 10 % <b>photoabsorber</b> area, and minimal amounts of Nafion or other permselective membranes (i. e. areal coverages and volumetric fractions of only a few percent of the cell), with the remaining area comprised of a suitable, low-cost inert, non porous material (flexible polymers, inert inorganic materials, etc.) should be able to produce high values of η_(STH), with η_(STH) = 29. 8 % for an optimized design with a bandgap combination of 1. 6 eV/ 0. 9 eV in a tandem <b>photoabsorber</b> system at 350 K...|$|E

So far, the phantom test of PAI used in conjunction with FePt@PPy NPs showed a strong PA signal.

50|$|Through {{spectral}} unmixing {{and other}} techniques, MSOT {{data can be}} used to generate separate images based on the contrast provided by different <b>photoabsorbers.</b> In other words, a single MSOT data collection run provides separate images showing the distribution of oxy- or deoxy-hemoglobin. These images can be merged to provide a complete picture of tissue oxygenation/hypoxia. By using hemoglobin as an intrinsic oxygen sensor, MSOT is the only method available that can provide high-resolution images of tissue oxygenation without the need for exogenous labels. At the same time, MSOT can image additional endogenous <b>photoabsorbers</b> such as lipids and water, as well as exogenous contrast agents.|$|R
5000|$|A key {{strength}} of MSOT {{is its ability}} to resolve the photoechoes obtained in response to excitation with different wavelengths of illuminating light. Since the photoechoes depend on the optical absorption characteristics of molecules within the target tissue (or added to the tissue), MSOT can image the distributions of specific photoabsorbing molecules. The endogenous <b>photoabsorbers</b> most often imaged are oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, key players in oxygen metabolism, myoglobin, lipids, melanin and water. Several exogenous contrast agents have also been used in MSOT, including some common histology dyes, fluorescent dyes, novel metal-based agents and non-metallic nanoparticles. [...] Transfecting target tissue with reporter genes to express contrast agents in situ has also been reported, such as transfection with the tyrosinase gene to produce melanin.|$|R
40|$|The {{trade-off}} {{between the}} optical obscuration and kinetic overpotentials of electrocatalyst films patterned {{onto the surface}} of tandem light-absorber structures in model photoelectrosynthetic water-splitting systems was investigated using a 0 -dimensional load-line analysis and experimental measurements. The electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst at high current densities, normalized to the electrocatalyst surface area, {{is an important factor in}} the dependence of the optimal solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency, η_(STH,opt), on the filling fraction (f_c) of the patterned catalysts, because even under conditions that produce minority-carrier current densities of ~ 10 mA cm^(− 2) at the solid/liquid interface, the current density at catalyst-bearing sites can be > 1 – 2 A cm^(− 2) in low filling-fraction films. A universal current-density versus potential relationship, up to current densities of 10 A cm^(− 2), was obtained experimentally for the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) using patterned Pt ultramicroelectrode (UME) arrays with a range of filling fractions and disc diameters. The η_(STH,opt) of system designs that utilize patterned electrocatalysts located on the illuminated side of tandem <b>photoabsorbers</b> was then evaluated systematically. The maximum STH conversion efficiency, η_(STH,max), using a hypothetical electrocatalyst that was optically transparent but which nevertheless exhibited a current-density versus potential behavior that is characteristic of the most active Pt films measured experimentally regardless of their optical obscuration, was 26. 7 %. By comparison, the maximum η_(STH,opt) of 24. 9 % for real patterned Pt electrocatalyst films closely approached this ideal-case limit. The performance and materials utilization of the patterned electrocatalysts and of the uniformly coated electrocatalysts on tandem <b>photoabsorbers</b> were also compared in this study. Hence, patterned electrocatalysts with very low filling fractions can provide a potentially promising path to the realization of efficient large-scale photoelectrolysis systems while minimizing the use of scarce noble metals...|$|R

The other advantage of 3 -D solar cells is a short migration distance of the minority carriers and, therefore, reduces the recombination of electrons and holes [3]. In addition, 3 -D solar cells are easily fabricated by non-vacuum methods such as spray pyrolysis and chemical bath depositions; consequently, they are well-known as low cost solar cells. The major <b>photoabsorber</b> materials in the 3 -D compound solar cells have been CuInS 2 [1 – 4, 9], CuInSe 2 [10], Se [11], Sb 2 S 3 [12 – 17], CdSe [18, 19], and CdTe [20, 21]. In the 3 -D compound solar cells, the buffer layer between the TiO 2 and absorber layer was commonly utilized to block charge recombination between electrons in TiO 2 and holes in hole-transport materials [1 – 4, 9, 10, 12 – 16].|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} present work {{is on the}} {{influence}} of source reagents on the properties of CuInSe 2 (CISe) <b>photoabsorber</b> powders prepared by microwave assisted synthesis in triethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol. The CISe powders prepared were investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an EDS analyzer and MicroRaman spectroscopy to control the composition, structure and morphology of the synthesized powders. It was found that the microwave assisted polyol method is useful for the synthesis of CISe nanopowders. Synthesis with metallic In and Cu precursors resulted in the residue of unreacted indium in the products of reaction and deviation of the resulting CISe powder composition from the stoichiometry. On the other hand, soluble salts of In(III) and Cu(I) used as source reagents lead to practically stoichiometrical CISe powder to be prepared. Chalcopyrite structure of the prepared CISe powder and polynanocrystalline morphology were confirmed by the XRD, SEM, EDS and Raman techniques. The purest CISe powder was synthesized from CuCl, In(OOCCH 3) 3 and Se source reagents. The average size of the prepared CISe powder grains depends on the average molecular weight of the solvent (polyol). Polyethylene glycol 600 used as the reaction solvent gives a practically uniform polycrystalline CISe powder with an average size of crystals around 80 n...|$|E
40|$|Many tumor-targeted {{strategies}} {{have been used}} worldwide to limit the side effects and improve the effectiveness of therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy (RT), etc. Biophotonic therapy modalities comprise very promising alternative techniques for cancer treatment with minimal invasiveness and side-effects. These modalities use light e. g., laser irradiation in an extracorporeal or intravenous mode to activate photosensitizer agents with selectivity in the target tissue. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a minimally invasive technique for cancer treatment which uses laser-activated <b>photoabsorbers</b> to convert photon energy into heat sufficient to induce cells destruction via apoptosis, necroptosis and/or necrosis. During the last decade, PTT has attracted an increased interest since the therapy can be combined with customized functionalized nanoparticles (NPs). Recent advances in nanotechnology {{have given rise to}} generation of various types of NPs, like gold NPs (AuNPs), designed to act both as radiosensitizers and photothermal sensitizing agents due to their unique optical and electrical properties i. e., functioning in dual mode. Functionalized AuNPS can be employed in combination with non-ionizing and ionizing radiation to significantly improve the efficacy of cancer treatment {{while at the same time}} sparing normal tissues. Here, we first provide an overview of the use of NPs for cancer therapy. Then we review many recent advances on the use of gold NPs in PTT, RT and PTT/RT based on different types of AuNPs, irradiation conditions and protocols. We refer to the interaction mechanisms of AuNPs with cancer cells via the effects of non-ionizing and ionizing radiations and we provide recent existing experimental data as a baseline for the design of optimized protocols in PTT, RT and PTT/RT combined treatment...|$|R
40|$|Photoelectrochemistry {{allows us}} to store the solar energy as {{chemical}} energy by splitting water into hydrogen by using suitable semiconductors. Since the early 1970 s {{there is a long}} quest for efficient photoelectrodes. Practically 1. 8 to 2. 0 V is required to split water taking into account the overpotentials and other efficiency loss processes. Single band gap <b>photoabsorbers</b> do not provide enough photovoltage to drive this energetic reaction. Multiple band gap systems or tandem cells can suitably match and effectively utilize the solar spectrum, finally leading to higher efficiencies. Tandem cells made out of silicon have the distinct advantage that they consist of a widely available material, they are based on a proven technology and they are able to provide the necessary voltage needed for the water splitting reaction. Here we investigate photovoltaic tandem cells made up of amorphous and microcrystalline silicon (a-Si/µ-Si) for hydrogen production. We have shown previously, {{that it is possible to}} achieve efficiencies well above 6 %, with these types of cells. But the photovoltages were not sufficient to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction on their own. Here we present our recent investigations on the modification of these devices, in order to understand which modifications are necessary to achieve higher working voltages, by variation of the catalyst material and the electrolyte, by the optimization of catalyst deposition techniques and by using additionally electronically better adapted buffer layers between the absorber and the electrolyte. The surfaces are characterized with respect to their photoelectrochemical (PEC) characteristics by cyclic voltammetry and with respect to their chemical composition and their electronic structure by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|A fully {{integrated}} solar-driven water-splitting system comprised of WO 3 /FTO/p^(+) n Si as the photoanode, Pt/TiO_ 2 /Ti/n^(+) p Si as the photocathode, and Nafion as the membrane separator, was simulated, assembled, operated in 1. 0 [*]M HClO_ 4, and evaluated for performance and safety characteristics under dual side illumination. A multi-physics model {{that accounted for}} the performance of the <b>photoabsorbers</b> and electrocatalysts, ion transport in the solution electrolyte, and gaseous product crossover was first used to define the optimal geometric design space for the system. The photoelectrodes and the membrane separators were then interconnected in a louvered design system configuration, for which the light-absorbing area and the solution-transport pathways were simultaneously optimized. The performance of the photocathode and the photoanode were separately evaluated in a traditional three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell configuration. The photocathode and photoanode were then assembled back-to-back in a tandem configuration to provide sufficient photovoltage to sustain solar-driven unassisted water-splitting. The current–voltage characteristics of the photoelectrodes showed that the low photocurrent density of the photoanode limited the overall solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency due to the large band gap of WO_ 3. A hydrogen-production rate of 0. 17  mL[*]hr^− 1 and a STH conversion efficiency of 0. 24 [*]% was observed in a full cell configuration for > 20  h with minimal product crossover in the fully operational, intrinsically safe, solar-driven water-splitting system. The solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, ηS_TH, calculated using the multiphysics numerical simulation was in excellent agreement with the experimental behavior of the system. The value of ηSTH was entirely limited by the performance of the photoelectrochemical assemblies employed in this study. The louvered design provides a robust platform for implementation of various types of photoelectrochemical assemblies, and can provide an approach to significantly higher solar conversion efficiencies as new and improved materials become available...|$|R
