This work is designed to indicate to the operators the appropriate new parameter settings, such as the speed of the line and the flow rates for the gas. Results of the mathematical model designed for this process are compared against real data from the line, and these results confirm the <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> and <b>accuracy</b> of the model...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} aspect of any classifier is its error rate, because this quantifies its <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Thus, the <b>accuracy</b> of error estimation is critical. Error estimation is problematic in small-sample classifier design because the error must be estimated using the same data from which the classifier has been designed. Use of prior knowledge, {{in the form of a}} prior distribution on an uncertainty class of feature-label distributions to which the true, but unknown, feature-distribution belongs, can facilitate accurate error estimation (in the mean-square sense) in circumstances where accurate completely model-free error estimation is impossible. This paper provides analytic asymptotically exact finite-sample approximations for various performance metrics of the resulting Bayesian Minimum Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) error estimator in the case of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the multivariate Gaussian model. These performance metrics include the first, second, and cross moments of the Bayesian MMSE error estimator with the true error of LDA, and therefore, the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error of the estimator. We lay down the theoretical groundwork for Kolmogorov double-asymptotics in a Bayesian setting, which enables us to derive asymptotic expressions of the desired performance metrics. From these we produce analytic finite-sample approximations and demonstrate their accuracy via numerical examples. Various examples illustrate the behavior of these approximations and their use in determining the necessary sample size to achieve a desired RMS. The Supplementary Material contains derivations for some equations and added figures. Comment: 25 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The program starts with all the test variables in the model, and progressively removes {{those that do not}} influence the model’s <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity.</b> A similar outcome in both the forwards and backwards models shows internal consistency (Katya Mauff, Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Cape Town, personal communication, August 2011).|$|R
30|$|The good {{predictability}} of TA and {{the high}} returns in emerging markets are not unanimously accepted in the literature. Chang et al. (2004) and Harvey (1995) emphasized {{that there is a}} strong autocorrelation in the price series of emerging markets, which means that the random walk hypothesis is rejected. Therefore, there is a good <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> in these markets. However, Costa et al. (2015) and Ratner and Leal (1999), who considered transaction costs, identified that the <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> of TA does not lead to abnormally strong returns.|$|R
40|$|When {{biomarker}} studies involve {{patients at}} multiple centers {{and the goal}} is to develop biomarker combinations for diagnosis, prognosis, or screening, we consider evaluating the <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> of a given combination with the center-adjusted AUC (aAUC), a summary of conditional performance. Rather than using a general method to construct the biomarker combination, such as logistic regression, we propose estimating the combination by directly maximizing the aAUC. Furthermore, it may be desirable to have a biomarker combination with similar <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> across centers. To that end, we allow for penalization of the variability in center-specific performance. We demonstrate good asymptotic properties of the resulting combinations. Simulations provide small-sample evidence that maximizing the aAUC can lead to combinations with greater <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> than combinations constructed via logistic regression. We further illustrate the utility of constructing combinations by maximizing the aAUC while penalizing variability. We apply these methods to data from a study of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery...|$|R
30|$|For {{species in}} the Pinus and Quercus groups, {{inclusion}} of the height measurements of 3 trees close (± 10 %) of the mean breast height diameter from each plot improved the <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> of the calibrated model. For the species included in other broadleaf species and other conifer species, the <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> of the model was improved by including the total height measured in a subsample of 3 trees of minimum, mean and maximum breast height diameter. The possibility of using complementary data from the stands to calibrate the mixed models provides a clear advantage over models developed by other procedures, which require large amounts of data or are less accurate.|$|R

Harrell's C statistic was used to evaluate the <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity.</b> The Cox proportional hazards model was used to construct a novel category. RESULTS: The LNR category had more <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> than the pN category in whole groups of patients (Harrell's C index: 0. 6194 vs 0. 6113, p = 0. 003).

We also found that there was significant survival heterogeneity among different pN categories at the same LNR category (P< 0. 001).

40|$|SummaryObjectives 1) To {{determine}} whether severe exacerbation of COPD is a BODE index independent {{risk factor for}} death; 2) whether the combined application of exacerbations and BODE (e-BODE index), offers greater <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> than BODE alone or can simplify the model, by replacing the exercise capacity (BODEx index). MethodsA prospective study was made of a cohort of COPD patients. In addition to calculation of the BODE index we register frequency of exacerbations. An analysis was made of all-cause mortality, evaluating the <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> of the exacerbations after adjusting for the BODE. These variables were also used to construct two new indexes: e-BODE and BODEx. ResultsThe study included 185 patients {{with a mean age}} of 71 ± 9 years, and FEV 1 % 47 ± 17 %. Severe exacerbation appeared as an independent adverse prognostic variable of BODE index. For each new exacerbation the adjusted mortality risk increased 1. 14 -fold (95 % CI: 1. 04 – 1. 25). However, the e-BODE index (C statistic: 0. 77, 95 % CI: 0. 67 – 0. 86) didn't improve prognostic capacity of BODE index (C statistic: 0. 75, 95 % CI: 0. 66 – 0. 84) (p=NS). An interesting finding was that BODEx index (C statistic: 0. 74, 95 % CI: 0. 65 – 0. 83) had similar prognostic capacity than BODE index. ConclusionsSevere exacerbations of COPD imply an increased mortality risk that is independent of baseline severity of the disease as measured by the BODE index. The combined application of both parameters (e-BODE index) didn't improve the <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity,</b> but on replacing exacerbation with exercise capacity the multidimensional grading system is simplified without loss of <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to examine the {{contribution}} of family history of Parkinson's disease and its associated disorders in the assessment of <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> of risk models for Parkinson’s disease. In a population of 192 patients with Parkinson’s disease and 1659 healthy individuals we investigated the impact of environmental factors and the effects of family history on Parkinson's disease risk. Pesticides exposure, positive family history of Parkinson’s disease and a positive family history of dementia and melanoma were associated to an increased risk for Parkinson’s disease, with results regarding family history of depression near to statistical significance. Smoking and caffeine intake were associated to a decreased risk for Parkinson’s disease. Three risk prediction models were assessed using the area under the curve approach: first model was based on known environmental risk factors, in the second model we added family history of Parkinson’s disease and in the third model we additionally included family history of dementia, melanoma and depression. We showed that inclusion of data on family history of associated disorders (AUC 0. 76) improves <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> of risk model for Parkinson’s disease in comparison with the first (AUC 0. 62) and the second model (AUC 0. 71).

40|$|International audienceA {{wide range}} of models have been {{proposed}} and developed for modelling sugar beet growth, each of them with different degrees of complexity and modelling assumptions. Many of them are used to predict crop production or yield, {{even when they were}} not originally designed for this purpose, and even though their <b>predictive</b> <b>capacity</b> has never been properly evaluated. In this study, we propose the evaluation and comparison of five plant growth models that rely on a similar energetic concept for the production of biomass, but with different levels of description (individual-based or per square meter) and different ways to describe biomass repartition (empirical or via allocation) : Greenlab, LNAS, CERES, PILOTE and STICS. The models were all programmed on the same modelling platform, calibrated on a first set of data, and then their <b>predictive</b> <b>capacities</b> were assessed on an independent data set. First, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on each model to identify a subset of parameters to be estimated, to reduce the variability of the models. We were able {{to reduce the number of}} parameters from 10 to 4 for Greenlab, and from 16 to 1 for STICS. Three criteria were then used to compare the <b>predictive</b> <b>capacities</b> of the models: the root mean squared error of prediction and the modelling efficiency for the total dry matter production and the dry matter of root, and the yield prediction error. All the models provided good overall predictions, with high values of the modelling efficiency. The use of sensitivity analysis allowed us to reduce the variability of the models and to enhance their <b>predictive</b> <b>capacities.</b> Models based on an empirical harvest index gave good yield predictions, and similar results compared to allocation models for the total dry matter, but the harvest index might not be very robust. The crucial role of initiation was also pointed out, as well as the need for an accurate estimation and modelling of this early phase of growth...|$|R
