The successful test rendered obsolete the cryogenic design used by Ivy Mike and its weaponized derivative, the JUGHEAD, which was slated to be tested as the initial Castle Yankee. It also used a 7075 aluminium 9.5cm thick ballistic case. Aluminium was used to drastically reduce the bomb's weight and simultaneously to provide sufficient radiation confinement time and to raise yield, a departure from the heavy stainless steel casing (304L or MIM 316L) employed by contemporary weapon-projects.|$|E

[...] Swedish Mausers were manufactured by Waffenfabrik Mauser AG in Oberndorf a/N in Germany and in Sweden by Carl Gustafs stads Gevärsfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. All Swedish Mausers, whether built in Germany or Sweden, were fabricated using a Swedish-supplied high grade tool steel alloyed with nickel, copper, and vanadium, a product than noted for its strength and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{action was}} a {{modified}} Mauser design with dual front locking lugs and a rear safety lug where {{the base of}} the bolt handle fitted into a recess in the receiver. The action was large, strong and robust, and therefore ideally suited to powerful sporting cartridges under development. The action used an internal box magazine and the Mauser-type claw extractor for controlled round feeding for excellent reliability. The barrel used on initial versions was of the same shape as the original military one, except it was polished and deep blued. The trigger mechanism was initially the same two-stage military type. Remington used the same steel and heat treatment as for the M1917 rifles, although improving the dimensional tolerances and the standard of finish.

Its elliptical planform 32.2 ft span wing it mounted using several cabane struts and produces a 15:1 glide ratio. The pilot sits on an open-air seat, without a windshield. The control system is unusual in that roll control is by cable-actuated wing warping. All three landing gear wheels have suspension and the nosewheel is steerable. The [...] KFM 107 powerplant is mounted behind the pilot's seat, with the propeller in between {{the upper and lower}} tailboom tubes. The design was <b>proof-tested</b> to +9/-9 g.

In any event, it could not be tested before being deployed, as there was only sufficient U-235 available for one device. Even though the design was never <b>proof-tested,</b> there was thought to be no risk of the device being captured by an enemy if it malfunctioned. Even a [...] "fizzle" [...] would have completely disintegrated the device, while the multiple redundancies built into the [...] "Little Boy" [...] design meant there was negligible if any potential for the device to strike the ground without detonating at all.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concentration}} of CO2 {{in the upper}} layer of the world's oceans is higher than is found in air, and thus {{it is the most}} concentrated [...] "mine" [...] from which zero-net carbon fuels can be produced. The U.S. Navy estimates that a typical nuclear propelled aircraft carrier which generates 100 megawatts of electricity can produce 41,000 US gallons(155,202 litres) of jet fuel per day and production from the onboard nuclear reactor would cost about $6 per gallon($1.58 per liter). While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive. Heather Willauer of the United States Naval Research Laboratory <b>proof-tested</b> the technology in 2013, fueling an internal combustion engine equipped model airplane with the synthetic fuel.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{historians have}} assumed {{that there was a}} {{difference}} in cartridge blueprint measurements between Swedish and Norwegian 6.5×55mm ammunition, but this may be unintentional. Due to different interpretations of the blueprint standard, i.e. the standards of manufacturing using maximum chamber in the Krag vs. minimum chamber in the Swedish Mauser, {{a small percentage of the}} ammunition produced in Norway proved to be slightly oversize when chambered in the Swedish Mauser action, i.e. requiring a push on the bolt handle to chamber in the Swedish arm. A rumour arose not long after the 6.5×55mm cartridge was adopted that one could use Swedish ammunition in Norwegian rifles, but not Norwegian ammunition in Swedish rifles. [...] Some even alleged that this incompatibility was deliberate, to give Norway the tactical advantage of using captured ammunition in a war, while denying the same advantage to the Swedes. However, after the rumour first surfaced in 1900, the issue was examined by the Swedish military. They declared the difference to be insignificant, and that both the Swedish and Norwegian ammunition was within the specified parameters laid down. Despite this finding, the Swedish weapon-historian Josef Alm repeated the rumour in a book in the 1930s, leading many to believe that there was a significant difference between the ammunition manufactured in Norway and Sweden. [...] It is worth noting that Sweden would later adopt a 6.5×55mm rifle with a much stronger Mauser bolt action, the m/94 carbine in 1894 and the m/96 Rifle in 1896, both of which were <b>proof-tested</b> with loads generating significantly more pressure than those used to proof the Norwegian Krag action.|$|E

40|$|CONCLUSION: Subjectivity {{seems to}} play a {{definite}} role {{in the interpretation of}} the pendular test, but somewhat less for caloric testing, where pure visual analysis seems to be more reliable. Automated values provided by <b>proof-tested</b> software may be useful. OBJECTIVES: In some centers, the interpretation of videonystagmography is still based on direct visual analysis of recorded tracings. Our study addresses the importance of subjectivity in the interpretation of videonystagmographic readings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two experts (one junior and the other senior) were asked to interpret the same caloric and pendular tests on two different occasions, 3 months apart. Initial reading was performed without knowledge of the patient's history or the results of other neuro-otological tests. Three months later, interpretations were done with complete access to the patient's charts. The experts' answers were compared to the values provided by the computer software. RESULTS: For the pendular test, inter-expert agreement was poor. With knowledge of the patient's history, the expert's interpretations tended to coincide with the software's calculations. For the caloric test, interpretation was less variable...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel multi-element fibre (MEF) technology for implementing space-division multiplexing (SDM) in optical fibres. MEF comprises multiple fibre-elements that are drawn and coated together using a common polymer coating. In MEF, the fibre-elements {{are compatible with}} current technology i. e. the fibre-elements can be directly fusion spliced to standard single mode pigtail fibre. Thus, a smooth upgrade from WDM based systems to SDM system is possible. In this work, MEF technology has been implemented for both, passive SDM fibres and SDM amplifiers. Erbium-doped Core-pump MEF amplifiers have been demonstrated exhibiting similar gain and noise figure performance to conventional Er-doped fibre amplifier while maintaining ultralow crosstalk levels. In addition, an Erbium/Ytterbium-doped cladding-pumped MEF amplifier has been developed, and a novel technique to achieve a broadband gain has been demonstrated which could cover wavelength region of 1536 nm- 1615 nm using a single multimode pump. Furthermore, MEF technology has been combined with mode-division multiplexing to show that higher spatial multiplicity could be achieved by implementing the MEF with other SDM technologies. In passive MEFs, the fabricated fibres have been characterised for their loss and transmission properties, showing low loss and error-free transmission. Also, the MEFs are <b>proof-tested</b> showing high strength. The compatibility of MEF fibres have been tested in a concatenated SDM system demonstrating their flexibility in the telecom network...|$|E
40|$|The {{windstorm}} of January 11 {{caused a}} minor {{amount of damage}} to the Hanford Reservation and Hanford vicinity. Damage sustained to Hanford Reservation structures (roofing, flashing, fences, windows) was approximately $ 20, 000. One building did receive structural damage to roof members. Evidence that wind pressures did not reach 30 lb/ft{sup 2 } during the January 11 windstorm was provided {{in the fact that}} specially designed exterior wall panels did not fail. These panels were designed and carefully <b>proof-tested</b> to insure that they would fail at a loading of 30 lb/ft{sup 2 } as a requirement of structural safety in the original design-construction program in 1952 - 1954. There was one power outage on the Hanford Reservation due to the January 11 windstorm (Rattlesnake Mountain Observatory). Damage to power lines and electrical facilities amounted to about $ 1600. Damage to structures in the Hanford vicinity (excluding the Hanford Reservation) from the January 11 windstorm was estimated to cost $ 13, 000. This does not include damage to private residences, etc., which has been estimated by others to be near $ 250, 000. Power line damage in the Hanford vicinity amounted to about $ 80, 000, of which $ 60, 000 was accounted for in the loss of four transmission towers in the tie-line between Priest Rapids and Wanapum Dams. The January 21 windstorm, which struck Toppenish, Washington, was a straight-wind of the catabatic foehn type and not a tornado-type wind as described in newspaper accounts. No funnel cloud was associated with this windstorm. The maximum gust was about 85 mph at 30 ft above the ground. Cost estimates of damage in Toppenish were not available. There were no power outages or structural damage on the Hanford Reservation from the January 21 windstorm. Total damage to the Hanford Reservation from the two windstorms was estimated to be about $ 22, 500...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{characterize}} the stable isotope values of terrestrial, secondary carbonate minerals from five Ordinary Chondrite (OC) meteorites collected in Antarctica. These samples were identified and requested from NASA based upon their size, alteration history, and collection proximity to known Martian meteorites. They are also assumed to be carbonate-free before falling to Earth. This research addresses two questions involving Mars carbonates: 1) characterize terrestrial, secondary carbonate isotope values to apply to Martian meteorites for isolating in-situ carbonates, and 2) increase understanding of carbonates formed in cold and arid environments with Antarctica as an analog for Mars. Two samples from each meteorite, each approximately 0. 5 grams, were crushed and dissolved in pure phosphoric acid for 3 sequential reactions: a) R times 0 for 1 hour at 30 degrees Centigrade (fine calcite extraction), b) R times 1 for 18 hours at 30 degrees Centigrade (course calcite extraction), and c) R times 2 for 3 hours at 150 degrees Centigrade (siderite and/or magnesite extraction). CO (sub 2) was distilled by freezing with liquid nitrogen from each sample tube, then separated from organics and sulfides with a TRACE GC using a Restek HayeSep Q 80 / 100 6 foot 2 millimeter stainless column, and then analyzed on a Thermo MAT 253 Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS) in Dual Inlet mode. This system was built at NASA/JSC over the past 3 years and <b>proof-tested</b> with known carbonate standards to develop procedures, assess yield, and quantify expected error bands. Two distinct species of carbonates are found: 1) calcite, and 2) non-calcite carbonate (future testing will attempt to differentiate siderite from magnesite). Preliminary results indicate the terrestrial carbonates are formed at approximately sigma (sup 13) C equal to plus 5 per mille, which is consistent with atmospheric CO (sub 2) sigma (sup 13) C equal to minus 7 per mille and fractionation of plus 12 per mille based upon polar temperature of - 20 degrees Centigrade. The oxygen values fractionate sigma (sup 18) O equal to minus 10 - 20 per mille lighter between the R times 0 and R times 1 reactions at 30 degrees Centigrade. The carbonate oxygen isotope measurements are consistently heavier than expected with meteoric water and temperatures from Antarctica, perhaps due to secondary carbonate formation during curation in Houston, TX...|$|E
40|$|Propulsion {{systems that}} utilize hypergolic {{propellants}} {{have been used}} to power space vehicles {{since the beginning of the}} space program. Liquid methane and oxygen propulsion systems have emerged as an alternative and have proven to be more environmentally friendly. The incorporation of liquid methane/liquid oxygen (LOX) into the propulsion system has demonstrated an increase in engine performance, as well as a reduction in the volume, size and complexity of the system. Consequently, reducing the total mass of the vehicle which is a crucial aspect that is considered when planning space missions to both the Moon and Mars [1]. Project Morpheus has made significant advancements in liquid oxygen/liquid methane propulsion system technologies by incorporating a LOX/methane propulsion system to a vertical test bed. The vehicle consisted of a 5, 000 lb main engine and four 20 lb remote control system (RCS) engines that utilize liquid methane/LOX as its propellant [1]. The vehicle completed successful flight testing at Kennedy Space Center in 2014 which marked the completion of the Morpheus project. Subsequent projects utilizing Morpheus' vertical test bed have been developed to make further advancements. One of the subsequent projects consisted of the addition of a smaller 2, 000 lb main engine and a cold helium heat exchanger which would make it possible for a pressurant tank systems to be send to Mars or the Moon by significantly decreasing the overall mass and volume of the pressurant tank. The hot fire tests of the integrated system with the smaller main engine and cold helium heat exchanger were successful at sea level, but further studies are being conducted to better understand how the vertical test bed will behave under thermal-vacuum conditions. For this reason, the integrated vehicle will be taken to Plum Brook to be tested in a chamber capable of simulating these conditions. To ensure that the vehicle will function properly under vacuum conditions, testing will be first completed at the component level. During this process, the igniter of the main engine and the RCS thrusters will be tested under a vacuum. To complete the testing of the components, the test setup first needed to be finalized. The CryoCart is being used to feed the propellants to the test article. The CryoCart is a movable test set-up that was developed in 2009 to provide a mobile platform for testing oxygen/methane systems with hot-fire capability up to 100 lbf. The CryoCart consists of three different systems: Oxygen, Methane, and liquid Nitrogen. The Oxygen and Methane systems are placed into two different carts while the liquid nitrogen system is mainly located in the methane cart. Over the years, the CryoCart has been utilized for different projects and has undergone deterioration. For this reason, a new phase has been developed to rebuild it to working conditions once again. During my internship, I was aiding in the construction and restoration of the CryoCart. In the initial stages of the process, I updated the fluid and electrical schematics for the oxygen, methane, and test article systems. The original CryoCart consisted of an electrical panel that utilized electromechanical relays and a terminal to drive the igniter power and signal, as well as the main fuel and oxygen valves. This electrical panel connected to the CryoCart through various wire harnesses that could be found exiting from the CryoCart. First, it was determined how these harnesses connected to the electromechanical relays so that they worked correctly. Once the electrical system was understood, an alternative for the electromechanical relays and the Molex connectors used throughout the system was sought since these components can often prove to be unreliable. Solid State relays and MIL connectors were purchased to serve as replacements. Upon arrival of the parts, crimping and wiring was completed to install the new solid state relays and MIL connectors. During the replacement of the relays and connectors, system checks of the electrical system were ran to ensure that the system was working correctly. While completing system checks, the pressure transducers that were not functioning properly were also replaced and any issue with the wiring or signal was addressed. Once the electrical components were replaced, the restoration of the fluid system began. Parts of the tubing in the CryoCart had to be rebuild and often consisted of sizing, cutting, bending, filing, and sanding the tubing to prepare it to be flared. Many components had to be <b>proof-tested</b> to bring their certifications up to date, and several components had to be replaced. Various flex hoses, valves, and fittings were send to the Clean Lab because they were new, dirty, or had gone through proof-testing. Once they arrived from the cleaning lab they had to be put back to the system and leak checks and functional tests were conducted. In the Nitrogen system, the copper tubing located in the Oxygen cart was rebuild and Aerogel insulation was added to this section. A new gaseous nitrogen system was added to the CryoCart to purge the vacuum tube which will serve as the test chamber. Once the CryoCart was completed, construction of parts of the vacuum tube began. A flange was manufactured with welded fittings to hold the line of the vacuum pump as well as some extra fittings which will serve as extra inlets used to introduce fluid lines to the vacuum tube. Stress analysis was ran in this flange to ensure that it would not fail under vacuum conditions. The fluid lines leading from the air side of the vacuum to the test article were also constructed and added to the mount that had already been manufactured. Three different sets of tubing were constructed to accommodate the seven different RCS thruster and the main engine igniter that are going to be tested. Full electrical system checks were completed to ensure that all the wire harnesses and valves were functioning. Upon the completion of the CryoCart and the vacuum tube, hot fire testing for the RCS thrusters and the main engine igniter are going to begin. During this time any issues encountered with the engines or igniter will be addressed to ensure that the components function under vacuum conditions. After successful completion of testing, the vertical test bed, Morpheus, will be rebuilt and prepared to be sent to Plum Brook. In Plum Brook, the vehicle will be tested in the thermal-vacuum chamber to demonstrate that integrated lox-methane propulsion system operation in space-like conditions. This internship has allowed me the opportunity to gain valuable hands on experience and to develop skills that will aid in my education as well as in the workforce, while at the same time helping me determine that I would like to further pursue a career in propulsion engineering...|$|E
