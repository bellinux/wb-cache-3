25|$|Although {{this mode}} is faster, the {{photoconductive}} mode tends to exhibit more electronic noise. The leakage current {{of a good}} <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> is so low (<1 nA) that the Johnson–Nyquist noise of the load resistance in a typical circuit often dominates.|$|E
25|$|A <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> has {{a central}} un-doped, or intrinsic, layer, forming a p-type/intrinsic/n-type structure. They {{are used as}} radio {{frequency}} switches and attenuators. They are also used as large-volume, ionizing-radiation detectors and as photodetectors. PIN diodes are also used in power electronics, as their central layer can withstand high voltages. Furthermore, the PIN structure {{can be found in}} many power semiconductor devices, such as IGBTs, power MOSFETs, and thyristors.|$|E
25|$|In energy {{dispersive}} analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, {{as already mentioned}} above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (<b>PIN</b> <b>diode,</b> Si(Li), Ge(Li), Silicon Drift Detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionises {{a large number of}} detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover {{the low end of the}} performance spectrum, followed by <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy the high end of the performance scale.|$|E

25|$|These consist {{essentially}} of a 3–5mm thick {{silicon junction}} type p-i-n diode (same as <b>PIN</b> <b>diode)</b> with a bias of −1000 V across it. The lithium-drifted centre part forms the non-conducting i-layer, where Li compensates the residual acceptors which would otherwise make the layer p-type. When an X-ray photon passes through, it causes {{a swarm of}} electron-hole pairs to form, and this causes a voltage pulse. To obtain sufficiently low conductivity, the detector must be maintained at low temperature, and liquid-nitrogen cooling must {{be used for the}} best resolution. With some loss of resolution, the much more convenient Peltier cooling can be employed.|$|E
25|$|A {{laser diode}} is {{electrically}} a <b>PIN</b> <b>diode.</b> The active {{region of the}} laser diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a laser diode is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped active layer, followed by the P doped cladding, and a contact layer. The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.|$|E
