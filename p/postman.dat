5|$|The primary {{literary}} {{influence on}} film noir was the hardboiled school of American detective and crime fiction, led {{in its early}} years by such writers as Dashiell Hammett (whose first novel, Red Harvest, was published in 1929) and James M. Cain (whose The <b>Postman</b> Always Rings Twice appeared five years later), and popularized in pulp magazines such as Black Mask. The classic film noirs The Maltese Falcon (1941) and The Glass Key (1942) were based on novels by Hammett; Cain's novels provided the basis for Double Indemnity (1944), Mildred Pierce (1945), The <b>Postman</b> Always Rings Twice (1946), and Slightly Scarlet (1956; adapted from Love's Lovely Counterfeit). A decade before the classic era, a story by Hammett was the source for the gangster melodrama City Streets (1931), directed by Rouben Mamoulian and photographed by Lee Garmes, who worked regularly with Sternberg. Wedding a style and story both with many noir characteristics, released the month before Lang's M, City Streets has a claim to being the first major film noir.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1899 Mougeot experimented in the 12th {{arrondissement}} of Paris with couriers using automobiles, {{but this}} did not catch on. Mougeot installed the first stamp machines, and postcards delivered by compressed air in Paris.He also supported the use of bicycles by <b>postmen,</b> a long-planned but always delayed innovation.Mougeot gave <b>postmen</b> a monthly allowance of 15 francs if their route was more than 32 km, and the same allowance to town <b>postmen</b> whose routes were more than 24 km.In 1898 he decided to build a [...] "telephone office" [...] in Langres, which came into service on 27 March 1900.|$|R
5|$|The stamps {{were sold}} from post-offices {{across the country}} but some were also issued to postmen for sale. Sales started on 25 June 1849, however their use only became legal on 1 July. Because {{of the lack of}} an {{infrastructure}} of post boxes, particularly in rural areas, letters could be given directly to the <b>postman</b> in person rather than delivered to post offices to be sent.|$|E
5|$|ALP's Letter {{becomes the}} focal point as it is {{analysed}} in detail in I.5. This letter was dictated by ALP to her son Shem, a writer, and entrusted to her other son Shaun, a <b>postman,</b> for delivery. The letter never reaches its intended destination, ending up in a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named Biddy. Chapter I.6 digresses from the narrative in order to present the main and minor characters in more detail, {{in the form of}} twelve riddles and answers.|$|E

She appeared in the 1941 horror film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and her reputation as a glamorous femme fatale was enhanced by her performance in the film noir The <b>Postman</b> Always Rings Twice (1946). Her popularity continued through the 1950s in such films as The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} strenuous tasks among postal workers has {{recently}} become the subject ofconcern in Poland. So far no guidelines {{have been developed}} regarding the admissable workload levels for <b>postmen.</b> The existing mies and regulations concerning the lifting and shifting ofheavy weights are general and not applicable to the specific tasks of the postmen's work. In Poland no studies on workload in <b>postmen</b> {{have been carried out}} up to the present. The world literature also does not report much on the subject. Attention is paid mainly to accidents at work and robberies by assault on <b>postmen</b> (I). The few studies on workload in <b>postmen</b> were not intended for determining admissible workload levels (2, 3, 4, 5). In order to fill this gap we have undertaken research into the factors of the postmen's workload to evaluate their influence on the magnitude and effects ofthis type ofwork. MATERIALS and METHODS Befure the study protocol was designed the mailbags of 158 <b>postmen</b> had been weighed every day during a one month period. During this one month period there were days when the workload was light (I), moderate (II) and heavy (III) ...|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere, Italian {{director}} Luchino Visconti adapted Cain's The <b>Postman</b> Always Rings Twice as Ossessione (1943), regarded both {{as one of}} {{the great}} noirs and a seminal film in the development of neorealism. (This was not even the first screen version of Cain's novel, having been preceded by the French Le Dernier Tournant in 1939.) In Japan, the celebrated Akira Kurosawa directed several films recognizable as film noirs, including Drunken Angel (1948), Stray Dog (1949), The Bad Sleep Well (1960), and High and Low (1963).|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the <b>Postman</b> to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E

5|$|The son of William and Elizabeth (née Best) Ponsford, Bill Ponsford {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy North on 19 October 1900. His father was a <b>postman</b> whose family had emigrated from Devon to Bendigo, Victoria, to work in the mines during the 1850s gold rush. His mother was also born in the goldfields, at Guildford, before moving to Melbourne with her father, a Crown Lands bailiff. Ponsford grew up on Newry St in Fitzroy North, and {{attended}} the nearby Alfred Crescent School, which stood beside the Edinburgh Gardens.|$|E
5|$|Despite the obstacles, {{readers and}} {{commentators}} {{have reached a}} broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, {{and their three children}} Shem the Penman, Shaun the <b>Postman,</b> and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text La Scienza Nuova ("The New Science"), upon which they argue Finnegans Wake is structured.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{with the}} thawing of Sino-Indian relations, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to China {{led to the}} {{resumption}} of talks on opening the border. Later in 2004, the Indian Defence Minister's visit to China led to the formal opening of the pass. The opening, originally scheduled for 2 October 2005, was postponed due to last-minute infrastructure problems on the Chinese side. Finally, {{after a decade of}} talks, Nathu La was opened on 6 July 2006. The date of the reopening, which also formally recognised Tibet as part of China by India and Sikkim's accession to India, coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama. In the years before the reopening, the only person permitted to cross the barbed-wire frontier had been a Chinese <b>postman</b> with an Indian military escort, who would hand over mail to his Indian counterpart in a building at the border.|$|E

5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too could be brought to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house {{that had been used}} as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house did not reveal Mengele or any members of his family, and the neighborhood <b>postman</b> said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so he had to give up.|$|E
5|$|Later, Ingeborg's husband dies in an accident, and Ingeborg sends {{a letter}} to Kaspar. However, it is accidentally dropped by the <b>postman,</b> and never arrives.

As Kaspar tells Ingeborg that he loves her long hair, she does not cut it, but when Kaspar trips over it and breaks his thumb, she sends for her hairdresser from Norway. On the way, the hairdresser meets a young man on the train, who was also {{travelling}} to Copenhagen to meet Kaspar, his favourite poet. The two fall in love, and are revealed to be the narrator's parents.|$|E
5|$|N. T. Rama Rao and Garikapati Varalakshmi {{were chosen}} {{as one of}} the leading pairs of actors.

Yandamuri Jogarao and Savitri, who had played minor roles in Shavukar and Pathala Bhairavi, were chosen as the other leading pair. In playing the role of the zamindar, S. V. Ranga Rao exhibited a strange body language, inspired by a stranger he had observed at a railway station. Dr. Sivarama Krishnayya and C.V.V.
