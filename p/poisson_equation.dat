25|$|The first grid is coarse mesh {{spanning}} the entire problem domain including the bath regions {{and the channel}} region. The second grid (and so on for any other grids, 3rd, 4th, etc.) is a relatively much finer mesh that spans a sub-domain of the system containing the region that requires fine resolution like the channel pore. The <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation</b> is first solved on the coarse mesh with all the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, {{taking into account the}} applied bias. Next the boundary conditions for the secondary meshes are obtained by interpolating from the first or previous solutions of the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation.</b> The <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation</b> is solved again for the finer meshes using the new boundary conditions. In this way, electrostatic fields with different mesh discretization for different regions can be generated.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> for denumerable Markov chains with unbounded cost functions. Solutions to the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> {{exist in the}} Banach space of bounded real-valued functions {{with respect to a}} weighted supremum norm such that the Markov chain is geometrically ergodic. Under minor additional assumptions the solution is also unique. We give a novel probabilistic proof of this fact using relations between ergodicity and recurrence. The expressions involved in the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> have many solutions in general. However, the solution that has a finite norm with respect to the weighted supremum norm is the unique solution to the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations.</b> We illustrate how to determine this solution by considering three queueing examples: a multi-server queue, two independent single server queues, and a priority queue with dependence between the queues. © Springer-Verlag 2003...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} Euler [...] Poinsot case of {{the rigid}} body dynamics admits a class of simple but non-trivial integrable generalizations, which modify the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> describing {{the motion of the}} body in space. These generalizations possess first integrals which are polynomial in the angular momenta. We consider the modified <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> as a system of linear equations with elliptic coefficients and show that all the solutions of it are single-valued. By using the vector generalization of the Picard theorem, we derive the solutions explicitly in terms of sigma functions of the corresponding elliptic curve. The solutions are accompanied with a numerical example. We also compare the generalized <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> with % some generalizations of the classical 3 rd order Halphen equation.

25|$|In all {{most any}} of the methods in {{simulation}} of ion channels, the major computational cost comes from the calculation of electrostatic forces acting on the ions. In continuum models, for instance, where ionic density exist rather than explicit ions, the electrostatic potential is calculated in a self-consistent manner by solving the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation.</b> In MD simulations, on the other hand, the electrostatic forces acting on the particles are calculated by explicit evaluation of the Coulombic force term, often splitting the short-range and long-range electrostatic forces {{so they could be}} computed with different methods. In our model as a reduced particle method, the longrange electrostatic forces are evaluated by solving the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation</b> and augmenting the forces so obtained with a short-range component. By solving the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation</b> it is possible to self-consistently include the forces arising from the bias to the system, while this is a difficult issue to be addressed in MD simulations.|$|E

25|$|The ion {{and partial}} charges on protein {{residues}} {{are assigned to}} a finite rectangular grid using the cloud-in-cell (CIC) scheme. Solving the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation</b> on the grid counts for the particlemesh component of the P3M scheme.

25|$|Currently {{there are}} two Poisson solvers {{implemented}} in BioMOCA based on the finite difference method. One uses the pre-conditioned Conjugate Gradient scheme (pCG) and is used by default. The later is borrowed from an APBS solver, which uses a V-multi-grid scheme. Other than the numerical approach to solve the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation,</b> {{the main difference between}} the two solvers is on how they address the permittivity in the system. In the first solver, a dielectric value is assigned to each cell in the grid, while in the APBS solver the dielectric coefficients are defined on the grid nodes. As discussed earlier box integration method is used in the pCG solver, which allows us to treat the <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation</b> in the most accurate way. Even though a full multigrid solver based on box-integration method has been under development, there is a neat way to reuse the already exiting code and treat the ion channel systems.|$|E
25|$|Ion channel {{simulations}} {{require the}} presence of large bath regions for accurate treatment of screening. There being of such bath regions make the mesh domain of <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation</b> large and leads to either {{a large number of}} grid points with fine mesh resolution or a small number of grid points with very coarse discretization. From bulk simulations a coarse mesh is sufficient for describing the baths using the P3M scheme. However, a fine resolution is required in the channel domain because of the highly charged nature of these regions and {{the presence of}} spatially varying dielectric regions. Besides the ultimate interest is to study the channel behavior in terms of ion permeability, selectivity, gating, density, etc.… In other words, it is better off to put more computational resources in the channel region, and bare minimum in the baths to reduce the overall computational cost and speed up our simulations from weeks to perhaps days instead.|$|E
40|$|These are {{lecture notes}} on the subject defined in the title. As such, they do not pretend to be really new, {{probably}} except for the only section about <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> with potentials. Yet, {{the hope of the}} author is that they may serve as a bridge to the important area of <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> "in the whole space" and with a parameter, the latter theme not being presented here. Why this area is so important was explained in many papers and books (see the references [12, 34, 35]) : it provides one of the main tools in diffusion approximation in the area stochastic averaging. Hence, the aim of these lectures is to prepare the reader to "real" <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> [...] i. e., for differential operators instead of difference operators [...] and, indeed, to diffusion approximation.

40|$|We {{consider}} a general class of non-gradient hypoelliptic Langevin diffusions and study two related questions. The {{first one is}} large deviations for hypoelliptic multiscale diffusions. The second one is small mass asymptotics of the invariant measure corresponding to hypoelliptic Langevin operators and of related hypoelliptic <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations.</b> The invariant measure corresponding to the hypoelliptic problem and appropriate hypoelliptic <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> enter the large deviations rate function due to the multiscale effects. Based on the small mass asymptotics we derive that the large deviations behavior of the multiscale hypoelliptic diffusion {{is consistent with the}} large deviations behavior of its overdamped counterpart. Additionally, we rigorously obtain an asymptotic expansion of the solution to the related density of the invariant measure and to hypoelliptic <b>Poisson</b> <b>equations</b> with respect to the mass parameter, characterizing the order of convergence. The proof of convergence of invariant measures is of independent interest, as it involves an improvement of the hypocoercivity result for the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation.
