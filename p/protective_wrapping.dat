40|$|Abstract. System {{designers}} using o-the-shelf components (OTSCs), whose internals they cannot change, {{often use}} add-on wrappers {{to adapt the}} OTSCs ' behaviour as required. In most cases, wrappers are used to change functional properties of the components they wrap. In this paper we discuss instead <b>protective</b> <b>wrapping,</b> the use of wrappers to improve the dependability i. e., non-functional properties like availability, reliability, security, and/or safety of a component and thus of a system. Wrappers can improve dependability by adding fault tolerance, e. g. graceful degradation, or error recovery mechanisms. We discuss the rational speci cation of such protective wrappers in view of system dependability requirements, and highlight some of the design trade-o s and uncertainties a ecting system design with OTSCs and wrappers, and di erentiating it from other forms of fault-tolerant design. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With {{off-the-shelf}} software, software {{fault tolerance}} {{is almost the}} only means available for assuring better dependability than the off-the-shelf software offers, without the much higher costs of bespoke development or extra V&V. We report our experience with an experimental setup we have developed with off-theshelf SQL database servers. First, we describe {{the use of a}} protective wrapper to mask the effects of a bug in one of the servers, without depending on an adequate fix from the vendors. We then discuss how to combine the diverse off-the-shelf servers into a diverse modular redundant configuration (N-version software or Nself-checking software). A wrapper guarantees the consistency between the diverse replicas of the database, serving multiple clients, by restricting the concurrency between the client transactions We thus show that diverse modular redundancy with <b>protective</b> <b>wrapping</b> is a viable way of achieving fault-tolerance with even complex off-the-shelf components, like database servers. 1...|$|E

50|$|If an EIFS with Drainage, or water-managed EIFS is installed, a water {{resistive}} barrier (aka a WRB) {{is first}} installed over the substrate (generally glass faced exterior-grade gypsum sheathing, {{oriented strand board}} (OSB) or plywood).

Then a drainage cavity is created (usually by adding some sort of space between the foam and the WRB). Then the other 3 layers, described above, are added. This type of EIFS is required by many building codes areas on wood frame construction, and is intended to provide a path for incidental water that may get behind the EIFS with a safe route back to the outside.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{describe}} the surgical technique and peroperative management of tracheal and carinal replacement with aortic allografts for large salivary gland–type carcinoma and report the results {{with a mean}} 34 months' follow-up. MethodsWe performed tracheal and carinal replacements with aortic allografts in 6 patients with extensive mucoepidermoid (n =  1) or adenoid cystic (n =  5) carcinomas. Tracheal tumor resection was followed by carinal restitution (n =  3) and interposition of the graft, splinted by a silicone stent. The allograft consisted of an aortic segment, either fresh (in the first 2 patients) or cryopreserved (in the last 4). All grafts were wrapped with bulky and well-vascularized flaps (pectoral muscle flap all patients, with an additional “thymopericardial fat flap” in the last 2) to promote revascularization and to prevent erosion of adjacent large vessels or fistulas. No immunosuppressive therapy was administered. ResultsComplete resection (R 0) was achieved in 5 (83 %) of 6 patients. Three of the first 4 patients experienced major morbidity, mainly fistulas between the esophagus and graft. The last 2 patients had an uneventful outcome. All grafts transformed into well-vascularized conduits focally lined with respiratory epithelium. So far, the last 4 patients are disease-free and 3 of them have returned to full-time employment. Stent removal has not been attempted in any patient. ConclusionTracheal replacement with aortic allografts enables resection of extensive tumors with a curative intent. Efficient <b>protective</b> <b>wrap</b> around the graft is mandatory. Further follow-up is required to determine whether cartilage rings are generated within the graft, as in animal models...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{well known}} that {{asphaltene}} molecules {{play a significant role in}} stabilizing emulsions of water in crude oil or diluted bitumen solutions. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the aggregation and orientation behaviors of asphaltene molecules in a vacuum and at various water surfaces. Two different continental model asphaltene molecules were employed in this work. It was found that the initially disordered asphaltenes quickly self-assembled into ordered nanoaggregates consisting of several molecules, in which the aromatic rings in asphaltenes were reoriented to form a face-to-face stacked structure. More importantly, statistical analysis indicates that most of the stacked polycyclic aromatic planes of asphaltene nanoaggregates tend to be perpendicular to the water surface. If the asphaltene molecules are considered as “stakes”, then the asphaltene nanoaggregate can be regarded as a “fence”. All the fence-like nanoaggregates were twined and knitted together, which pinned them perpendicularly on the water surface to form a steady <b>protective</b> film <b>wrapping</b> the water droplets. The mechanism of stabilization of the water/oil emulsions is thereby well understood. Demulsification processes using a chemical demulsifier were also studied. It was observed that the asphaltene protective film was destroyed by a demulsifier of ethyl cellulose molecules, leading to exposure of the water droplet. The results obtained in this work will be of significance in guiding the development of demulsification technology. 1...|$|R
40|$|Context: The {{food wrap}} films {{are used to}} cover the tip of curing light units {{in order to avoid}} {{contamination}} and prevent damage to the light guide. However, their effects on resin polymerization are not fully known. Aims: We investigated the effects on restoration efficiency of a food <b>wrap</b> <b>protective</b> barrier used on the tip of curing light units. Materials and Methods: For each treatment, five replications were performed, a total of 60 bovine incisor. The degree of conversion (%DC) of restorations with the composite resin Opallis EA 2 was evaluated using 3 curing light devices (Optilux 501, Optilight and Ultra LED) and 2 curing distances (0 and 5 mm). The composite resin was tested for restoration of cavities in bovine crowns. %DC values were measured by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance technique. Statistical Analysis Used: The data were analyzed using 3 -way ANOVA and Tukey′s test. Results: Use of the protective film lowered %DC (F = 4. 13; P = 0. 05), and the effects of curing distance were associated to the curing light device (F = 3. 61; P = 0. 03). Conclusions: The distance from the light curing tip and use of a translucent protective barrier on the light-cure device can both impair composite resin %DC...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} employing starch-protein hydrolysate of amaranth flour to produce protective edible coatings on butter. Tests were run on 3 types of coating solutions. The first {{was made in}} such manner that to hydrolysate of 40 -% dry matter content, 30 -% (w/w) plasticiser (glycerol) was added and also 3 -% (w/w) emulsifying agent (lecithin).

The objective was to investigate the oxidation course of butter with <b>protective</b> coatings, butter <b>wrapped</b> in original wrapping and butter without wrapping/coat. Determined values were peroxide value, acid value and anisidine value. Results of butters with protective and edible polymer coatings displayed a similar oxidation course to that of butter in standard wrapping.

40|$|Myelin is a <b>protective</b> layer <b>wrapped</b> around axons {{which helps}} them conduct {{electrical}} signals rapidly, and {{provides them with}} metabolic support. In {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), myelin is produced by specialised glial cells called oligodendrocytes. Loss of myelin (demyelination) is associated with degeneration of axons and many neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The restoration of myelin sheaths by remyelination may protect axons and help functional recovery of patients, but achieving this requires better understanding of how the process unfolds at the cellular level. To investigate the processes of de- and remyelination in vivo, I have characterised a transgenic zebrafish line in which expression of the bacterial enzyme nitroreductase (NTR) is driven under the myelin basic protein promoter, thus in myelinating glia. I treat larvae with the NTR substrate metronidazole (Mtz). The reaction between NTR and Mtz results in a toxic metabolite which selectively kills NTR-expressing cells. The treatment with Mtz consistently ablates two-thirds of oligodendrocytes while not harming the animals otherwise. Myelin sheaths continue to deteriorate {{after the end of the}} treatment, such that seven days later, extensive demyelination is observed by electron microscopy. By 16 days after Mtz-treatment, robust recovery has occurred, with no discernible axon loss and myelin thickness restored to control levels. At this time point, oligodendrocyte numbers have also returned to control levels. During the demyelinated phase, I observe a striking increase in microglia and macrophages in the spinal cord. In order to study the role of the innate immune system in recovery, I used a mutant line, irf 8 -/- which lacks a transcription factor essential for development of microglia and macrophages. I am in the process of determining the ability of these mutants to regenerate their oligodendrocytes and myelin; preliminary results suggest that they are able to restore their myelin sheaths fully, but seem to have a delay in regenerating their oligodendrocytes compared to wild-types. The model I have established can be used in the future to better understand the consequences of demyelination to axon health, as well as chemical screening to identify compounds that could accelerate the remyelination process or enhance the thickness of myelin generated during remyelination. Insights arising from such studies will be useful in designing strategies to reduce axon loss and improve myelin regeneration in demyelinating diseases...|$|R

At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically to large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the Western Boundary of Kruger National Park, South Africa have caused concern regarding the health of several species of tree. My objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of <b>wrapping</b> <b>protective</b> wire netting around the trunk of the tree in preventing and reducing bark stripping by elephants. 2, 668 trees, 1352 marula (Sclerocarya birrea), 857 knobthorn (Acacia Nigrescens), and 459 false marula (Lannea schweinfurti), were assessed for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been <b>wrapped</b> in <b>protective</b> wire netting (789, 548, and 50 respectively). For knobthorn and marula, wire netting significantly decreased the number of the trees that were bark stripped. For all trees, wire netting decreased the level of bark stripping especially for the highest impact levels. No trees wrapped with wire were ringbarked, compared to 23 unwired trees. In addition, wire netting had an effect on the distribution of damage for the highest impact class incurred regardless of type. A higher relative frequency of wired trees were found in lower impact categories compared to unwired trees. Wire netting is a low maintenance and ecologically valuable technique that alleviates bark stripping for some species.

At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically for large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, have caused concern regarding the survival of several tree species. Our objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of <b>wrapping</b> <b>protective</b> wire netting around the trunk of the tree for preventing and reducing bark stripping, branch breaking, and felling by elephants. We assessed 2668 trees – 1352 Sclerocarya birrea (marula), 857 Acacia nigrescens (knobthorn), and 459 Lannea schweinfurthii (false marula) – for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been <b>wrapped</b> in <b>protective</b> wire netting (789, 548 and 50, respectively). Wire netting was effective in reducing the severity of bark stripping and the relative proportion of trees that were bark stripped. In addition, wire netting had an effect on the level of impact, with a higher relative frequency of wire-net-protected trees found in lower impact categories compared with unprotected trees. Since tree mortality has been attributed to high levels of elephant impact, the use of wire netting could serve to maintain individual trees or populations particularly vulnerable to elephant impact in areas with locally high densities of elephants. Conservation implications: Since wire netting is a relatively low cost and ecologically unobtrusive strategy, it could be used to reduce elephant impact in problem areas. This method focuses on protecting trees rather than some other strategies such as environmental manipulation, translocation, contraceptives, and culling that instead focus on reducing elephant numbers.
