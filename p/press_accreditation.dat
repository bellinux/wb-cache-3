50|$|The first Standing Committee of Correspondents {{was created}} in 1879 to {{eliminate}} lobbyists from the press galleries. With the approval of House and Senate leaders, reporters drafted a set of requirements for <b>accreditation.</b> <b>Press</b> passes were issued only to those whose primary source of income was journalism, and who reported by telegraph to a daily newspaper. The rules eliminated lobbyists, but also women and minorities. Nineteenth-century womenreporters were confined to social news coverage, which did not justify the cost of telegraphing. African American reporters were limited to the black press, which were then all weekly papers. Not until the 1940s did women and minorities overcome these obstacles.|$|R

From 1929 he was {{the secretary general of}} the Société des auteurs de films which sought to establish greater recognition for the authorial rights of filmmakers.

The union achieved improvements in rates of pay, hours of work, and insurance arrangements for accidents at work, as well as <b>press</b> <b>accreditation</b> for film journalists. The union could also speak with one voice for all aspects of the industry. After the war L'Herbier continued his lobbying for French cinema by chairing the Comité de défense du cinéma français.|$|E

The study found determined attempts to minimize ideological influences through media socialization by accentuating on the direct influences, such as the journalists ’ role in shaping content, establishing structured routines to contain possible governmental and legal backlash, and aligning organizational sustainability to editorial prerogatives. The greatest impediment to its ability to maintaining its editorial independence, however, stem from the limitations exerted by extramedia forces, such as lack of <b>press</b> <b>accreditation,</b> legal constraints, and inter-media rivalry, that collectively act as a surrogate ideology.
