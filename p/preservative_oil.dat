After a few days, the sapwood is completely impregnated; unfortunately little or no penetration takes place in the heartwood. Only green wood can be treated in this manner. This process has found considerable usage to impregnate poles and also larger trees in Europe and North America, and has experienced a revival of usage to impregnate bamboo in countries such as Costa Rica, Bangladesh, India and the state of Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|Patented by Charles A. Seely, {{this process}} {{achieves}} treatment by immersing seasoned wood in successive baths of {{hot and cold}} preservatives. During the hot baths, the air expands in the timbers. When the timbers are changed to the cold bath (the preservative can also be changed) a partial vacuum is created within the lumen of the cells, causing the preservative {{to be drawn into}} the wood. Some penetration occurs during the hot baths, but most of it takes place during the cold baths. This cycle is repeated with a significant time reduction compared to other steeping processes. Each bath may last 4 to 8 hours or in some cases longer. The temperature of the preservative in the hot bath should be between 60 to 110 C and 30 to 40 C in the cold bath (depending on preservative and tree species). The average penetration depths achieved with this process ranges from 30 to 50 mm. Both <b>preservative</b> <b>oils</b> and water-soluble salts can be used with this treatment.

Thermally modified samples had lower treatability than their counterpart control samples. More structural changes after thermal modification, especially in birch, significantly reduced the preservative uptake and distribution. The differences of preservatives uptake near the end grain were high and then decreased near the mid position of the samples length as compared with similar type of wood sample.

40|$|Abstract This study {{concentrates}} on developing and tuning various oil analysis methods {{to meet the}} requirements of modern industry and environmental analytics. Oil analysis methods form a vital part of techniques used to monitor the condition of machines and may help to improve the overall equipment effectiveness value of a factory in a significant manner. Worm gears are used in various production machines, and their breakdowns may cause significant production losses. Wearing of these gears is relatively difficult to monitor with vibration analysis. Analysis of two indicator metals, copper and iron, may reveal wearing phenomena of worm gears effectively, and savings can be significant. Effective wear metal analysis requires good tools. ICP-OES with kerosene dilution is widely used in wear metal analysis, but purchasing and using of ICP-OES is expensive. A cheaper FAAS technique with similar pre-treatment of oil samples was tested and it proved to be useful especially in analyzing small amounts of samples. The accuracy of FAAS was sufficient for quantitative work in machine diagnostics and waste oil characterization. Solid debris analyses are useful in oil contamination control as well as in detection of wearing mechanisms. Membrane filtration, optical microscopy, SEM and automatic particle counting were applied in analysis of rolling and gear oils. Particle counting is an effective way to detect oil contamination, but in the studied cases even larger particles than those detected in normal ISO classes would be informative. However, membrane filtration and optical microscopy may reveal the wearing machine element exactly. Additives provide oils with desired properties thus they should be monitored intensively. A FTIR method for quantitative analysis of fatty alcohols and fatty acid esters in machinery oils was developed during this work. It has already been used successfully in quantitative and qualitative analysis of machinery oil samples. Various kinds of oils may be spilled into the soil during use and in accident situations, and they can migrate to groundwater layers. Biodegradation of oils can remove them from the soil or water completely or at least diminish the amount of harmful substances. An automatic, respirometric BOD OxiTop method was used to evaluate the biodegradability of various oils in water and soil media. The biodegradation of certain bio and mineral hydraulic oils was evaluated in groundwater, where bio oils usually biodegraded more effectively than mineral oils. The use of oils in machines weakened especially the biodegradability of bio oils. Biodegradability of bio oils was also studied in standard conditions of OECD 301 F and bio oils usually biodegraded moderately good in these conditions. The biodegradation of forestry chain <b>oils</b> and wood <b>preservative</b> <b>oils</b> was evaluated in forest soils.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the antimicrobial effect of various gel formulations on plaque formation; different tooth gels were compared to a toothpaste containing comparable antimicrobial ingredients with regard to its microbiocidal activity. The study was conducted under the assumption, that a chief requirement for the prevention of plaque formation is the combination of mechanical removal and antimicrobial activity, and not the sole capability of mechanical plaque removal. Methods: Ledermix® fluoride gel as commercially available with preservative, and without <b>preservative</b> and perfume <b>oils,</b> Elmex® gelée, and Meridol® toothpaste were tested in a standardized in-vitro test modification of the quantitative suspension test EN 1040. Instead of testing in a suspension, the respective product was directly placed on a standardized contaminated sterile stainless steel disk without adding any bio-burden. 50 % egg yolk in Aqua dest. was used as a neutralizer. Results: Within 1 min, Elmex® gelée showed a RF > 5 log 10 against S. pyogenes and S. sanguinis. Against S. mutans, a log 10 RF of ≥ 5 was achieved after 2 min, against C. albicans after 5 min, and against P. aeruginosa after 10 min S. aureus was the most difficult organisms to be reduced. After an application time of 10 min, only a log 10 RF of 2. 4 was achieved. Ledermix exceeded the antimicrobial efficacy of Elmex® gelée against S. mutans and C. albicans and was already effective against these organisms after 1 min, but did not show the same antimicrobial efficacy as Elmex® gelée against P. aeruginosa. Similar to Elmex® gelée, a required reduction of > 5 log 10 for antimicrobials under no organic challenge was not achieved against S. aureus. Ledermix® fluoride gel without preservatives and Ledermix® fluoride gel without <b>preservatives</b> and perfume <b>oil</b> did not show the antimicrobial efficacy of the standard Ledermix® fluoride gel formulation, indicating that the observed antimicrobial efficacy is chiefly based on the preservative, and possibly the perfume oil. Compared to the tested gels, Meridol® toothpaste was less effective and reached any antimicrobial effect > 5 log 10 only against S. sanguinis after 10 min. Conclusion: All unmodified tested gels showed an antimicrobial effect. Because no relevant antimicrobial efficacy against plaque forming bacteria was achieved within 2 min, in practice, an anti-plaque forming effect based on the antimicrobial action of gels cannot be assumed when used in the oral cavity. However, the results {{of the present study}} indicate that the antimicrobial efficacy of gels is determined by their formulation and that for the prevention of plaque formation the combination of mechanical removal and antimicrobial activity is not the chief requirement only, but a sustained antimicrobial effect may be of greater importance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWood is {{biodegradable}} material. Using wood in {{long term}} requires preservation and protect. Wood preservation is able to lengthen its life {{at least three times}} than non-treated wood. Lignocelluloses biomass bio-oil is potential substrates as wood preservative. One of potential source as lignocelluloses biomass bio-oil is oil palm trunk. Production of lignocelluloses biomass bio-oil is influenced by numerous parameters such as, moisture content of wood, temperature and time of combustion. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a powerful and efficient mathematical approach widely applied in the optimization of process. The objectives of this research are to search an optimum condition of production of lignocelluloses biomass bio-oil of oil palm trunk. Optimization of production process of lignocelluloses biomass bio-oil is carried out by using RSM with three variable designs as introduced by Box-Behnken, including pyrolysis temperature at 350 °C, 400 °C and 450 °C; pyrolysis time of 60 minutes, 90 minutes and 120 minutes; and moisture content of 10 %, 12. 5 % and 15 % with 15 runs.

40|$|Three {{types of}} wood <b>preservatives,</b> {{creosote}} <b>oil</b> (Creosote), chromated copper arsenate (CCA- 3) and ammoniacal copper quats (ACQ- 1) were studied, first by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under different heating rates (5 or 40 ℃/min), {{and then by}} using thermogravimetric analysis with infrared spectrometry (TGA-IR) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). The results obtained from the TGA tests found that the decomposition temperature {{of each of the}} preservatives for the heating rate at 5 ℃/min was lower than that at 40 ℃/min. Regardless of different heating rate, the char (wt %) of the CCA- 3 was more than that of the ACQ- 1, and the amount of char for the Creosote was lower than that for either of the water-based preservatives. The IR response of all preservatives in the TGA-IR tests showed that at a heating rate of 5 ℃/min, the absorbance of Creosote and ACQ- 1 was higher than that of CCA- 3. This indicated that the concentration of evolved species of CCA- 3 was less than that of Creosote and ACQ- 1. However, at a heating rate of 40 ℃/min, the absorbance of CCA- 3 and ACQ- 1 was higher than that of Creosote. Considering the decomposition step (thermal time or temperature) at different heating rates in the TGA tests and the IR response from the TGA-IR analysis, the results obtained showed that at the slow-heating regime, the concentrations of CO_ 2 produced by Creosote and ACQ- 1 were higher than that of CCA- 3, but at the fast-heating regime, the concentration of CO_ 2 for ACQ- 1 was higher than that of Creosote and CCA- 3. The EDX analysis of all preservatives showed that the main element of the char for Creosote was C (82. 75 %) after combustion. The char of CCA- 3 had an amount of Cr (34. 99 %) that was obviously more than that of As (11. 89 %) and Cu (16. 69 %) due to Cr being a stable element during combustion. The char of ACQ- 1 left a high amount of inorganic metal elements, such as Cu (50. 14 %). These results, when compared to the chemical ingredients of all preservatives, enabled us to point out the kinds of evolved species for referencing the thermo-decomposition processes of the preservatives. The use of TGA for analyzing the thermal properties of three types of preservatives, in combination with TGA-IR and EDX analysis, has led to useful results, regarding the identification of thermal decomposition products (evolved species and char) ...|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{antibacterial}} activity, oregano oil {{has lately}} become interesting {{as a potential}} 'natural' food <b>preservative.</b> Oregano <b>oil</b> {{was found to be}} a fast acting and effective inhibitor of a strain of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, the causative agent of a serious gastro-enteritis, and was lethal to this strain when used in high enough concentrations. Starting with 106 bacteria per millilitre broth, 156 ppm was lethal within 5 min; 625 ppm was lethal within 1 min. Treated bacterial cells observed under an electron microscope were lysed and apparently empty of cell contents. The chemical composition of two oregano oils was determined. Carvacrol and thymol, both phenolic compounds, appeared to be responsible for the antibacterial activity. The other two major components p-cymene and gamma-terpinene were found to be inactive against bacteria. The food stabiliser agar improved the antibacterial action of oregano oil in broth and the action of carvacrol was improved by both agar and stabiliser carrageenan. This enhancement is presumed to be due to the delayed separation of the essential oil or carvacrol droplets from suspension. The emulsifier lecithin markedly reduced the efficacy of oregano oil, possibly because it enclosed the carvacrol in micelles so that it came less into contact with bacterial cells. Changes in protein synthesis in E. coli O 157 :H 7 cells during overnight incubation with a sub-lethal concentration of carvacrol were demonstrated. Heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60) was induced in significant amounts and flagellin synthesis was almost completely inhibited, resulting in bacteria without flagella. Flagella are essential to bacterial motility and there is some evidence to indicate that they mediate adherence of pathogenic E. coli to epithelial cells in the gut and urinary tract. Further research is planned to investigate whether carvacrol can render E. coli O 157 :H 7 aflagellate in vivo and whether this inhibits adhesion and colonisation of gut epithelial cells. Carvacrol {{in the form of a}} vapour was effective in significantly reducing viable numbers of Salmonella enteritidis on raw chicken at temperatures ranging from 4 C to 37 C. This is promising for practical applications in the food sector since many foods are stored and transported at low temperatures. Possible uses could be the inclusion of a carvacrol carrier within the packaging for fresh products to reduce growth of spoilage bacteria. Alternatively, small carcases or pieces of meat could be decontaminated by vapour before further processing. In conclusion, there are several possible applications for oregano essential oil, and the constituent carvacrol in particular, in improving food safety. The addition of essential oil or carvacrol to food products could inhibit growth and reduce numbers of spoilage bacteria and pathogens. The use of carvacrol vapour within food packaging to extend the shelf life and improve safety or as a novel decontaminant for fresh meat is another possibility. A further potential application is in improving the intestinal health of food animals, when used as a feed additive...|$|R
