2500|$|The {{electrocardiograph}} (ECG or EKG) machine used in {{the show}} was a Datascope Model 850 Dual Trace Physiological Monitor. This model came out in 1971 {{and was the first}} <b>portable,</b> <b>battery</b> rechargeable unit of its kind. Its original price was $2,000. In the middle of Season 4, the show switched to a Datascope MD/2, which was a combined monitor and defibrillator that allowed the monitor unit to slide out. The paramedics also carried some medical equipment in a black model [...] "PF-3300" [...] Old Pal tackle box, commonly used by the fire department at the time. There were instances when the actors encountered difficulty in pronouncing medical terms correctly, so some scenes show the characters from the back or behind a mask, which allowed them to dub in the correct pronunciations at a later time.|$|E
