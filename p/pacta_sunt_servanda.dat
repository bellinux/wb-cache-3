2500|$|Contract law {{concerns}} enforceable promises, and can {{be summed}} up in the Latin phrase <b>pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> <b>servanda</b> (agreements must be kept). In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: offer and acceptance, consideration and the intention to create legal relations. In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get £100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an invitation to treat, mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a reasonable man Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, [...] "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the [...] "distinct inconvenience" [...] of using a faulty product. [...] "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said Lord Justice Lindley, [...] "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".|$|E

40|$|The Consumer Protection Act (the CPA), 68 of 2008, has {{certainly}} evoked much debate and expectations {{in the consumer}} market. Most certainly, {{one of the most}} debated topics is how this new piece of legislation would influence common law of contract. Principles such as freedom to contract, caveat emptor and <b>pacta</b> <b>servanda</b> <b>sunt,</b> will from the effective date of this act certainly bear a new meaning. No longer will the consumer be faced with the might of the sword of the court's interpretation not to excuse contractual unfairness. The CPA seeks specifically to ensure contractual fairness through the principle of public policy and good faith, by promoting a fair, accessible and sustainable marketplace for consumer products and services, and for that purpose to establish national norms and standards relating to consumer protection. The CPA burdens the seller with rigid obligations and creates a plethora of rights available to the consumer. To a certain extent these rights and obligations are similar to the common law rights and obligations of the parties to an agreement of sale. But, in certain instances these rights and obligations differ in a considerable way. The main focus point of this dissertation is how the duties of a seller to an agreement of sale will be influenced and amended, either expressly or by implication. The study will start of with a brief discussion on the implementation and need for a Consumer Protection Act in South Africa, followed by the seller's common law obligations. Thereafter the systematic and application of the CPA will be set out, followed by an extensive discussion of the seller's obligations flowing from the CPA, as well as the specific differences as regards to the common law obligations. From here on, certain practical implications of the CPA will be discussed, followed by a general conclusion. CopyrightDissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

This leads to consideration of how the NVNB principle interacts with Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, incorporating the principle of <b>pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> servanda: [...] "Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith."

5000|$|With {{reference}} to international agreements, [...] "every {{treaty in force}} is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith." [...] <b>Pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> <b>servanda</b> is related to good faith, while <b>pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> <b>servanda</b> does not equate with good faith. This entitles states to require that obligations be respected and to rely upon the obligations being respected. This good faith basis of treaties implies that {{a party to the}} treaty cannot invoke provisions of its municipal (domestic) law as justification for a failure to perform. However, with regards to the Vienna Convention and the UNIDROIT Principles it should be kept in mind that these are heavily influenced by civil law jurisdictions. To derive from these sources that <b>pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> <b>servanda</b> includes the principle of good faith is therefore incorrect.|$|E

40|$|In South Africa, {{courts and}} academia {{frequently}} refer to contracts as bonae fidei agreements. Often this term is invoked without further explanation or reflection {{on what the}} meaning of this term is. Upon closer inspection it seems that the phrase “bonae fidei has largely become devoid of any meaning. This study embarks upon a critical analysis of case law leading up to the remarks of the Constitutional Court in Everfresh Market Virginia (Pty) Ltd v Shoprite Checkers Ltd 2012 (1) SA 256 (CC); 2012 (3) BCLR 219 (CC), with the aim of determining what the role of good faith in the South African law of contract is and how this concept is approached by South African courts. A brief overview of the historical origins of the concept is given and the English law is considered as a foreign jurisdiction in order to gain understanding of how the concept is dealt with elsewhere. This study does not propose to undertake an in-depth study of consumer protection legislation. The justification for this decision {{lies in the fact that}} moving beyond this scope will prove to be too wide a field of study; hindering the in-depth discussion and evaluation of the common law and moving beyond the research aims of this dissertation. A critical analysis of South African case law indicates that it is unlikely that the courts in South Africa will adopt a general defence based on good faith that would empower courts to set aside otherwise enforceable agreements. The principle of good faith now forms part of the umbrella defence of public policy: it is finally accepted that public policy is invested in equitable contractual relationships and not only in upholding the principle of <b>pacta</b> <b>servanda</b> <b>sunt.</b> This study shows that good faith has a more active role to play in the law of contract as there is a duty upon courts to develop the common law so as to bring it in line with constitutional norms and values. This study illustrates the importance of open-ended concepts such as good faith and ubuntu to achieve a greater degree of equity and justice between contracting parties. The conclusion is reached that public policy is informed by the reigning ideology of the day: the contract law of South Africa must reflect its adherence to upholding and promoting the values and norms underlying the Constitution. If courts step up and uphold the constitutional mandate to develop the common law to bring it in line with constitutional values and norms, there will be very little need for legislative interference.

These exceptions are part of general doctrine of frustration. Iranians exceptions to this rule are named as “Ta`azzor” and “Ta`assor” rules. Doctrine of Frustration in Common law includes three subdivision theories: “impossibility of performance”, “frustration of purpose” and “impracticability” (hardship. All of these theories applied where a supervening event occurs. In English courts, only first two theories are accepted but third one is applicable in American courts. In imamieh Jurisprudence and Iranian law, “Ta`azzor” rule in most aspects is similar to Impossibility and “Ta`assor” rule is somehow like Impracticability.

This condition has an impact on the change of security concept from State centrism to human security. At least seven factors must be fulfilled to realize human security, thats are: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security and political security. The global awareness motivates the development of the concept, doctrine, norms and institution of Human Rights by making International consensus approved by International Community.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} flesh out a theory of {{national}} application of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It does so by seeking to provide {{an answer to the}} research question, ‘what is the proper role of the domestic courts in the application of the European Convention?’ By relying upon the examples of French, German, and UK law, the study argues that it is not true in descriptive terms, nor desirable in normative terms, that the domestic courts take an approach to the ECHR based upon friction and assertion of sovereignty. This study argues instead that domestic application of the ECHR is built on the attainment of certain aims. These aims are inferred, in the main, from the domestic courts’ jurisprudence, such as it relates to four central ECHR doctrines, and they are: the doctrines of evolutionary interpretation; proportionality; the margin of appreciation; and autonomous concepts. On the basis of an analysis of this jurisprudence, the four aims are identified as being, first, honouring the principle of <b>pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> servanda; secondly, the safeguarding of human rights based upon the insight that human rights are a paramount good to be pursued; thirdly, the aim of positive, as opposed to negative, rights diversity; and, fourthly, the aim that conclusions reached on the domestic level of one state must be capable of being universalized. The approach of the domestic courts to the application of the ECHR can be explained {{on the basis of the}} domestic courts’ wish to attain these four aims. The proper role played by the domestic courts, the study argues, is one in which they are willing to give a lead to Strasbourg as well as to be led, in both, to use the wording of the Preamble of the ECHR, ‘the maintenance’ and in the ‘further realisation’ of the Convention rights.

This research uses several theories to analyses the topic, such as the concept of exploration and exploitation, Theory about The Nation and its sovereignty, the Theory about the International Treaty, and the Theory of the Succession of state, economic development contract, production sharing contract theory, Pact <b>Sunt</b> <b>Servanda</b> Principe, Concept of Joint operation. This research is a law research, that emphasis on the norms of Law and the facts through {{the implementation of the}} treaties that has been existed. The treaties are; Timor Sea Treaty 2002, International Unitization Agreement on Greater Sunrise 2003, and Certain Maritime Agreement 2006. The data in this research is collected through field research and library study. After that, the data is processed and systematized as well as analyzed by using theories in order to see the benefit of the treaties for Timor Leste. The Timor Sea Treaties are the treaties between Timor Leste and Australia about the Joint Petroleum Development Area and Greater Sunrise Area as well as the sea border issue in the Timor Sea. Timor Leste as a new independent country has the right to negotiate the border issue with Australia, as well as negotiating the exploitation of natural resources. According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, median line is an ideal solution. However, the border issue is held for some year because both nations maintain their claims as the owner of the territory. Finally, Timor Leste and Australia have achieved three treaties to exploit the natural resources. In fact, by holding the border of the sea, Timor Leste has gained less benefit in the area of Greater Sunrise. Moreover, this research also mentions other issues such as Greater Sunrise’s pipeline, Production Sharing Contract, and justice perspectives in sharing of the distribution of the oil and gas for Timor Leste and Australia...|$|R

50|$|The Roman-Dutch law of {{contract}} recognised the canon law principle that all serious agreements ought to be enforced (<b>pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> <b>servanda).</b> Adopting the canonist position, all contracts {{were said to be}} an exchange of promises that were consensual and bonae fidei, that is, based simply on mutual assent and good faith.

50|$|An {{underlying}} {{principle of}} the law of contract (<b>pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> <b>servanda</b> or sanctity of contract) is that agreements seriously concluded should be enforced, but agreements that are clearly detrimental to the interests of the community as a whole, whether they are contrary to law or morality (contra bonos mores), or if they run counter to social or economic expedience, is not enforced.

50|$|The {{sources have}} been {{influenced}} by a range of political and legal theories.

The clause, it held, was a law of general application, because it was underpinned by the principle of <b>pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> <b>servanda.</b> This analysis permitted the High Court to consider whether the limitation of section 34 by the contract was a justifiable limitation of the right.

Drawing, though, from domestic contract law, he argued that relations among polities ought to be governed by the law of peoples, the jus gentium, established by the consent of the community of nations on the basis of the principle of <b>pacta</b> <b>sunt</b> <b>servanda,</b> that is, on the basis of the observance of commitments. On his part, Christian von Wolff, contended the international community should be a world superstate (civitas maxima), having authority over the component member states.

In Le droit des gens, Vattel suggested that the law of nations was composed of custom and law on the one hand, and natural law on the other.|$|E
