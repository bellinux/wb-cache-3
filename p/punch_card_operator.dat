40|$|Transcript, 64 pp. Audio file {{available}} at [URL] reviews {{his involvement with}} computing from 1949 to the early 1970 s. He relates how he first learned about computers in Air Force <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> <b>operator</b> school and ran IBM punched card machines during the Korean War. Vincent joined International Harvester after the war, operating an IBM 602 A and later {{one of the first}} IBM 705 computers. He discusses the problems with the 705 and the field support offered by IBM. In 1959 Vincent joined Montgomery Ward, where he operated an early drum computer, the IBM 650. Vincent describes the difficulties of operating a drum computer. In 1961 Vincent joined Pillsbury, where he converted the company from an IBM punched card system to a General Electric 225 computer. He describes subsequent computer acquisitions at Pillsbury, including the 1965 acquisition of a GE 625, one of the early multi-processing computers. In 1969 Vincent joined Standard Computer Corporation, founded by engineers from the Call-A-Computer Division of Pillsbury, where he worked with Lazlo Rocozi on an IBM 7090 take-off, the IC 7000. In 1971 Vincent returned to Pillsbury and programmed the GE 635 in Cobol. Vincent discusses the problems of integrating different computer systems both within Pillsbury and with other companies. He concludes by discussing why Pillsbury uses GE (now Honeywell) instead of IBM computers...|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that in the {{mentioned}} experiments the interface between sensors and computer was implemented with the help of data input cards, such decision was a decisive step on the way of the appearance of the DAA. Then, there was only to solve the problem of direct digital data, obtained from sensing elements, input into computer, excluding the stage of preparation of <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> and <b>operator</b> assistance as a surplus link.|$|R

50|$|Multiprogramming doesn't {{give any}} {{guarantee}} that a program will {{run in a}} timely manner. Indeed, the very first program may very well run for hours without needing access to a peripheral. As there were no users waiting at an interactive terminal, this was no problem: users handed in a deck of <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> to an <b>operator,</b> and came back {{a few hours later}} for printed results. Multiprogramming greatly reduced wait times when multiple batches were being processed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{enduring}} {{memories of}} the IBM 1130 may have resulted from its need for continual human intervention. It was usually occupied running [...] "jobs" [...] specified by a deck of <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> The human <b>operator</b> would load jobs into the card reader and separate them back into jobs for return, perhaps along with printed output, to the submitter. The operator {{would also have to}} watch the 1130 for evidence of a malfunctioning or stalled job and intervene by pressing the [...] key on the keyboard to skip ahead {{to the start of the}} next job.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that Digital Humanities (DH) has, of late, gone from {{strength}} to strength. New teaching programmes in DH {{have been set}} up in institutions across the world; a flurry of new publications on the topic have recently appeared; and the numbers attending its annual Conference of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations grow year on year. It is also widely agreed that Digital Humanities has its finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist. By this I mean that its practitioners use a host of new – or at least newly applied – methods in order to carry out Humanities research that might otherwise be impossible, for example, text analysis, distant reading, 3 D imaging and so on. Why, then, should a discipline like DH, which is characterised so much by its present be aware of its past? The current dearth of literature on the history of Digital Humanities might indeed indicate that its practitioners are not convinced that it should. Indeed, until recently Digital Humanities has more or less ignored its disciplinary history. The application of computing to the Humanities {{can be traced back to}} 1949, at least, when Fr Roberto Busa S. J. (1913 – 2011), with funding from IBM began work on an index variorum of some 11 million words of Medieval Latin in the works of St Thomas Aquinas. It is astonishing to note that no comprehensive histories of DH and no book-length studies of such developments exist. This talk will explore ongoing research into the history of Digital Humanities in order to argue that its rich histories are ones that should urgently be addressed. In particular, I will give a detailed overview of research that I undertook during a recent visit to the archive of Busa, who is often identified as a pioneer of what is now known as Digital Humanities. While there we interviewed a number of the female <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> <b>operators</b> who worked for Busa in the 1950 s and 1960 s and whose names had disappeared from the historical record. As well as revealing their otherwise hidden stories I will reflect on how the findings of this project resonate with modern-day Digital Humanities, especially in terms of our understandings of issues like collaboration, gender and knowledge transfer...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} text entry interfaces was the <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input. A <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input is a computer input device used to read executable computer programs, source code, and data from <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> Most early computers used <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> as their main input device. Along with a <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers were an earlier method of entering data and running programs before {{the current generation of}} input devices existed. A <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> is an output device that <b>punches</b> holes in <b>cards</b> under computer control. Sometimes card readers were combined with <b>card</b> <b>punches</b> and, later, other devices to form multifunction machines.|$|R

50|$|<b>Punched</b> <b>card</b> - Book {{music was}} {{originally}} developed by taping {{a stack of}} <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> together.|$|R
50|$|For Hollerith {{machines}} and other unit record machines the resulting <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> contained {{data to be}} processed by those machines. For computers equipped with a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input/output device the resulting <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> were either data or programs directing the computer's operation.|$|R
50|$|Backing {{store was}} {{magnetic}} drum and optionally one-inch-, half-inch- or quarter-inch-wide magnetic tape. Input was from 80-column <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and optionally 160-column <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and <b>punched</b> paper tape. Output was to 80-column <b>punched</b> <b>cards,</b> line printer, and optionally to punched paper tape.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> voting systems use a metal hole-punch {{mechanism}} {{that does not}} suffer nearly as much from this fault, although most states have eliminated <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> voting systems of all types after the 2000 Florida experience. Canada still predominantly uses <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> ballots.|$|R
50|$|<b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> {{had been}} in use since the 1890s; their {{technology}} was mature and reliable. <b>Card</b> readers and <b>punches</b> developed for <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> machines were readily adaptable for computer use. Businesses were familiar with storing data on <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and keypunch machines were widely employed. <b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> were a better fit than other 1950s technologies, such as magnetic tape, for some computer applications as individual cards could easily be updated without having to access a computer.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} machine-readable medium {{used for}} data (as opposed to control) was <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> used for {{records in the}} 1890 United States Census: each <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> was a single record. Compare the journal entry from 1880 and the <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> from 1895. Records were well established {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, when most data processing was done using <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> Typically each record of a data file would be recorded in one <b>punched</b> <b>card,</b> with specific columns assigned to specific fields. Generally, a record was the smallest unit that could be read in from external storage (e.g. card reader, tape or disk).|$|R
50|$|While <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> are now {{obsolete}} as {{a recording}} medium, as of 2012, some voting machines still use <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> to record votes.|$|R

Mainframe computers had evolved into have modular architectures {{at the same time}} <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> were being abandoned as input devices. <b>Punch</b> <b>card</b> based mainframe computer systems typically had very rigidly fixed architectures with little variation in input or output devices.|$|R
25|$|Leslie Comrie's {{articles}} on <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> methods and W.J. Eckert's publication of <b>Punched</b> <b>Card</b> Methods in Scientific Computation in 1940, described <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> techniques sufficiently advanced to solve some differential equations or perform multiplication and division using floating point representations, all on <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and unit record machines. Such machines were used during World War II for cryptographic statistical processing, {{as well as}} a vast number of administrative uses. The Astronomical Computing Bureau, Columbia University, performed astronomical calculations representing {{the state of the art}} in computing.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of computers <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> found new uses as their principal input media. <b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> were used not only for data, but for a new application - computer programs, see: Computer programming in the <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> era. Unit record machines therefore remained in computer installations in a supporting role for keypunching, reproducing card decks, and printing.|$|R

50|$|Programs {{were mostly}} still entered using <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> or paper tape. See {{computer}} programming in the <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> era. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could {{be created by}} typing directly into the computers.

50|$|Card {{image is}} an archaic {{term for a}} {{character}} string, usually 80 characters in length, that was, or could be, contained on a single <b>punched</b> <b>card.</b> IBM cards were 80 characters in length. UNIVAC cards were 90 characters in length. A <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> typically held multiple data fields, some numeric, some alphabetic. Many data formats, such as the FITS image file format, still use card images as basic building blocks—even though <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> are now mostly obsolete.|$|R

50|$|The Bull machine used <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> of 45 columns, with {{round holes}} and a {{rotating}} adder. His machine was substantially better than its competition, Hollerith and Powers, through {{the mechanism of}} <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> pre-selection.|$|R
50|$|The {{card reader}} could read 600 {{standard}} <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> per minute, {{each with a}} capacity of up to 80 characters. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> could <b>punch</b> 100 <b>cards</b> per minute.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Punched</b> <b>card</b> {{technology}} {{developed into}} {{a powerful tool for}} business data-processing. By 1950 <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> had become ubiquitous in industry and government. [...] "Do not fold, spindle or mutilate," [...] a generalized version of the warning that appeared on some <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> (generally on those distributed as paper documents to be later returned for further machine processing, checks for example), became a motto for the post-World War II era.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> {{were widely}} used {{through much of}} the 20th century in {{what became known as the}} data {{processing}} industry, where specialized and increasingly complex unit record machines, organized into semiautomatic data processing systems, used <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> for data input, output, and storage. [...] Many early digital computers used <b>punched</b> <b>cards,</b> often prepared using keypunch machines, as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data.|$|R
50|$|The 407 read <b>punched</b> <b>cards,</b> totaled {{fields on}} the cards, made simple decisions, printed results, and, {{with the aid}} of a summary punch, output results on <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> that could be input to other {{processing}} steps.|$|R

50|$|The IBM 557 Alphabetic Interpreter (photo) allowed {{holes in}} <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> to be {{interpreted}} and the <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> characters printed on any row or column, selected by a control panel. Introduced in 1954, the machine was a synchronous system where brushes would glide over a hole in a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> and contact a brass roller thereby setting up part of a character code. There are no 557's operating commercially in the world today.|$|R
