2500|$|Odor {{identification}} {{requires the}} specific labeling of presented olfactory stimuli, unlike odor recognition. The ability of humans to verbally identify odors is very restricted despite {{the ability to}} differentiate hundreds of odors. It has been hypothesized that such poor odor identification performance {{is due to a}} weak link between odors and language. [...] However, it is possible that this <b>poor</b> <b>connection</b> is not due to limitations imposed by the human olfactory system, but by the way odors are gradually learned and because no formal education exists for the naming of odors as does for visually identifiable stimuli. The difficulty in identifying and giving a label to olfactory stimuli is known as verbal-semantic processing, and is thought to grow increasingly worse with age, consequently affecting odor recognition.|$|E

25|$|The {{participants}} from both sub-groups all held similar views {{in relation to}} the public transport; that of bus overcrowding, <b>poor</b> <b>connections,</b> <b>poor</b> timing, and poor route design impacted negatively on their perceptions and opinions of public transport.

50|$|Although some {{improvements}} {{had been}} made to the Leuchars station (which had been built as a rudimentary wayside stop) there were complaints about the connectional arrangements there; the branch trains made <b>poor</b> <b>connections</b> with the main line trains, and delays were attributed to improper formation of the main line trains.|$|R

50|$|Another {{common mistake}} with home-made {{adapters}} {{is to use}} two cables into a connector which is only designed for a single cable, possibly resulting in <b>poor</b> electrical <b>connection,</b> <b>poor</b> mechanical attachment at the strain relief, and/or inadequate ingress protection.|$|R
50|$|Another {{issue is}} the joining of {{aluminum}} wire to copper wire. In addition to the oxidation that occurs {{on the surface of}} aluminum wires which can cause a <b>poor</b> <b>connection,</b> aluminum and copper are dissimilar metals. As a result, galvanic corrosion can occur in the presence of an electrolyte, and these connections can become unstable over time.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} {{quality of service}} is rate {{limiting}} a connection, packets may be intentionally dropped in order to slow down specific services to ensure available bandwidth for other services marked with higher importance (like those used in the leaky bucket algorithm).

50|$|There was {{a single}} service each-way on the Waterford-Rosslare stretch, {{operated}} by 2700 Class railcars taking just over 1 hour.

50|$|The first daily {{bus service}} to Cowbridge was inaugurated in 1920, and proved much more {{convenient}} than the trains.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2015, only 1,400 passengers used the service daily instead of the forecast 2,000. There were still regular problems with {{the operation of the}} portion working, with poor provision of information to passengers. In addition, many bus connections in the district of Heinsberg were still unchanged from their original timetable and had not been adapted to the railway timetable. There is also a <b>poor</b> <b>connection</b> from the Rhein-Niers-Bahn from Heinsberg towards Mönchengladbach, as it misses the Wupper-Express (RE 4) towards Düsseldorf by a few minutes.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] mile horse tramway from Ryde Pier to the IoWR St John's Road {{station was}} {{overwhelmed}} by the numbers of passengers during the summer months, and many proposals were put forward {{for the construction of}} a railway. Delegations of local people in the island attended meetings with a joint committee of the LSWR and LBSCR, and they demanded a proper railway at Ryde. The two mainland companies had collaborated in forming a joint connection to Portsmouth on the mainland and saw that their business to the Isle of Wight was limited by the <b>poor</b> <b>connection</b> at Ryde, so they acceded to the idea, and agreed to construct the link themselves.|$|E
50|$|While a single-player game {{maintains}} the main game {{state on the}} local machine, an online game requires it to be maintained on a central server {{in order to avoid}} inconsistencies between individual clients. As such, the client has no direct control over the central game state and may only send change requests to the server, and can only update the local game state by receiving updates from the server. This need to communicate causes a delay between the clients and the server, and is the fundamental cause behind lag. While there may be numerous underlying reasons for why a player experiences lag, they can be summarized as insufficient hardware in either the client or the server, or a <b>poor</b> <b>connection</b> between the client and server.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} {{repeater}} units, most stations utilize duplexers. These are notch filters usually in {{an array of}} six, eight, and sometimes four units. They separate the transmitter and receiver signals from each other so one antenna and coaxial line can be utilized. While this solution is very efficient and easy to install, factors such as humidity and temperature can affect the performance of duplexers, so in most configurations a dryer is installed to keep humidity out of the duplexers and coaxial cable, along with heated buildings in which they are installed in. Excellent quality coaxial cable, connectors, and antennas must also be used, as a single-antenna is not as forgiving as a dual antenna system since any RF leakage or <b>poor</b> <b>connection</b> can greatly decay the reliability and performance of the repeater. In some applications, cables going from the repeater and duplexers must be tuned to mitigate these issues.|$|E
50|$|In time, the {{trembler}} coil {{system was}} seen as obsolete and was replaced, first by the ignition magneto and later by Kettering's battery ignition system, using battery, coil and contact breaker. These systems used a single ignition coil for the engine, supplying the spark to each cylinder in turn. A device called the distributor (previously used with magnetos) was used to switch the high-voltage current to each plug in turn. The high voltage distributor evolved from the timer and it too was a rotary switch driven at camshaft speed. The first high voltage distributors likewise used a wiping-contact, but as the current was at such a high voltage, these gave trouble with arcing and erosion of the contacts leading to a <b>poor</b> <b>connection.</b> It was realised that a jump-spark distributor would work equally well at high voltages and would be less susceptible to problems from erosion.|$|E
