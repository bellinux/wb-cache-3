5|$|There {{was also}} {{increased}} environmental {{concern in the}} Soviet Union. In the mid-1950s, Soviet scientists began taking regular radiation readings near Leningrad, Moscow, and Odessa and collected data on the prevalence of strontium-90, which indicated that strontium-90 levels in western Russia approximately matched those in the eastern US. Rising Soviet concern was punctuated in September 1957 by the Kyshtym disaster, which forced the evacuation of 10,000 people after an explosion at a nuclear plant. Around the same time, 219 Soviet scientists signed Pauling's antinuclear petition. Soviet <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> did not share the concerns of others in Soviet Union, however; Kurchatov unsuccessfully called on Khrushchev to halt testing in 1958.|$|E
5|$|When the Song dynasty was founded, the <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> {{consisted}} of officials (and their sons) {{who had served}} in the Five Dynasties era, {{as well as those who}} came from prominent families which boasted an aristocratic ancestry and had provided officials for generations. Since the first Song emperors wished to avoid domination of government by military strongmen such as the jiedushi of the previous era, they limited the power of military officers and focused on building a powerful civilian establishment. During the 11th century, the expansion of schools and local academies nurtured a nationwide gentry class which provided most if not all officials. By the late 11th century, the elite marriage strategies of prominent families eroded due to the intense partisan politics surrounding the New Policies (新法; xin fa) of Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086). These great families were replaced by officials representing diverse local gentry lineages throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Despite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a {{story that}} was more {{directly}} critical of the Japanese business and <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> than any previous work. The Bad Sleep Well, based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about {{a young man who}} is able to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new U.S.-Japan Security treaty, which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.|$|E

40|$|The article {{describes}} and analyzes {{the evolution of}} Lithuanian <b>political</b> <b>elite’s</b> attitudes towards the European Union (EU) and its governance {{during the past decade}} (2004 - 2016). First, it reviews changes in the composition of Lithuania’s <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> and assesses EU related policy decisions, which reveal the complex interrelations between national and supranational politics in a small but illustrative post-communist state. Second, it presents an analysis of the Lithuanian <b>political</b> <b>elite’s</b> attitudes, which were surveyed in 2007, 2009 and 2014; it examines trends in the elite’s attachment to Europe, their perceptions of threats to EU cohesion, changes in the levels of their trust in EU institutions, their conceptions of European governance, and their stances towards the management of financial and economic crisis. Comparing the three surveys captures evolution of the attitudes of the by and large consensually pro-European Lithuanian <b>political</b> <b>elite.</b> The Europeanness of the Lithuanian <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> also increases, an attitude which appears to be more a response to Russia-induced geopolitical destabilization than to the 2008 financial crisis...|$|R

5|$|Historically, Egyptian breeders {{imported}} horses bred in {{the deserts}} of Palestine and the Arabian peninsula {{as the source of}} their foundation bloodstock. By the time that the Ottoman Empire dominated Egypt, the <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> of the region still recognized the need for quality bloodstock for both war and for horse racing, and some continued to return to the deserts to obtain pure-blooded Arabians. One of the most famous was Muhammad Ali of Egypt, also known as Muhammad Ali Pasha, who established an extensive stud farm in the 19th century. After his death, some of his stock was bred on by Abbas I of Egypt, also known as Abbas Pasha. However, after Abbas Pasha was assassinated in 1854, his heir, El Hami Pasha, sold most of his horses, often for crossbreeding, and gave away many others as diplomatic gifts. A remnant of the herd was obtained by Ali Pasha Sherif, who then went back to the desert to bring in new bloodstock. At its peak, the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif had over 400 purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, an epidemic of African horse sickness in the 1870s that killed thousands of horses throughout Egypt decimated much of his herd, wiping out several irreplaceable bloodlines. Late in his life, he sold several horses to Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt, who exported them to Crabbet Park Stud in England. After his death, Lady Anne was also able to gather many remaining horses at her Sheykh Obeyd stud.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, {{northern}} India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell {{again to the}} superior mobility and firepower {{of a new generation}} of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> along the coasts of southern and eastern India. As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.|$|E

40|$|Bertold Brecht’s anecdote If Sharks Were Men {{tells us}} about the life in the sea between sharks and little fish. Sharks teach the little fish about moral and their {{obedience}} to sharks. If they always obey to the sharks, they will have better future. This anecdote describes the <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> as sharks. They are being described as people, who are thirst of authority, {{but on the other}} side teach the ordinary people about “moral”. The ordinary people are being described as little fishes, that can be easily influenced and dominated. In this work, Brecht places himself as Mister K, the narrator, who lucidly describes the character of the ruler or <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> and the ordinary people. He makes three important points as a reflection of the life at that time. Firstly, the <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> always use the other people for their personal and group interest without feeling guilty, or in other words, public deception has already become a trend for <b>political</b> <b>elite.</b> Secondly, the ordinary people can be easily influenced to follow what Brecht calls in his work as “moral teaching”. Thirdly, the character of <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> always deceive and ignore the people and the helplessness of the people in dealing with the ruler is seen in this work as a reflection of the loss of ethics as an orientation and of their powerlessness in enjoying their existential freedom...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article {{analyzes}} the post-independence background {{and composition of}} the Nigerian core <b>political</b> execu-tive <b>elite.</b> By analyzing changes in the national <b>political</b> <b>elite,</b> this article attempts to establish {{the extent to which}} compo-sition of the elite reflects the democratic governance aspects of openness and inclusiveness. Liberal pluralists believe that transformation in the elite power structure depends on periodic renewals, i. e. the entrance of new persons and ideas as re-gimes and resources change. In post-colonial Nigeria, there have been many structural changes, especially in the political regime and economic resources. The article argues that structural changes have not been very effective in transforming the outlook of the Nigerian elite. The lack of transformation in <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> demeanor at the national executive power struc-ture is based on the shared (common) background and preferences of members of the elite. This article applies critical elite theory to analyze the characteristics and continuity of the Nigerian <b>political</b> <b>elite.</b> The findings demonstrate how the nature of the <b>political</b> executive <b>elite</b> in Nigeria has contributed to the weakness of political institutions...|$|R
