25|$|Since 2000, {{scholarly}} {{research has}} focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; John Lubbock and Oliver Lodge admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and cultural tourism (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with Thomas Cook); the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre. The sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett, argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout Web 2.0. Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a whole new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called <b>parametric</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
2500|$|If Deconstructivism {{can be said}} to {{have had}} an {{influence}} on Finnish architecture in the 1990s and 2000s, it was mainly through the global influence of Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas; an architecture typified by playful formal disjunctions of forms {{and the use of the}} [...] "generic", an anti-architecture with aesthetic value. Prime examples of this have been the work of Kai Wartiainen (e.g. High Tech Centre, Ruoholahti, Helsinki, 2001) and ARK-House Architects (e.g. Helsinki City College of Technology, Audio Visual School, 2001). Examples of more biomorphic works, if not always using <b>parametric</b> <b>design</b> principles, are seen in the work of Jyrki Tasa of Arkkitehdit NRT (e.g. Moby Dick House, Espoo, 2008; Into House, Espoo, 1998), and Anttinen ...|$|E
2500|$|The aims {{at a new}} {{understanding}} of regionalism yet in a modern idiom materialised in the greater use of timber - the building material most associated historically with Finnish architecture. However, there lies a dichotomy in its use: between its inherent positive values and its use as symbolising nostalgia, not to mention exploiting its industrial potential by the pervading timber industry. Already in 1956 Alvar Aalto argued that the use of wood was not a nostalgic return to a traditional material; {{it was a case of}} its [...] "biological characteristics, its limited heat conductivity, its kinship with man and living nature, the pleasant sensation to the touch that it gives.". A special unit, the so-called Wood Studio - partly funded by the Finnish wood industry - was founded at Aalto University not only to research wood construction but also to build experimental structures in wood, often using computer-based <b>parametric</b> <b>design</b> principles. An early example of this is the Observation Tower at Helsinki Zoo (2002) by Ville Hara and the Wood Studio. Similarly, Kärsämäki Shingle Church (1999-2004) by Anssi Lassila, was the result of a student competition held by the University of Oulu Department of Architecture, based on the idea of a modern church built using 18th century timber construction techniques, as a reminder of a previous church on the same site. Other notable large-scale wooden constructions since 2000 include the Sibelius Concert Hall, Lahti (1997-2000), by APRT; the east stand roof of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium (2005) by K2S Architects; and Kilden Performing Arts Centre, Kristiansand, Norway (2012), by ALA Architects. The Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Warsaw, Poland (2013), by Lahdelma & Mahlamäki is characterised by the principle of [...] "complex objects in a glass box", including parametrically-designed organic forms.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA new {{dictionary}} selection {{approach for}} sparse coding, called <b>parametric</b> dictionary <b>design,</b> {{has recently been}} introduced. The aim is to choose a dictionary from a class of admissible dictionaries which can be presented parametrically. The designed dictionary satisfies a constraint, here the incoherence property, which can help conventional sparse coding methods to find sparser solutions in average. In this paper, an extra constraint will be applied on the parametric dictionaries to find a structured dictionary. Various structures can be imposed on dictionaries to promote a correlation between the atoms. We intentionally choose a structure to implement the dictionary using a set of filter banks. This indeed helps to implement the dictionary-signal multiplications more efficiently.

A parametric representation gathers together within the same structure the parametric definition and one specific instance: the current instance. An EXPRESS model that follows this approach is presented. Its integration within the STEP Standard would enable the exchange of (simple) <b>parametric</b> <b>designs.</b> The use of a parametric program, based on a standard API, is a more conventional approach. We present the EBP system which enables such a program to be generated through purely graphical interactions.

If the API itself supports all these constructs, the parametric representation may be restored on the receiving system...|$|R
