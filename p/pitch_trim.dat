5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the engine}} being mounted above the center of gravity, power was highly {{stabilizing}} (addition of power would push the nose down), {{which could have been}} disconcerting to pilots.

2500|$|All {{wreckage}} {{was found}} along a 209 metre long, 50 metre wide {{section of the}} seabed {{at a depth of}} 78 metres. Investigators found no evidence of structural failure inflight. The damage to the aircraft was roughly symmetrical left-to-right, indicating the aircraft was close to wings-level flight on impact. The separation of the left landing gear leg compared to the bending of the right leg suggested to investigators that impact with the water happened with the left wing slightly lower than the right, as the left gear was the more damaged, and therefore subject to more force against the water. When the left wingtip contacted the water, investigators conclude that the aircraft cartwheeled, bringing the right wing down into the water with great force, which they report as being consistent with the nose gear being bent to the right as well as aft. The pattern of damage to the nose and the underside of the fuselage suggests the aircraft was in a slightly nose-down attitude, as if in a normal descent. Nearly neutral trim settings indicated the pilot was not trying to compensate for some abnormal flying condition, such as an engine failure or flight control problems. The <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> was set to a slight nose-down attitude, which the aircraft manufacturer calculated to indicate stable flight at 110–120 kts. This is consistent with investigators' calculations based on the damage to the aircraft that it had been moving at 90–130 kts at impact. Damage to the propeller blades is consistent with both of them turning and similar engine power being delivered to them. The amount of power being delivered to the propellers could not be determined. Therefore, it remains possible that ice had accumulated in the carburetors and reduced engine power. Although meteorological conditions were favorable for carburetor icing, and the carburetor heat levers were in the [...] "OFF" [...] position, loss of engine power is not consistent with the speed and shallow angle of impact calculated from the wreckage.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was scheduled to}} ferry 13 empty cargo pallets to be filled at Jeddah then returned to Kano. The flight was nearly canceled because only five pallets were loaded onto the aircraft, and the employee who had keys to the cargo pallet storage area did not report for work that day. The captain nearly cancelled the flight until arrangements were made for seven more cargo pallets to be added. The aircraft took at approximately 17:00 UTC and arrived in Jeddah a few minutes past 22:00 UTC. The turnaround time would have normally taken {{an hour and a}} half, but it took {{two and a half hours}} since the cargo pallets had to be loaded after arrival in Jeddah. The {{aircraft was}} ready for takeoff at 00:30 UTC, but during the engine start up procedure engine number 4 would not start. Engine number 4 was repaired and the flight took off at 13:48 UTC en route to Kano and was expected at Kano at 18:19 UTC. The captain was not warned about any classified or hazardous material aboard. The flight engineer sensed a strange odor in the cockpit at flight level 35 as the aircraft approached N'Djamena, at about 17:00 UTC. The rest of the crew as well as the ground engineer and the load-master confirmed the smell had persisted for a while. The two passengers traced to odor to pallet 11 and which appeared to be misty. After being handed a fire extinguisher the applied it to the pallet and when they returned they were breathing heavily. Afterwards the smoke evacuation procedure was followed and the smell temporarily ceased. The flight was cleared to descend at 18:00 UTC. Shortly afterwards the master warning followed a minute later by a fire warning sounded. With smoke entering the cabin, the flight went into a descent of nearly 3000 feet per minute. Control of the <b>pitch</b> <b>trims</b> was lost. The flight engineer started a radio transmission to the airline at 1804:57 UTC that ended suddenly at 1805:04, the same time the cockpit voice recordings stopped.

The aircraft descended slowly in the grasses but rolled upon contact with the water.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{portion of}} the lower surface of the airfoil hinges {{downwards}} from {{the leading edge of}} the flap, while the upper surface stays immobile. This can cause large changes in longitudinal <b>trim,</b> <b>pitching</b> the nose either down or up. At full deflection, a split flaps acts much like a spoiler, adding significantly to drag coefficient. It also adds a little to lift coefficient. It was invented by Orville Wright and James M. H. Jacobs in 1920, but only became common in the 1930s and was then quickly superseded. The Douglas DC-1 (progenitor to the DC-3 and C-47) was one of the first of many aircraft types to use split flaps.|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} {{design feature}} of the flap system {{is that there is}} no noticeable change in <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> with the extension of the flaps.

40|$|This paper investigates numerically {{the flow}} and {{unsteady}} aerodynamics {{of a complex}} landing gear using Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES). The case studied is a six-wheel main landing gear with some medium and small components included, which has been measured previously in wind tunnel. The {{aim of this study}} is to extend landing gear modelling to more complicated geometry and to understand the unsteady aerodynamic loads and flow features around landing gears with complex configuration. A meshing strategy based on unstructured mesh is used to cope with the geometrical complexity. Carefully chosen refinement zones and structured boundary layer meshes are employed to improve the mesh quality, which helped to ensure the accuracy for the DDES simulation. A hex-dominated mesh with 37 million cells was generated with resolved boundary mesh using 10 - 21 layers on all landing gear components. It is found that flow around the bogie is more complex due to stronger interactions between wheels in close proximity for the six-wheel bogie. Other components, such as wheel axles, bogie <b>pitch</b> <b>trimmer,</b> forward dressing link and after torque link introduces flow unsteadiness in the bogie region. Statistics of mean and RMS forces for all components of the main landing gear are obtained. The drag on the front pair of wheels was found to be lower than the middle and the back wheels. The presence of forward and after side stays (or diagonal struts) on the landing gear possibly creates asymmetry in the flow field. This asymmetric flow features further changes the separation on and around the wheels and influence its wake region. The presence of the components like side stays, forward dressing link and the after torque link changes the wake pattern behind the cylindrical strut. This increases the mean drag coefficient of the main strut compared to that of a simple cylinder with similar geometrical dimensions. This suggests that smaller components may play a significant role in changing flow features around a bigger component. The RMS side force coefficient of the main strut is higher than the RMS lift and drag coefficients, indicating a possibility of strong interaction between the main strut and wheels. Also, efforts are made to understand the unsteadiness in the landing gear wake. This study contributes to the limited literature available for aircraft main landing gear configurations with more geometrical details...|$|R
