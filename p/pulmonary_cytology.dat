40|$|Samples {{obtained}} by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) {{were used to}} evaluate <b>pulmonary</b> <b>cytology</b> in 59 feedlot calves with clinical signs of respiratory disease (cases) and 60 clinically normal comparison calves (controls). Many calves in both case and control groups had inflammatory changes in the lower respiratory tract, as determined by changes in proportions in the BAL differential cell count. Approximately 35 % of cases and 40 % of controls showed a normal differential cell count. It therefore appeared that the criteria used to select cases for treatment, which {{were similar to those}} often used in the field, were poor predictors of lower respiratory tract disease.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{measuring}} the functional consequences and the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>cytology</b> changes following a simulation of pulmonary haemorrhage. Pulmonary function tests including lobeline-induced hyperventilation, cytology of tracheo-bronchial wash (TBW) and thoracic radiographs were performed before, {{as well as}} 1, 7, 14 and 28 days after, the instillation of 300 ml of blood into the lungs of 4 horses deemed free of exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (Group 1). Control data (Group 2) were obtained by instilling the same volume of saline into the lungs of the same horses in a crossover design (control). The instillation of blood or saline resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of neutrophils in the TBW. Thoracic radiographs showed increased opacity in the caudodorsal region of the lungs in 4 / 4 (Day 1) and 2 / 4 horses (Day 7), in Group 1, and in 2 / 4 (Day 1) and 0 / 4 horses (Day 7) in the control group. These changes were attributed to the instillation procedure rather than the nature of the instilled material. Breathing mechanics and arterial blood gases at rest were not affected in either Groups 1 or 2. However, the maximal expiratory peak flow recorded during lobeline-induced hyperventilation was significantly lower (P< 0. 05) and the total pulmonary resistance significantly higher (P< 0. 05) on Day 1 in Group 1, but not Group 2. These observations suggest that expiratory flows might be partly limited in bleeders when breathing at high airflowPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy of intrathoracic lesions under fluoroscopic control on 50 patients. Lesions {{as small as}} 1 to 1 · 5 cm. in diameter were aspirated. Thirty of the 36 cases of malignant neoplasm were diagnosed by this method. Of the 14 non-neoplastic cases, granuloma was diagnosed in two, and in eight of the remaining 12 the clinical diagnosis {{was supported by the}} nature of the aspirated material. Pneumothoraces are to be expected as a complication of the method. Most will be asymptomatic; a small proportion will require treatment. There will also be the occasional haemoptysis. The procedure can be quickly performed and it is well tolerated by the patient. It causes less discomfort than bronchoscopy or scalene lymph node biopsy.

40|$|A 5 {{year old}} Thoroughbred-Warmblood gelding was {{presented}} with a six month history of weight loss, {{as well as a}} two week history of symmetrical limb swellings and intermittent fever. Physical exam revealed symmetrical, hard swellings present over both distal radii, the proximal left metacarpus, as well as both distal tibias and proximal metatarsi. Radiographs revealed moderate, smooth to palisading, diaphyseal new bone formation, confirming a diagnosis of hypertrophic osteopathy (HO). Imaging of the thorax was performed to determine an underlying cause. Ultrasonography of the thorax revealed multiple hypoechoic lung nodules in the cranioventral lung fields, along with pleural fluid.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} {{is based on the}} cytologic {{evaluation}} of bronchial brushings for the diagnosis of non neoplastic and neoplastic bronchopulmonary lesions and relation of the cytologic findings with clinical diagnosis and histopathologic examination wherever possible. Material and Method: 35 symptomatic patients were selected on whom bronchoscopy was done. Bronchial brushing was performed using straight brushes and bronchial washing specimens were collected after brushing samples. Smears were stained by Pap, H&E, and Giemsa in all the cases while PAS and Ziehl Neelsen stainings were done in selected cases. Endobronchial biopsy was performed using a flexible long biopsy forceps. Results: The age of the patients varied from 18 to 88 years, and the male:female ratio was 3. 3 : 1. Carcinoma was diagnosed in 21 (60 %) out of total 35 cases on bronchial biopsy and the remaining 14 cases (40 %) showed inflammatory, tuberculous or no significant pathology. Bronchial washing showed 10 true positive, 10 true negative, 4 false positive and 11 false negative cases whereas bronchial brushing showed 17 true positive, 12 true negative, 2 false positive and 4 false negative cases as confirmed on biopsy. Bronchial brushing showed good sensitivity (80. 9 %) and specificity (85. 7 %) compared to bronchial washing which had sensitivity of 47. 6 % and specificity of 71. 4 %. Conclusion: These findings attempted to confirm the concept that <b>pulmonary</b> <b>cytology</b> has improved to the point that its sensitivity is high enough to justify its use as a definitive diagnostic tool in those cases in which tissue diagnosis is not possible...|$|E
40|$|Background: The use of cytological {{methods in}} the {{diagnosis}} of malignant lesions of the respiratory tract has been generally acclaimed {{as one of its}} most successful applications. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy revolutionized respiratory cytology, as bronchial brushings, broncho-alveolar lavage and bronchial forceps biopsy became more easy, accessible and popular, shifting the emphasis from diagnosis of advanced malignancy in inoperable patients to the use of cytology as a first line diagnostic and management tool. Respiratory tract cytology is well established throughout the world as a diagnostic procedure in the evaluation of patient with suspected lung malignancy. Methodology: The present study compromises of bronchoscopic cytology and histology of bronchial biopsy in 80 patients suspected of lung tumors. The study was carried out in the department of pathology M. P. shah medical college and  the samples of the bronchoscopic material were received from tuberculosis and chest department  of G. G hospital Jamnagar Results: Out of 80 patients 66 were found to be malignant. Some of the suspicious lesions turned out to be malignant in biopsy. In the carcinoma of lung squamous cell carcinoma was the most common carcinoma (39. 39 %) followed by adenocarcinoma (21. 21 %) small cell carcinoma 13. 63 % and large cell carcinoma 7. 57 %,  majority  of the cases 77. 5 % were male predominat Conclusion: <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>cytology</b> is an important, basic diagnostic tool for the detection of lung cancer, that too in early diagnosis. Fibroptic bronchoscopy is an easy, OPD procedure which is minimally invasive and without any  risk.

40|$|Acute and convalescent serum {{samples were}} taken from 59 calves with signs of {{respiratory}} disease (cases) and 60 clinically normal animals (controls) during their first month in the feedlot. Sera were analyzed for antibodies to bovine parainfluenza 3 (PI 3) virus by hemagglutination inhibition, to bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus, bovine respiratory syncytial (BRS) virus and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1) by virus neutralization, and to Pasteurella haemolytica by indirect agglutination (PhIA) and cytotoxin neutralization (PhCN) tests. There was minimal evidence of serological activity to BHV 1. Serological activity to the other agents occurred commonly and the prevalence of acute titers and their mean values was similar in case and control groups. Mean convalescent PI 3 and P. haemolytica (PhIA) titers were higher in controls than cases (p < 0. 01) but, otherwise, convalescent titers did not differ between groups. The incidence of seroconversion was similar in both groups for all agents except for PI 3 virus which was more frequent in controls than cases (p < 0. 0001). There was a positive association between PhIA and CN seroconversion and isolation of P. haemolytica from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (p < 0. 1). The measure of agreement (kappa) between seroconversion with the P. haemolytica PhIA and PhCN tests was 0. 51. Bacteriological and cytological evaluations of the respiratory tract were made using BAL. No associations were evident between serological titers and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>cytology.</b> A multivariate logistic {{analysis was used to}} evaluate associations between disease status and serological, bacteriological and cytological data.

40|$|Background. Sequential {{treatments}} of Chinese medicines for acute exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (AECOPD) risk window (RW) have benefits for preventing reoccurrences of AEs; however, {{the effects on}} pulmonary function, pulmonary, and systemic inflammatory biomarkers remain unclear. Methods. Cigarette-smoke/bacterial infections induced rats were randomized into Control, COPD, AECOPD, Tongsai Granule/normal saline (TSG/NS), moxifloxacin + salbutamol/NS (MXF+STL/NS), TSG/Bufei Yishen Granule (BYG), MXF+STL/STL, and TSG+MXF+STL/BYG+STL groups and given corresponding medicine(s) in AE- and/or RW phase. Body temperature, <b>pulmonary</b> function, blood <b>cytology,</b> serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP), pulmonary histomorphology and myeloperoxidase (MPO), polymorphonuclear (PMN) elastase, interleukins IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and IL- 10, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α expressions were determined. Results. Body temperature, inflammatory cells and cytokines, SAA, CRP, and pulmonary impairment were higher in AECOPD rats than stable COPD, while pulmonary function declined and recovered to COPD level in 14 – 18 days. All biomarkers were improved in treated groups with shorter recovery times of 4 – 10 days, especially in TSG+MXF+STL/BYG+STL group. Conclusion. Sequential treatments with Tongsai and Bufei Yishen Granules, during AECOPD-RW periods, can reduce inflammatory response and improve pulmonary function and shorten the recovery courses of AEs, especially the integrated Chinese and Western medicines...|$|R
40|$|Glucocorticoid (GC) {{therapy is}} {{recognized}} {{to be effective}} {{for the treatment of}} recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) in horses. Anti-inflammatory properties of GC are thought to be mediated by suppression of inflammatory gene expression via inhibition of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1). The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of low-dose inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and injectable dexamethasone 21 - isonicotinate on clinical signs, <b>pulmonary</b> function, airway <b>cytology,</b> and activity of NF-kB and AP- 1 in bronchial cells of RAO-affected horses. Seven horses with RAO were exposed to moldy hay until they developed airway obstruction on 3 separate occasions. In a crossover design, they were then treated with a placebo (injection on day 1), inhaled beclomethasone (500 mg q 12 h for 10 days), or dexamethasone (0. 06 mg/kg, IM on day 1) and monitored for 10 days. Pulmonary function, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology, and NF-kB and AP- 1 activity in bronchial brushing cells were measured before (day 1) and after treatment (day 10). Treatment with beclomethasone resulted in significantly improved pulmonary function of RAOaffected horses compared with placebo and dexamethasone treatments. However, none of the treatments had an effect on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology or NF-kB and AP- 1 activity. These findings reveal that, in a model of severe RAO, the benefits of low-dose inhaled beclomethasone on pulmonary function are not accompanied by a decrease in airway inflammatory cells or a suppression of transcription factors NF-kB and AP- 1 DNA-binding activity.

40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} value of {{immediate}} assessment of cytology in percutaneous fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of lung. METHODS: FNA specimens from 75 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary neoplasms were subjected to immediate cytology assessment. Direct smears were prepared in the radiology department and stained using the Diff Quik method. The cellular content was assessed and, if possible, a provisional diagnosis offered. A second FNA was requested if the initial aspirate seemed of doubtful adequacy. The diagnostic accuracy was examined by review of clinical and radiological data in all patients, and by correlation with other histological or cytological material in 25 patients. Complications of the procedure were identified during the clinical review. RESULTS: Two of 75 specimens were inadequate for diagnosis. Satisfactory diagnostic material was obtained in 51 patients on a single aspirate and following a second FNA in 22 patients. Of the 73 satisfactory aspirates, 58 were malignant, one highly suspicious of malignancy and 14 reported as negative for malignancy. All malignant diagnoses were confirmed on clinical or pathological review. FNA accurately distinguished primary small cell and large cell carcinomas in those patients with pathological follow up. There were two false negative reports, one due to sampling error and the other due to misinterpretation of aspirate material. The diagnostic specificity was 100 % and sensitivity 96. 6 %. Complications were recorded in seven (9. 3 %) patients, five of whom developed pneumothorax; a chest drain was required in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous FNA cytology provides safe and accurate diagnosis {{in the investigation of}} <b>pulmonary</b> lesions. Immediate <b>cytology</b> assessment ensures that aspirate material is handled optimally, and those patients requiring further sampling or ancillary investigation identified rapidly. The number of unsatisfactory and false negative lung FNA are therefore reduced. The complication rate is minimised by decreasing the number of pleural punctures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Bronchogenic {{carcinoma}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} major killer diseases worldwide. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>cytology</b> is a simple and resourceful method of early diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma. The use of bronchoscope has increased the variety of diagnostic specimen obtainable and extended the scope of cyto-pathology. We carried out a study to demonstrate the value of cytological examination of bronchial brushing and washing in diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma in our settings. 69 patients of clinically and radiologically suspected brochogenic carcinoma attending the Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute (Guwahati) as well as in Dept. of Pathology, Gauhati Medical College and hospital were selected for one year. Out of total 69 cases bronchial brushing carried out in 42 cases and bronchial washing carried out in 27 cases. In bronchial brushing cytology a positive diagnosis of malignancy was established in 30 cases (71. 43 %) and in bronchial washing diagnosis of malignancy was found in 8 cases. Bronchoscopic biopsy was successfully done in 40 cases and histopathological diagnosis of malignancy was made in 29 cases. Out of 29 cases of carcinoma confirmed by histology, cytology was consistent in 26 cases. The bronchial cytology revealed sensitivity (89. 96 %), specificity (90. 9 %), positive predictive rate (96. 3 %), accuracy (90 %), false negative rate (10. 34 %) and false positive rate (9. 1 %). During the bronchoscopic procedure there was no major complication or fatality. Thus bronchial brushing and washing has firmly established its role in the early diagnosis of brochogenic carcinoma because it is safe, rapid and cost –effective and importantly gives a higher rate of sensitivity and accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Horses with {{recurrent}} airway obstruction (RAO) present many similarities {{with human}} asthmatics including airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, reversible obstruction, and increased NF-kappaB expression. Studies in experimental asthma models {{have shown that}} transcriptions factors such as activator protein- 1 (AP- 1), GATA- 3, cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) may also {{play an important role}} in airway inflammation. The purpose of this study was to measure DNA binding activity of these transcription factors in the airways of horses with RAO and to compare it to pulmonary function and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology. Seven horses with RAO and six control animals were studied during a moldy hay challenge and after 2 months at pasture. <b>Pulmonary</b> function, BALF <b>cytology</b> and transcription factors' activities in bronchial brushings were measured during hay and pasture exposures. During moldy hay challenge, RAO-affected horses developed severe airway obstruction and inflammation and a significantly higher airway AP- 1 binding activity than in controls. After 2 months on pasture, pulmonary function and airway AP- 1 binding activity were not different between RAO and control horses. The DNA binding activity of CREB in airways of RAO-affected horses increased significantly after 2 months at pasture and became higher than in controls. A significant positive correlation was detected between AP- 1 binding activity and indicators of airway obstruction and inflammation. Airway GATA- 3, CEBP and CREB binding activities were negatively correlated with indices of airway obstruction. However, contrarily to CREB binding activity, GATA- 3 and CEBP binding activities were not different between RAO and control horses and were unaffected by changes in environment. These data support the view that AP- 1 and CREB play a role in modulating airway inflammation in horses with RAOPeer reviewe...|$|R
