5|$|Protandry is when an {{individual}} starts out male and becomes female while the reverse condition is known as <b>protogyny,</b> the latter being more common. Changing sex can occur in various contexts. In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, where males have harems of up to ten females, if the male is removed {{the largest and most}} dominant female develops male-like behaviour and eventually testes. If she is removed, the next ranking female takes her place. In the species Anthias squamipinnis, where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males, if a certain number of males are removed from a group, the same number of females change sex and replace them. In clownfish, individuals live in groups and only the two largest in a group breed: the largest female and the largest male. If the female dies, the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place.|$|E
25|$|A few {{species of}} goby, such as blackeye goby and Lythrypnus dalli, can change their sexes. Sex change is {{possible}} in these gobies, since the external genitalia {{for males and females}} do not differ much. Sex changes can take from days to weeks. Most sex changes in gobies are from female to male (<b>protogyny)</b> rather than male to female (protandry). Female-to-male changes are observed not only in gobies but also in wrasses, damselfishes, and sea basses. Female-to-male change usually occurs because the resident male of the group is dead. If there is no male in the group, reproduction will be impossible. Therefore, the dominant female turns into male, allowing mating to happen. Male-to-female change occurs when the females have preference for specific features in males. For example, female gobies prefer large males, and a few large males mate with multiple females, whereas small males lose their chance to mate. Small males either choose to become sneakers (kleptogamy) or choose to transform into females because all females technically have high mating opportunities. By turning into females, males can ensure that they produce many descendants.|$|E
2500|$|Usually hermaphrodites are sequential, {{meaning they}} can switch sex, usually from female to male (<b>protogyny).</b> This can happen if a {{dominant}} male {{is removed from}} a group of females.

It is less common for a male to switch to a female (protandry). As an example, most wrasses are protogynous hermaphrodites within a haremic mating system. Hermaphroditism allows for complex mating systems. [...] Wrasses exhibit three different mating systems: polygynous, lek-like, and promiscuous mating systems. [...] Group spawning and pair spawning occur within mating systems. The type of spawning that occurs depends on male body size.

50|$|Warner {{suggests}} that selection for protandry may occur in populations where female fecundity is augmented {{with age and}} individuals mate randomly. Selection for <b>protogyny</b> may occur where there are traits in the population that depress male fecundity at early ages (territoriality, mate selection or inexperience) and when female fecundity is decreased with age, the latter seems to be rare in the field. An example of territoriality favoring <b>protogyny</b> occurs {{when there is a}} need to protect their habitat and being a large male is advantageous for this purpose. In the mating aspect, a large male has a higher chance of mating, while this has no effect on the female mating fitness. Thus, he {{suggests that}} female fecundity has more impact on sequential hermaphroditism than the age structures of the population.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} gobies exhibit gonochorism and protogynous hermaphroditism, {{including}} bi-directional sex reversal. <b>Protogyny</b> {{refers to a}} category of hermaphroditism where female organs develop or mature before the appearance of male product. In most species of male Tellostei gobbidae this characteristic is observed.Among those in the genus Elacatinus, <b>protogyny</b> is observed in E. illecebrosus.Protogynous hermaphroditism in gobies consists of a male reproductive system with paired, secretory, accessory gonadal structures (AGS) associated with the testis.While the AGS is almost universally present in male gobies, protogynous females need to develop AGS in order for sex reversal to take place. The AGS develop from precursive tissues (pAGS), {{in the form of}} bilateral, ventrally localized cell masses, located close to the junction of the ovarian lobes and the oviduct. At the time of sex change, it undergoes rapid growth and diverts to form the AGS. When pAGS develops into AGS, ovigerous tissue is also completely replaced by seminiferous lobules. However, the ovarian lumen remains even after the sex change, functioning as a common spermatozoa collection region that is continuous with the common genital sinus as free spermatozoa travels from seminiferous lobules into the gonadal lumen.|$|E

50|$|Sprengel {{identified}} that flowers were essentially organs designed to attract insects that aided in pollination.

He also observed dichogamy, both <b>protogyny</b> and protrandry and pointed out that this helped prevent self-pollination. He also noticed self-incompatibility. He classified insects as generalists and specialists and identified the principle of buzz pollination in Leucojum. He noticed that some flowers were nectarless, especially those that were wind-pollinated. He also observed that some flowers such as orchids attracted insects but did not have nectar {{but he did not}} fully understand the nature of the deception.

50|$|Sequential {{hermaphroditism}} (called dichogamy in botany) {{is a type}} of hermaphroditism {{that occurs}} in many fish, gastropods, and plants. Sequential hermaphroditism occurs when the individual changes sex at some point in its life. It can change from a male to female (protandry), or from female to male (<b>protogyny)</b> or from female to hermaphrodite (protogynous hermaphroditism), or from male to hermaphrodite (protandrous hermaphroditism). Those that change gonadal sex can have both female and male germ cells in the gonads or can change from one complete gonadal type to the other during their last life stage. Individual flowers are also called sequentially hermaphrodite, although the plant as a whole may have functionally male and functionally female flowers open at the same time.|$|E

5000|$|Example: wrasses (Family Labridae) are a {{group of}} reef fish in which <b>protogyny</b> is common. Wrasses also have an {{uncommon}} life history strategy, which is termed diandry (literally, two males). In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase male and a terminal phase male. Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial. They are, perhaps, female mimics (which is why they are found swimming in group with other females). Terminal phase males are territorial and have a distinctively bright coloration. Individuals are born as males or females, {{but if they are}} born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Females and initial phase males can become terminal phase males. Usually, the most dominant female or initial phase male replaces any terminal phase male when those males die or abandon the group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protogyny</b> is {{the most}} common form of {{hermaphroditism}} in fish in nature. About 75% of the 500 known sequentially hermaphroditic fish species are protogynous. Common model organisms for this type of sequential hermaphroditism are wrasses. They are one of the largest families of coral reef fish and belong to the Labridae family. Wrasses are found around the world in all marine habitats and tend to bury themselves in sand at night or when they feel threatened. In wrasses, the larger of the two fish is the male, while the smaller is the female. In most cases, females and immature have a uniform color while the male has the terminal bicolored phase. Large males hold territories and try to pair spawn while small to mid-size initial-phase males live with females and group spawn. In other words, both the initial and terminal phase males can breed; they differ however in the way they do it.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{groups of}} flowering plants among the Magnoliids {{and the families}} Choranthaceae, Ceratophyllaceae, Nymphaeaceae, Annonaceae, and Aristolochiaceae are bisexual with {{both male and female}} parts present and functional within the usually large floral structure. The main pollinators of these flowers were beetles, flies and thrips. They evolved mechanisms to reduce self-pollination by changing the timing of maturity of the male and female parts. This altered timing mechanism or dichogamy was principally expressed by <b>protogyny</b> or the early maturation of the female parts and only rarely by protandry or the early maturation of the male parts. The early flowers were principally flat and dish-like with the evolution of deeper corolla tubes being a later innovation and principally associated with long-tongued pollinators such as moths. There are a large number of other mechanisms that enhance cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination. The forces that lead to the evolution of such systems as bearing male and female flowers on separate kinds of plants is still unclear.|$|E
5000|$|The ‘gene {{dispersal}} model’ {{is based}} on the idea that limitations on dispersal may influence population structure or genetical environment and it can be separated into two versions: the inbreeding version and the sampling-error version. This theory of gene dispersal can be applied to sequential hermaphrodites, especially the inbreeding version. The inbreeding version is based upon the fact that both protandry and <b>protogyny</b> help prevent inbreeding in plants and thus one can make the same assumption that in animals it works by reducing the probability of this occurring among siblings. The sampling-error version {{is based on}} the reality that the genetical environment is influenced by genetic drift and similar phenomena in small populations. The two aspects of these hypotheses influenced by hermaphroditism, that is inbreeding and sampling-error, result in the same thing — reduction of genetic variability. In other words, being a hermaphrodite would increase genetic variability and thus be considered advantageous to the population.|$|E

50|$|Paeonia cambessedesii is a clump-forming, perennial, {{herbaceous}} peony, which dies {{down in the}} autumn, and overwinters with buds {{just under}} the surface of the soil, and may reach a height of 25-60 cm. The reddish purple stem carries several alternately arranged leaves. The lowest leaves consist of nine leathery, hairless leaflets which are lanceolate to inverted egg-shaped with a pointy tip. The upper surface of the leafblade is bluish green with a metallic gloss, while the main veins are reddish purple, and the underside of the leafblade is purple. Each stem carries one cup-shaped flower of 6-12 cm with usually eight (5-10) pale to purplish pink petals, and is said to smell of roses. Within is a circle of numerous purple filaments topped by yellow anthers. The center of the flower consists of three to nine, initially purple carpels, each of which is connected through a thick style with a reddish stigma on top. The stigmas ripen before the stamens, a situation called <b>protogyny.</b> The three to eight (mostly four to six) carpels develop into dry dehiscent fruits (called follicles) of about 6 cm long, that open with a suture along their lengths, and contain initially carmine colored seeds that turn glossy black when fully ripe.|$|E
5000|$|In {{nearly all}} ray-finned fish, the sexes are separate, {{and in most}} species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally, {{typically}} with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid. Development then proceeds with a free-swimming larval stage. However other patterns of ontogeny exist, {{with one of the}} commonest being sequential hermaphroditism. In most cases this involves <b>protogyny,</b> fish starting life as females and converting to males at some stage, triggered by some internal or external factor. This may be advantageous as females become less prolific as they age while male fecundity increases with age. Protandry, where a fish converts from male to female, is much less common than protogyny.Most families use external rather than internal fertilization. Of the oviparous teleosts, most (79%) do not provide parental care. Viviparity, ovoviviparity, or some form of parental care for eggs, whether by the male, the female, or both parents is seen in a significant fraction (21%) of the 422 teleost families; no care is likely the ancestral condition. Viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about 6% of teleost species; male care is far more common than female care. Male territoriality [...] "preadapts" [...] a species for evolving male parental care.|$|E

50|$|Initial phase males, {{terminal}} phase males, {{and females}} {{have the capability}} of reproducing. This {{is due to the}} <b>protogyny,</b> or the female’s ability to become a male. The density of the type of male depends {{on the size of the}} reef. There are more terminal phase males than initial phase males on smaller reefs, on which they guard a small number of females. However, on larger reefs, there are equal proportions of initial phase and terminal phase males. This increases the chances of initial phase males to mate because they are less aggressive compared to terminal phase males. Sex change has been studied in bluehead wrasses primarily using field manipulations, where it can be induced in large females by removing dominant terminal phase males from small reefs. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons differ across sexual phenotypes in the hypothalamus of bluehead wrasses and also with androgen implants that induce sex change. Behavioral sex change is very rapid in bluehead wrasses under field conditions, with male-typical behaviors being observed within minutes to hours after dominant terminal phase males are removed. Interestingly, behavioral sex change occurs even in females whose gonads (ovaries) have been surgically removed prior to becoming socially dominant. Behavioral sex change is associated with increases in expression of a neuropeptide hormone termed arginine vasotocin or AVT and these increases occur regardless of whether sex changing females have gonads or not. Injections of AVT can induce sexual and aggressive behaviors in terminal phase male bluehead wrasses while injections of fluoxetine (tradename: Prozac) can reduce aggressive behaviors by terminal phase males.|$|E
40|$|In migratory animals, {{protandry}} (earlier {{arrival of}} males on the breeding grounds) prevails over <b>protogyny</b> (females preceding males). In theory, {{sex differences in}} timing of arrival should be driven by the operational sex ratio, shifting toward <b>protogyny</b> in female-biased populations. However, empirical support for this hypothesis is, to date, lacking. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed arrival data from three populations of the long-distance migratory south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki). These populations differed in their operational sex ratio caused by the unidirectional hybridization of male south polar skuas with female brown skuas (Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi). We found that arrival times were protandrous in allopatry, shifting toward <b>protogyny</b> in female-biased populations when breeding in sympatry. This unique observation is consistent with theoretical predictions that sex-specific arrival times should be influenced by sex ratio and that <b>protogyny</b> should be observed in populations with female-biased operational sex ratio...|$|E

In contrast, stigmas of highly susceptible hybrids remained receptive for up to 6 d, when an aging constriction occurred, located similarly at the pollination-induced abscission site.

40|$|Existing models {{explaining}} {{the evolution of}} sexual dimorphism in the timing of emergence (SDT) in Lepidoptera assume equal mortality rates for males and females. The limiting as-sumption of equal mortality rates has the consequence that these models are only able to explain the evolution of emergence of males before females, i. e. protandry—the more com-mon temporal sequence of emergence in Lepidoptera. The models fail, however, in provid-ing adaptive explanations {{for the evolution of}} <b>protogyny,</b> where females emerge before males, but <b>protogyny</b> is not rare in insects. The assumption of equal mortality rates seems too restrictive for many insects, such as butterflies. To investigate the influence of unequal mortality rates on the evolution of SDT, we present a generalised version of a previously published model where we relax this assumption.

40|$|The {{ability of}} larger males to control {{resources}} and monopolise spawnings {{is thought to}} explain the benefits of <b>protogyny</b> in some animals. Here we describe the breeding and non-breeding social organisations of a temperate protogynous goby, Coryphopterus nicholsii, {{in the light of}} this prediction. Our results confirm that C. nicholsii has a stable social organisation, based on the year-round defence of a territory by both females and males. As predicted, larger individuals of both sexes were more likely to defend territories than smaller ones. These territories always included one or more shelter rocks, which were used as refuges by both sexes throughout the year, and also as nest sites by males in the breeding season. We then use experimental manipulation of shelter rock availability to examine the influence of intraspecific competition on territory establishment by smaller males. Following the removal of resident, non-nesting males, territories were quickly taken over. In addition, artificial reefs and nest sites were quickly colonised. Therefore, it appears that suitable shelter rocks are limited. Furthermore, intraspecific competition is strongly size-specific in C. nicholsii and determines which individuals gain access to shelter rocks. The presence of these social conditions is consistent with the prediction that the ability of larger males to monopolise more than one mate affects the occurrence of <b>protogyny</b> in some animals, and may clarify the occurrence of <b>protogyny</b> in C. nicholsii...|$|E
40|$|Apiaceae {{subfamily}} Apioideae is characterised by intra- and interfloral dichogamy. There are {{two distinct}} patterns: multicycle protandry and multicycle <b>protogyny.</b> <b>Protogyny</b> is almost completely restricted to New World genera. We determined {{the form of}} floral dichogamy for 198 species representing 36 of the 49 genera of Apioideae native to North America north of Mexico. We also examined variation in sex expression (proportions of perfect and staminate flowers) within and among plants in populations of 16 species. The form of dichogamy was constant among congeners, {{with the exception of}} a few adichogamous selfers. The 17 protandrous genera included 11 native to both the Old and New Worlds and six endemic to the Americas. The protandrous genera were characterised by white flowers, the presence of stylopodia, decreasing proportions of staminate flowers in sequentially blooming umbels, wetter habitats, later flowering times, and eastern or transcontinental distributions. The 19 protogynous genera were all New World endemics characterised by mostly yellow or purple flowers, the absence of stylopodia, increasing proportions of staminate flowers in sequentially blooming umbels, drier habitats, earlier flowering times, and western distributions. The transition from protandry to <b>protogyny</b> probably occurred in the late Pliocene, coincident with adaptation to newly forming dry grassland and cold desert habitats. The evolutionary forces involved may have included selection for reproductive assurance, pollinator specialisation, or both.

40|$|Dichogamy, the {{temporal}} separation {{of male and}} female function, is widespread among angiosperms, yet its causes and consequences are not well understood. Two forms of dichogamy exist: protandry, in which pollen dispersal precedes stigma receptivity, and <b>protogyny,</b> in which the reverse occurs. Species-level comparative studies show that protandrous species tend to be pollinated by bees or flies, whereas protogynous species tend to be windor beetle-pollinated. This suggests a functional role for pollinators in the evolution of dichogamy. We mapped dichogamy and pollination characters onto a phylogeny of angiosperm species. Using the program Discrete, two models of evolutionary change (one allowing only for independent evolution and the other allowing correlated evolution of the two traits) were fit to the phylogeny to test for correlations. Log-likelihood ratio tests and Monte Carlo simulations support a correlated model for the evolution of the type of dichogamy and the form of pollination, demonstrating that the previously reported correlations are robust to phylogenetic correction. However, pollination mode was not found to affect transitions between protandry and <b>protogyny.</b> Rather, an examination of transition rates revealed that the rate of transitions between biotic and abiotic pollination depends on whether a species is protandrous or protogynous. Additionally, we found more support for a role of pollination in the evolution of <b>protogyny</b> from non-protogyny than in the evolution of protandry from non-protandry.

We investigated whether monoecy and <b>protogyny</b> limit self-pollination in seven Carex species. • We conducted field experiments comparing stigmatic pollen loads and seed set between intact and emasculated stems. We tested for self-compatibility and evaluated pollen limitation of seed set by supplemental pollination. Finally, we measured outcrossing rates in open-pollinated and emasculated stems using allozyme markers. • Emasculated stems captured significantly less pollen than open-pollinated stems and set less seed. Pollen deposition during the female-only phase for intact stems was only 12 % of the total captured. Outcrossing rates for three species indicated high selfing (range t = 0. 03 – 0. 39). Allozyme loci in the remaining species were monomorphic also suggesting high selfing. These results demon...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Reproductive {{biology and}} {{pollination}} of the fanwort, Cabomba aquatica Aubl., were studied in populations from dams located in Dois Irmãos State Park, Recife, Pernambuco state, northeastern Brazil. Flower anthesis in this species is diurnal and lasts two days. The flowers are bisexual and exhibit herkogamy and incomplete <b>protogyny.</b> Each flower produces {{an average of}} 2. 1 ± 94. 8 pollen grains, with a P/O ratio of 1. 055 and high pollen viability (99. 7 %). This species is self-compatible, but requires biotic vectors to transfer pollen. We observed visits of bees (Apidae and Halictidae), wasps (Vespidae) and flies (Diptera) to the flowers. Bees and wasps {{were considered to be}} effective pollinators, both due to their behavior and their high frequency of visits to flowers, whereas flies were considered to be occasional pollinators. The floral mechanism (herkogamy and <b>protogyny),</b> together with low nectar production and pollinator behavior during visits, may contribute to increase pollen flow between individuals...|$|E
40|$|Sequentially {{hermaphroditic}} fish change sex from male {{to female}} (protandry) {{or vice versa}} (<b>protogyny),</b> increasing their fitness by becoming highly fecund females or large dominant males, respectively. These life-history strategies present different social organizations and reproductive modes, from near-random mating in protandry, to aggregate- and harem-spawning in <b>protogyny.</b> Using a combination of theoretical and molecular approaches, we compared variance in reproductive success (Vk*) and effective population sizes (Ne) in several species of sex-changing fish. We observed that, regardless of the direction of sex change, individuals conform to the same overall strategy, producing more offspring and exhibiting greater Vk* in the second sex. However, protogynous species show greater Vk*, especially pronounced in haremic species, resulting in an overall reduction of Ne compared to protandrous species. Collectively and independently, our results demonstrate that the direction of sex change is a pivotal variable in predicting demographic changes and resilience in sex-changing fish, many of which sustain highly valued and vulnerable fisheries worldwide...|$|E
