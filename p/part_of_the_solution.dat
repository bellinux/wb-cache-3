Concerned about mounting assimilation among young Jews, {{he was convinced that}} Aliyah offered <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution.</b> Yet he found Tel Aviv lacking in social and cultural frameworks for young English-speaking adults who took this step. To address this lacuna and further his idea of modern-day Zionist pioneering in Israel, he launched a series of social entrepreneurial initiatives focusing on the Tel Aviv area. The Am Yisrael Foundation as the umbrella organization under which these programs operate was formally established in 2013 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.|$|E
25|$|However, {{things are}} not quite that simple. The zero-point energy cannot be {{eliminated}} by dropping its energy from the Hamiltonian: When we do this and solve the Heisenberg equation for a field operator, we must include the vacuum field, which is the homogeneous <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> for the field operator. In fact we can show that the vacuum field {{is essential for the}} preservation of the commutators and the formal consistent of QED. When we calculate the field energy we obtain not only a contribution from particles and forces that may be present but also a contribution from the vacuum field itself i.e. the zero-point field energy. In other words, the zero-point energy reappears even though we may have deleted it from the Hamiltonian.|$|E
25|$|Different {{choices for}} the frame of {{reference}} and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the non-linear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and independent variables, by taking the velocity potential and stream function as the independent variables, and the coordinates (x,z) as the dependent variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. moving with the phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free surface location is known beforehand, and not an unknown <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution.</b> The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased series expansion reduces.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, higher {{incentives}} for farmers to grow non-food biofuel crops {{combined with other}} factors, such as over development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, climate change, growing consumer demand in China and India, and population growth, caused food shortages in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico, as well as rising food prices around the globe. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. Some of these shortages resulted in food riots and even deadly stampedes. The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> to concerns about food prices and overall food security. They in part base this {{on the experience of}} Vietnam, which went from a food importer to large food exporter and saw a significant drop in poverty, due mainly to the development of smallholder agriculture in the country.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining a {{comfortable}} temperature inside {{such a large}} glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely {{on the fact that}} they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions - they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function - the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors {{at the end of each}} day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Path {{dependent}} and time-dependent constitutive models and experience with their use for numerical simulation of field performance {{of concrete and}} rockfill dams are described in the paper. For <b>the</b> mechanical <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solutions,</b> a combined model using path dependent incrementaly-linear elasticity in the pre-peak regime and theory <b>of</b> plasticity in <b>the</b> peak regime is applied. Using proper switch functions and path dependent relations for calculating tangent values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional deformational characteristics, <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> double hardening elastic-plastic models is approximated. For <b>the</b> time dependent <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solutions,</b> <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> multiface viscoplasticity with two and three viscoplastic surfaces is applied. The two-surface model allowed simulating the observed viscoplastic flow of weak marly shale in foundation of a concrete dam displaying unusual behaviour. Viscoplastic flow with three surfaces was successfully applied for modelling long-term creep of rockfill. This model and its application for Sance Rockfill Dam are described in more detail. ...|$|R

500|$|In his conclusion, Smith states {{his belief}} that modern {{politicians}} and military leaders use force where it has no utility and commit military forces without fully defined political and strategic objectives. He believes that politicians and generals remain in the mindset of industrial war, which leads them {{to prepare for a}} decisive confrontation that never happens, and he condemns them for failing to recognise the shift in the way wars are fought. Discussing humanitarian interventions, such as those in the Balkans, Smith does not argue against intervention, but believes that the intervention must be based on a full understanding of the conflict and a clear strategy with defined objectives. According to Smith, [...] "no act of force will ever be decisive" [...] because the aim of modern conflicts is to win the will of the people, which will not be achieved by battlefield victory alone. He argues that whereas, in the industrial war paradigm, war led to victory and thus to peace, in the modern paradigm confrontation leads to conflict, which then reverts to confrontation. He asserts that force is only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> to modern conflicts; they require complex political and military solutions, which will subdue but not necessarily permanently end the conflict.|$|E
500|$|Smith's thesis, and {{the central}} theme of The Utility of Force, {{is that the world}} entered a new {{paradigm}} of conflict {{at the end of the}} 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries, which he calls [...] "war amongst the people", and that Western, industrialised armies are ill-suited to the new style of warfare. The defining characteristics of [...] "war amongst the people" [...] are that conflicts tend to be timeless, more political in nature, and fought between parties that are part of, and in amongst, the civilian population rather than between uniformed armies on a battlefield. To prove his theory, Smith provides a detailed history starting with Napoleon, who invented what Smith calls [...] "industrial warfare"—the paradigm in which the entire resources of the nation were mustered and which culminated in the two world wars. In the second half of the book, Smith states that the advent of nuclear weapons rendered industrial warfare obsolete, but that Western governments and generals refused to acknowledge the new paradigm, which led to several significant defeats in the second half of the 20th century. He provides six themes which characterise modern conflicts and proceeds to analyse each in detail, before dedicating his final chapter to his reflections on his command in Bosnia. He concedes that he did not foresee the Srebenica massacre, but criticises UNPROFOR, believing that it was not in a position to act even had the massacre been foreseen and that it had no strategy for effectively intervening in the war. In his conclusion, Smith argues that military force is only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> in modern conflicts, and that it must be combined with political initiatives which together will subdue but not necessarily end the conflict.|$|E
