500|$|Hudner {{said he was}} {{occasionally}} {{criticized for}} his actions, and [...] "about 90" [...] <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him he acted recklessly. His commanders noted his actions may have endangered the helicopter pilot and sacrificed an aircraft, criticisms Hudner later said did not make him regret his decision, as {{he felt it was}} a spur of the moment action. Still, commanders later issued orders forbidding pilots from crash-landing in a similar way to try to save downed wingmen. On later reflection, Hudner indicated he did not consider himself a hero for his actions.|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|Desiring a {{realistic}} depiction of vulpine behavior and habits, Mannix {{spent more than}} a year studying the behaviors of a mated pair of foxes that he kept at his home. He stated that they were [...] "so tame [...] could turn them loose and watch them hunt, fight, make love, and live an almost normal life." [...] Additionally, he studied wild foxes and interviewed trappers, hunters, game wardens, and [...] "Masters of Hounds" [...] to learn what they felt foxes would and would not do. In the novel's postscript, Mannix discusses this research. [...] To defend his novel against charges of improbability, he recounts his observations of wild foxes and discusses other people's stories about fox behavior. Regarding the actions Tod takes in eluding the hunters, he details both witnessing wild foxes performing such acts and stories others shared with him that he used as a basis for some of the story's events. For example, he notes that while <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that foxes do not really run among sheep or cattle herds to escape hounds, he himself used to watch them do just that from his bedroom window. In the case of a fox running along train tracks as a train is approaching, Mannix drew on a story told to him by a master of hunting in the area of Whitford Sales—near Thorndale, Pennsylvania—who had to stop hunting in the area because of a fox who consistently killed pursuing hounds on the Trenton Cutoff using this method.|$|E

5000|$|The Def Leppard song [...] "Man Enough" [...] {{from their}} 2015 self-titled album {{features}} a bass line similar to [...] "Another One Bites the Dust," [...] with guitarist Phil Collen explaining that <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him {{about how their}} song reminded them of the Queen song.|$|R

2500|$|Voter {{turnout in}} the eastern city of Jalalabad was low at no more than 20–30%, {{according}} to election observer Tim Fairbank: [...] "A lot of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> us they were afraid to vote, and afraid to have their fingers dipped in ink because of the Taliban's threats." [...] The government, on the other hand, was expected to claim {{that it was more}} like 60% in the area.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, Ford {{promised to}} release a [...] "real {{comeback}} album" [...] {{later in the year}} with drummer Chuck Spradlin, saying that 2009's nu metal-inspired Wicked Wonderland, {{was too much of a}} collective project with ex-husband Jim Gillette. [...] "A lot of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me that they want a real Lita Ford album, and I know what they mean. They are going to get it", she was quoted as saying at the time.|$|E

These included Thomas Massari, {{who founded the}} Seth-Hermes Foundation {{and said he had}} channeled Seth as early as 1972, and Jean Loomis, director of the Aquarian Center in Connecticut and others to date. [...] However, in the introduction to the first book written about Seth, Seth is said to have conveyed that [...] "communications will come exclusively through Ruburt [...] at all times, to protect the integrity of the material". In The Seth Material, Jane Roberts wrote: [...] "Several <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me that Seth communicated with them through automatic writing, but Seth denies any such contacts." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 5, 2006, O'Donnell used {{a series}} of ching chongs to imitate newscasters in China. Vanessa Hua of the San Francisco Chronicle {{expressed}} disappointment in O'Donnell, given the comedian's championing of LGBT rights. On December 14, O'Donnell apologized to those she offended, explaining that [...] "Some <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me it's {{as bad as the}} n-word. I was like, really? I didn't know that." [...] O'Donnell warned that [...] "there's a good chance I'll do something like that again, probably in the next week, not on purpose. Only 'cause it's how my brain works."

60|$|There {{was another}} silence, this time longer than before. Lady Deringham was thinking. Once more, then, {{the man had}} lied to her! He was on some secret {{business}} of his own. She shuddered slightly. She had no curiosity as to its nature. Only she remembered what many <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her, that where he went disaster followed. A piece of coal fell into the grate hissing from the fire. He stooped to pick it up, and catching {{a glimpse of her}} face became instantly graver. He remembered that as yet he had heard nothing of what she had come to tell him. Her presence in the library was altogether unexplained.|$|R

60|$|I {{made up my}} mind {{to amuse}} myself now. I was sick of being grave and serious. When one thinks how short a while youth lasts it is foolish not to take the best {{advantage}} of it; the time man has at his disposal is not long enough for tragedy and moaning; he has only room for a little laughter, and then his hair gets grey and his knees shaky, and he is left repenting that he did not make more of his opportunities. So many <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me that they have never regretted their vices, but often their virtues! Life is too short to take things seriously. Let us eat, drink and be merry, for to-morrow we die.|$|E
60|$|Lady Gregory {{has just}} given me her {{beautiful}} Poets and Dreamers, {{and it has}} brought to mind a day {{two or three years}} ago when I stood on the side of Slieve Echtge, looking out over Galway. The Burren Hills were to my left, and though I forget whether I could see the cairn over Bald Conan of the Fianna, I could certainly see many places there that are in poems and stories. In front of me, over many miles of level Galway plains, I saw a low blue hill flooded with evening light. I asked a countryman who was with me what hill that was, and he told me it was Cruachmaa of the Sidhe. I had often heard of Cruachmaa of the Sidhe even as far north as Sligo, for the country <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me a great many stories of the great host of the Sidhe who live there, still fighting and holding festivals.|$|E
