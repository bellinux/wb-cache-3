40|$|In this thesis, the {{potential}} of the gap discharge transducer is investigated as transducers in a time-of-flight gas flow measurement setup designed for harsh environments. In this thesis the gap discharge transducer is operated in two different modes, named spark discharge transducer and glow discharge transducer. The spark discharge transducer generates a spark over a gap while the glow discharge transducer generates a continuous glow discharge. Earlier studies show that the spark discharge transducer is very durable and a potent sound <b>pulse</b> <b>emitter.</b> This thesis continues these studies by incorporating the spark discharge transducer into a flow measurement system as a sound <b>pulse</b> <b>emitter.</b> Further more, the gap discharge transducer is investigated as a potential sound pulse receiver. As an emitter in a flow measurement system the spark discharge transducer was placed in a pipe with a variable flow in a laboratory environment. The transducer was set to generate sparks to create the sound pulse and standard piezoelectric receivers were used to capture the signal. As a receiver, the gap discharge transducer was tested in two experiments. In the first experiment the spark discharge transducer was placed in a vacuum chamber to test the dependence between breakdown voltage and pressure. The pressure change from a sound pulse might cause breakdown in the gap of the transducer if an initial voltage between the electrodes is set close enough to breakdown. The breakdown leads to a spark which can be used to determine when a sound pulse arrives. In the second experiment the transducer was set to generate a glow discharge. The glow discharge was then subjected to a sound source. The voltage and current of the glow discharge depends on the environmental conditions in the gap. Pressure changes from a sound pulse will then affect the air in the gap which in turn changes the voltage and current characteristics of the discharge. The change in voltage and/or current can then be used to determine when a sound pulse has arrived. The investigation shows that the spark discharge transducer is a potential sound <b>pulse</b> <b>emitter</b> in a flow measurement system and could be capable of determining a flow quite accurately. As a receiver, the spark discharge transducer show limited potential. The pressure change of a spark generated sound pulse requires the receiver to be set very close to the breakdown voltage. But that close to the determined breakdown voltage will very often cause the gap to breakdown spontaneously. The glow discharge transducer, on the other hand, show promising potential. The transducer is proven to be able to receive sound waves and has a sensitivity that is deemed compatible with the spark discharge transducer as a sound <b>pulse</b> <b>emitter.</b> Godkänd; 2014; 20140917 (krikar); Nedanstående person kommer att disputera för avläggande av teknologie doktorsexamen.

40|$|Laser {{altimetry}} {{provides an}} active, high-resolution, high-accuracy method for measurement of planetary and asteroid surface topography. The {{basis of the}} measurement is {{the timing of the}} roundtrip propagation of short-duration pulses of laser radiation between a spacecraft and the surface. Vertical, or elevation, resolution of the altimetry measurement is determined primarily by laser pulse width, surface-induced spreading in time of the reflected pulse, and the timing precision of the altimeter electronics. With conventional gain-switched pulses from solid-state lasers and nanosecond resolution timing electronics, submeter vertical range resolution is possible anywhere from orbital altitudes of approximately 1 km to altitudes of several hundred kilometers. Horizontal resolution is a function of laser beam footprint size at the surface and the spacing between successive laser pulses. Laser divergence angle and altimeter platform height above the surface determine the laser footprint size at the surface, while laser pulse repetition rate, laser transmitter beam configuration, and altimeter platform velocity determine the spacing between successive laser pulses. Multiple laser transmitters in a single laser altimeter instrument that is orbiting above a planetary or asteroid surface could provide across-track as well as along-track coverage {{that can be used to}} construct a range image (i. e., topographic map) of the surface.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{potential}} of the gap discharge transducer is investigated as both a sound <b>pulse</b> <b>emitter</b> and a sound pulse receiver in a gas flow measurement setup. The main objective is to use the gap discharge transducer as an integral part in a gas flow measurement system developed for harsh environments. The idea for the method considered in this study to determine the flow was taken from the time-of-flight technique used in ultrasonic flow measurements. The gap discharge transducer should then be used as both an emitter and a receiver in a setup that somewhat mimics those in ultrasonics. Earlier studies with the gap discharge transducer has shown that it is both very durable and a potent sound <b>pulse</b> <b>emitter.</b> This thesis continues these studies by incorporating the transducer into a measurement system as an emitter and also investigates its capabilities {{to be used as a}} sound pulse receiver. As an emitter in a flow measurement system the transducer was placed in a pipe with a variable flow in a laboratory environment. The transducer was set to generate sparks to create the sound pulse and standard piezoelectric receivers were used to capture the signal. To determine the possibilities to use the transducer as a receiver the transducer was placed in a vacuum chamber to test the dependence between breakdown voltage and pressure. Since a sound pulse is a change in pressure the pulse might cause breakdown in the gap between the electrodes of the transducer if an initial voltage between the electrodes is set close enough to breakdown. The investigation shows that the gap discharge transducer is a potential sound <b>pulse</b> <b>emitter</b> in a flow measurement system and, with some small calibration and more precise alignment, is capable to determine the flow quite accurately. On the other hand, to use the transducer as a receiver is concluded to be very difficult. The breakdown voltage is too unstable to allow an initial voltage close to breakdown to be set without risking spontaneous breakdown due to random events.

We explore the evolution of magnetic inclination angle with period and spin-down power, finding possible correlations. While the presence of significant off-peak emission can often be used as a discriminator between outer gap and slot gap models, a hybrid model may be needed.

40|$|A {{neural network}} {{recognition}} and tracking system is proposed for classification of radar pulses in autonomous Electronic Support Measure systems. Radar type information {{is combined with}} position-specific information from active emitters in a scene. Type-specific parameters of the input pulse stream are fed to a neural network classifier trained on samples of data collected in the field. Meanwhile, a clustering algorithm is used to separate <b>pulses</b> from different <b>emitters</b> according to position-specific parameters of the input pulse stream. Classifier responses corresponding to different emitters are separated into tracks, or trajectories, one per active emitter, allowing for more accurate identification of radar types based on multiple views of emitter data along each emitter trajectory. Such a What-and-Where fusion strategy is motivated by a similar subdivision of labor in the brain. The fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to classify streams of pulses according to radar type using their functional parameters. Simulation results obtained with a radar pulse data set indicate that fuzzy AIUMAP compares favorably to several other approaches when performance is {{measured in terms of}} accuracy and computational complexity. Incorporation into fuzzy ARTMAP of negative match tracking (from ARTMAP-IC) facilitated convergence during training with this data set. Other modifications improved classification of data that include missing input pattern components and missing training classes. Fuzzy ARTMAP was combined with a bank of Kalman filters to group pulses transmitted from different emitters based on their position-specific parameters, and with a module to accumulate evidence from fuzzy ARTMAP responses corresponding to the track defined for each emitter. Simulation results demonstrate that the system provides a high level of performance on complex, incomplete and overlapping radar data.
