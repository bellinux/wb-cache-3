5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Georgia Tech facing first down, in {{possession}} of the ball at the Clemson 18-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Dwyer gained 10 yards and a first down with a running <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Clemson eight-yard line. Three plays later, Dwyer completed the Yellow Jackets' scoring drive with a run into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Georgia Tech its first lead of the game, 10–7, with 13:30 remaining.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|After Brantinghame Hall closed, {{he again}} played Chrysos in {{a revival of}} Pygmalion and Galatea at the Lyceum Theatre and played Mr Barnes in his own <b>play,</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> Death, at the Olympic Theatre. He then {{appeared}} at the Comedy Theatre under Charles Hawtrey in Pickwick (1889), a successful one-act musical play by F. C. Burnand and Edward Solomon based on an episode in The Pickwick Papers, which Barrington ended up directing and in which he alternated in the roles of Pickwick and Baker. Barrington then created the role of Lt. Col. Cadbury in a Grundy farce called Merry Margate and next played Tosser in a comic opera by Solomon and George P. Hawtrey called Penelope, in which he co-starred with Dan Leno. He also played {{a number of other}} roles in other theatres throughout 1889 until he rejoined D'Oyly Carte to create the role of Giuseppe in The Gondoliers in December 1889, remaining for the long run of that last Gilbert and Sullivan hit.|$|E

5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as {{the companion}} <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute {{to avoid having to}} marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.|$|E
5|$|In the 2002–03 season, Baroš scored {{twice on}} his Premiership debut away to Bolton Wanderers on 14 September 2002, as Liverpool won 32 away. Baroš was a {{substitute}} in the 2003 Football League Cup Final against Manchester United. He entered {{the game in}} the second half, but did not <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the game, being substituted himself a minute {{before the end of the}} game. Liverpool won the game 2–0 to win the cup, the first major trophy of Baroš' career. Towards the end of the season, he scored twice in a 6–0 away win over already-relegated West Bromwich Albion in April 2003. He ended his first season in the Premiership with 12 goals for the club.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play after the interception, Pegues gained one yard on a rushing <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. Clark then {{completed}} a pass to Jarrett Ferguson at the Alabama 36-yard line for a first down. During the play, Alabama was called for a five-yard penalty for grabbing Ferguson's facemask during the tackle. After the penalty, Angelo Harrison gained nine yards on a reverse run. Ferguson then was tackled for a loss of two yards, and Clark threw an incomplete pass on third down. Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent in Graham to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick sailed right of the goal, however. With 4:10 remaining in the first quarter, Tech led Alabama 70.|$|E

5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Alabama 16-yard line by Milons. The first play of the drive was a 12-yard run by Alexander, who also gained a first down. On the next play, Alabama committed a five-yard false start penalty. Alexander was stopped for no gain on a running play after the penalty, then he picked up nine yards on a running <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. On third down, Alexander gained a first down with a run to the 40-yard line. He then was tackled for a two-yard loss. On the next play, Zow was tackled by Jason Buckland for a seven-yard loss. On third down, Alexander ran ahead to the 44-yard line but still was short of the first down marker. Alabama punted, and the kick was downed at the Tech 20-yard line.|$|E
5|$|The city {{immediately}} sued {{to prevent}} the move, {{on the basis that}} the lease of the stadium was active until 1998. Fans were in an uproar, staging protests, signing petitions, filing lawsuits and appealing to other NFL owners to block the relocation. Advertisers pulled out of the stadium, fearing fans' ire. Talks between the city, Modell and the NFL continued as the Browns finished the season with a 5–11 record. At the team's final home game against the Bengals, unruly fans in the Dawg Pound bleachers section rained debris, beer bottles and entire sections of seats onto the field, forcing officials to move <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite end to ensure players' safety. Cleveland won the game, its only victory after the announcement of the move.|$|E
5|$|The premiere {{took place}} at the EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts in Calgary in February 2011.

Four days after the premiere, Burnt Thicket Theatre moved the <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer, where the play was scheduled to be performed until March 12. All the performances in Red Deer were sold out. The play drew emotional reactions from the audience. Kooman learned that some audience members at the initial performances later responded to the play by talking with others about human trafficking, writing letters to their Members of Parliament, and doing other creative things on the subject. They also contacted Waldschmidt, sometimes up to a year later, with stories about how the play had continued to affect their lives. In conjunction with the initial run of She Has a Name, Burnt Thicket Theatre provided the names of organizations that assist human-trafficking victims. There was also a panel discussion about human trafficking after the matinée on February 26.|$|E

He credited The Problem Solverz as the first seamless use of Flash for television animation, with conceptualization and the end result occurring in the same program. Writing was the longest aspect of production, taking up to several months for the crew to conceive the story and draft a script. Animation was comparatively quicker, with the team delivering work in only a few weeks given the digital approach; Jones felt that the animators could to <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strengths of the fully digital animation process.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{stressed}} {{that he intended}} to bring a better style of <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team in the coming season but admitted that players would have to be sold to balance the books. Deals were already in place to sell Jamie Ward to Derby County for an undisclosed fee, and sign Danny Philliskirk from Chelsea on a free transfer, but Wilson also added to the squad in June by signing Lecsinel Jean-François from his former club Swindon Town, also on a free transfer. After much speculation, and with the players about to return for pre-season training, Darius Henderson was sold to Millwall for an undisclosed fee in order to free up money on the wage bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} {{internal}} structure of Peking-opera plays is highly variable. Prior to 1949, zhezixi, short plays or plays {{made up of}} short scenes from longer plays, were often performed. These plays usually center on one simple situation or feature a selection of scenes designed to include {{all four of the}} main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers. This format has become less prevalent in recent times, but plays of one act are still performed. These short works, as well as individual scenes within longer works, are marked by an emotional progression {{from the beginning of the}} <b>play</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end. For example, the concubine in the one act play The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated begins in a state of joy, and then moves to anger and jealousy, drunken playfulness, and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation. A full-length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes. The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes. Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes, or scenes involve protagonists and antagonists. There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression. It is these scenes that are usually excerpted for later zhezixi productions. Some of the most complex plays may even have an emotional progression from scene to scene.|$|E
