40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} {{migration}} investigations with different spiked <b>and</b> non-spiked <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> board packaging {{materials in contact}} with foodstuffs and food simulants in the temperature range between - 18 °C and 40 °C were carried out. The aim was to deepen {{the understanding of the}} migration behaviour of target substances in <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> board fibres. Components <b>and</b> contaminants of <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> board with different molecular weight and chemical structure were selected as target migrants. From the kinetic migration studies diffusion and partition coefficients were derived by using a software for modelling migration in multilayer materials. On the basis of these results {{for the first time a}} model for the migration from <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> board into foods and simulants was developed by adapting the validated diffusion model for plastics. In contrast to the migration in plastic materials, where the migrants are solved and homogenously distributed in the polymer matrix, mass transfer in <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> board is a more complex phenomenon, because the migrants can be adsorbed on the cellulose surface with different strength. The most important finding of the study was that for a correct modelling of the experimental results in many cases <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> board must be regarded as a 2 -layer system: the main mass of <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> board (B 1) defines the core layer with high diffusion rates and a thin second layer (B 2) represents the surface region of the <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> board with decreased diffusion rates due to the slow desorption...|$|R
