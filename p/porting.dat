40|$|This study aims to (1) to {{investigate}} {{what are the}} main factors for evaluation of <b>port</b> competitiveness through an analysis of previous literature review; (2) to compare <b>port</b> competitiveness among a sample of <b>ports</b> in Korea and China using TOPSIS; (3) to determine ways to improve <b>port</b> competitiveness in Korea and particularly for Busan <b>port.</b> After selecting the related criteria on <b>port</b> competitiveness for the analysis, the main relevant criteria are divided into three major categories: <b>port</b> throughput, physical and financial criteria in Korean and Chinese <b>ports.</b> The empirical results indicate that Shanghai, Shenzhen and Busan <b>port</b> are the first three competitive <b>ports.</b> Shanghai <b>port</b> ranked near the top <b>port</b> in this analysis, it ranked fist <b>port</b> in <b>port</b> throughput and <b>port</b> financial category (ranked third <b>port</b> in <b>port</b> physical category), Shenzhen <b>port</b> ranked second <b>port</b> in <b>port</b> physical and <b>port</b> financial category (ranked third <b>port</b> in <b>port</b> throughput category), Busan <b>port</b> ranked first <b>port</b> in <b>port</b> physical category, and Ningbo <b>port</b> ranked third <b>port</b> in <b>port</b> throughput and <b>port</b> financial category in this analysis.

30|$|As {{discussed}} in Section 1, {{we know that}} well-known <b>Ports,</b> which range between 0 to 1023, and are closely bound to some specific services.

5|$|The {{size of the}} {{development}} team and the complexity of <b>porting</b> the whole browser to a new backend caused Epiphany to re-release version 2.22 with bugfixes instead of the actual development code, so browser development remained stagnant until , when the project team announced that Epiphany 2.26 would be the final Gecko-based version. Eventually, in September 2009 the Webkit-powered Epiphany 2.28 was released, as part of GNOME 2.28.|$|E
5|$|After {{experimenting with}} <b>porting</b> the {{original}} The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy Color, the Flagship team, supervised by Yoshiki Okamoto, began developing three interconnected Zelda games {{that could be}} played in any order. The complexity of this system led the team to cancel one game. Both Seasons and Ages were a critical success, and together sold eight million units. Critics complimented the gameplay, colorful designs and graphic quality, but criticized the inconsistent sound quality.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its limited}} release, English-language copies of Panzer Dragoon Saga are rare and sell for high prices. It {{has not been}} re-released. In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it a priority. In the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make <b>porting</b> the game difficult.|$|E

5|$|During the 2015 Build keynote, Microsoft {{announced}} a Universal Windows Platform bridge {{that would allow}} Android and iOS software to be ported to Windows 10 Mobile and published to the Windows Store. In August 2015, A version of the Microsoft Android bridge toolset {{was reported to be}} leaked and available on the internet along with its documentation. The leaked toolset required developers to register and use the WNS to send notification data to ported applications, and would not allow for Google Cloud Messaging to be used instead. Microsoft later discontinued the Android bridge project in favor of continuing support for iOS application <b>porting</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Sunsoft {{obtained}} the license {{for it and}} re-released it along with the Final Fantasy Legend games. This version was advertised as having Game Boy Color support, although the release was not enhanced in any way.

GamesRadar listed Final Fantasy Adventure {{as one of the}} titles they want in the 3DS Virtual Console.|$|E

In April 2011, Mobile 1UP has released a re-worked version of the work done in 2010 with a prehistoric setting (new artwork, sfx, music, levels) under the name Caveman, available for the iOS and webOS platforms. Brutal Deluxe, the developer who did the <b>porting</b> of the Apple IIgs version of Lemmings, has released the games' source code.|$|E

5|$|<b>Porting</b> Final Fantasy XI to the Xbox proved {{difficult}} due to compatibility issues {{greater than}} was hoped for between Xbox Live and PlayOnline, likely because {{the latter was}} designed first. After negotiation, Xbox 360 players were able {{to play the game}} through PlayOnline's servers exclusively, despite Microsoft's initial wish that Square Enix would use its own platform. Downloadable content was also not available on the platform since the game played through PlayOnline. It was hoped that content would eventually be offered through the Xbox Live Marketplace. Final Fantasy XII started out as a game designed for the PlayOnline game platform.|$|E
5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos MontrÃ©al by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the <b>porting</b> was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves <b>porting</b> titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} at Bell Labs before {{the rise of}} the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 computer. As a part of <b>porting</b> the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to take full}} {{advantage}} of the hardware, without the imposition of <b>porting</b> to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture so easy to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began <b>porting</b> {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E
