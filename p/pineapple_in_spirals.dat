50|$|Charles Purdon (18 March 1838 - 22 July 1926) {{planted the}} first <b>pineapples</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern Cape of South Africa in 1865, {{which led to}} the {{commercial}} <b>pineapple</b> industry <b>in</b> the country.|$|R
40|$|I grew up eating <b>pineapples</b> <b>in</b> {{everything}}; well, {{nearly everything}} (let 2 ̆ 7 s not exaggerate). They were a sweetener, made things juicy. Pineapple jam, <b>pineapple</b> breadcrumbs stuffed <b>in</b> the chicken roast for Sunday lunch after church, pineapple on the barbeque for the Christian folk my parents (MotherJoy and Onward) invited home, crushed <b>pineapple</b> <b>in</b> the punch, <b>pineapple</b> <b>in</b> the boiled fruitcake, <b>pineapple</b> <b>in</b> sandwiches as a treat {{through the summer}} holidays, <b>pineapple</b> <b>in</b> the curried rice salad for days my mother felt adventurous. We ate from pineapples too. Imagine then refined white sugar being spooned out of a fancy pineapple canister with its spiky pineapple top of a lid. Milk pouring out of a matching pineapple jug, part of a set. Salad out of large wooden bowls {{in the shape of}} half pineapples. And we ate off flat yellow pineapple dinner plates, helped ourselves to butter cake and sponge rolls on Sundays for tea off glass pineapple platters. People thought us quirky, we laughed them off. In the Solider family, this attachment to the fruit of the land was our way of stitching ourselves in place, saying we belonged. And in sub-tropical Queensland, the pointy state of Australia, what a surfeit...|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the series, the {{officials}} released a short video, explaining the running mystery of the <b>pineapple</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Pineapple</b> Incident (season 1, episode 10).

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to seek a better knowledge and greater understanding of the factors associated with successful <b>pineapple</b> farming <b>in</b> the Eastern Cape Region of the Union of South Africa. As no previous · investigation equally representative of commercial <b>pineapple</b> farming patterns <b>in</b> the Eastern Cape has been made, this study can be regarded as a pilot survey of the labour structures, rates of production, combination of enterprises; marketing channels and the suitability of various districts in the region of study for the production of <b>pineapples.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the history of the <b>pineapple</b> <b>in</b> South Africa will be traced briefly, and the position the Union holds as a supplier of pineapples on the world market, will be investigated. the importance of the Eastern Cape as a producer of <b>pineapples</b> <b>in</b> South Africa is well known, but is also unequivocally illustrated by the information in Table 1. According to estimates made by the Division of Economics and Markets for 1955 / 56 season, no less than 86. 5 percent of the total acreage planted to <b>pineapples</b> <b>in</b> South Africa, was located in this area. Bathurst, East London and Albany, three of the six districts included in the estimate, were particularly prominent. Taken together, they cultivated more than three-quarters of the total area planted to <b>pineapples</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern Cape, and nearly 70 per cent of the total for South Africa. The remaining quarter of the area cultivated in the Eastern Cape was located in the districts of Peddie, Komgha and Alexandria...|$|R

30|$|The <b>pineapple</b> {{industry}} <b>in</b> Thailand is now {{the fourth}} largest producer and exporter of <b>pineapple</b> <b>in</b> the world (Office of Agricultural Economics 2016).

Currently, Thailand has 75 pineapple processing companies that generate approximately 200 tons of waste per day (Ritthisorn et al. 2016).
