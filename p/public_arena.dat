40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{question}} of who defines the agenda of environmental concerns in Singapore. It argues that the state plays an inordinately large role in defining the agenda and implementing the solutions. Few other competing environmental agendas have been set in alternative <b>public</b> <b>arenas.</b> While this has worked generally well in Singapore, there are larger roles for environmental groups, businesses and industries, and other bodies to play. It is in the enlarged roles of these bodies that the hope for a greater democratization of <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> in Singapore lies...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} how civil society organizations (CSOs) perform and influence public arenas. The focus {{of this paper is}} the transformative scope of social innovation initiatives promoted by CSOsin two <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> in Brazil: the fight against electoral corruption and the protection of children and adolescents? rights. The research consisted of three stages: 1) controversy mapping {{to understand}} the configuration ofthese <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> and compare the trajectories of the public problems studied; 2) observation of the ?field of experience? of some CSOs that perform in these arenas; and 3) analysis of ?political grammars? produced in public arenas, connecting them to the performance of the CSOs analysed. The results reveal how social innovation emerges, develops and is disseminated in the <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> studied and highlights the similarities and differences between the two cases, discussing the practices and role of CSOs in these processes. As conclusions, the study indicates that social innovation initiatives promoted by CSOs are influenced by and {{have an effect on the}} ?political culture? in the <b>public</b> <b>arenas.</b> Additionally, this work states that the regime of CSOs? engagement in the public sphere and their performance have consequences in terms of influence on social and political changes. In the cases studied, when CSOs go beyond the logic of coproduction of public services and engage in ?public inquiry? processes, their capacity to inspire social transformation seems to be enhanced...|$|R

In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment.

5|$|The {{movement}} for indigenous {{cultural and political}} resurgence in Taiwan traces its roots to the ideals outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Although the Republic of China was a UN member and signatory to the original UN Charter, four decades of martial law controlled the discourse of culture and politics on Taiwan. The political liberalization Taiwan experienced {{leading up to the}} official end of martial law on July 15, 1987, opened a new <b>public</b> <b>arena</b> for dissenting voices and political movements against the centralized policy of the KMT.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche for those in the <b>public</b> <b>arena.</b> Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and leadership roles in political parties.|$|E

25|$|Pakistani women lack {{social value}} and status because of {{negation}} of {{their roles as}} producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male {{members of the family}} are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the <b>public</b> <b>arena,</b> while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in the <b>public</b> <b>arena.</b> This situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships.|$|E
