50|$|Due to {{progressing}} miniaturization and {{introduction of}} electronics into new areas, quality {{requirements for the}} parts are rising, and thus the quality of dispensing must be increased as well. To obtain the required quality, on one hand, the resin system has to be developed and optimized accordingly. On the other hand, the resin dispensing system has to work more and more precisely to obtain best dispensing.

50|$|Vacuum <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>casting</b> (VPC) uses {{gas pressure}} and a vacuum {{to improve the}} quality of the casting and minimize porosity. Typically VPC machines consist of an upper and a lower chamber—the upper chamber, or melting chamber, housing the crucible, and the lower casting chamber housing the investment mould. Both chambers are connected via a small hole containing a stopper. A vacuum is pulled in the lower chamber, while pressure is applied in the upper, and then the stopper is removed. This creates the greatest pressure differential to fill the molds.|$|E
50|$|Centrifugal casting, or centrifuging, {{is used as}} a {{means of}} casting small, {{detailed}} parts or jewelry. An articulated arm is free to spin around a vertical axle, which is driven by an electric motor or a spring. The entire mechanism is enclosed in a tub or drum to contain hot metal should the mold break or an excess of metal be used. Single use molds are prepared using the lost wax method. A small amount of metal in a crucible (a sort of ceramic pan) next to the mold is heated with a torch. When the metal is molten the arm is released, forcing (by centrifugal force) the metal into the mold. The high forces imposed on the metal overcome the viscosity, resulting in a finely detailed workpiece. A similar advantage may be obtained by vacuum casting or <b>pressure</b> <b>casting.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Pressure casting: Specially {{developed}} {{polymeric materials}} allow a mould {{to be subject}} to application external pressures of up to 4.0 MPa-so much higher than slip casting in plaster moulds where the capillary forces correspond to a pressure of around 0.1 - 0.2 MPa. The high pressure leads to much faster casting rates and, hence, faster production cycles. Furthermore, the application of high pressure air through the polymeric moulds upon demoulding the cast means a new casting cycle can be started immediately in the same mould, unlike plaster moulds which require lengthy drying times. The polymeric materials have much greater durability than plaster and, therefore, it is possible to achieve shaped products with better dimensional tolerances and much longer mould life. <b>Pressure</b> <b>casting</b> was developed in the 1970s for the production of sanitaryware although, more recently, it has been applied to tableware.|$|E

40|$|Das keramische Druckgussverfahren wird in der Sanitärindustrie erst seit den 1980 er Jahren {{verwendet}} und ist somit ein noch relativ junges Verfahren mit viel Optimierungspotential. Insbesondere der Füllvorgang einer Druckgussform wurde bis heute nur wenig untersucht. Die Optimierung des Füllvorgangs kann geometrischer Art sein (Design des Produktes, Eingussposition und Entlüftungsposition) oder durch die Anpassung der Prozessparameter (Formmaterial, Druck, Füllgeschwindigkeit und Temperatur) und der rheologischen Eigenschaften der keramischen Gießmasse (Viskositat, Thixotropie und Litergewicht) erfolgen. Diese Vielfalt an Parametern zur Steuerung des Druckgussprozesses sowie die Tatsache, dass experimentelle Messungen in einer Druckgussform während des Füllvorgangs so gut wie unmöglich sind, machen den Einsatz einer Computersimulation notwendig. Dies zu ermöglichen ist das Ziel dieser Arbeit. Zunächst wird ein phänomenologisches Materialmodell präsentiert, das sich zur Beschreibung des thixotropen Verhaltens von Alumosilikatsuspensionen eignet. Anschließend wird das Materialmodell in die Strömungssimulationssoftware FLOW 3 D implementiert und anhand von einfachen zweidimensionalen Geometrien sowie an einer produktionserprobten, komplexen dreidimensionalen Geometrie validiert. Das Ergebnis dieser Arbeit trägt zum besseren Verständnis des Füllvorgangs einer Druckgussform bei und stellt der Sanitärindustrie, in Kombination mit der vorhandenen praktischen Erfahrung, ein sehr wirksames Werkzeug zur Optimierung des Druckgussprozesses zur Verfügung. The <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> {{process has}} been introduced in the sanitary ware industry since the 1980 s and is therefore still a young technology with a high potential of optimization. Especially the filling of a <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> mould has been analysed poorly until today. The filling of a sanitary mould is controlled through many different parameters like geometry parameters (product design, inlet position, inlet diameter, etc), process parameters (mould material, pressure in the mould, inlet velocity, temperature, etc) and material properties of ceramic slurry (viscosity, thixotropy, density, etc). The correct setting of the above listed parameters is extremely difficult, due to their influence on the filling {{which can not be}} measured directly. To better understand which influence the different parameters have on the filling of a <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> mould as well as to rapidly solve problems in the production, it appears necessary to use the computational fluid dynamics. This is the main objective of this thesis. In a first step a macroscopic material model, able to describe the thixotropic behaviour of ceramic slurry, will be developed. Then the material model will be implemented in the commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLOW 3 D. Computer simulation of 2 D-geometries and 3 D-geometries will be used to validate the material model and the move of the slurry surface during the filling of a <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> mould. The results of this thesis illustrate that the computer simulation of the filling of a sanitary mould, with a thixotropic slurry, help to better comprehend the filling process of <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> in the sanitary industry.

However the application of <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> in the field of non-clay ceramics is very limited and under development. A laboratory <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> machine was used for casting of aqueous silicon nitride slips. Several commercial polymethylmethacrylate materials were applied as the filtering and moulding material. The penetration of fine powder particles into the mould was avoided by partially flocculation of the slips. With the partially flocculated slips lower green densities were reached (maximum 54 per cent) compared with pressure cast deflocculated slips (maximum 63 per cent). In both cases the slip pressure was varied in the range 1 MPa - 3 MPa and it did not significantly influenced the green density. The bending strength of the sintered samples was between 700 and 800 MPa and it is consequently lower than the strength of dry pressed samples. Large pores because of a inhomogeneous distribution of the polyacrylate binder were detected as defects in the microstructure.
