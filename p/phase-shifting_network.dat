It is mounted perpendicular to the field winding and produces a magnetic flux that passes through the moving vanes. The moving vanes turn a shaft that carries a pointer moving over a scale.

The scale is marked to show the direction of rotation corresponding to the [...] "incoming" [...] machine running faster than the [...] "running" [...] system. When the frequencies match, the moving vanes will rotate to a position corresponding to the phase difference between the two sources. The incoming machine can then be adjusted in speed so that the two systems are in phase agreement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{provides}} the theoretical {{basis for the}} measurement of reactive and distortion powers from the wavelet transforms. The measurement of reactive power relies {{on the use of}} broad-band <b>phase-shift</b> <b>networks</b> to create concurrent in-phase currents and quadrature voltages. The wavelet real power computation resulting from these 90 <b>phase-shift</b> <b>networks</b> yields the reactive power associated with each wavelet frequency level or subband. The distortion power at each wavelet subband is then derived from the real, reactive and apparent powers of the subband, where the apparent power is the product of the v; i element pair's subband rms voltage and current. The advantage of viewing the real and reactive powers in the wavelet domain is that the domain preserves both the frequency and time relationship of these powers. In addition, the reactive power associated with each wavelet subband is a signed quantity and thus has a direction associated with it. This permits tracking the reactive power flow in each subband through the power system. Index Terms—Digital signal processing, phase shift networks, measurement, power, RMS, subband, wavelets.

40|$|With the {{congestion}} of the sub- 6 GHz spectrum, {{the interest}} in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating on millimeter wave spectrum grows. In {{order to reduce the}} power consumption of such massive MIMO systems, hybrid analog/digital transceivers and application of low-resolution digital-to-analog/analog-to-digital converters have been recently proposed. In this work, we investigate the energy efficiency of quantized hybrid transmitters equipped with a fully/partially-connected <b>phase-shifting</b> <b>network</b> composed of active/passive phase-shifters and compare it to that of quantized digital precoders. We introduce a quantized MIMO model based on an additive quantization noise model considering a realistic power consumption and loss model to evaluate the spectral and energy efficiencies of the transmit precoding methods. Simulation results show that partially-connected hybrid precoders can be more energy-efficient compared to digital precoders, while fully-connected hybrid precoders perform poorly due to their severe insertion losses. Also, the topology of the phase-shifting components offers an energy-spectral efficiency trade-off: active phase-shifters provide higher data rates, while passive phase-shifters maintain better energy efficiency...|$|E

50|$|Sainton's 317C series {{consisted}} of a class C carrier tube in parallel connection with a class C peak tube. The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through + and − 90-degree <b>phase-shifting</b> <b>networks</b> as in a Doherty amplifier. The unmodulated radio frequency carrier {{was applied to the}} control grids of both tubes. Carrier modulation was applied to the screen grids of both tubes but the screen grid bias points of the carrier and peak tubes were different and were established such that the peak tube was cut off when modulation was absent and the amplifier was producing rated unmodulated carrier power and both tubes were conducting and each tube was contributing twice the rated carrier power during 100% modulation as four times the rated carrier power is required to achieve 100% modulation. As both tubes were operated in class C, a significant improvement in efficiency was thereby achieved in the final stage. In addition, as the tetrode carrier and peak tubes required very little drive power, a significant improvement in efficiency within the driver was achieved as well. The commercial version of the Sainton amplifier employed a cathode-follower modulator, not the push-pull modulator disclosed in the patent, and the entire 50,000-watt transmitter was implemented using only nine total tubes of four tube types, all of these being general-purpose, a remarkable achievement, given that the 317C's most significant competitor, RCA's BTA-50H, was implemented using thirty-two total tubes of nine tube types, nearly one-half of these being special-purpose, employed only in the BTA-50H. Over 200 CE 317C transmitters were installed in North America alone, easily outdistancing all competitors combined.|$|R
30|$|Full-dimension multiple-input multiple-output (FD-MIMO) {{transmission}} {{refers to}} wireless transmission systems that support two-dimensional antenna arrays {{with a large}} number of antenna elements. This enables high-resolution beamforming in both, the elevation and the azimuth domain, in order to achieve space-division multiple access gains through spatial separation of users, as well as to enhance the energy efficiency of wireless data transmission by concentrating the radiated energy towards intended users [1 – 3]. The great potential of FD-MIMO systems has been recognized by standardization bodies, such as the third generation partnership project (3 GPP); correspondingly, development and standardization efforts are ongoing within long-term evolution (LTE) Release 14 and 5 G new radio (NR) to further enhance the initial realization of FD-MIMO in Release 13. Currently, most implementation proposals of FD-MIMO transceivers are based on hybrid architectures, where part of the signal processing is performed in base band and part in the analog radio frequency (RF) domain in order {{to limit the number of}} required RF chains. This approach is especially important in the millimeter wave band, where hardware complexity is a limiting factor [4 – 8]. When designing hybrid precoding systems, several challenges need to be addressed [9 – 11]: the design freedom of RF precoders is commonly restricted by hardware limitations, such as discrete angular resolution and constant modulus of the phase-shifting elements, as well as partial connectivity of the <b>phase-shift</b> <b>network</b> to limit insertion loss. An alternative to hybrid architectures, which potentially provides even higher spectral and energy efficiency in certain operating regimes, is to employ cheap low (even single bit) resolution analog to digital (AD)/digital to analog (DA) converters in FD-MIMO transceivers. At the receive-side of most existing MIMO transceivers, high-resolution AD converters are employed to minimize the signal distortions introduced by the receiver. Such high-resolution AD converters are, however, among the most power hungry devices of the receiver chain. This motivates the use of low-resolution energy efficient AD converters in FD-MIMO systems to achieve energy-efficient operation [12 – 15]. At the transmit side, on the other hand, power expenditure is dominated by power amplifiers, which are usually required to operate within the high linearity regime to avoid signal distortion. Employing low-resolution DA converters relaxes these linearity requirements, allowing the amplifiers to operate closer to saturation thereby increasing their efficiency [16, 17].|$|R
