In this study, {{with the aim of}} the production of environmentally friendly antibacterial paper, nanoclay was selected as a productive agent of antibacterial effect. Since the effectiveness of nanoclay depends on the amount of its negative charge, nanoclay was homogenized using a homogenizer until be processed a homogeneous structure with more negative charge. Due to the negativity of charge of fibers and clay nanoparticles, Nanoclays was combined with starch at levels of 1, 3 and 4 %, and the suspension was applied to on surface of the paper as an overlay using Auto Bar Coater. Antibacterial and physical properties of papers were evaluated. The results showed that nanoclays had a significantly effect on inhibiting the growth of bacteria and were able to reduce the growth of bacteria even at low levels of consumption.
