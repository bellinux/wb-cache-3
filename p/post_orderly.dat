40|$|Papua New Guinea was {{conducted}} using a structured questionnaire to examine possible factors of malaria prevalence, including education experiences, knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behaviors, {{in relation to}} antimalarial antibody titers. Bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed that micro-environmental conditions caused intercommunity differences in malaria prevalence. Ninety-nine percent of the subject villagers recognized mosquito bites {{as a cause of}} malaria transmission, which explains the high possession rate of bednets. There was a significant correlation between malaria education experience at schools and knowledge (p < 0. 01) and between knowledge and bednet use (p < 0. 05). However, regular bednet users were only 35 % of the total, due primarily to feelings of discomfort, heat, and stuffiness inside the bednet. Villagers ’ behavior of consulting an aid <b>post</b> <b>orderly</b> (APO) in case of high fever significantly lowered the titer level (p < 0. 05), while their bednet use did not. This unexpected result was attributable to inappropriate bednet use and to daily living patterns, including both subsistence and social activities. We conclude that information regarding lifestyles and attitudes toward bednet use as well as malaria education experience at schools are particularly important for practical malaria prevention...|$|E

40|$|Research on {{a remote}} and {{culturally}} conservative Papua New Guinea island {{before and after the}} introduction of biomedical primary health care in the form of government aid posts shows that beliefs in the supernatural causation of serious illness ans death by sorcery, witchcraft or taboo violation remain largely unchanged after a decade. Most islanders first seek treatment from traditional healers who can identify and combat the underlying supernatural causes of illness. A healer, traditional or modern, must be greatly trusted by patient and kin due to fears of sorcery and witchcraft attack, and aid <b>post</b> <b>orderlies,</b> from a different cultural and linguistic group, find it difficult to gain the confidence of the community. Orderlies and other health care providers should not present themselves as being in competition with traditional healers but concentrate on earning the trust of community members. Individuals from the local community should be offered training as aid <b>post</b> <b>orderlies</b> and primary health care workers. The islanders' hierarchy of resort to medical treatment is variable, and biomedicine and traditional healing have not assumed complementary functions. Traditional theories of disease causation and treatment are part of indigenous religious beliefs and thus highly resistant to change. Acceptance of biomedical treatment can occur without rejection of supernatural theories of disease causation. The rate of acceptance may vary among ethnic groups within the same country or region due to underlying cultural or religious differences. The constraints of inter-ethnic differences and of traditional beliefs concerning health and illness within which the health system must function in this case are found in many multi-ethnic developing countries. traditional healing primary health care sorcery Papua New Guinea...|$|R
50|$|Mail {{circulation}} - Generally, mail (letters & parcels) {{posted in}} the UK addressed to troops overseas was circulated by the GPO to the Home Postal Depot (HPD) in London {{where it was}} sorted by theatre and unit. It was then despatched to embarkation ports and loaded on vessels for transportation to the theatre’s BAPO. At the BAPO the mail was sorted and loaded onto supply trains for transportation to the railhead. At the railhead the mail guard, who had accompanied the mail from the BAPO, {{and members of the}} railhead APO transferred the mails to the supply column (usually lorries) for the journey to the Refilling Points where the attached Field Post Office (FPO) staff would receive the mail and then distribute it the Unit <b>Post</b> <b>Orderlies</b> (UPOs) who had travelled to the Refilling Point on regimental transport. Homeward bound mail was sent in the reverse direction back to the BAPO, which would be responsible for loading it onto vessels bound for the UK. On the mail's arrival in the UK it was put into the GPO system for delivery to the addressee.|$|R

50|$|Henry Darlot, a clerk {{from the}} Post Office Foreign Section, {{was chosen as}} the Army Postmaster, the first to officially {{accompany}} the Army overseas. Mail for the Army was handed to the Post Office Foreign Section, sealed in bags and passed to ships sailing to Holland. The Army established a base at Den Helder. When Henry Darlot arrived with his servant, he found that two despatches of mails had already preceded him. The result was chaos. He reported to the Post Office Secretary's Office on 27 September 1799 that: the mails are both delivered which I assure you is not so easy or businesslike as I imagined it would be, for although the letters are partly sorted in London to the different regiments, there are still a great number for persons not attached to any regiment who are so impatient to be supplied that immediately a mail arrives I am beset by at least a hundred of them. Great confusion is occasioned also by officers detached from the regiment to which their letters were addressed insisting on looking for them before the Drum Majors were appointed <b>Post</b> <b>Orderlies</b> for each regiment get them.|$|R
