The {{purpose of the study}} was to explore and describe the barriers to <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> {{psychiatric nursing}} care, using the case study methodology. A sample of 12 participants was recruited for the study, comprising four key informants and eight study participants. The data collection methods included grand tour interviews with the key informants, in-depth interviews with key informants and other study participants and participant observation of all 12 participants.
