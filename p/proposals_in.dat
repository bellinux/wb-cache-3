5|$|Baird {{was given}} {{additional}} responsibilities as Minister responsible for Children on February 8, 2001. His department increased funding for child services {{early in the}} year, amid {{a significant increase in}} provincial demand. In November 2001, the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending 40–45% cuts in provincial child-care programs. Baird initially {{declined to comment on the}} document's contents, but rejected its <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> early 2002.|$|E

5|$|Buckinghamshire County Council's architect, Fred Pooley, {{had spent}} {{considerable}} {{time in the}} early sixties developing ideas for a new town in the Bletchley and Wolverton area. He developed a futuristic proposal based on a monorail linking a series of individual townships to a major town centre. The county council published the <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> 1966, {{but it was too}} late to influence the government.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009 Air France withdrew its interest. This led to Veolia {{looking for}} new partners, with the {{announcement}} that it would begin working on new <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> cooperation with Trenitalia to run services from Paris to Strasbourg, London and Brussels.|$|E
5|$|In around 1797, a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} build a fortified city occupying the entire peninsula, with Fort Tigné as its keep. Like the earlier <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> the late 17th and early 18th centuries, nothing materialized from this plan.|$|E
50|$|A <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> 2015 {{was for the}} new {{council to}} also absorb the Wairoa and Central Hawkes Bay councils to make a super {{regional}} council of 150,000 people. This amalgamation referendum was held in September 2015, the majority of voters (~66%) rejected the <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> favour of the status quo.|$|R

5|$|In late July 2007, South Somerset District Council {{plans were}} made public by the Western Gazette {{to build a}} £21m 'Yeovil Sports Zone' on Yeovil Recreation Ground, {{which has been a}} popular open green space used by the local {{community}} for over seventy years. Residents fought to protect the Rec, leading to rejection of the <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> 2009, and further consultations in 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>Proposals</b> <b>in</b> January 2013 {{to improve}} the bus service to the airport {{involving}} turning emergency lanes into bus lanes on the freeway and the Bolte Bridge and putting SkyBus on a myki fare, were challenged by CityLink operator Transurban, because it would limit its toll revenue, and by Melbourne Airport, because it would reduce its car parking profits. Similar objections would apply to a rail link.|$|E
5|$|The Long Range Strike Bomber {{program is}} {{intended}} to yield a stealthy successor for the B-52 and B-1 that would begin service in the 2020s; it {{is intended to}} produce 80 to 100 aircraft. Two competitors, Northrop Grumman and a joint team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, submitted <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> 2014; Northrop Grumman was awarded a contract in October 2015.|$|E
25|$|Solomon Feferman and Vann McGee further {{discussed}} Tarski's <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> work published {{after his}} death. Feferman (1999) raises {{problems for the}} proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary homomorphisms. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski's <b>proposal</b> has <b>in</b> dealing with sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's <b>proposal</b> results <b>in</b> a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original <b>proposal.</b> <b>In</b> particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.|$|R

5|$|After Jordan retired {{following}} the 1992–93 NBA season, Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf sought a sculptor to honor Jordan and requested that Chicago Bulls Vice President Steve Schanwald seek proposals from artists. Twelve artists made <b>proposals.</b> <b>In</b> January 1994, Schanwald hired Omri and Julie Rotblatt-Amrany of Highland Park, Illinois, who erected a statue at the Bulls' new {{home for the}} 1994–95 NBA season, the United Center. Until 1994 when they both moved, the Bulls and Blackhawks had played at Chicago Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{calls for}} a special session of the {{legislature}} {{had been made in}} February and March, Governor Stanley was not initially receptive to the idea at the beginning of April. In mid-April, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Gi Stevens urged Stanley to call a special session of the General Assembly to reconsider the Gray Commission <b>proposals.</b> <b>In</b> May, at least one state delegate urged the General Assembly to call itself into special session.|$|E
5|$|Central Area Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in March 1940, and covered the central portion of New South Wales. Headquartered at Sydney, Central Area Command was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. It was disbanded in August 1941 and control of its units taken over by other RAAF formations. <b>Proposals</b> <b>in</b> 1943–44 to raise a new Central Area Command did not come to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1890s, the CCE struggled unsuccessfully to raise the capital it needed to fund the construction. Whilst it did so it continued to develop its route <b>proposals.</b> <b>In</b> 1899, parliamentary permission was obtained to modify the route so that the Euston branch was extended northwards to connect to the main route {{at the south end of}} Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. In 1900, the CCE was taken over by a consortium led by American financier Charles Yerkes which raised the necessary money.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders {{introduced}} a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve {{by the end}} of 2009. After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the <b>proposals.</b> <b>In</b> March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.|$|E

5|$|Paramount {{turned down}} several <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> the mid-2000s {{to restart the}} franchise. These {{included}} pitches from film director Bryan Singer, Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski, and Trek actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner. The studio also turned down an animated web series. Instead, Paramount hired a new creative team to reinvigorate the franchise in 2007. Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer, J. J. Abrams, had the freedom to reinvent the feel of Trek.|$|E
5|$|President Richard Nixon {{reestablished}} the AMSA {{program after}} taking office, keeping with his administration's flexible response strategy {{that required a}} broad range of options short of general nuclear war. Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated. In April 1969, the program officially became the B-1A. This was the first entry in the new bomber designation series, first created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> November 1969.|$|E
5|$|The Iowa {{class were}} the only battleships with the speed {{required}} for post-war operations based around fast aircraft carrier task forces. There {{were a number of}} <b>proposals</b> <b>in</b> the early Cold War to convert the class to take into account changes in technology and doctrine. These included plans to equip the class with nuclear missiles, add aircraft capability and—in the case of Illinois and Kentucky—a proposal to rebuild both as aircraft carriers instead of battleships.|$|E
