To humor him, I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out.|$|E

[...] He was a [...] athlete who excelled in American football, baseball, and track and field. While ice skating in Brookside Park in Cleveland as a youth, the ice gave way and Gedeon's cousin plunged through up to his neck. [...] The cousin later recalled: [...] "Elmer slid across the ice on his belly and <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out." [...] Gedeon's uncle, Joe Gedeon, was a Major League Baseball player who was implicated in the Chicago Black Sox scandal.|$|E
500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day.

[...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Hamilton had {{the idea}} of making a fight scene inside a lift, which was choreographed and done by Sean Connery and {{stuntman}} Joe Robinson. [...] The car chase where the red Mustang comes outside of the narrow street on the opposite side in which it was rolled, was filmed over three nights on Fremont Street in Las Vegas. The alleyway car roll sequence is actually filmed in two locations. The entrance was at the car park at Universal Studios and the exit was at Fremont Street, Las Vegas. It eventually inspired a continuity mistake, as the car enters the alley on the right side tires and exits the street driving on the left side. During the car chase where the police are chasing Bond in a small parking lot the Mustang was to jump a small ramp over several cars. Bill Hickman (Bullitt fame) did this stunt; the hired stunt driver they had couldn't perform this and wrecked two or three cars. [...] The stunt team had only one automobile left so they called Hickman – who drove for hours to the location, jumped into the Mustang, and did the stunt in one take. While filming the scene of finding Plenty O'Toole drowned in Tiffany's swimming pool, Lana Wood actually had her feet loosely tied to a cement block on the bottom. Film crew members held a rope across the pool for her, with which she could lift her face out of the water to breathe between takes. The pool's sloping bottom made the block slip into deeper water with each take. Eventually, Wood was submerged but was noticed by on-lookers and rescued before actually drowning. Wood, being a certified diver, took some water but remained calm during the ordeal, although she later admitted to a few [...] "very uncomfortable moments and quite some struggling until they <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{contribution}} in music came after she met William Orbit {{at a party}} and tried to beg a cigarette from him. They began a relationship shortly after, and he encouraged her to do some spoken word for his Strange Cargo project and to sing. Possibly the best-known work from that time is [...] "Water from a Vine Leaf", which she co-wrote and which was released as a limited-edition single. It was also {{at this time that}} Orbit and Orton covered John Martyn's [...] "Don't Wanna Know 'Bout Evil", which was not only the first song that they recorded together, but also their first release in Japan, as a duet called Spill (later re-released in the UK in 1997). She regarded Orbit's influence as very positive, commenting [...] "I think William <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out of the crowd and <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out of the gutter, in a way. Because I don't know where my enthusiasm was going to take me, because it was pretty raw to say the least." ...|$|E

2500|$|Every {{morning before}} {{beginning}} work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg. I'd scratch {{her and she}} would lean farther and farther toward me until there was some danger of her toppling over on me. One time I started {{to walk away from}} her, and she reached out and took my wrist with her trunk and <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> back to her side. It was a command: [...] "Don't stop!"

Verburgh's Janitor Union lawyer got Verburgh released on a writ of habeas corpus. Verburgh said of the experience:Oh, they hanged me up, they blindfolded me ... I can't put up my arms, they are sore. They had handcuffs on me for hours and hours. They threw me in the cell and blindfolded me.

2500|$|Upon {{completing}} his army service, Chikatilo {{returned to his}} native village {{to live with his}} parents. He soon became acquainted with a young divorcee, and the pair began a three-month relationship, which ended after several unsuccessful attempts at intercourse, when the woman innocently asked her friends for advice as to how Chikatilo might overcome his inability to maintain an erection. As a result, most of his peers discovered his impotence. In a 1993 interview regarding this incident, Chikatilo stated: [...] "Girls were going behind my back, whispering that I was impotent. I was so ashamed. I tried to hang myself. My mother and some young neighbours <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out of the noose. Well, I thought no one would want such a shamed man.

2500|$|Crowe's {{performance}} was less well received and even Crowe {{agreed that the}} film suffered from poor vocal performances. Emma Gosnell, writing for The Daily Telegraph, stated that she {{walked out of the}} showing due to the poor singing, specifically citing Crowe and Jackman as the cause. Playback singer Marni Nixon said [...] " [...] was nothing. It wasn't that he was choosing to sing like that, he just couldn't do anything else" [...] and that Jackman acted well but [...] "could have done with a nobler voice". American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert tweeted several disparaging messages, including [...] "why not cast actors who could actually sound good?" [...] and [...] "the singing was so distracting at times it <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out", to which Crowe replied via Twitter: [...] "I don't disagree with Adam, sure it could have been sweetened, Hooper wanted it raw and real, that's how it is".

2500|$|As {{a result}} of her altered looks and weight gain from her {{rheumatoid}} arthritis treatment, The New York Times published this statement in 2005, [...] "Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much. She later said in interviews that she didn't bother correcting the rumors because people in show business hire drunks all the time, but not people who are sick." [...] Turner has had well-publicized problems with alcohol, which she used as an escape from the pain and symptoms of acute rheumatoid arthritis. Turner has admitted that because of her illness, she was in constant unbearable agony and that as a result, the people she was closest to would suffer from it, as she was constantly drinking to relieve the pain and it made her a very difficult person. A few weeks after leaving the production of the play The Graduate in November 2002, Turner was admitted into the Marworth hospital in Waverly, Pennsylvania, for the treatment of alcoholism. [...] "I have no problem with alcohol when I'm working," [...] she explained. [...] "It's when I'm home alone that I can't control my drinking...I was going toward excess. I mean, really!
