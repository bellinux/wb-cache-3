5000|$|In 1800s America {{the knife}} {{was adopted by}} men and women in all walks of life as a {{defensive}} weapon and an item of daily wear. [...] Politicians wore them into state and federal buildings, even the United States Capitol. As a concealable weapon, the <b>push</b> <b>dagger</b> was a favorite choice of civilian owners requiring a discreet knife capable of being used for personal protection. [...] Before the development of reliable small pistols such as the derringer, the <b>push</b> <b>dagger</b> was especially popular among riverboat gamblers and residents of the larger towns and cities of the Old Southwest, particularly gamblers and émigrés from the city of New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E

Potter). A few huge Bowies up to 9 ft long were created for exhibition.|$|R

5000|$|The British Army and its Commonwealth allies (e.g. Australia, Canada and New Zealand) used a {{wide variety}} of trench knives during World War I. Some were {{commercial}} models based on Bowie knives. Others were more specialised types, such as <b>push</b> <b>daggers</b> with a roughly cylindrical aluminium grip which was shaped to fit comfortably when the user's hand made a fist. The attached 4 in blade protruded between the knuckles of the user. It was common British practice for trench knives to be used in combination with other [...] "quiet" [...] weapons, like trench clubs, pickaxe handles and hatchets, during trench raiding expeditions, backed up with revolvers and hand grenades. Many standardized versions were made by government contractors and officially issued. Most had slab wooden grips and metal sheaths and were sturdily made.|$|R

5000|$|The New Orleans-style <b>push</b> <b>dagger</b> {{was known}} as the gimlet knife. [...] The gimlet knife had a short two-inch (50 mm) blade with a [...] "gimlet" [...] or T-handle. [...] It was a common weapon in the city during the 1800s, and was usually slipped into a boot or {{concealed}} inside a coat sleeve, or else hung on a waistcoat button by a strap attached to the knife's leather sheath. [...] The gimlet knife was used in so many riots, fights, and murders in New Orleans that the city passed an ordinance in 1879 prohibiting anyone within city limits from selling, offering or exhibiting such a weapon for sale.|$|E
50|$|In Denmark, fixed-blade knives {{are legal}} to own if the blade {{is no longer}} than 12 cm (4.75 inches). Blades over this length may only be legally owned if the {{possessor}} has a legitimate reason for carrying the knife or a special collector's permit. However, such knives are still generally illegal to carry in public, whether on one's person or in a vehicle, unless transported {{in such a manner}} as to prevent ready access by the owner (lockbox, locked trunk, etc.) Folding, non-lock blade knives are legal to carry if the blade length does not exceed 7 cm (2.756 in). Locking knives and knives over 7 cm must be transported in public so as not to allow ready access by the owner. Knives with blades that may be opened with one hand (even if the one-hand opening mechanism has been removed), automatic-opening knives (switchblades), <b>push</b> <b>daggers,</b> gravity knives, disguised knives (belt-buckle knife, sword cane, etc.) and knives with ready access by the wearer (neck or belt knives, boot knives, etc.) are illegal to own or possess. Multi-tools featuring one-hand opening blades are also illegal to own or possess. Owning throwing knives and throwing in private or public is subject to permissions.|$|R
50|$|The {{excursion}} (of which Ji-hwan and Shi-young become aware) takes place, and {{the king}} is almost killed by Ji-hwan, but he is momentarily distracted {{by the death of}} Shi-young {{at the hands of the}} king's elite bodyguard and troops. The king, stabbing Ji-hwan with a heretofore hidden <b>dagger,</b> <b>pushes</b> Ji-hwan away; {{and the king}} continues to look on as Ji-hwan battles more troops. Almost defeated, Gyu-yup, finally moved by compassion and his past relationship with Shi-young and Ji-hwan, comes to Ji-hwan's rescue. He pleads for his and Ji-hwan's freedom (Gyu-yup had promised his neck to the current king during the rebellion in order to save his own troops from execution, and the now-king took this to mean this promise was binding in perpetuity), and when that is met with silence, he and Ji-hwan engage the troops that have surrounded them. The movie ends by freezing the old friends, united in battle again, in action against the usurper king's troops.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, the <b>push</b> <b>dagger</b> also enjoyed a brief period of {{popularity}} in Britain and Central Europe, particularly in Germany, where it was called the Stoßdolch or Faustmesser, meaning [...] "push-dagger" [...] and [...] "fist-knife", respectively. The weapon is thought to have been introduced there in the mid-1800s by foreign sailors visiting North German ports. German cutlery makers began to manufacture domestic versions of the design, often set in nickel-silver mountings. The Stoßdolch was sold primarily as a self-defence weapon for travellers, salesmen, and others who required a compact, concealable weapon. Push daggers continued to be sold in Britain and Europe through the end of the 19th century, when the combination of more effective police forces and the availability of inexpensive small handguns caused a substantial decline in sales and usage of push daggers and other types of specialised fighting knives.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reality of}} static trench warfare in World War I created {{a need for}} short, handy close-combat weapons {{that could be used}} in the {{confines}} of a trench. With pistols in short supply, a variety of knives and other stabbing weapons were created or issued to troops serving in the trenches. Originally most of these weapons were fabricated in the field from readily available materials such as metal stakes, but soon factory-made examples of knuckle knives and push daggers appeared at the front, and were used by both sides in the conflict. In Britain the Robbins-Dudley Co. of Dudley, Worcestershire, a metalworking concern, was one of the first commercial producers of specialised wartime knuckle-knives and push daggers for private sale to individual soldiers and officers. [...] The typical Robbins-Dudley <b>push</b> <b>dagger</b> - referred to as a 'punch knife' by its maker - utilised an aluminium 'knuckle'-type handle cast onto a 3.625-in. (93 mm) heat-treated steel dagger blade or alternatively, a 5-in. (127 mm [...] ) metal spike, which was subsequently blackened to prevent reflections in moonlight.|$|E
50|$|At 7:10 a.m., Owens and his deputies, {{equipped}} with weapons from Dinkum's private museum, have the town's main road barricaded with cars when Burrell {{and his men}} arrive, prompting a lengthy firefight. Armed with a Tommy Gun, Figuerola holds off the thugs before being injured by a sniper. Owens and Dinkum mow down {{a majority of the}} thugs with a Vickers machine gun mounted {{on the back of a}} school bus with Martinez providing cover fire, while Torrance snipes several gunmen on the rooftops. After Owens kills Burrell, Cortez's Corvette eventually arrives in town, veering past the barricade as Owens and the deputies shoot it. Cortez ejects Agent Richards from the car before speeding through a corn field. Suddenly, he encounters the Mayor's Camaro commandeered by Owens before both cars collide with a swather. A dazed Cortez continues his escape on foot, but Owens meets him at the bridge. Owens ignores Cortez's bribe offers before both men fight each other. Despite sustaining slashes and stab wounds from Cortez's <b>push</b> <b>dagger,</b> Owens defeats the drug lord and handcuffs him before dragging him back into town using the battered and now roofless Camaro. Agent Bannister arrives to take Cortez back into custody and arrests Agent Richards for taking the drug lord's bribe and aiding in his escape. Deputies Figuerola and Dinkum are taken to the hospital to be treated for their wounds. Martinez turns in the deputy's badge, Bailey's badge, that Owens had given him earlier. Owens tells him to keep it, as he's earned it. As the Mayor sees what is left of his Camaro, Owens warns him about parking in the fire lane before he, Torrance and Martinez walk into the diner.|$|E
