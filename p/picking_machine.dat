25|$|The cotton {{comes off}} of the <b>picking</b> <b>machine</b> in laps, and is then taken to carding machines. The carders line up the fibres nicely to make them easier to spin. The carding machine {{consists}} mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine {{in the form of}} a sliver; a large rope of fibres.|$|E

50|$|One {{method to}} any error with voting {{machines}} is parallel testing, which are {{conducted on the}} Election Day with randomly <b>picked</b> <b>machines.</b> The ACM published a study showing that, to change {{the outcome of the}} 2000 U.S. Presidential election, only 2 votes in each precinct would have needed to be changed.|$|R
50|$|The South {{urbanized}} as {{the cotton}} base collapsed, especially {{east of the}} Mississippi River. Farming was much less important (and the remaining farmers more often specialized in soybeans and cattle, or citrus in Florida). The need for cotton pickers ended with the utilization of <b>picking</b> <b>machines</b> after 1945, and {{nearly all of the}} black cotton farmers moved to urban areas, often in the North. Whites, who had been farmers, usually moved to nearby towns. Factories and service industries were opened in those towns for employment.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, at {{the beginning}} of 2000 s, Single Head architectural technology was adapted for use in the <b>Pick</b> and Place <b>machine.</b> Single Head is the general acceptance of particular product architecture and is characteristic of technical evolution in a <b>Pick</b> and Place <b>machines.</b> Single Head architectural technology actually dominated the <b>Pick</b> and Place <b>machine</b> market. A dominant design often emerges in response to the opportunity to obtain economies of scale or to take advantage of externalities (Arthur, 1988). The K as a front runner of OSAT, adapted it in spite of having plenty of its own technologies because customers such as Samsung has strongly required it. Figure 1 presents the operation principle of Single Head Pick and Place Module. By utilizing the single head, <b>Pick</b> and Place <b>machines</b> <b>pick</b> the die from on wafer and placing them in the holes. Single Head technology is principle operation method, thus architecture technology. The K having accumulated knowledge about the operation principle of the <b>Pick</b> and Place <b>machine</b> began the innovation, because single Head component had a time lag during the process from picking the die to placing it the hole. Also the time required to move the die hindered quality control. Real time product inspection is much more important for OSATs.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of the corn <b>picking</b> <b>machine</b> has made this hand harvesting process obsolete. By using modern machines, a farmer is capable of tending larger fields, thus producing more food with less effort. As a result, the term Cornjerker as used in the agricultural industry has become a colloquialism.|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, the industrious Yankee {{owners of}} the Fall River Manufactory persevered, and sought to improve their {{business}} with new technologies. In 1814, the mill acquired a Blair <b>picking</b> <b>machine,</b> which had just been introduced in the United States. This machine was used to clean and process the raw cotton prior to spinning, a process that until then had been done by hand at considerable time and expense. The new device resulted in greatly increased production and about a 75 percent drop in the cost in the picking process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:-This {{research}} work {{will give a}} new technology {{in the field of}} cotton boll picking mechanism and to develop machine which is low weight ergonomically which could be used to pick cotton bolls. In India entire cotton is handpick by labor, internationally available machine for cotton boll picking is costlier and its shows that due to spindle type cotton <b>picking</b> <b>machine,</b> percentage of short fibre content increases result in poor quality of cotton fibre strength. Suction type cotton boll <b>picking</b> <b>machine</b> will give new technology in the field of agriculture, which is helpful for Indian farmer, it is not costly and easy to handle.

Introduction:- Cotton <b>picking</b> <b>machine</b> already exist in market. But due to mechanical cotton harvesting it loses the quality of fiber strength. In earlier days cotton picking is done by hand that was giving a good quality of cotton with good fiber strength but it require more time.

40|$|This {{research}} paper investigates a new 3 D handling process in food industry: bin <b>picking.</b> <b>Machines</b> only function effectively when {{the input of}} product is physically well organised, well structured, and consistent. At many stages in a typical production line, foodstuffs are physically arranged as they move through a machine or equipment, however, this order is then lost again as products are ejected onto conveyors, bulked together into bins for transport, taken off-line for chilled storage. Bin picking is generally not solved for manufacturing parts. Unlike food ordering processes such as pick and place operations, vibratory feeders etc., this food handling operation has not been applied to food industry neither. A new approach is presented using the Microsoft KinectTM sensor and Active Shape Models. By combining the new device that obtains an RGB and RGB-D image and the flexible shape model, {{it is possible to}} identify non-uniform food products that have a high variation in shape. The methodology of this system is presented. The experiments show the achievability of this new system...|$|R

At present, research of domestic machinery of blueberry picking is still in early stages. Mechanical and automation level of blueberry picking are enriched, through research of <b>picking</b> <b>machine</b> of lowbush blueberry. The research has the vital significance to the development of blueberry industry. To improve picking efficiency and reduce total loss rate of green fruit, mechanism of picking is analyzed. Fruit, which has certain representativeness in the variety, is researched. Picking force and vibration frequency of plants are obtained and work principle is determined. Structures of vibrating picking and fruit collection and the body of the machine are designed. Parameters of structure size and working are determined, with which the machine is manufactured. Plan of experiment is designed and experiment of picking is done in the season blueberries are most ripe. Result indicates structure of blueberry <b>picking</b> <b>machine</b> is reasonable. Picking force and vibration frequency are effective. Compared with that of manual picking, efficiency of mechanical picking is high, which meets technical requirements of blueberry machinery...|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} gossip {{communication}} can be {{illustrated by the}} analogy of office workers spreading rumors. Let's say each hour the office workers congregate around the water cooler. Each employee pairs off with another, chosen at random, and shares the latest gossip. At {{the start of the}} day, Alice starts a new rumor: she comments to Bob that she believes that Charlie dyes his mustache. At the next meeting, Bob tells Dave, while Alice repeats the idea to Eve. After each water cooler rendezvous, the number of individuals who have heard the rumor roughly doubles (though this doesn't account for gossiping twice to the same person; perhaps Alice tries to tell the story to Frank, only to find that Frank already heard it from Dave). Computer systems typically implement this type of protocol with a form of random [...] "peer selection": with a given frequency, each <b>machine</b> <b>picks</b> another <b>machine</b> at random and shares any hot rumors.|$|R
