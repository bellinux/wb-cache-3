5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of <b>phenotypic</b> and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback {{to keep in mind}} is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to <b>phenotypic</b> similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, <b>phenotypic</b> differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The <b>phenotypic</b> differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the <b>phenotypic</b> composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Variation exists within {{populations of}} organisms {{with respect to}} morphology, physiology, and {{behaviour}} (<b>phenotypic</b> variation).|$|E
5|$|While natural {{selection}} has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations {{to the current}} environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance. As a result, drift acts upon the genotypic frequencies within a population without regard to their <b>phenotypic</b> effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of alleles whose <b>phenotypic</b> effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the frequencies of alleles that cause unfavorable traits, and ignores those that are neutral.|$|E
5|$|Both {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo <b>phenotypic</b> switching and grow as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, {{but these are not}} reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E
5|$|Human {{behaviour}} {{may also}} provide examples of costly signals. In general, these signals {{provide information about}} a person’s <b>phenotypic</b> quality or cooperative tendencies. Evidence for costly signalling {{has been found in}} many areas of human interaction including risk taking, hunting, and religion.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger <b>phenotypic</b> variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less <b>phenotypic</b> variation and comprise animals that are either heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable <b>phenotypic</b> trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{may have}} played a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases <b>phenotypic</b> variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the <b>phenotypic</b> polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{traits are}} governed by only a single gene, but most traits are {{influenced}} by the interactions of many genes. A variation in one of the many genes that contributes to a trait may have only a small effect on the phenotype; together, these genes can produce a continuum of possible <b>phenotypic</b> values.|$|E
5|$|Standard {{errors of}} prediction, {{also known as}} {{accuracy}} or possible change value {{in the context of}} EBV and EPD predictions, are dependent on the quality of information used to predict an animal's EBV or EPD for a given trait. Errors in estimating genetic merit are being addressed in research programmes that aim to supplement <b>phenotypic</b> data extensively used in current BLUP predictions with genotypic data.|$|E
5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great <b>phenotypic</b> plasticity (changing its developmental rate {{in response}} {{to changes in the}} environment), as it develops very quickly in the lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E
5|$|The fungi {{have several}} {{unicellular}} species, such as baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Some fungi, {{such as the}} pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, can undergo <b>phenotypic</b> switching and grow as single cells in some environments, and filamentous hyphae in others.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller <b>phenotypic</b> effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large <b>phenotypic</b> effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in Papilio polytes is controlled by the doublesex gene.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Sardinian ichnusae {{subspecies}} is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits in their current homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations stem from repeated introductions of animals from different localities in the Mediterranean. This latter theory may explain the subspecies' <b>phenotypic</b> diversity.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the <b>phenotypic</b> variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins {{first came}} to {{prominence}} with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme. With his book The Extended Phenotype (1982), he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the <b>phenotypic</b> effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment. In 2006, he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and <b>phenotypic</b> diversity. Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} and the Bactrian camel often interbreed {{to produce}} fertile offspring. Where the ranges {{of the species}} overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Persia and Afghanistan, the <b>phenotypic</b> differences between them tend to decrease {{as a result of}} extensive crossbreeding. The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the dromedary and the Bactrian camel should be merged into a single species with two varieties. However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene showed the species display 10.3% divergence in their sequences.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis serves an {{indicator}} species for river monitoring (in Germany); however the spreading populations {{also have a}} high tolerance for degraded habitats. Theodoxus fluviatilis has a large <b>phenotypic</b> plasticity: it was found living on stones and on dead wood in freshwater environments; whereas it lives on stones and on Fucus vesiculosus, Potamogeton spp. and Zostera marina in brackish water in the Baltic Sea. The species {{can also be found}} on aggregates of Mytilus.|$|E
5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different <b>phenotypic</b> traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} kind of fitness landscape, each {{dimension}} represents a different <b>phenotypic</b> trait. Under {{the assumptions of}} quantitative genetics, these <b>phenotypic</b> dimensions can be mapped onto genotypes. See the visualizations below for examples of phenotype to fitness landscapes.|$|E

25|$|Knot theory, {{a branch}} of topology, is used in biology to {{study the effects of}} certain enzymes on DNA. These enzymes cut, twist, and {{reconnect}} the DNA, causing knotting with observable effects such as slower electrophoresis. Topology is also used in evolutionary biology to represent the relationship between phenotype and genotype. <b>Phenotypic</b> forms that appear quite different can be separated by only a few mutations depending on how genetic changes map to <b>phenotypic</b> changes during development.|$|E
25|$|Scientists use an {{extensive}} genetic and <b>phenotypic</b> database {{to determine the}} common ancestor of all modern placental mammals, including humans.|$|E
25|$|The <b>phenotypic</b> {{effect of}} a {{particular}} gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so {{how is it possible}} to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the <b>phenotypic</b> differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|An {{outstanding}} {{question and}} {{area of research}} is whether ATP depletion or reactive oxygen species are in fact responsible for the observed <b>phenotypic</b> consequences.|$|E
25|$|Physical causes lead to <b>phenotypic</b> {{alterations}} in susceptible cells (e.g. due to genetic makeup), which then effectuate DNA changes which alter the cell's behavior.|$|E
