Various {{studies have shown that the}} mastering of basic skills happens best if taught in a realistc and workplace-based context. It is necessary that simulaton itself takes place in the realistc background of a genuine clinical or in an accordingly simulated learning environment. A panoramic projecton system that allows the simulaton of diferent scenarios has been created at the medical school of the Westphalian Wilhelms-University Muenster/Germany. The SimuScape © is a circular training room of six meters in diameter and has the capacity to generate pictures or moving images as well as the corresponding background noises for medical students, who are then able to interact with simulated <b>patents</b> <b>inside</b> a realistc environment. About 1, 000 students have been instructed using the SimuScape © in the courses of emergency medicine, family medicine and anesthesia. The SimuScape©, with its 270 °-panoramic projecton, gives the students the impression “of being right in the center of acton”. It is a fexible learning environment that can be easily integrated into curricular teaching and which is in full operaton for 10 days per semester. The SimuScape © allows the establishment of new medical areas outside the hospital and surgery for simulaton and it is an extremely adaptable and cost-efectve utlizaton of a lecture room.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{incentive}} that governments {{have to protect}} IPR in a trading world economy, focusing on the patent novelty requirement {{and its effect on}} growth and trade. We consider a world economy with ongoing innovation in two regions. The North is assumed to have a higher wage than the South and a greater capacity for innovation, the South is assumed to have a larger population than the North. We introduce heterogeneity in innovation size together with the obligation, imposed by <b>Patent</b> Office <b>inside</b> each region, that innovation size must be higher than the patent novelty requirement. This patent characteristic stands to be a useable instrument to promote innovation and growth, and also a strategic trade policy instrument. We numerically determine the Nash equilibrium of the strategic game that results of the patent novelty requirement setting by each regional authority. We then compare, in terms of welfare, the non-cooperative equilibrium with the equilibrium that results from the patent novelty requirement harmonization, when the level of this common patent novelty requirement is set by a supra-regional organization. patent novelty requirement, innovation, growth, quality ladders, harmonization, North and South...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons for the change was the issue of lubrication. Lead bullets, {{especially}} soft, low alloy lead used in low pressure cartridges, need to be lubricated to prevent lead buildup in the bore. This lubricant can be applied either to the exposed portion of the heeled bullet, called outside lubricated, or on the portion inside the case, called inside lubricated. Outside lubrication requires a hard, dry lubricant, as anything soft or sticky will rub off or pick up dirt that comes in contact. Inside lubrication, on the other hand, can use sticky wax or grease, but then needs some means for the lubricant to reach {{the wall of the}} bore, since the diameter of the heel is smaller than the bore. While there were some methods <b>patented</b> to allow <b>inside</b> lubrication of heeled bullets (such as a piston at the base, which forces lubricant out of ports in the exposed sides of the bullet upon firing), they never became popular, due to the complexity and expense involved. Non-heeled bullets, however, can easily be lubricated on the portion inside the case using a grease groove packed with lubricant. This prevents the lubricant, usually a grease or wax, from picking up dirt and grit which can damage the bore.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} patents {{have argued that}} the very {{materiality}} and techniques of legal media, such as the written patent document, are vital for the legal construction of a patentable invention. Developing the centrality placed on patent documents further, it becomes important to understand how these documents are ordered and mobilized. Patent classification answers the necessity of making the virtual nature of textual claims practicable by linking written inscription to bureaucracy. Here, the epistemological organization of documents overlaps with the grid of patent administration. How are scientific inventions represented in such a process? If we examine the process of creating a new patent category within the International Patent Classification (IPC), it becomes clear that disagreements about the substance of the novel inventive subject matter have been resolved by computer simulations of patent documents in draft classifications. The practical needs of patent examiners were the most important concerns in the making of a new category. Such a lack of epistemological mediation between the scientific and legal identities of an invention depicts a legal understanding that science is already <b>inside</b> <b>patent</b> law. From an internal legal perspective, the self-referential introduction of the new patent category may make practical sense; however it becomes problematic from a technological and scientific standpoint as the remit of the patent classification also affects other social contexts and practice...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis {{explores the}} {{determinants}} {{and impact of}} UniversityIndustry (U-I) knowledge transfer. It focuses on the UK {{as well as a}} number of European regions and aims at filling several gaps in the literature. Firstly, I examine the role of scientific (i. e. university) and market (i. e. customers, competitors, suppliers) knowledge for <b>patent</b> inventors working <b>inside</b> firms. I use data from an original survey of industry inventors combined with patent data from the European Patent Office and I employ an econometric strategy rarely applied at inventor’s level (i. e. productivity approach). My finding is that the amount and quality of patents invented increase when inventors draw their knowledge jointly from a wide set of knowledge sources, rather than from only one of these. Secondly, I investigate the impact of U-I research collaborations on UK firms’ R&D activities. The data consists of a set of publicly funded U-I partnerships combined with firm-level data available from the UK Office for National Statistics. I combine propensity score matching with OLS regression to select an ad-hoc control group and obtain a reliable estimate of the impact of U-I collaboration on firms. My finding is that treated firms’ R&D expenditure and share of R&D employment both increase after participation to U-I partnerships. Thirdly, I explore the role of research quality as a determinant of UK university departments’ engagement in U-I collaboration. I use data on publicly funded U-I collaboration combined with data on UK universities and I employ OLS regression. My finding is that academic quality displays a mixture of negative and positive relationship with the volume of private funding for U-I collaboration, and that this is interdependent with the level of academia’s past experience in U-I collaboration. Together, these chapters make important contributions to a vast but still puzzled literature on U-I knowledge transfer activities...|$|R
40|$| {{found when}} their {{scientific}} careers and technology developed were compared: {{the great majority}} of patented inventions related directly to individuals´ scientific expertise and to the themes they were working on when the patents were applied for. Consequently, academic scientists have had a clear technological profile, which distinguished them from Finnish patentees in general. This profile is characterised by scientific expertise and a close connection between technology and current scientific research. According to the study at hand it has not been a problem to combine a university career and the development of commercial technology. For the academic patentees of UH and HUT these two spheres of life were not separate activities, but were carried out in parallel and usually inside the academic world. The individuals studied often had a true compound career where teaching, research and technological innovation activities were closely connected. Scientific and technological fields of university-based technology Activity in developing technological applications has varied significantly between different parts of the academic world. In some departments it was common practice while in others practically non-existent. For example, in the HUT departments of wood processing, mining and chemistry the share of patents per working scientists was approximately 1. 0 but in architecture only 0. 11. In the first three of the four departments research has materialised most as commercial applications. Mining, wood processing and chemical industries developed greatly in Finland during the 20 th century, and in each of them university scientists were also part of the modernisation process as developers of new technology. Scientists with a background in chemistry were the most active developers of technology. In HUT the share of chemists was 33 % of all academic patents. In UH they were responsible for 40 % of patented inventions. Another group of scientists active in developing commercial technology was physicists. They concentrated especially on devices and methods of measurement, analysis and control. Besides scientific fields there was also notable variation in academic patenting according to the individuals´ academic status. At least in light of patent statistics the development of commercial technology was more typical among experienced scientists than their junior colleagues. Of all academic groups professors clearly dominated patenting. Second big group was adjunct professors (docents), who in many cases had their primary careers outside the academic world. One of the key questions of current work is the technological quality of inventions developed by university scientists. As already noted, there is an obvious profile in the technological output of the scientists, and it becomes evident in the distribution of patents over different sectors of technology. Even though patents can be found in all patent groups, inventions relating to chemistry and metallurgy, human necessities and physics dominated academic patenting. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum are fixed constructions: scientists´ contribution was minimal in technology relating, for example, to the construction of roads, railways, bridges and structural elements of buildings. Some notable changes also occurred in the orientation of academic patenting during the 20 th century. The proportion of the two biggest groups of academic patents chemistry and metallurgy and human necessities were stable for most of the period studied. Changes occurred in groups for electricity and physics: in both fields the number of patented inventions started to grow at the end of the century. The increase was especially notable in physics: in the 1970 ´s and 1980 ´s UH and HUT scientists became active as developers of new measuring equipment and physics became the most active field in academic patenting. At the level of individual patent classes another clear change occurred in biotechnology; there are clear signs that during the 1990 ´s it became one of the most important fields of university-based technology. An important detail is that in patent group of physics it was not instruments of science that were patented, but applications for industrial or commercial purposes, which were often based on devices and methods with a scientific function. Thus, patenting of scientific measuring equipment was not considered necessary; patenting of commercial applications based on them was. Another typical feature relating to this technology for measurement, analysis and control is that it was developed across scientific boundaries. Scientists in several fields of natural sciences created different devices and methods. This explains why technology relating to measuring and testing was the biggest single patent class among university scientists during the 20 th century. Technology transfer and commercialisation of academic inventions A granted patent tells nothing about the importance of the technology developed. Only if inventions are transferred to markets and successfully commercialised can they become innovations of commercial and societal significance. In the case of academic patents it was possible to examine the level of technology transfer with the help of inventions, which patent rights ended up to company possession. It turned out that 57 % of the <b>patents</b> developed <b>inside</b> universities became company property. Even though this is only an indicative figure it suggests that the technological contribution of university scientists has not remained inside the ivory tower, but diffused for the use of society. It is more difficult to estimate what kind of financial value technology of university origin has had to the scientists themselves, to universities and to companies that put these inventions to use. It is impossible to examine the commercialisation of each academic patent and give an estimate about the financial profit they generated. However, the existing information about the monetary significance of the university-based technology is consistent: only a small share of North-American universities who have commercialised inventions developed in their sphere have benefited financially. This also applies to individual scientists in Europe: only a few have been able to gain substantially from their technological efforts. Nothing implies that the situation was any different in two Finnish universities during the 20 th century. Regardless of a few commercial success stories to be found among UH and HUT scientists´ academic patents, for the most participation in the development of commercial technology has not been profitable. Why? The fact is that only a small share of all new inventions become commercial successes; the majority disappear without leaving a trace in society. In the case of academic scientists three additional aspects can be found leading to a negative outcome: inexperience of academic scientists in the commercialisation of technology, absence of support mechanisms in that process and reluctance of scientists to participate actively in the further development and commercialisation of patented technology...|$|R
