25|$|In the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own homes, {{people are}} more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends {{on a number of}} considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people are}} often nude in the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home or garden, either alone or {{with members of the}} family; naturists {{normally}} refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.|$|E

25|$|Many Moriscos were {{suspected}} of practising Islam in secret, and the jealousy {{with which they}} guarded the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> domestic life prevented the verification of this suspicion. Initially they were not severely persecuted by the Inquisition, experiencing instead a policy of evangelization without torture, a policy not followed with those conversos who were {{suspected of}} being crypto-Jews. There were various reasons for this. Most importantly, in the kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon {{a large number of}} the Moriscos were {{under the jurisdiction of the}} nobility, and persecution would have been viewed as a frontal assault on the economic interests of this powerful social class. Still, fears ran high among the population that the Moriscos were traitorous, especially in Granada. The coast was regularly raided by Barbary pirates backed by Spain's enemy the Ottoman Empire, and the Moriscos were suspected of aiding them.|$|E

25|$|Many people regard visible tan {{lines as}} un-aesthetic, {{and seek to}} avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to {{maximize}} their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, tanners need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice. Some people tan in the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> backyard where they can at times tan without clothes, and some countries have set aside clothing-optional swimming areas (popularly known as nude beaches), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan topless, and others wear very brief swimwear, such as a microkini or thong.|$|E

25|$|On January 20, 2005, District Court Judge Gary L. Lancaster {{dropped the}} charges, agreeing {{with the defense}} that the federal anti-obscenity {{statutes}} were unconstitutional, as they violated a person's fundamental right to possess and view whatever they want in the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own home. As a fundamental right had been violated, the government had to establish that a compelling state interest was involved. The prosecution argued {{that the government had}} a legitimate interest in protecting adults from unwitting exposure to obscenity, and protecting children from exposure to obscenity. These arguments were rejected by the court, which also ruled that the federal obscenity laws were not narrow enough to meet these interests, and could not justify a complete ban on obscene material. Lancaster ruled that children and unwitting adults are protected from the content because the website requires a credit card to join, and because software is available by which parents can restrict children's access to Internet pornography. The court did agree with the government that Lawrence had not created a new broad fundamental right to engage in any private sexual conduct. Instead the court relied on Stanley, which had established there was a fundamental right to private possession of obscene material. The court did rely on Lawrence for its assertion that the government could not use public morality as a legitimate state interest which justified the infringement of consensual, adult, private sexual conduct. The court also made reference to the dissenting opinion of Justice Scalia, who said that Lawrence had questioned the validity of U.S. obscenity laws, since the government could not enforce a moral code of conduct. Judge Lancaster also cited numerous constitutional scholars who had observed that the Lawrence ruling calls federal obscenity laws into question.|$|E

[...] "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see." [...] Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he [...] "did not know where to begin". The characterization in La Cousine Bette is considered especially skillful. Anthony Pugh, in his book Balzac's Recurring Characters, says that the technique is employed [...] "for the most part without that feeling of self-indulgence that mars some of Balzac's later work. Almost every example arises quite naturally out of the situation." [...] Biographer Noel Gerson calls the characters in La Cousine Bette [...] "among the most memorable Balzac ever sketched".|$|E
500|$|In November 1539, Philip asked Bucer {{to produce}} a {{theological}} defence of bigamy, since {{he had decided to}} contract a bigamous marriage. Bucer reluctantly agreed, on condition the marriage be kept secret. Bucer consulted Luther and Melanchthon, and the three reformers presented Philip with a statement of advice (Wittenberger Ratschlag); later, Bucer produced his own arguments for and against bigamy. Although the document specified that bigamy could be sanctioned only under rare conditions, Philip took it as approval for his marriage to a lady-in-waiting of his sister. When rumours of the marriage spread, Luther told Philip to deny it, while Bucer advised him to hide his second wife and conceal the truth. Some scholars have noted a possible motivation for this notorious advice: the theologians believed they had advised Philip as a pastor would his parishioner, and that a lie was justified to guard the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> confessional counsel. [...] The scandal that followed the marriage caused Philip to lose political influence, and the Reformation within the Empire was severely compromised.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Privacy {{preserving}} {{data mining}} deals with hiding an individual’s sensitive identity without sacrificing the usability of data. It {{has become a}} very important area of concern but still this branch of research is in its infancy. People today have become well aware <b>of</b> the <b>privacy</b> intrusions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> sensitive data and are very reluctant to share their information. The major area of concern is that non-sensitive data even may deliver sensitive information, including personal information, facts or patterns. Several techniques <b>of</b> <b>privacy</b> preserving data mining have been proposed in literature. In this paper, we have studied all these state of art techniques. A tabular comparison of work done by different authors is presented. In our future work we will work on a hybrid of these techniques to preserve the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> sensitive data.
