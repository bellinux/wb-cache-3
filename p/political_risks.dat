25|$|These {{new forms}} of {{monetary}} interdependence made possible huge capital flows. During the Bretton Woods era, countries were reluctant to alter exchange rates formally even in cases of structural disequilibria. Because such changes had {{a direct impact on}} certain domestic economic groups, they came to be seen as <b>political</b> <b>risks</b> for leaders. As a result, official exchange rates often became unrealistic in market terms, providing a virtually risk-free temptation for speculators. They could move from a weak to a strong currency hoping to reap profits when a revaluation occurred. If, however, monetary authorities managed to avoid revaluation, they could return to other currencies with no loss. The combination of risk-free speculation with the availability of huge sums was highly destabilizing.|$|E

500|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity (CIRP) {{is found to}} hold when there is open capital mobility and limited capital controls, and this finding is confirmed for all currencies freely traded in the present day. One such example is when the United Kingdom and Germany abolished capital controls between 1979 and 1981. Maurice Obstfeld and Alan Taylor calculated hypothetical profits as implied by {{the expression of a}} potential inequality in the CIRP equation (meaning a difference in returns on domestic versus foreign assets) during the 1960s and 1970s, which would have constituted arbitrage opportunities if not for the prevalence of capital controls. However, given financial liberalization and resulting capital mobility, arbitrage temporarily became possible until equilibrium was restored. Since the abolition of capital controls in the United Kingdom and Germany, potential arbitrage profits have been near zero. Factoring in transaction costs arising from fees and other regulations, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting or nonexistent when such costs exceed deviations from parity. While CIRP generally holds, it does not hold with precision due to the presence of transaction costs, <b>political</b> <b>risks,</b> tax implications for interest earnings versus gains from foreign exchange, and differences in the liquidity of domestic versus foreign assets.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three substantive chapters (3, 4, 5) {{on the impact of}} <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> on equity and exchange rate returns and their volatilities. Chapter 3 proposes a framework for predicting market returns and volatility using changes in the country’s <b>political</b> <b>risk.</b> We identify the appropriate lag to to calculate changes over, and how the changes should be included in mean and volatility equations. The level of aggregation of <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> variable is also examined. Analysing 47 emerging and 21 developed markets, we find predictive power primarily for volatility of emerging markets, and recommended use of three <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> components which suitably capture important dimensions of political environment. In the Chapter 4 we empirically examines the impact of <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> on returns and volatility of individual firms and industry portfolios from New Zealand and Pakistan. The data used in the study consist of 184 firms from New Zealand and 202 firms from Pakistan along with country-level <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> data from the ICRG. As in the, we find in Chapter 3 that the impact of <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> is more on volatility than the returns of firms in both markets. As we expect, the impact of <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> is more on Pakistani firms compared to those in New Zealand. Overall, results from the industry portfolios are according to the hypothesis that <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> impact is different across industries (volatility increase for some industries and decrease for few). Chapter 5 examine the relationship between <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> variables on the nominal exchange rate return and its volatility. We again investigate developed versus developed markets, and also consider three different exchange rate regimes i. e. floating, managed floating and fixed. This is important to examine the link between <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> and exchange rate because there are two sources of <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> one {{on either side of the}} exchange rate. In our analysis, we use the <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> spread between the country of interest and the USA. Overall results reveal that emerging markets are more exposed to <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> compared to developed. Further, the impact of <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> variables is more on the floating exchange rate compared to managed floating and fixed exchange rate as might be expected, since intervention in the market will generally reduce to eliminate the influence of alternative factors.

2500|$|Although it {{has been}} {{estimated}} as having no more than 300 armed guerrilla members, the EZLN paralyzed the Mexican government, which balked at the <b>political</b> <b>risks</b> of direct confrontation. The major reason for this was that the rebellion caught the attention of the national and world press, as Marcos made full use of the then-new Internet to get the group's message out, putting the spotlight on indigenous issues in Mexico in general. Furthermore, the opposition press in Mexico City, especially La Jornada, actively supported the rebels. These factors encouraged the rebellion to go national. Many blamed the unrest on infiltration of leftists among the large Central American refugee population in Chiapas, and the rebellion opened up splits in the countryside between those supporting and opposing the EZLN. Zapatista sympathizers have included mostly Protestants and Word of God Catholics, opposing those [...] "traditionalist" [...] Catholics who practiced a syncretic form of Catholicism and indigenous beliefs. This split had existed in Chiapas since the 1970s, with the latter group supported by the caciques and others in the traditional power-structure.

50|$|Conclusion: Mitigating <b>Political</b> <b>Risks</b> in an Uncertain WorldThere {{are four}} main {{strategies}} {{to reduce the}} probability that a risk event will occur: eliminate the threat, minimize its likelihood, isolate the event, or completely avoid the risk.

A holistic approach to risk management—such as Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)—breaks down categories of risks and standardizes their analysis. However, many corporations fail to incorporate <b>political</b> <b>risks</b> into their risk management frameworks, either because they do not recognize the importance of <b>political</b> <b>risks</b> or they mistakenly think <b>political</b> <b>risks</b> are unpredictable.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} study is to determine if <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> analysis is of value for the political decision-maker and also how <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> can be identified and factored into political decision-making. Electricity supply in South Africa was used to test the assumptions and findings related to <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> and decision-making. <b>Political</b> <b>risk</b> analysis was also not used in the traditional way to determine economic, investment or business risk, but rather to determine if the methods underlying <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> analysis are of any value to political decision-makers in deciding policy and policy-actions. The value of this study lies in determining a systematic and representative body of information and practice on <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> analysis to serve as tool and guideline for <b>political</b> decision-making. <b>Political</b> <b>risk</b> is used in the context of political decision-making, based on informed decision-making with a sensitivity towards forecasting, anticipation and prioritising of decisions. Different approaches to <b>political</b> <b>risk,</b> focussing on effective systems functioning, early warning and traditional <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> analysis were selected. From this a framework for the analysis of policy decisions and actions related to electricity supply in South Africa was developed. The analysis determined that the negative consequences of flawed decisions can be prevented, or can at least be limited if informed decisions are taken, based on an understanding of possible future outcomes and the implications thereof. The study concludes that the analytical framework based on <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> analysis is a valuable tool to assist political decision-makers. The flexible analytical framework developed in this study provides evidence of the value and use of <b>political</b> <b>risk</b> analysis as a tool to assist political decision-makers, that will also have value in policy relevant areas such as the provision of water, youth unemployment, development and education in South Africa.
