5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic <b>pushing</b> <b>it</b> towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E

The {{domestic}} wide release in the US came on January 9, 2004, with the film appearing in 2,406 theaters and earning $13.81 million in its opening weekend. The film eventually grossed $66.81 million in U.S. totals and $56.11 million in foreign countries, {{with a total of}} $122.92 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in {{the cracks in the}} ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or <b>pushing</b> <b>it</b> with the head.|$|E

5|$|The storm quickly strengthened, being {{upgraded}} twice by the JMA on September 11, at 0600 UTC to {{a severe}} tropical storm and at 1800 UTC to a typhoon, becoming the seventh official typhoon of the season. It then {{took on a}} more north-northwesterly track, weakening while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle on September 14. However, it restrengthened, reaching its maximum intensity of 110 knots (205km/h, 125mph) from the JMA and 120knots (220km/h, 140mph) from the JTWC before passing Iriomote on September 15. Originally expected by the JTWC to pass {{to the east of}} Okinawa Island, a subtropical high-pressure ridge south of the main Japanese islands forced the storm to take a more westward track, <b>pushing</b> <b>it</b> towards Taiwan. Shortly later, Shanshan passed directly over Iriomote.|$|E
5|$|First {{displayed}} in June 2012 at Computex, the Zenbook Touch series has touch screens {{to take advantage}} of the Windows 8 operating system. The Zenbook Touch series includes the UX31A which is the same as the Zenbook Prime, but with a touch enabled screen, and the U500VZ, a 15inch model. A UX21A with a touch enabled screen was also demonstrated at Computex in June and officially announced in late August, though at the launch event on October23, 2012, only the UX31A and the U500VZ were displayed. The U500VZ is thicker than previous Zenbooks at 20mm (0.79") and uses a standard Ivy Bridge mobile processor rather than the ultra-low voltage CPUs used in other Zenbooks, thus technically <b>pushing</b> <b>it</b> out of the ultrabook category, although it still meets other ultrabook specifications. AnandTech reviewer Jason Inofuentes found the touch screen to be so superior to the trackpad that he stopped using the trackpad altogether in his trial of a Zenbook Touch at the Asus launch event. Chris Griffith of The Australian found that the screen of the UX31A responded well and that the Windows 8 gestures worked predictably, his only criticism being the high price.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm {{on top of}} a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and <b>pushing</b> <b>it</b> into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.|$|E

5|$|Throughout September {{and early}} October, Charles {{maintained}} his pressure on Moreau's army, <b>pushing</b> <b>it</b> {{further to the}} west. On 18 September, part of an Austrian division under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Petrasch swept from Karlsruhe, south to Kehl and stormed the Rhine bridgehead there; he succeeded in holding it, with high losses (about 2,000 of his 5,000 men were killed, wounded or missing). Immediately, though, General Schauenburg, the French garrison commander, counter-attacked and drove the Austrians back; the French lost 1,200 killed or wounded, and 800captured. Even though the French still held the crossing at Kehl and Strasbourg, Petrasch's Austrians prevented Moreau from using the crossing to escape to France, leaving as his only reliable route to France the bridge at Hüningen. If Moreau, at that point situated in Freiburg, withdrew too soon from the Breisgau, Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino 's column would be trapped there.|$|E

25|$|Kuhn {{illustrates}} how {{a paradigm shift}} later became possible when Galileo Galilei introduced his new ideas concerning motion. Intuitively, when an object is set in motion, it soon comes to a halt. A well-made cart may travel a long distance before it stops, but unless something keeps <b>pushing</b> <b>it,</b> it will eventually stop moving. Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of nature: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed. Given the knowledge available at the time, this represented sensible, reasonable thinking.|$|E
