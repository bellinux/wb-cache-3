The Eighth Five-Year Plan, while approved by the Congress, had to earn the approval of the National Assembly before being implemented.|$|E

5|$|Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 The Terrace, {{were built}} during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, {{also known as}} the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} and painted limestone walls.

25|$|Dive <b>{{planning}}</b> <b>is</b> {{the process}} of planning an underwater diving operation.

5|$|The marls was colonized by pioneer species, then {{shrubs and}} trees, {{corresponding}} to a primary succession. Without human intervention, a climax community would be reached.

5|$|The {{old town}} of Roskilde is centred around the main square, Stændertorvet, {{just south of}} the cathedral. The {{original}} street <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> preserved in nearby Skomagergade, Algade and Hestetorvet although most of the buildings were rebuilt after serious fires in the 18th century. The area is flanked to the north by two large parks, Byparken and Folkeparken, which stretch down to Roskilde Fjord.|$|E
5|$|This <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> viable only {{if certain}} {{conditions}} are met. The d7-square must {{be available for}} the Ne5, {{so that it can}} later transfer to f6. White should also not be able to easily advance the e3-pawn to e4, where it would be adequately defended by the Nc3 and a possible Bf3. Finally, White should not have the time to launch a quick attack on Black's castled position with the pawn thrust f4–f5–f6.|$|E

Set in rural Minnesota, A Simple Plan follows {{brothers}} Hank (Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Thornton), who, along with Jacob's friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), discover a crashed plane containing $4.4 million in cash. The three men {{go to great lengths}} to keep the money a secret but begin to doubt each other's trust, resulting in lies, deceit and murder.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery <b>Plan</b> <b>is</b> the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|An Environmental Protection Act in 1991 {{prohibited}} importing {{radioactive material}} for long-term storage or burial in Russia, but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage {{was passed by}} the Russian Parliament and signed by President Putin in 2001.
