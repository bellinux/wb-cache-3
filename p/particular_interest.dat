5|$|Of <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> is {{the fact}} that the Schechter Letter account of Oleg's death (namely, that he fled to and raided FRS, {{tentatively}} identified with Persia, and was slain there) bears remarkable parallels to the account of Arab historians such as Ibn Miskawayh, who described a similar Rus' attack on the Muslim state of Arran in the year 944/5.|$|E

5|$|These are of <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> {{because they}} are the first black holes {{discovered}} that were intermediate in mass between the conventional stellar-mass black hole and the supermassive black holes discovered at the cores of galaxies.

5|$|A keen geographer, Towner {{would often}} {{disappear}} into the bush for weeks on end, for study or exploration. As {{a fellow of the}} Royal Geographical Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> in researching the life of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the Australian Government to issue a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. He addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled Lake Eyre and its Tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of <b>particular</b> <b>interest.</b> Large-area mirrors, {{frequently}} with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors {{are used in}} optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|In 1536 Cleeve {{was closed}} by Henry VIII {{in the course}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the abbey was {{converted}} into a country house. Subsequently, the status of the site declined and the abbey was used as farm buildings until the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains. In the twentieth century Cleeve was taken into state care; the abbey is now looked after by English Heritage and is open to the public. Today Cleeve Abbey is one of the best-preserved medieval Cistercian monastic sites in Britain. While the church is no longer standing, the conventual buildings are still roofed and habitable and contain many features of <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> including the 'angel' roof in the refectory and the wall paintings in the painted chamber.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 {{the company}} moved its Cardiff venue to the Sophia Gardens Pavilion (built for the Festival of Britain), with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra as the company's orchestra, {{replacing}} the previous ad hoc ensemble. The Pavilion was acoustically mediocre and lacked an orchestra pit; {{two years later}} the company moved again, to the New Theatre where it played Cardiff seasons across the next fifty years. The 1952 season attracted <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> because it included {{what was then a}} rarity: Verdi's Nabucco. The company built a reputation for staging seldom-seen Verdi works, including The Sicilian Vespers staged in the same year, I Lombardi in 1956, and The Battle of Legnano, under the shortened title The Battle, in 1960. The 1952 Nabucco was the WNO's first production for which costumes and scenery were specially designed (by Patrick Robertson) rather than hired.|$|E

40|$|Politics and {{economics}} are inextricably linked. Government establishes and enforces {{the rules of}} the game for the economy, thereby determining not only how much wealth is created, but also how wealth is distributed across society. The primary question of political economy is easily stated: for whose benefit does government set the rules? This paper examines the fundamental conflict of interest between maximizing the wealth of a nation, versus maximizing the wealth of <b>particular</b> <b>interests.</b> The same distortions and deceptions have been used for centuries to obscure how government sets {{the rules of the}} game to benefit <b>particular</b> <b>interests.</b> political economy; rules of the game...|$|R
