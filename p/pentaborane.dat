50|$|Decaborane, like <b>pentaborane,</b> is a {{powerful}} toxin affecting the central nervous system, although decaborane is less toxic than <b>pentaborane.</b> It can be absorbed through skin. It forms an explosive mixture with carbon tetrachloride, which caused an often mentioned explosion in a Malta, New York, manufacturing facility in 1948 when CCl4 was used to clean the equipment.|$|E

50|$|William J. Evans is a {{distinguished}} chemistry {{professor at the}} University of California Irvine who specialises {{in the fields of}} inorganic and organometallic chemistry. He was born in Wisconsin where he also completed his undergraduate studies. He received his Bachelor’s degree in 1969 after focusing on research into <b>pentaboranes.</b> After the completion of his undergraduate studies he attended The University of California, Los Angeles where he obtained his PhD in 1973 for his research into metallocarboranes. He then spent some time at Cornell University where he completed his postdoctoral research in transition metal phosphite complexes. In 1975, Evans arrived at the University of Chicago where he decided to begin research into actinides and lanthanides1. He moved to the University of California, Irvine in 1983 where he has remained ever since1.Evans has won many accolades which include the ACS Award in Inorganic Chemistry in 2005 and the prestigious Tolman award in 2014 for his research in the field of coordination chemistry of the late elements. Evans has a particular interest in meeting the global energy demand. His research focuses on the role that actinides and lanthanides can play in these processes3. Evans and his research group believe that the unique properties displayed by these rare metals, could help to solve global problems through potential new catalysis and improved processes.|$|R
50|$|Occupational {{exposure}} {{limits for}} <b>pentaborane</b> {{set by the}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health stand at 0.005 ppm (0.01 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average, with a short-term exposure limit of 0.015 ppm (0.03 mg/m3). The acute toxicity of <b>pentaborane</b> has caused it to be considered immediately dangerous to life and health, with a limit set at 1 ppm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentaborane,</b> {{also called}} pentaborane(9) to {{distinguish}} it from pentaborane(11) (B5H11), is an inorganic compound with the formula B5H9. It {{is one of the}} most common boron hydride clusters, although it is a highly reactive compound. Because of its high reactivity toward oxygen, it was once evaluated as rocket or jet fuel. Like many of the smaller boron hydrides, <b>pentaborane</b> is colourless, diamagnetic, and volatile.|$|E
50|$|This <b>pentaborane</b> was {{considered}} {{for use as}} a fuel by North American Aviation when the XB-70 Valkyrie was in the planning stages, but the aircraft ended up using hydrocarbon fuel instead. <b>Pentaborane</b> was also investigated {{to be used as a}} bipropellant with nitrogen tetroxide. In the Soviet Union, Valentin Glushko used it for the experimental RD-270M rocket engine, under development between 1962 and 1970.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>pentaborane</b> is extensive. Halogenation give the symmetrical derivatives B5H8X, {{which can be}} isomerised to place the halide {{on the base of}} the square pyramid. With strong bases such as alkyl lithium reagents, it can be deprotonated and the resulting lithium salts react with diverse electrophiles to give substituted derivatives. It is Lewis acidic, forming double adducts with two equivalents of trimethylphosphine. <b>Pentaborane</b> is used for the synthesis of other boron hydride clusters.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pentaborane</b> was {{evaluated}} {{by both the}} U.S. and Russian armed services as a so-called [...] "exotic fuel". Because simple boron compounds burn with a characteristic green flame, the nickname for this fuel in the U.S. industry was [...] "Green Dragon". In terms of heat of combustion, <b>pentaborane</b> surpasses its equivalent carbon compounds because their self-linking element, carbon, weighs more than one atomic mass unit more than an atom of boron, and some boranes contain more hydrogen than the carbon equivalent. The ease of breaking the chemical bonds of the compound is also taken into consideration.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} boranes are diborane B2H6 {{and two of}} its pyrolysis products, <b>pentaborane</b> B5H9 and decaborane B10H14. A large number of anionic boron hydrides are known, e.g. B12H122−.|$|E

50|$|Another {{high yield}} method heats {{triethylamine}} borane with diborane at {{a temperature of}} 180 °C. Yet another heats <b>pentaborane</b> at 125° with the same triethylamine borane. In both cases the dodecaborate salt of trimethylamine is produced.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{threshold}} odor of <b>pentaborane</b> is 194 PEL; {{and if it}} concentration is only 10 PEL, one cannot timely change cartridges with using smell - they could be [...] "used" [...] forever (but they cannot protect forever).|$|E
5000|$|It {{was first}} {{prepared}} by Alfred Stock by pyrolysis of diborane at about 200 °C. An improved synthesis starts from salts of B3H8−, which {{is converted to}} the bromide B3H7Br− using HBr. Pyrolysis of this bromide gives <b>pentaborane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Contemporaneously {{with the}} {{development}} of metal cluster compounds, numerous boron hydrides were discovered by Alfred Stock and his successors who popularized the use of vacuum-lines for the manipulation of these often volatile, air-sensitive materials. Clusters of boron are boranes such as <b>pentaborane</b> and decaborane. Composite clusters containing CH and BH vertices are carboranes.|$|E
50|$|From 1962 - 1978, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) {{undertook}} a classified program (declassified in 1993) {{to develop a}} family of missiles called SCRAM (Supersonic Combustion RAmjet Missile). They were intended to fit on to the Talos MK12 launcher system or the Terrier MK10 launcher. Testing of engine modules in a direct-connect, and a free-jet, facility took place {{at a variety of}} Mach numbers and pressures (altitudes). These included Mach 4 (24,000 ft), Mach 5.3 (46,000 ft), Mach 7.8 (67,000 ft) and Mach 10 (88,000 ft). Tests showed that acceptable combustion efficiency was only achieved with over 20% <b>pentaborane</b> (B5H9) in MCPD (C12H16). Tests with pure <b>pentaborane</b> (HiCal) showed that a net thrust could be achieved at Mach 7. An accelerative capability equivalent to 11g was observed for Mach 5 flight at sea level.|$|E
5000|$|Problems {{with this}} fuel include its {{toxicity}} and its characteristic of bursting into flame on {{contact with the}} air. Furthermore, its exhaust (when used in a jet engine) would also be toxic. Long after the <b>pentaborane</b> was considered unworkable, the total United States stock of the chemical, 1900 pounds, was destroyed in the year 2000, when a safe and inexpensive means for doing so was finally engineered. The process used hydrolysis with steam, yielding hydrogen and a boric acid solution. The system was nicknamed [...] "Dragon Slayer".|$|E
50|$|Interest in this {{substance}} {{began as}} a possible fuel for high-speed jets. The propellant mix that would produce the greatest specific impulse for a rocket motor is sometimes given as oxygen difluoride and <b>pentaborane.</b> During {{the early years of}} the space race and the missile gap, American rocket engineers thought they could more cheaply produce a rocket that would compete with the Soviets by using an existing first stage and putting an upper stage with an engine that produces thrust at a very high specific impulse atop it. So projects were begun to investigate this fuel.|$|E
5000|$|In chemistry, boranes {{comprise}} {{a large group}} of the group 13 hydride compounds with the generic formula of BxHy. Due to the high affinity of boron for oxygen, these compounds do not occur in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, the lighter explode violently. The class is named after the parent chemical called [...] "borane" [...] itself, chemical formula BH3. This compound is only known to exist as a transient intermediate since it dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral. In addition to the charge-neutral boranes, a large number of anionic boron hydrides are known. The most important boranes are diborane B2H6 and two of its pyrolysis products, <b>pentaborane</b> B5H9 and decaborane B10H14. The development of the chemistry of boron hydrides led to new experimental techniques and theoretical concepts. Boron hydrides have been studied as potential fuels, for rockets and for automotive uses, but the only commercial applications involve derivatives of borane.|$|E
