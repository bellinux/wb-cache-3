40|$|Fullerenes, {{the family}} of large, all-carbon, cage-like molecules, promise to launch an array of new products.

Fullerenes are produced commercially via the arc vaporization of graphite, a method which is limited to low production rates and low scale-up potential. In this work, a new process was developed in which fullerenes are produced via the thermal plasma dissociation of hydrocarbons. The process is attractive due to its potential for large scale fullerene production. Tetrachloroethylene (C 2 Cl 4) {{was selected as the}} carbon source for fullerene synthesis, due to the instability of C-Cl bonds in the high temperature zone predicted for fullerene formation. The effect of input electrical power, C 2 Cl 4 feed rate and reactor pressure on fullerene formation and collection was studied. The temperature profile and its effect on the residence time of reactive species in the temperature zone required for fullerene formation was found to {{play a critical role in}} the production of fullerenes. With the present reactor configuration, an input power in excess of 55 kW was required for the treatment of up to 0. 54 mol/min of C 2 Cl 4. High C 2 Cl 4 feed rates resulted in a lower conversion of C 2 Cl 4 to fullerenes. Lower reactor pressures (200 and 300 torr) resulted in higher fullerene yields as compared to results obtained at 400 torr.

Once {{thought of as}} novel curiosities due to their structure and bonding, carboranes have now been applied in many diverse fields, from medicine to nanoscale engineering. Of particular interest is the icosahedral monocarba-closo-dodecaborate(-) (HCB 11 H 11 anion) carborane and its derivatives due to their many unique properties. This type of carborane {{is well known for}} its extremely low nucleophilicity and considered the most weakly coordinating of all known anions. Also, these carboranes are extremely difficult to oxidize and most are stable to the most aggressive reagents. Because of these unique properties, we explore the use of functionalized carboranes as ligand R-groups in transition metal complexes for their eventual application in catalysis. Organic azides are invaluable building blocks for synthetic chemists. Herein we report the synthesis of various carboranyl azides and some unusual reactivity during the carboranyl azide synthesis. The synthesis and characterization of the parent carboranyl azide (Li+N 3 CB 11 H 11 -) hexabrominated carboranyl azide (Li+N 3 CB 11 Br 6 -), the perbrominated carboranyl azide (Li+N 3 CB 11 Br 11 -), and the <b>perchlorinated</b> carboranyl azide (Li+N 3 CB 11 Cl 11 -) are reported.

40|$|We {{report on}} a spectroscopic multitechnique {{approach}} to study the metal/radical spinterface formed by a <b>perchlorinated</b> trityl radical derivative and either gold or silver. The spectroscopic fingerprint of their paramagnetic properties could be determined by comparison with their diamagnetic precursor and by DFT calculations. Thanks to the presented approach, we could gain unprecedented insight into the radical–metal interaction and how this latter perturbs the spin polarization and consequently the magnetoelectronic properties of the radical adlayer. Knowledge of the factors influencing the spinterface is an essential tool toward the tailoring of the properties of spin-based electronic devices.

40|$|Degradation of {{trichloroethylene}} (TCE) by the methanotrophic bacterium Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b was {{studied by}} using cells grown in continuous culture. TCE degradation was a strictly cometabolic process, requiring {{the presence of}} a cosubstrate, preferably formate, and oxygen. M. trichosporium OB 3 b cells degraded TCE only when grown under copper limitation and when the soluble methane monooxygenase was derepressed. During TCE degradation, nearly total dechlorination occurred, as indicated by the production of inorganic chloride, and only traces of 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethanol and trichloroacetaldehyde were produced. TCE degradation proceeded according to first-order kinetics from 0. 1 to 0. 0002 mM TCE with a rate constant of 2. 14 ml min- 1 mg of cells- 1. TCE concentrations above 0. 2 mM inhibited degradation in cell suspensions of 0. 42 mg of cells ml- 1. Other chlorinated aliphatics were also degraded by M. trichosporium OB 3 b. Dichloromethane, chloroform, 1, 1 -dichloroethane, and 1, 2 -dichloroethane were completely degraded, with the release of stoichiometric amounts of chloride. trans- 1, 2 -Dichloroethylene, cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene, and 1, 2 -dichloropropane were completely converted, but not all the chloride was released because of the formation of chlorinated intermediates, e. g., trans- 2, 3 -dichlorooxirane, cis- 2, 3 -dichlorooxirane, and 2, 3 -dichloropropanol, respectively. 1, 1, 1 -Trichloroethane, 1, 1 -dichloroethylene, and 1, 3 -dichloropropylene were incompletely converted, and the first compound yielded 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethanol as a chlorinated intermediate. The two <b>perchlorinated</b> compounds tested, carbon tetrachloride and tetrachloroethylene, were not converted. ...|$|E
40|$|During pyrolytic {{separation}} of aluminium from Al/plastics combinations at 600 C aluminium reacts {{in case of}} long gas residence times with HCl split off from PVC to form the catalytically active Lewis acid AlCl_ 3 with an almost stoichiometric yield. Pyrolysis experiments of different scales - micropyrolysis (Py-GC, EGA-FTIR (#mu#g)), thermoanalysis (mg), flow and batch reactors (g) -have been run using admixtures of Lewis acids with graded Lewis acidity, namely AlCl_ 3, GaCl_ 3, FeCl_ 3, BiCl_ 3, SbCl_ 3 and ZnCl_ 2, as well as CuCl to investigate systematically the effect of metal chlorides on the thermal decomposition of PVC, particularly on the formation of aromatics, PAH and chlorinated organics. Quantitative analyses of PAH in the condensate and the char were carried out with GC-FID and HPLC/Fluorescence. Methyl-PAH, mainly naphthalenes and at lower concentrations phenanthrenes and anthracenes, were determined with HPLC/UV. Chlorobenzenes and PCB were quantified with GC-EC, dioxins with GC-MS. The yield of char increases with the percentage of metal chlorides approaching finally a maximum value increasing with Lewis acidity. The yield of PAH and methyl-PAH, on the other hand, tends nearly exponentially to a minimum value decreasing practically to zero with increasing Lewis acidity. In addition to the thermodynamically stable <b>perchlorinated</b> products as there are hexachlorobenzene and decachlorobiphenyl also pentachlorobenzene and smaller amounts of PCB 206 and 208 as well as polychlorinated dioxins were identified. No significant dependence {{on the amount of}} metal chlorides was observed. (orig.)

40|$|We {{report an}} {{approach}} – named chemTEM – to follow chemical transformations at the single-molecule {{level with the}} electron beam of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) applied as both a tuneable source of energy and a sub-Angstrom imaging probe. Deposited on graphene, disk-shaped perchlorocoronene molecules are precluded from intermolecular interactions. This allows monomolecular transformations to be studied at the single-molecule level in real time and reveals chlorine elimination and reactive aryne formation as a key initial stage of multi-step reactions initiated by the 80 keV e-beam. Under the same conditions, perchlorocoronene confined within a nanotube cavity, where the molecules are situated in very close proximity to each other, enables imaging of intermolecular reactions, starting with the Diels Alder cycloaddition of a generated aryne, followed by rearrangement of the angular adduct to a planar polyaromatic structure {{and the formation of}} a <b>perchlorinated</b> zigzag nanoribbon of graphene as the final product. ChemTEM enables the entire process of polycondensation, including the formation of metastable intermediates, to be captured in a one-shot ‘movie’. A molecule with a similar size and shape but with a different chemical composition, octathio[8]circulene, under the same conditions undergoes another type of polycondensation via thiyl biradical generation and subsequent reaction leading to polythiophene nanoribbons with irregular edges incorporating bridging sulphur atoms. Graphene or carbon nanotubes supporting the individual molecules during chemTEM studies ensure that the elastic interactions of the molecules with the e-beam are the dominant forces that initiate and drive the reactions we image. Our ab initio DFT calculations explicitly incorporating the e-beam in the theoretical model correlate with the chemTEM observations and give a mechanism for direct control not only of the type of the reaction but also of the reaction rate. Selection of the appropriate e-beam energy and control of the dose rate in chemTEM enabled imaging of reactions on a timeframe commensurate with TEM image capture rates, revealing atomistic mechanisms of previously unknown processes...|$|E
40|$|Great deal of {{research}} has shown that catalytic and non-catalytic thermal decomposition (pyrolysis and oxidation) of chlorinated alkanes and alkenes results in the formation of heavier cyclic chlorinated pollutants. Central to these processes is the Diels-Alder addition/cyclisation of small chlorinated carbon chains and the successive replacement of hydrogen atoms in cyclic compounds by chlorine atoms at high temperatures. Polychlorinated benzenes, dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) are formed during the heterogeneous reactions of propene on fly-ash in the presence of air and HCl between 623 - 673 K. Formation of PCDD/F from thermal oxidation of polychlorinated phenol has been demonstrated to proceed at a rate 100 times faster than the competing de novo pathway. High temperature pyrolysis of 1, 3 -hexachlorobutadiene concludes in the production of hexachlorobenzene (C 6 Cl 6) and other highly chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons. Along the same line of enquiry, experimental results have explained that unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as acetylene are readily converted to hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorobutadiene and other heavier <b>perchlorinated</b> species in the presence of cupric oxide and HCl under post combustion conditions. Taylor et al. observed the pyrolysis of hexachloropropene to occur readily, even at temperatures as low as 700 K to yield CCl 4, C 2 Cl 4, C 2 Cl 6 and C 3 Cl 4 (tetrachloroallene). At higher temperatures (up to 1223 K), distinct molecular growth was observed with reaction products including C 4 Cl 6 (1, 3 -hexachlorobutadiene), C 6 Cl 6 (hexachlorobenzene), C 6 Cl 8 (1, 3, 5 -octachlorohexatriene), C 8 Cl 8 (octachlorostyrene), possible other isomers of C 6 Cl 8, C 8 Cl 8 and four isomers of C 12 Cl 8. Cl displacement of CCl 3 radicals was observed to be the overriding origination pathway for conversion of C 3 Cl 6 into C 2 Cl 4, CCl 4 and C 2 Cl 6. At higher temperatures, C 3 Cl 3 recombination accounted for about 80...|$|E
