5000|$|In regular DSL, a cable {{runs from}} the {{telephone}} switch {{to a piece of}} equipment called a Plain Old Telephone Service (<b>POTS)</b> <b>splitter.</b> This splitter separates the DSL and voice bands. Thus the customer will have a dial tone, which allows them to use the telephone line as a regular land line while they are using it to access the Internet on their computer. A cable carrying both services {{runs from the}} splitter to the cable head, where it continues on to the customer on outside plant. (See DSLAM.) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the theory behind}} the "coil-enhancement" principle: The impedance of an inductor is made controllable {{as a function of}} the frequency by means of a transconductance function g(m) (s) that is located in the feedback loop. In order to show the potential of the coil-enhancement circuit, the effect of several basic transconductance functions onto the synthesized impedance is presented. The specific case of g(m) (s) similar to s(- 1) produces the coil-enhancement situation and is discussed in detail. One drawback of the coil-enhancement circuit is found in the series resistance of a second inductor, also positioned in the feedback loop. The influence of this series resistance onto the synthesized impedance is addressed and a work-around is presented. A newly developed active "plain old telephone service" (<b>POTS)</b> <b>splitter,</b> based upon the coil-enhancement principle, is derived from a fully passive <b>POTS</b> <b>splitter</b> in which two large inductors are merged together into one active inductor. The active <b>POTS</b> <b>splitter</b> is fully tested and is found compliant with the standard "TS 101 952 - 1 - 1 V 1. 2. 1 (option A) " of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. The area reduction that comes together with the passive-to-active conversion is 40 %...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of the size difference that can be expected between splitters designed for ADSL and VDSL suggests {{that the goal of}} a universal <b>POTS</b> <b>splitter</b> is impractical. These considerations, which are independent of the question of VDSL line code, cast some doubt on the economic attractiveness of the scalable DSL concept. ________________________________________________________ 1. Introduction Evolving xDSL deployments demand spectral compatibility between several existing telephone and data services. VDSL, ADSL, ISDN and POTS are of major importance and must be able to co-exist in the same cable plant. This co-existence is allowed by the use of splitting filtrs, {{an essential part of the}} hardware for an xDSL service. A universal splitter designed to separate POTS and ISDN from all high-frequency band services, both ADSL and VDSL, would at first seem to be an attractive idea, and very helpful to the concept of a scalable DSL. However, on further examination, it becomes apparent [...] ...|$|E
