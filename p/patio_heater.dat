50|$|Patio heaters {{have become}} popular with bars and {{restaurants}} since they extend {{the day and the}} season for their customers to sit outdoors. This increase in the popularity of the <b>patio</b> <b>heater</b> has led to concerns over their environmental effects. One <b>patio</b> <b>heater</b> can produce four tons of carbon dioxide annually.|$|E
50|$|A <b>patio</b> <b>heater</b> (also {{called a}} {{mushroom}} or umbrella heater) is a radiant heating appliance for generating thermal radiation for outdoor use.|$|E
50|$|A burner {{on top of}} a post, burns {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG), propane or butane, and directs the flames against a perforated metal screen. Heat is radiated {{from the surface of the}} screen in a circular pattern around the appliance. A reflector atop the burner reflects heat that would be otherwise lost upwards. This is because the reflecting hood is usually silvered which makes it a poor absorber/emitter of heat but excellent at reflecting infra-red radiation back. This reduces the amount of heat lost by conduction as silvered surfaces will not absorb infra-red light. The chimenea is an alternative to the <b>patio</b> <b>heater</b> for home use, which burns wood instead of gas.|$|E
25|$|According to Sky News, the gas {{cylinders}} contained propane, used for <b>patio</b> <b>heaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some newer {{types of}} <b>patio</b> <b>heaters</b> are {{electrically}} powered radiative heaters that emit infrared energy onto nearby surfaces, {{which in turn}} heat up the surrounding air.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} the {{overhead}} radiant <b>heaters</b> are the <b>patio</b> <b>heaters</b> often used with outdoor serving. The top metal disc reflects the radiant heat onto a small area.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the methods and}} tools that will guide in the design analysis {{of the role of}} materials and processes selection in terms of embodied energy, carbon foot print, recycle fraction, toxicity and sustainability criteria. As engineers we need to use our particular skills to guide design decisions that minimize or eliminate adverse eco impacts. The CES EduPack software is used in this study for better understanding of these issues, create material charts, perform materials and processes selection, and eco audit or life cycle analysis allowing alternative design choices to meet the engineering requirements and reduce the environmental burden. The results of the life cycle analysis of <b>patio</b> <b>heater</b> and 2 MW wind turbine are presented in this paper...|$|E
50|$|Outdoor heating {{allows people}} to stay in {{substantially}} unenclosed spaces, when it would otherwise be too cold to do so. To this end, various outdoor heating appliances are available, including gas <b>patio</b> <b>heaters,</b> quartz or ceramic electric lamps, and wood burning chimenea and fire pits.|$|R
5000|$|Gavron has criticised <b>patio</b> <b>heaters,</b> {{calling them}} [...] "an indulgence too far". In {{an article for}} the Guardians Comment is Free site she asked, [...] "Why not wear a jumper and enjoy fresh air, not a {{cocktail}} of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and goodness knows what else." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Patio</b> <b>heaters</b> {{are used}} to enable people to sit outside at night or in cold weather. They can be {{permanently}} mounted on eaves and patio roofs, or portable and self-supporting. They can operate on electricity, propane, bottled butane (small units), or natural gas. The latter can be plumbed into permanent locations or attached to 'quick-connect' outlets.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{gas heater}} {{made use of}} the same {{principles}} of the Bunsen burner invented in the previous year. It was first commercialized by the English company Pettit and Smith in 1856. The flame heats the air locally. This heated air then spreads by convection, thus heating the whole room. Today the same principle applies with outdoor <b>patio</b> <b>heaters</b> or [...] "mushroom heaters" [...] which act as giant Bunsen burners.|$|R
50|$|Garden {{furniture}} may {{range from}} a patio set consisting of a table, four or six chairs and a parasol, through benches, swings, various lighting, to stunning artifacts in brutal concrete or weathered oak. <b>Patio</b> <b>heaters,</b> that run on bottled butane or propane, are often used to enable people to sit outside at night or in cold weather. A picnic table, {{is used for the}} purpose of eating a meal outdoors such as in a garden.|$|R
50|$|Known {{mostly for}} its {{exchange}} of 20-pound barbeque grill tanks, Blue Rhino boasts other product lines. Global Sourcing, a company acquired by Blue Rhino in 2000, is the world's largest supplier of barbeque grills. Its products are sold across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Global Sourcing products include Uniflame-branded barbeque grills, {{as well as}} <b>patio</b> <b>heaters,</b> outdoor fireplaces, mosquito eliminators, charcoal and electric grills, and indoor fireplaces sold under SkeeterVac, Endless Summer, and other private labels.|$|R
25|$|According to Sky News, the gas {{cylinders}} contained propane, used for <b>patio</b> <b>heaters.</b> A second bomb was later {{found in a}} blue Mercedes-Benz 280E {{believed to have been}} left in the same area at around the same time. The illegally parked car received a parking ticket in Cockspur Street at 02:30. At about 03:30 the car was transported to the Park Lane car pound. Staff left the car in a public area after smelling petrol fumes and alerted police on hearing about the first bomb.|$|R
5000|$|Monbiot {{believes}} that drastic action coupled with strong political will {{is needed to}} combat global warming. Monbiot has written that climate change is the [...] "moral question of the 21st century" [...] {{and that there is}} an urgent need for a number of emergency actions he believes will stop climate change, including: setting targets on greenhouse emissions using the latest science; issuing every citizen with a [...] "personal carbon ration"; new building regulations with houses built to German passivhaus standards; banning incandescent light bulbs, <b>patio</b> <b>heaters,</b> garden floodlights, and other inefficient technologies and wasteful applications; constructing large offshore wind farms; replacing the national gas grid with a hydrogen pipe network; a new national coach network to make journeys using public transport faster than using a car; all petrol stations to supply leasable electric car batteries with stations equipped with a crane service to replace depleted batteries; scrap road-building and road-widening programmes, redirecting their budgets to tackle climate change; reduce UK airport capacity by 90 percent; closing down all out-of-town superstores and replacing them with warehouses and a delivery system.|$|R
