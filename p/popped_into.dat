The Rangers avoided elimination in game four, as Chris Kreider scored at 07:03 of overtime, redirecting Rick Nash's shot into the Bruins net, giving New York a 4–3 victory. But Boston was victorious in game five, 3–1, scoring three unanswered goals, including two from Gregory Campbell.|$|E

A riff <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> Chris Martin's mind late one night in Liverpool {{when he came into}} the studio, where he then developed it on piano. According to Martin, [...] "Clocks" [...] was inspired by the English rock band Muse. Martin presented the riff to the band's guitarist, Jonny Buckland, who then added a layer of guitar chords to the basic track: [...] "He picked up his guitar [...] and played these brilliant chords... It was like a chemical reaction process." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for Satisfied began {{soon after}} the release of DecembeRadio and {{occurred}} in spurts, as the band found more success in letting ideas come to them spontaneously than in meeting for dedicated writing sessions. [...] The chorus melody of [...] "Be Alright", for example, <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> bassist and lead singer Josh Reedy's head while showering. [...] On another occasion, Reedy came up with a riff on GarageBand while traveling between gigs. [...] Two of the earliest completed songs, [...] "Satisfy Me" [...] and [...] "Find You Waiting", were included in the band's live shows by April 2008.

I started playing around on the piano with these chords and did a key change, and then I knew, 'OK, this is magic.'"

500|$|The {{members of}} the band {{reportedly}} spent afternoons getting stoned and watching Three Stooges reruns. One day, they had a post-Stooges meeting {{to try to come}} up with a name.

The name had <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> his head after listening to Harry Nilsson's album Aerial Ballet, which featured jacket art of a circus performer jumping out of a biplane. Initially, Kramer's bandmates were unimpressed; they all thought he was referring to the Sinclair Lewis novel they were required to read in high school English class. [...] "No, not Arrowsmith," [...] Kramer explained. [...] "A-E-R-O...Aerosmith." [...] The band settled upon this name after also considering [...] "the Hookers" [...] and [...] "Spike Jones." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1989, Zomba asked Dickinson {{to produce}} a track for the movie , {{providing}} a budget, a studio, and a producer, Chris Tsangarides. Dickinson took up the opportunity and called {{an old friend of}} his, former Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, and, shortly after meeting up, they had [...] "Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter" [...] ready for the studio, then recorded with the assistance of bassist Andy Carr, and drummer Fabio del Rio. [...] "I wrote it in about three minutes", states Dickinson, [...] "I don't know where the title 'Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter' came from, but it just <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> my head. I thought, 'Bloody hell, straight out of AC/DC!' And I thought, Nightmare on Elm Street. Yeah, that'll do.' Impressed with the results, Zomba asked Dickinson if he was willing to record a whole album as well. With the same line-up and producer, Dickinson's solo debut, Tattooed Millionaire, was written and recorded within two weeks, and released in May 1990, followed by a supporting tour.|$|E

500|$|... "Yellow" [...] {{was written}} in [...] Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after {{finishing}} recording [...] "Shiver", the band took a break and {{went out of the}} studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started off a lot slower", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, [...] "and it sort of got a bit heavier".|$|E
500|$|American {{songwriter}} {{and producer}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart convened with Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash and Kuk Harrell in January 2007 at the Atlanta-based Triangle Studios {{to create new}} material. In the studio, Stewart was [...] "messing around with a walloping hi-hat sound", which he found in the free music software GarageBand, which is included in all Mac computers. With his attention caught by the sound, Nash asked Stewart what he was doing: [...] "Oh, my Gosh, what is that beat?". When Stewart incorporated chords onto the hi-hat, [...] "immediately the word <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> [...] head"; {{he went to the}} vocal booth and started singing. Nash wrote the first two verses and the chorus over Stewart's skeleton track. They quickly wrote the lyrics, completing the first verse in 60 seconds. They continued into writing, adding the hook while [...] " [...] would put the next chord". In a matter of hours, they had recorded a demo of the track. The song was written with American pop singer Britney Spears in mind, whom Stewart had previously worked with on her 2003 single [...] "Me Against the Music". Stewart and Nash thought that Spears, who had [...] "her personal life... a little out of control" [...] at the time, needed a hit as musical comeback. Spears was working on her fifth album, Blackout, so they sent a copy of the demo to Spears' management. However, Spears did not hear of the song because her label rejected it, claiming they had enough songs for her to record.|$|E
500|$|Author Yoshihiro Togashi {{stated that}} he began working on Yu Yu Hakusho {{during a period of}} time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and {{illustrate}} a manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing Yu Yu Hakusho, {{he did not have a}} clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title [...] "How to be a Ghost" [...] while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed [...] "YuYu-Ki (Poltergeist Chronicles)" [...] for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. Because a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, Togashi quickly created an alternative: [...] "YuYu Hakusho (Poltergeist Report)". He commented that he could have used [...] "Den (Legend)" [...] or [...] "Monogatari (Story)", but [...] "Hakusho (Report)" [...] was the first thing that came to his mind. He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. [...] "Yusuke Urameshi" [...] is a pun, [...] "Kazuma Kuwabara" [...] is a combination of two professional baseball players, and [...] "Hiei" [...] and [...] "Kurama" [...] are [...] "just names that <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> [...] head". When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.|$|E

2500|$|Festivus was {{conceived}} by author and editor Daniel O'Keefe, {{the father of}} TV writer Dan O'Keefe, and was celebrated by his family as early as 1966.

In the original O'Keefe tradition, the holiday would take place to celebrate the anniversary of Daniel O'Keefe's first date with his future wife, Deborah.

2500|$|They did slapstick, reeled off old {{vaudeville}} jokes, and did {{whatever else}} <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> their heads. The audience laughed. This success {{led to a}} series of well-paying engagements on the Eastern seaboard, culminating in a run at New York's Copacabana. The act consisted of Lewis interrupting and heckling Martin while he was trying to sing, with the two ultimately chasing each other around the stage. The secret, both said, is that they ignored the audience and played to each other. The team made its TV debut on the first broadcast of CBS-TV network's The Ed Sullivan Show (then called [...] "The Toast Of The Town) on June 20, 1948, with composers Rodgers and Hammerstein also appearing. [...] Hoping to improve their act, the two hired young comedy writers Norman Lear and Ed Simmons to write their bits.

2500|$|In 1992, guitarist Dan Hoerner and bassist Nate Mendel {{met when}} they became housemates at the University of Washington. After jam sessions, they decided to form a band and sought a drummer, {{eventually}} deciding to invite William Goldsmith. Goldsmith played in many bands but decided to join the duo's project. They released a demo tape under the name [...] "Empty Set". Post-release, the band changed their name from Empty Set to Chewbacca Kaboom, upon realization that a band with the name Empty Set already existed. However, when another demo tape was released, the new name earned them little attention, and it was yet again subject to change, this time to 'One Day I Stopped Breathing'. The band eventually settled on the name Sunny Day Real Estate. Mendel stated the band's name [...] "was just a random thought that <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> my head that came from a Talking Heads song, '(Nothing But) Flowers'". He felt that since the band's outlook on the world saw that every possible thing was becoming a commodity to be bought and sold, {{it was possible that}} one day, people would even start selling sunny days. The lyrics made him ponder about what could be sold as property, and come up with the commercialization of sunny days.|$|E
