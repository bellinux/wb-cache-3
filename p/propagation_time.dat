40|$|An error {{propagation}} {{model has been}} developed for multimodule computing systems in which the main parameters are the distribution functions of error <b>propagation</b> <b>times.</b> A digraph model is used to represent a multimodule computing system, and {{error propagation}} in the system is modeled by general distributions of error <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> between all pairs of modules. Two algorithms are developed to compute systematically and efficiently the distributions of error <b>propagation</b> <b>times.</b> Experiments are also conducted to measure the distributions of error <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> with the fault-tolerant microprocessor (FTMP). Statistical analysis of experimental data shows that the error <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> in FTMP do not follow a well-known distribution, thus justifying the use of general distributions in the present model...|$|R
40|$|The CMOS {{inverter}} {{plays an}} important role in digital CMOS design. Digital CMOS components in general depend on optimization techniques that have been proposed taking as reference the CMOS inverter. CMOS inverter optimization is often based on the equilibrium of the <b>propagation</b> <b>times.</b> The factors that affect these <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> are numerous, namely: transistor dimensions, loading conditions, Miller effect and second order effects potentiated by the scaling of the CMOS technology. This paper explores new perspectives on the matching of the CMOS inverter <b>propagation</b> <b>times,</b> due to nonlinear loading conditions. Theoretical and simulation evidence shows that, the <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> depend on several loading parameters when the load is a similar inverter rather than a simple linear capacitor...|$|R

2500|$|However, in 1905 and 1906 Poincaré {{pointed out}} the {{possibility}} of a gravitational theory, in which changes propagate with the speed of light and which is Lorentz covariant. He pointed out that in such a theory the gravitational force not only depends on the masses and their mutual distance, but also on their velocities and their position due to the finite <b>propagation</b> <b>time</b> of interaction. On that occasion Poincaré introduced four-vectors. Following Poincaré, also Minkowski (1908) and Arnold Sommerfeld (1910) tried to establish a Lorentz-invariant gravitational law. However, these attempts were superseded because of Einstein's theory of general relativity, see [...] "The shift to relativity".|$|E

40|$|We present {{calculations}} of the <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> and energy losses of cosmic rays {{as they are}} transported through the heliosphere. By calculating these quantities for a spatially 1 D scenario, we benchmark our numerical model, which uses stochastic differential equations to solve the relevant transport equation, with known analytical solutions. The comparison is successful {{and serves as a}} vindication of the modeling approach. A spatially 3 D version of the modulation model is subsequently used to calculate the <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> and energy losses of galactic electrons and protons in different drift cycles. We find that the <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> of electrons are longer than those of the protons at the same energy. Furthermore, the <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> are longer in the drift cycle when the particles reach the Earth by drifting inward along the heliospheric current sheet. The calculated energy losses follow this same general trend. The energy losses suffered by the electrons are comparable to those of the protons, which is in contrast to the generally held perception that electrons experience little energy losses during their propagation through the heliosphere.

40|$|Acoustical Oceanography {{includes}} {{the use of}} both active and passive acoustic systems to measure various properties of the ocean environment. Active methods use a specifically designed and controlled sound projector while passive methods exploit naturally occurring ocean sounds such as breaking waves, ship noise, or marine mammal vocalizations. Historically, active methods have been the preferred choice when precise <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> or calibrated sound levels are important. However, passive sensing has a strong appeal {{due in part to}} the ease in which listening-only systems can be deployed. There have been a number of advances in passive sensing even for cases where <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> and sound levels are of interest. For example, it has been shown that surface wave noise can be used to measure vertical <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> through the seabed and water column. More recently, there is experimental evidence that indicates noise correlations may also be used to determine horizontal <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> in the seabed. Although replacing controlled projectors with noise sources is an attractive option there are limitations to how and when noise can be used this way. These limitations as well as experimental and modeling results from surface and ship noise will be described in this presentation...|$|R

The <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> for almost 200 events are compared with the predicted times from four different models. The simplest model assumes a constant convective motion of solar wind disturbances along the Sun-Earth line, whereas more sophisticated models take {{the orientation of the}} discontinuity as well as the real positions of the solar wind monitor and target into account. The results show that taking orientation and real position of the solar wind monitor and target into account gives a more precise time delay estimation in most cases.

5000|$|The {{lumped element}} model is valid {{whenever}} , where [...] denotes the circuit's characteristic length, and [...] denotes the circuit's operating wavelength.Otherwise, when the circuit length {{is on the}} order of a wavelength, we must consider more general models, such as the distributed element model (including transmission lines), whose dynamic behaviour is described by Maxwell's equations. Another way of viewing the validity of the lumped element model is to note that this model ignores the finite time it takes signals to propagate around a circuit. Whenever this <b>propagation</b> <b>time</b> is not significant to the application the lumped element model can be used. This is the case when the <b>propagation</b> <b>time</b> is much less than the period of the signal involved. However, with increasing <b>propagation</b> <b>time</b> there will be an increasing error between the assumed and actual phase of the signal which in turn results in an error in the assumed amplitude of the signal.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to propose a solid {{mathematical}} framework to characterize the dynamical properties of neural field systems with propagation delays and to show that it allows us to find sufficient delay-dependent bounds for the linear stability of the stationary states. This is a step in the direction of answering the question of how much delays can be introduced in a neural field model without destabilization. As a consequence one can infer in some cases without much extra work, from the analysis of a neural field model without propagation delays, the changes caused by the finite <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> of signals. This framework also allows us to prove a linear stability principle to study the bifurcations of the solutions when varying the nonlinear gain and the <b>propagation</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R
