50|$|The Pfandbrief Act (Pfandbriefgesetz), {{established}} in 2005 and amended in 2009, regulates the Pfandbrief. While most European countries have covered bond legislation, the United States and UK initially preferred non-legislative guidelines. The 2005 Pfandbrief Act increased potential issuers {{to include all}} licensed credit institutions that meet certain requirements. Formerly, only specialized <b>private</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>banks</b> and public sector banks could issue covered bonds in Germany. The Pfandbrief Act supersedes all prior existing Pfandbrief legislations. The 2009 amendment introduced the Aircraft Pfandbrief as the fourth Pfandbrief type.|$|R

50|$|Unsurprisingly, in {{the midst}} of the Asian and Russian {{economic}} crises of the late 1990s, Colombia had its first economic recession in more than 60 years. The exchange rate came under severe pressure, and the Bank of the Republic devalued the exchange-rate band twice. The sudden stop in international lending led to an abrupt adjustment in the current account, which meant a large contraction in aggregate demand. Increases in international interest rates together with expectations of devaluation of the peso caused rises in internal interest rates, contributing to the contraction of GDP. The recession and the bursting of a real-estate bubble also resulted in a major banking crisis. The savings and loan corporations were especially affected. The government took over a few private financial institutions and forced others to close. Public <b>banks</b> and <b>private</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>banks</b> were hard hit, and the subsequent government intervention to aid some of the distressed financial institutions added pressures on public expenditure.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots of}} the German Pfandbrief system reach back to the year 1769. In the {{aftermath}} of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) that had ravaged the country Prussian King Frederick the Great introduced the Pfandbrief system with a ”cabinets-order” to ease credit shortage for the nobility. Based on his royal decree, Prussia set up so-called ”Landschaften,” compulsory public-law associations of noble landowners, within the individual provinces. To refinance loans to their members Landschaften issued debentures that largely correspond with the present-day mortgage Pfandbrief since the creditor acquired a direct claim over the estates the member had pledged as security. This Pfandbrief system rapidly spread throughout all of Europe. Towards {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, it was widely adopted for the refinancing of public sector loans. The second decisive boost to the development of the Pfandbrief occurred when Landschaften outside Prussia started issuing Pfandbriefe for which all the properties lent against by the Landschaft served jointly as security. As before the loans raised by the Landschaften were not paid out in cash, but in Pfandbriefe. In 1862, the first German <b>mortgage</b> <b>bank,</b> Frankfurter Hypothekenbank in Frankfurt am Main, opened its doors. Numerous other <b>mortgage</b> <b>banks</b> followed in rapid succession in almost all German federal states. By the beginning of the twentieth century 40 <b>private</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>banks</b> existed. <b>Mortgage</b> <b>banks</b> concentrated from the outset on real estate financing. The rapidly expanding towns and cities in the area of industrialization were in need of the housing construction and commercial properties financing. The 1900 <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Bank</b> Act (HBG) is deemed pioneering legislation until today. It provided a legally prescribed, uniform organizational framework for this group of credit institutions. It was in force for more than a century until the Pfandbrief Act entered into force in 2005 (source: Association of German Pfandbrief Banks).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the case for}} mortgage covered bonds {{as an alternative to}} the originate-to-distribute mortgage funding model. It argues that the economic incentives provided to market participants under the covered bonds model are less susceptible to moral hazard even while retaining the key benefits of securitization such as capital market funding and flexibility in risk allocation. Notwithstanding these advantages, however, limited market size and the greater pro-cyclicality of mortgage loan quality in the United States - potentially reflecting borrower incentives under the personal bankruptcy framework - impose limits on the benefits ensuing from this model. The analysis underscores the need for a comprehensive legal-regulatory framework to underpin market development and discusses a number of ways in which the current draft legislation may be further strengthened. A potential strategy to hasten market development within the current institutional framework is identified.

2500|$|Vilnius Land Bank ( [...] , , [...] ) was {{the first}} bank {{established}} in Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno), present-day Lithuania. It was a <b>private</b> joint-stock <b>mortgage</b> <b>bank</b> serving the Northwestern Krai of the Russian Empire. Its mission was to provide loans collateralized by real estate to manor owners (agriculture) and city residents (industry). As it could not accept deposits, the <b>bank</b> issued <b>mortgage</b> bonds {{to raise funds for}} the loans. The bank was established in 1872 after a banking reform. It was one of eleven land banks operating in the Empire, and grew {{to be one of the}} largest. Despite several economic crises, particularly the one caused by the Russian Revolution of 1905, the outstanding loans grew from 5 million rubles in 1874 to 148.8 million in 1912. Both Lithuanians and Russians complained that the bank was controlled by and served the Polish interests. During World War I, the bank was evacuated to Petrograd (Saint Petersburg). After the war, in 1920, it returned to Vilnius, which became part of the Second Polish Republic. It continued to operate at diminished volumes until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.|$|R
