Initially, production began outside Bulgaria in three foreign factories: Sandrik in Dolne Hamre and Bruder Gottlieb und Brauchbar in Brun, Moravia (Bratri G&B - Brno) in Czechoslovakia and Eisenhuttenwerk Thale in Thale, Harz, Germany. In the end of 1935 a <b>punching</b> <b>press</b> was imported from Germany to Bulgaria and installed at the Military Works {{in the town of}} Kazanlak, and subsequently production continued in Bulgaria as well. The earlier bigger and heavier types A and B were phased out in the early 1950s, but the latest type C is still in service in the Bulgarian army, but is being phased out completely in the 2010s, in favor of a newer kevlar helmet, the BK-3 developed by the Croatian-based company Sestan-Busch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{flywheel}} is {{the heavy}} rotating mass which is placed between the power source and the driven machine {{to act as}} a reservoir of energy. It is used to store the energy when the demand of energy of energy is less and deliver it when the demand of energy is high. The current paper is focused on the analytical design of arm type of flywheel which is used for <b>punching</b> <b>press</b> operation. Now in regard to the design of flywheel it is required to decide the mean diameter of the flywheel rim, which depends upon two factors such as availability of space and the limiting value of peripheral velocity of the fly wheel. However the current design problem is formulated for punching machine which has to be make holes of 30 holes/minute in a steel plate of 18 mm thickness with space limitation that is the diameter of flywheel should not exceed 1000 mm, hence it can be observed that the design of the flywheel is to be carried out (based) on the availability of space limitation and accordingly the fluctuation of energy, dimensions of the flywheel, stresses induced in the flywheel are determined. Finally after detail analysis it is observed that the induced diameter of the flywheel is less than the allowable/permissible diameter and hence it can be concluded that the design is safe from availability of space point of view. Keywords- Flywheel, peripheral velocity, fluctuation of energy, stresses, stored energy. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Noise {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} forms of environmental pollution among developed and developing countries. A report from UK National Study of Hearing estimated that around 440 million people suffer from noise induced hearing loss in EU countries with 1 – 1. 6 million disability-adjusted life year lost. In China, the Second China National Sample Survey on disability in 2007 revealed that about 27. 8 million people suffered from hearing impairment, and 73. 4 % of which (about 20 million) were diagnosed with disability. The prevalence of hearing impairment was estimated to be 2. 1 % in the general population, and increased to 11. 0 % among those aged greater than 65 years. Objective: To find out the effect of earplug on noise induced hearing loss (NIHL), as well as understanding the source and exposure of noise in the industry, to estimate the prevalence of NIHL in factories with noise exposure, to analyze relationships between NIHL and age, sex, dose and duration of occupational noise exposure, type of work, use of hearing protection products, education level and other factors. Significant risk factors identified were used to provide evidence-based recommendations in prevention and control of NIHL. Study Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional study Method: A total of 1874 workers exposed to noise in a compressor factory in Guangzhou, China were included. Between September 2011 and January 2012, physical examination including a screening program of hearing loss, pure tone audiometry test were carried out among workers including information on age, sex, work types, noise exposure level, exposure time, as well as the questionnaire about earplug using status, status of using ear products report by company, smoking status, education level, discharge of ear, history of herpes zoster, history of using ototoxic drugs, history of ear surgery, family history of NIHL, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure. The outcome variable is the audiometric mean value which reflects hearing status of the subjects. Subgroup differences in mean value of audiometry were compared by independent sample t-test. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between earplug use and NIHL, adjusted for other potential confounders. Factors associated with earplug use were also identified. Result: 1873 workers took part in the study (both physical examination and questionnaire) The prevalence of NIHL is 381 (20. 3 %) from study, and an average noise level of 83. 5 dB was detected in the factory across different types of working place. The pure tone audiometric mean value (PTA) is 26. 7 dB with a standard deviation of 4. 8. The mean PTA value for those using earplug is 25. 81 dB, which was significantly lower than those not using earplug with a mean PTA value of 1. 54 dB (p < 0. 001). A 0. 962 mean difference is detected between noncontinuous earplug usage group and continuous usage group. Multiple linear regression model showed a dose response effect in use of earplug on NIHL, with an estimated mean PTA 1. 49 dB (p-value < 0. 001) and 0. 96 dB (p-value = 0. 001) lower than those not using earplug at all. Hearing protective effect with part of dose response relationship is found in education level groups as well. Workers from technical school have a 5. 974 dB lower of mean PTA, where the decrease is 3. 909 dB in high school group, reference of primary level. Moreover, ever smokers show 1. 557 dB higher on reference as nonsmoker. Other significant results can be found in family history of NIHL, ototoxic drug using, with statistical significant, respectively, with the direction of positive to NIHL, which shows harmful effect on workers’ hearing. Multivariable logistic regression model is used to find out factors associated with earplug usage. In the model, higher education level is found to be associated with higher earplug usage, especially among participants from technical schools, with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 34. 07, whereas those from high school group have an AOR of 12. 35. (With Primary school group being the reference group.) Workers whose daily tasks involve phosphorus board, <b>punching</b> <b>press,</b> compressor are found to have a relatively low percentage on earplug usage compliance, with AOR of 0. 55, 0. 41, 0. 23 respectively. (Those from machine shops are used as the reference group.) The result is in accordance with their positive correlation on NIHL. Conclusion: Use of earplug was found to be protective to NIHL. Factors such as education level, smoking status, discharge of ear, family history of NIHL and certain types of work were found to be associated with lower risk of NIHL. To protect hearing of the workers and reduce NIHL prevalence, provision of and education on hearing protection products and supervision of continuous use of earplug in noise exposed industry should be implemented. Occupational health monitoring to the enterprises should be enhanced by health sectors of Chinese government. Due to the limitation of retrospective design of this dissertation, further cohort studies are called for to provide stronger evidence of factors’ effect on NIHL. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the information required {{to describe the}} machine and device resources in the turret <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> environment which are needed {{for the development of}} the analysing method for automated production. The description of product and device resources and their interconnectedness is the starting point for method comparison the development of expenses, production planning and the performance of optimisation. The manufacturing method cannot be optimized unless the variables and their interdependence are known. Sheet metal parts in particular may then become remarkably complex, and their automatic manufacture may be difficult or, with some automatic equipment, even impossible if not know manufacturing properties. This thesis consists of three main elements, which constitute the triangulation. In the first phase of triangulation, the manufacture occuring on a turret <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> is examined in order to find the factors that affect the efficiency of production. In the second phase of triangulation, the manufacturability of products on turret <b>punch</b> <b>presses</b> is examined through a set of laboratory tests. The third phase oftriangulation involves an examination of five industry parts. The main key findings of this study are: all possible efficiency in high automation level machining cannot be achieved unless the raw materials used in production and the dependencies of the machine and tools are well known. Machine-specific manufacturability factors for turret <b>punch</b> <b>presses</b> were not taken into account in the industrial case samples. On the grounds of the performed tests and industrial case samples, the designer of a sheet metal product can directly influence the machining time, material loss, energy consumption and the number of tools required on a turret <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> by making decisions in the way presented in the hypothesis of thisstudy. The sheet metal parts to be produced can be optimised to bemanufactured on a turret <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> when the material to be used and the kinds of machine and tool options available are known. This provides in-depth knowledge of the machine and tool properties machine and tool-specifically. None of the optimisation starting points described here is a separate entity; instead, they are all connected to each other...|$|R
