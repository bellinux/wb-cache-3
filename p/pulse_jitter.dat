Major components of the machines are: Marx generator, water-filled pulse-forming line (PFL), water-filled coaxial transmission line, three-cell inductive voltage adder, and rod-pinch diode. The diode pulse has the following electrical specifications: 2. 25 -MV, 60 -kA, 60 -ns. Each source has the following x-ray parameters: 1 -mm-diameter spot size, 4 -rad at 1 m, 50 -ns full width half max. The x-ray pulse is measured with PIN diode detectors. The sources were developed to produce high resolution images on single-shot, high-value experiments. For this application it is desirable to maintain {{a high level of}} reproducibility in source output. X-ray <b>pulse</b> <b>jitter</b> is a key metric for analysis of reproducibility.

40|$|In {{this report}} a {{theoretical}} model is developed that predicts the single-point, two-frequency coherence function for transionospheric radio waves. The theoretical model {{is compared to}} measured complex frequency correlation coefficients {{using data from the}} seven equispaced, phase-coherent UHF signals transmitted by the Wideband satellite. The theory and data are in excellent agreement. The theory is critically dependent upon the power-law index, and the frequency coherence data clearly favor the comparatively small spectral indices that have been consistently measured from the wideband satellite phase data. A model for estimating the <b>pulse</b> delay <b>jitter</b> induced by the coherence bandwidth loss is also developed and compared with the actual delay jitter observed on synthesized pulses obtained from the Wideband UFH comb. The results are in good agreement with the theory. The results presented in this report, which are based on an asymptotic theory, are compared with the more commonly used quadratic theory. The model developed and validated in this report can be used to predict the effects of coherence bandwidth loss in disturbed nuclear environments.

40|$|Top Up {{injections}} without noticeable {{motion of}} the stored beam is a challenge. The common method of beam accumulation with a local bump formed by four independent pulsed dipole kicker magnets usually causes beam oscillations. The matching of the four independent kicker systems regarding <b>pulse</b> <b>jitters</b> and shapes is technologically limited. Afterward the beam excitation was reduced more when two kicker magnets {{on each side of}} the septum were powered in series by one pulser unit. An even more promising approach is to adopt an alternative injection method deploying a single non linear kicker magnet with zero Bx,y field in the center and an off axis maximum, By, which is horizontally displaced by 10 12 mm. There the injected beam gets kicked and looses half of its transverse momentum. Such a magnet was designed and built as a short in vacuum magnet with a small vertical gap height. For first beam tests the kicker was placed in the second straight section after the injection point, and the 1. 5 4 s pulse was designed to deflect the 1. 72 GeV beam by 1 mrad.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{recently}} introduced Bayesian framework `Generative Pulsar Timing Analysis' to incorporate both <b>pulse</b> <b>jitter</b> (high frequency {{variation in the}} arrival time of the pulse) and epoch to epoch stochasticity {{in the shape of}} the pulse profile. This framework allows for a full timing analysis to be performed on the folded profile data, rather than the site arrival times as is typical in most timing studies. We apply this extended framework both to simulations, and to an 11 yr, 10 cm data set for PSR J 1909 - 3744. Using simulations, we show that temporal profile variation can induce timing noise in the residuals that when performing a standard timing analysis is highly covariant with the signal expected from a gravitational wave (GW) background. When working in the profile domain, these variations are de-correlated from the expected GW signal, resulting in significant improvement in the obtained upper limits. Using the PSR J 1909 - 3744 data set from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project, we find significant evidence for systematic high-frequency profile variation resulting from non-Gaussian noise in the oldest observing system, but no evidence for either detectable <b>pulse</b> <b>jitter,</b> or low-frequency profile shape variation. Using our profile domain framework we therefore obtain upper limits on a red noise process with a spectral index of γ = 13 / 3 of 1 × 10 ^- 15, consistent with previously published limits.

40|$|Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) {{have been}} studied in detail since their {{discovery}} in 1982. The integrated pulse profiles of MSPs appear to be stable, which enables precision monitoring of the pulse times of arrival (TOAs). However, for individual pulses the shape and arrival phase can vary dramatically, which is known as <b>pulse</b> <b>jitter.</b> In this paper, we investigate the stability of integrated pulse profiles for 5 MSPs, and estimate the amount of jitter for PSR J 0437 - 4715. We do not detect intrinsic profile shape variation based on integration times from ~ 10 to ~ 100 s with the provided instrumental sensitivity. For PSR J 0437 - 4715 we calculate the jitter parameter to be f_J= 0. 067 +- 0. 002, and demonstrate that the result is not significantly affected by instrumental TOA uncertainties. Jitter noise is also found to be independent of observing frequency and bandwidth around 1. 4 GHz on frequency scales of < 100 MHz, which supports the idea that pulses within narrow frequency scale are equally jittered. In addition, we point out that <b>pulse</b> <b>jitter</b> would limit TOA calculation for the timing observations with future telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array and the Five hundred metre Aperture Spherical Telescope. A quantitative understanding of pulse profile stability and the contribution of jitter would enable improved TOA calculations, which are essential for the ongoing endeavours in pulsar timing, such as the detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background.

40|$|The {{aspect to}} be {{investigated}} during this contract was an electron-beam triggered diamond switch {{to be used in}} high power modulators. Today's high power modulators require higher voltage switches than those developed to date. Specifically, the proposed 1 TeV linear collider, the NLC/ILC at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), consists of two linacs with 6600 X-Band klystrons powered by 3300 high power modulators. These modulators require switches capable of handling 80 kV, switching 8 kA with pulse durations ranging from 2 ps (linac) to 6 {micro}s (pre-linac) with switching times < 50 ns at pulse repetition frequencies up to 180 Hz. In addition the large number of switches and other components dictate a pulse to <b>pulse</b> <b>jitter</b> of < 10 ns and a mean time between failures of at least 50, 000 hours. The present approach is to use hydrogen filled thyratrons. While these switches meet the voltage and conduction current requirements they lack the required reliability (pulse to <b>pulse</b> <b>jitter)</b> and lifetime. Research to improve these aspects is in progress. A solid state switch inherently offers the required reliability and lifetime. However, Si-based switches developed to date are limited to about 5 kV and several must be stacked in series to deliver the required voltage. This further increases the already large parts count and compromises reliability and lifetime. A monolithic, solid state switch capable of meeting all the requirements for X-Band modulators would be ideal.

40|$|Multiunit {{activity}} and slow local field potentials show Omitted Stimulus Potentials (OSP) in the electrosensory system in rays after a missing stimulus in a 3 to > 20 Hz train of microvolt pulses in the bath, at levels {{from the primary}} medullary nucleus to the telencephalon. A precursor {{can be seen in}} the afferent nerve. The OSP follows the due-time of the first omitted stimulus with a, usually, constant main peak latency, 30 - 50 ms in medullary dorsal nucleus, 60 - 100 ms in midbrain, 120 - 190 ms in telencephalon - as though the brain has an expectation specific to the interstimulus interval (ISI). The latency, form and components vary between nerve, medulla, midbrain and forebrain. They include early fast waves, later slow waves and labile induced rhythms. Responsive loci are quite local. Besides ISI, which exerts a strong influence, many factors affect the OSP slightly, including train parameters and intensity, duration and polarity of the single stimulus <b>pulses.</b> <b>Jitter</b> of ISI does not reduce the OSP substantially, if the last interval equals the mean; the mean and the last interval have the main effect on both amplitude and latency. Taken together with our recent findings on visually evoked OSPs, we conclude that OSPs do not require higher brain levels or even the complexities of the retina. They appear in primary sensory nuclei and are then modified at midbrain and telencephalic levels. We propose that the initial processes are partly in the receptors and partly in the first central relay including a rapid increase of some depressing influence contributed by each stimulus. This influence comes to an ISI-specific equilibrium with the excitatory influence; withholding a stimulus and hence its depressing influence causes a rebound excitation with a specific latency...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a source of picosecond optical pulses {{is of paramount importance}} for an increasing number of photonic applications, such as optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) or hybrid wavelength division multiplexing/OTDM systems [1]. One of the simplest and most reliable techniques of generating picosecond optical pulses involves gain-switching a Fabry-Perot (FP) semiconductor laser [2]. Gain-switching of FP lasers, as opposed to DFB lasers, is more attractive since these lasers are more cost efficient and they yield <b>pulses</b> with lower <b>jitter</b> [3]. However, a problem associated with employing FP lasers in such a gain-switched configuration is the multi-moded output that would lead to the pulses suffering from a large amount of dispersion when transmitted through standard single mode fibre (SSMF). External injection or self-seeding at an appropriate wavelength, into the gain-switched FP laser is a simple solution {{that could be used to}} achieve single moded pulse generation. By varying the injected wavelength to select out different modes, the FP laser could potentially be used as a source of wavelength tunable pulses [4]. Other advantages that light injection brings are an improvement in the <b>pulse</b> temporal <b>jitter</b> and a reduction in chirp. Self-seeding of gain-switched lasers is a simple technique since it negates the need for an additional CW source by using a wavelength selective element placed in an external cavity. A small fraction of the output light, at a chosen wavelength, is re-injected into the gain-switched laser. However, to ensure optimum operatio...|$|R

The achievable jitter may be below 5 nanoseconds. The required trigger pulse voltage is about 200-2000 volts; higher voltages decrease the switching delay to some degree. The switching delay is strongly independent on the environment. Commutation time can be somewhat shortened by increasing the trigger pulse rise time.

The effect of jitter was studied using a physiologically-based model of auditory nerve and brainstem (medial superior olive neurons). It was found that the random timing of the <b>jittered</b> <b>pulses</b> increased firing synchrony in the auditory periphery, which caused an improved rate-ITD tuning for the 600 -pps pulse trains.
