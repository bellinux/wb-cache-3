[...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] was {{conceived}} from its title, and, according to Warren, [...] "it <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head, and I thought, 'I don't think I've heard that before, that's kind of interesting.' I started playing around on the piano with these chords and did a key change, and then I knew, 'OK, this is magic.'" [...] Warren further explained that she wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] as a ballad and dance song, {{because that was the}} way she heard it. She said: [...] "some people only know it as a – gay – dance song!" ...|$|E

Dickinson took up the opportunity and called {{an old friend of}} his, former Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, and, shortly after meeting up, they had [...] "Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter" [...] ready for the studio, then recorded with the assistance of bassist Andy Carr, and drummer Fabio del Rio. [...] "I wrote it in about three minutes", states Dickinson, [...] "I don't know where the title 'Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter' came from, but it just <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head. I thought, 'Bloody hell, straight out of AC/DC!' And I thought, Nightmare on Elm Street. Yeah, that'll do.' Impressed with the results, Zomba asked Dickinson if he was willing to record a whole album as well. With the same line-up and producer, Dickinson's solo debut, Tattooed Millionaire, was written and recorded within two weeks, and released in May 1990, followed by a supporting tour.|$|E

The word Festivus in this sense was coined by the elder O'Keefe, and according to him the name [...] "just <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head". In the original O'Keefe tradition, the holiday would take place to celebrate the anniversary of Daniel O'Keefe's first date with his future wife, Deborah. The phrase, [...] "a Festivus {{for the rest of}} us" [...] originally referred to those remaining after the death of the elder O'Keefe's mother, Jeanette, in 1976; i.e., the [...] "rest of us" [...] are the living, as opposed to the dead.|$|E

[...] The reviewer continued, saying that [...] "A thread of underlying sadness unites all four Chrismukkah episodes, but it's a sadness that begs to be redeemed {{by the end of the}} hour.

He said [...] "From out of nowhere, all of these ideas for tunes kept <b>popping</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> brain so, IT!! was born. They're all little snapshots about stuff.

2500|$|In 1992, guitarist Dan Hoerner and bassist Nate Mendel {{met when}} they became housemates at the University of Washington. After jam sessions, they decided to form a band and sought a drummer, {{eventually}} deciding to invite William Goldsmith. Goldsmith played in many bands but decided to join the duo's project. They released a demo tape under the name [...] "Empty Set". Post-release, the band changed their name from Empty Set to Chewbacca Kaboom, upon realization that a band with the name Empty Set already existed. However, when another demo tape was released, the new name earned them little attention, and it was yet again subject to change, this time to 'One Day I Stopped Breathing'. The band eventually settled on the name Sunny Day Real Estate. Mendel stated the band's name [...] "was just a random thought that <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head that came from a Talking Heads song, '(Nothing But) Flowers'". He felt that since the band's outlook on the world saw that every possible thing was becoming a commodity to be bought and sold, {{it was possible that}} one day, people would even start selling sunny days. The lyrics made him ponder about what could be sold as property, and come up with the commercialization of sunny days.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the success}} of Hellbilly Deluxe, Zombie {{released}} American Made Music to Strip By in October of 1999. The album was composed solely of remixes of songs featured on Hellbilly Deluxe, featuring contributions from Charlie Clouser and Rammstein, among others. The album was a commercial success in the United States, entering the top forty of the Billboard 200. In 2010, Zombie announced that his fourth studio album would be titled [...] (2010). When asked about the album's title, Zombie was quoted as stating [...] "Well, it was around the ten- year anniversary of the first record, and the idea just <b>popped</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head. It really wasn’t this big master plan by any means, I just knew I wanted to return to the old ways of doing things, and I thought that {{that would be a good}} starting point." [...] Songs taken from Hellbilly Deluxe were featured in Zombie's retrospective album Past, Present & Future (2003). The album featured songs from both Zombie's work with White Zombie as well as his solo career, along with some new material. Songs from Hellbilly Deluxe would later appear in Zombie's greatest hits collections The Best of Rob Zombie: 20th Century Masters The Millennium Collection (2006) and Icon (2010). Zombie has included songs taken from the album on all of his subsequent tours, including his Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour (2009-12). The music found on the album has been used extensively in the media, including films, video games, and television. [...] "Dragula" [...] and [...] "Superbeast" [...] have been covered by acts such as Motionless In White and Suicide Silence, respectively. The songs [...] "Superbeast", [...] "Dragula", [...] "Living Dead Girl", [...] "Meet the Creeper", [...] "How to Make a Monster", and [...] "Demonoid Phenomenon" [...] were all covered on the tribute album The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Rob Zombie (2002).|$|E

Maust {{came up with the}} band's name around 1997, during his travels in Eastern Europe with his brother, where they found a park in Budapest with missing statues, taken away after Communism fell. Seeing that there was a playground in the park, Maust said [...] "...being in that environment just made the phrase 'Cold War Kids' <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head. I may have heard it before.

The band relocated to Whittier, California, and began recording their first demo, which Monarchy Music released as the EP Mulberry Street (based on the restaurant where they regularly met) in spring 2005. Between tours, the band released two more EPs: With Our Wallets Full and Up in Rags, in 2006. Monarchy Music would re-release those EPs as one compilation album titled Up in Rags/With Our Wallets Full in 2006.|$|R

6000|$|Sir: I have {{observed}} that as a man advances in life, he is subject {{to a kind of}} plethora of the mind, doubtless occasioned by the vast accumulation of wisdom and experience upon the brain. Hence he is apt to become narrative and admonitory, that is to say, fond of telling long stories, and of doling out advice, to the small profit and great annoyance of his friends. As I have a great horror of becoming the oracle, or, more technically speaking, the [...] "bore," [...] of the domestic circle, and would much rather bestow my wisdom and tediousness upon the world at large, I have always sought to ease off this surcharge of the intellect by means of my pen, and hence have inflicted divers gossiping volumes upon the patience of the public. I am tired, however, of writing volumes; they do not afford exactly the relief I require; there is too much preparation, arrangement, and parade, in this set form of coming before the public. I am growing too indolent and unambitious for any thing that requires labor or display. I have thought, therefore, of securing to myself a snug corner in some periodical work where I might, as it were, loll at my ease in my elbow-chair, and chat sociably with the public, as with an old friend, on any chance subject that might <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> brain.|$|R

I really liked my interview... I wanted to try a different culture just so I could learn about different aspects of it, and it was challenging because I didn't know where to start and so I just started asking people I knew... as a healthcare professional I'm supposed to be willing to just go and talk to everyone and I think it's comfortable when you're in a hospital setting or if you're in a healthcare setting that that's your job, but doing that in your own personal environment, it was hard for me.

Walking through the quad on Quad Day, my friends and I passed a booth that had a large sign saying: “Atheist Club”.

So the question is: “So what? ” What am I going to do get involved with the Atheist club? Is the Atheist club too extreme? What if I actually agree with what they’re saying? These are all questions that I asked myself the moment I thought of the Atheists. As a member of the Irish Catholic community, I have been brought up with the ideals that God is the almighty power, {{and that there is a}} heaven and a hell. From what I understand about Atheists is that they believe in nothing, and that there is no higher power, which goes against everything that I’ve been raised with. Overall, I feel that getting involved in the Atheist community on campus would open my eyes, and possibly others, to a whole new world that many people do not understand...|$|R

To feel the difference, I dusted off an old LP of the same piece, record by another world-famous performer on a modern concert grand. The playing was beautiful but, compared to the fortepiano, the sound seems almost muted, the rapid passages of the allegro slurred. It was like listening to Bilson's version with earmuffs on.|$|R
