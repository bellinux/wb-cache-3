50|$|A {{solid state}} relay or SSR is a solid state {{electronic}} component that provides a function similar to an electromechanical relay but {{does not have any}} moving components, increasing long-term reliability. A solid-state relay uses a thyristor, TRIAC or other solid-state switching device, activated by the control signal, to switch the controlled load, instead of a solenoid. An optocoupler (a light-emitting diode (LED) coupled with a <b>photo</b> <b>transistor)</b> can be used to isolate control and controlled circuits.|$|E

A PIN-type photo detector is formed by the base-collector-subcollector layers. The bandgap of InGaAs works well for detecting 1550 nm-wavelength infrared laser signals used in optical communication systems. Biasing the HBT to obtain an active device, a <b>photo</b> <b>transistor</b> with high internal gain is obtained. Among other HBT applications are mixed signal circuits such as analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters.|$|E

When enough water is collected to make a single drop, it drops from the bottom, falling into the laser beam path.

5000|$|This kind of sensor {{sends out}} bursts of {{microwave}} or ultrasound energy {{and waits for}} the energy to reflect back. In a stagnant situation, the energy will bounce back in a normal pattern. When hands are placed in the basin, the energy emitted from the sensor will bounce back irregularly which triggers the dispensation of soap. Modern sensors used in electronic faucets, electronic flush valves and electronic soap dispensers use Infrared light with wavelength {{in the range of}} 850 nm. The sensor employs an emitter and a collector. The emitter emits pulses of infrared light while the collector, which is positioned to face {{in the same direction as}} the emitter, [...] "sits" [...] dormant waiting to sens the emitted pulses. When no hands are present in front of the devise, no reflection of light takes place, and therefore, no pulse is sensed. When hands are present in the pah of the emitted light, a portions of the emitted infrared light is bounced back in the direction of the collector which then becomes excited by the light (in the event a photodiode is used) and generates voltage to switch the pump on. If a <b>photo</b> <b>transistor</b> is utilized, then the <b>photo</b> <b>transistor,</b> upon sensing the infrared pulse, will simply switch the pump on.|$|E

The applications of Cd(OH) 2 are based on its specific optical and electrical properties. For example, Cd(OH) 2 films show high electrical conductivity as well as high transparency in the visible region of solar spectrum. Cadmium hydroxide has also been proven to be an important precursor that can be converted into cadmium oxide through dehydration or into other functional materials (e.g., CdS, CdSe) by reaction with appropriate elements or compounds [25].|$|R
50|$|In contrast, the {{dew point}} {{measurement}} is considerably more complex. The original dew point sensor deployed on ASOS systems utilized a chilled mirror that is cooled {{to the point where}} a fine film of condensation forms on the mirror's surface. The temperature of the mirror at this condition is equal to {{the dew point}} temperature. The hygrometer measures the dew point by directing a light beam from a small infrared diode {{to the surface of the}} mirror at an angle of 45 degrees. Two <b>photo</b> <b>transistors</b> are mounted so they measure a high degree of reflected light when the mirror is clear (direct) and scattered light when the mirror is clouded with visible condensation (indirect). With the formation of condensation on the mirror, the degree of cloudiness of the mirror surface increases with the direct transistor receiving less light and the indirect transistor more light. The output from these <b>photo</b> <b>transistors</b> controls the mirror cooling module which is an electronic heat pump that operates much like a thermocouple in reverse, producing a heating or cooling effect. When the sensor is first activated, the mirror is clear. As the mirror surface temperature is cooled to the dew point temperature, condensations forms on the mirror. The electronics continuously tries to stabilize the signal levels to the power amplifier to maintain the mirror temperature at the dew point. If the dew point of the air changes or if the circuit is disturbed by noise, the loop makes the necessary corrections to restabilize at the dew point and maintaining continuous operation.|$|R

Nuclear Power {{appears to be}} an inevitable option as future energy source; but disposal of nuclear waste is an important issue of concern in harnessing nuclear energy through “critical reactors”, which needs to be addressed satisfactorily. In India, economic exploitation of nuclear power is considerably dependent on Uranium &Thorium. Accelerator-Driven System (ADS) has the potential to provide an additional route to an efficient use of the available uranium and thorium resources, besides offering a way towards nuclear waste incineration. o The most challenging part of this CW proton accelerator is development of the low-energy injector, typically up to 20 MeV, because the space charge effects are maximal here.

40|$|Recently, {{amorphous}} InGaZnO ultraviolet <b>photo</b> thin-film <b>transistors</b> have exhibited {{great potential}} for application in future display technologies. Nevertheless, the transmittance of amorphous InGaZnO (~ 80 %) is still not high enough, resulting in the relatively large sacrifice of aperture ratio for each sensor pixel. In this work, the ultraviolet <b>photo</b> thin-film <b>transistor</b> based on amorphous InGaMgO, which processes a larger bandgap and higher transmission compared to amorphous InGaZnO, was proposed and investigated. Furthermore, the effects of post-deposition annealing in oxygen on both the material and ultraviolet detection characteristics of amorphous InGaMgO were also comprehensively studied. It was found that oxygen post-deposition annealing can effectively reduce oxygen vacancies, leading to an optimized device performance, including lower dark current, higher sensitivity, and larger responsivity. We attributed it to the combined effect of the reduction in donor states and recombination centers, {{both of which are}} related to oxygen vacancies. As a result, the 240 -min annealed device exhibited the lowest dark current of 1. 7 × 10 − 10 A, the highest photosensitivity of 3. 9 × 106, and the largest responsivity of 1. 5 × 104 A/W.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the design}} of {{communication}} systems like radio on fibre, an important step is the characterisation of opto-microwave receivers. This paper presents two equipments based on the generation of millimetre-waves by the beating of lasers. The sources of the two benches are different. So the particularities of each {{of them will be}} showed. An example of application is given by the characterisation of an Heterojunction <b>Photo</b> <b>Transistor</b> (HPT). I. Overview of the techniques of microwave single-tone-signal transport by an optical carrier Different fibre optic communication systems imply components having to work at very high frequencies. It is the case, for instance, for long haul links or for on-chip optical connections with very high bit rates of tens of Gb/s. It is also the case for radio on fibre systems. In all these systems, optical detection components and associated circuits need to be characterised at microwave or millimetre wave frequencies. To realise this characterisation, it is necessary to set up opto-microwave systems which should be able to combine an optical carrier with a microwave signal. Microwave frequencies can go until 40 or 60 GHz. These frequencies can appear through three different schemes:- The laser source is directly modulated by a microwave frequency- The optical carrier is modulated by an external modulator like an electro-absorption or phase modulator- Heterodyne beating of two optical sources into a photodetector generates the microwav...|$|E

Graphene, the first {{two dimensional}} material has carrier mobility up to 200, 000 cm 2 /(V. s) *[1]. This makes it a perfect candidate for high frequency electronic devices.

40|$|Abstract Perception is {{a product}} of evolution. Our perceptual systems, like our limbs and livers, have been shaped by natu-ral {{selection}}. The effects of selection on perception can be studied using evolutionary games and genetic algorithms. To this end, we define and classify perceptual strategies and al-low them to compete in evolutionary games in a variety of worlds with a variety of fitness functions. We find that verid-ical perceptions—strategies tuned to the true structure of the world—are routinely dominated by nonveridical strategies tuned to fitness. Veridical perceptions escape extinction only if fitness varies monotonically with truth. Thus, a perceptual strategy favored by selection is best thought of not as a win-dow on truth but as akin to a windows interface of a PC. Just as the color and shape of an icon for a text file do not entail that the text file itself has a color or shape, so also our percep-tions of space-time and objects do not entail (by the Invention of Space-Time Theorem) that objective reality has the structure of space-time and objects.
