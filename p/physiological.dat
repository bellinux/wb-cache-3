5|$|Plants are {{a primary}} source of basic chemicals, both for their {{medicinal}} and <b>physiological</b> effects, and for the industrial synthesis of {{a vast array of}} organic chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with an increased risk of thrombosis. This probably results from a <b>physiological</b> hypercoagulability in pregnancy that protects against postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|ROSE1 and ROSEAT2 {{are found}} in rhizobiales Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Agrobacterium tumefaciens respectively. They exist in the 5' UTR of HspA mRNA, and repress heat shock protein {{translation}} at <b>physiological</b> temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>physiological</b> {{carnivores}} consume plant {{matter and}} some <b>physiological</b> herbivores consuming meat. From a behavioral aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from the <b>physiological</b> standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E
5|$|The eyes {{should be}} copiously {{irrigated}} with <b>physiological</b> saline or water and examined for corneal abrasions.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{mechanisms}} limit {{the success of}} hybridization, including the large genetic difference between most species. Barriers include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and <b>physiological</b> rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization; others after it.|$|E
5|$|Adaptive stage – The {{person will}} not {{experience}} any negative symptoms, {{and they believe}} they have the capacity for drinking alcohol without problems. <b>Physiological</b> changes are happening {{with the increase in}} tolerance, but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{interruption}} {{in the use}} of psilocybin in research, {{there has}} been a general shift in attitudes regarding research with hallucinogenic agents. Many countries are revising their positions and have started to approve studies to test the <b>physiological</b> and therapeutic effects of hallucinogens.|$|E
5|$|Although NAD {{is written}} with a {{superscript}} plus sign {{because of the}} formal charge on a particular nitrogen atom, at <b>physiological</b> pH {{for the most part}} it is actually a singly charged anion (charge of minus 1), while NADH is a doubly charged anion.|$|E
5|$|Artisanal {{fishermen}} and gatherers of marine organisms in {{less developed countries}} may expose themselves to relatively high risk using diving equipment {{if they do not}} understand the <b>physiological</b> hazards, particularly if they use inadequate equipment.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss and Starling {{had also}} used {{vivisection}} on anaesthetized dogs to discover peristalsis in 1899. They {{went on to}} discover {{a variety of other}} important <b>physiological</b> phenomena and principles, many of which were based on their experimental work involving animal vivisection.|$|E
5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special <b>physiological</b> adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from <b>physiological</b> adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|DPB is idiopathic, {{which means}} an exact <b>physiological,</b> environmental, or {{pathogenic}} {{cause of the}} disease is unknown. However, several factors are suspected {{to be involved with}} its pathogenesis (the way in which the disease works).|$|E
5|$|Diets high in {{fruit and}} vegetables, and so {{possibly}} being rich in antioxidant vitamins, have no established effect on status of health or aging, yet {{may have more}} subtle <b>physiological</b> effects, such as modifying cell-to-cell communication.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed <b>physiological</b> mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the <b>physiological</b> water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E
5|$|Extremophile archaea {{are members}} of four main <b>physiological</b> groups. These are the halophiles, thermophiles, alkaliphiles, and acidophiles. These groups are not {{comprehensive}} or phylum-specific, nor are they mutually exclusive, since some archaea belong to several groups. Nonetheless, they are a useful starting point for classification.|$|E

5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological and <b>physiological</b> changes. An {{advantage of}} inducible, as opposed to constitutive defenses, {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, and are therefore potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E
5|$|People with {{schizophrenia}} {{may have}} {{a high rate of}} irritable bowel syndrome but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked. Psychogenic polydipsia, or excessive fluid intake in the absence of <b>physiological</b> reasons to drink, is relatively common in people with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin (O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 4-PO-Psilocin, or 4-PO-HO-DMT) is a prodrug that is {{converted}} into the pharmacologically active compound psilocin {{in the body}} by a dephosphorylation reaction. This chemical reaction takes place under strongly acidic conditions, or under <b>physiological</b> conditions in the body, through the action of enzymes called alkaline phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 DCIEM sport diving {{tables were}} based on fitting {{experimental}} data, rather than a <b>physiological</b> model, and the 1990 French Navy Marine Nationale 90 (MN90) decompression tables were a development of the earlier Haldanean model of the MN65 tables.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad makes {{mention of}} eleven asanas (Yogic postures), of which two pertain to <b>physiological</b> postures: the Peacock and the Rooster. It {{describes}} squatting with folded legs known as Sukhasana, a meditative pose.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} animals {{including}} fish, lizards and frogs {{to change their}} colours quickly is discussed. The changing of the pelage of arctic animals is attributed to the indirect effect {{of the change in}} temperature, i.e. a <b>physiological</b> response not a simple physical effect.|$|E
5|$|The first drug {{rehabilitation}} center in Tibet was being constructed in Duilongdeqing County in 2009. It was planned to provide <b>physiological</b> rehabilitation, psychological therapy {{and job training}} for up to 150 drug addicts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>physiological</b> {{function}} of the AH receptor {{has been the subject}} of continuous research. One obvious function is to increase the activity of enzymes breaking down foreign chemicals or normal chemicals of the body as needed. There may be other functions, however, related to growth of various organs or other regulatory functions. The AH receptor is phylogenetically highly conserved transcription factor with a history of at least 500 million years, and found in all vertebrates, and its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species. In fact, knock-out animals with no AH receptor are prone to illness and developmental problems. Taken together, this implies the necessity of a basal degree of AH receptor activation to achieve normal <b>physiological</b> function.|$|E
5|$|The <b>physiological</b> {{similarities}} {{between humans and}} other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups. Future research with animal models then can expand our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in the real world.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the egret's eyes allows for binocular vision during feeding, and <b>physiological</b> {{studies suggest that the}} species may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity. Adapted to foraging on land, they have lost the ability possessed by their wetland relatives to accurately correct for light refraction by water.|$|E

25|$|It can be {{difficult}} to distinguish between <b>physiological</b> factors and environmental factors, when many <b>physiological</b> adaptations are directly related to environment.|$|E
25|$|The <b>physiological</b> {{school of}} thought contends {{that in the case}} of {{inguinal}} hernia, the above-mentioned are only an anatomical symptom of the underlying <b>physiological</b> cause. They contend that the risk of hernia is due to a <b>physiological</b> difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the transversus abdominis aponeurotic arch.|$|E
25|$|In seeds with combinational dormancy, {{the seed}} or fruit coat is {{impermeable}} to water and the embryo has <b>physiological</b> dormancy. Depending on the species, physical dormancy can be broken before or after <b>physiological</b> dormancy is broken.|$|E
