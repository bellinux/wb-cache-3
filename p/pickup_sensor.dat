50|$|The {{choice in}} HEI system type is vitally {{important}} based on the engine {{it will be used}} with. Each GM division had its own engine design. Thus, a Chevrolet ignition may not be identical to an Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick, or Cadillac engine. Typically, the ignition system compatibility followed the engine size. Most GM engines (of the same size) between 1974 and 1988 used a similar distributor ignition system. The module type is important as well. For non-computer controlled carburetor engines, the 4-pin unit is used since it uses mechanical timing controls (vacuum and centrifugal advance). The 5-pin module is like the 4-pin, with an added knock/detonation sensor input to the module so the ignition could be deliberately retarded and the power output dropped to the spark plug to aid disruption of the knock condition. The 7-pin module is designed for computer timing controls. It incorporates 2 magnetic signals from the <b>pickup</b> <b>sensor,</b> and 3 signals shared with the ECM engine control module), while the remaining 2 pins provide signal and power to the coil. Normally the 7 pin is not used on non-computerized engines since it does not contain mechanical timing controls, but some early designs used a seven-pin distributor module in conjunction with mechanical and vacuum advance in the distributor body, so the seven-pin module would be backward compatible.|$|E

40|$|It {{is clear}} from simple skin depth {{considerations}} that steady state electromagnetic inspection of thick multi-layered conductors requires low frequency excitation. Conventional <b>pickup</b> <b>sensors,</b> however, lose sensitivity at lower frequencies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{feasibility}} research was to study a novel sensor based separation method for recycling of plastic materials from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) by using eigen-frequency response of impact acoustic emission. In this research three kinds of commonly used plastics, polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and styrene-maleic-anhydride (SMA) sampled from end-of-life vehicles, were researched. Almost all the crushed plastic scraps had a flake structure, theoretically their impact response behaviors were determined by their diameters and thicknesses. The equivalent diameters of the scraps were characterized by fine sieving and their thicknesses were measured online by a 3 D laser triangulation sensor above the conveying path. Following this the scraps were free dropped one-by-one to impact with an impact passive body on which impact acoustic emission (AE) signals were generated and acquired by an acoustic <b>pickup</b> <b>sensor.</b> Thirdly, the AE signals which carried eigen-frequency response features were processed and characterized. Results demonstrated that the scraps with diameters < 8 mm were too weak for the actual devices to process; the scraps with diameter from 8 – 13 mm still generated {{quite a lot of}} AE signals of inadequate intensity. Finally the general characterization and recognition yields were 64. 6 %, 61. 7 %, and 63. 9 % of PP, ABS, and SMA in mass, respectively of tested materials...|$|E

The 5-way switch is a so called super-switch and it is wired is such a way that in the middle position it enable both the neck and bridge pickups instead of the middle pickup that is enable only in combination with the bridge or the neck pickup. In this way, considering that the bridge pickup has 3 possible configurations, the total pickup combinations available are eleven.

40|$|The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) {{diagnostic}} instruments at Oak Ridge National Laboratory {{are based}} on the Network Attached Device (NAD) concept.

LabVIEW supports the agile development demanded by modern diagnostic systems. EPICS is the control system standard for the entire SNS facility. Program templates and documentation tools are available to the programmer. SNS diagnostics are developed by a multi-laboratory partnership, including ORNL, BNL, LANL, and LBNL.

5000|$|The Strat Plus {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1987 as an upgraded version of the mid-1980s American Standard Stratocaster (first introduced in 1986) featuring three Gold Lace <b>Sensor</b> <b>pickups</b> (used by Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Buddy Guy), Fender/Wilkinson needle-bearing roller nut (changed to the LSR nut in 1993), Sperzel staggered locking machine heads (later models came with Schaller staggered locking tuners), a TBX tone control for the middle and bridge pickups and a Hipshot Tremsetter. The Strat Plus was the highest end production model next to Fender Custom Shop guitars. Models were available with both maple and rosewood fretboards.|$|R

50|$|Acoustic-only based systems {{typically}} generate their alerts a {{few seconds}} slower than optical sensing systems because they rely on the propagation of sound waves. Therefore, the sound reaching a sensor 1 mile from its origin will take almost 5 seconds. A few seconds to accommodate <b>pickup</b> from distant <b>sensors</b> and to discern the number of rounds fired, often an indicator of incident severity, are both tolerable and a drastic improvement for typical police dispatching scenarios when compared against the several minutes that elapse from when an actual discharge occurs to the cumulative time of several minutes that pass when a person decides to place a 9-1-1 call and that information is captured, processed, and dispatched to patrol officers.|$|R
50|$|These guitars had Lace <b>Sensor</b> <b>pickups</b> (a Blue at the neck, and a dual Red at {{the bridge}} with a mini switch to split them), a Strat-style tremolo behind the metal place {{surrounding}} the bridge pickups, and a roller nut. Houser didn’t like to use a whammy bar, preferring to pull up on {{the tail of the}} bridge instead. The mini switch is in between the volume and tone pots. This allows for a wider array of tones than a standard Telecaster. On most Telecasters, you can choose neck, bridge, or both pickups simultaneously. With the dual Reds in the bridge being splittable, you can choose neck, bridge dual, bridge single, or combinations of neck and dual bridge as well as neck and single bridge.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, Dan Smith {{approached}} Clapton {{to discuss}} a plan to create a signature guitar built to his own specifications. Based on Clapton's brief, Fender made two early prototypes: one with a neck based on measurements taken from Blackie and one with a slightly softer V shape which Clapton ultimately deemed preferable. Both prototypes featured electronics based on the Elite Stratocaster including its 12 dB MDX mid-boost circuit intended to make the stratocasters' single-coils sound more like a humbucker. Clapton liked the boost circuit but asked for more dynamic range, prompting Fender to replace the [...] "Elite" [...] pickups with Gold Lace <b>Sensor</b> <b>pickups</b> and an updated MDX circuit that had been tweaked up to 25 dB boost in the midrange at around 500 Hz.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Upgrade {{was introduced}} in 1991 and had a poplar body, three Lace <b>Sensor</b> <b>pickups</b> (models Blue at the neck, Silver {{in the middle and}} Red at the bridge) and a treble/bass expander (TBX) tone control. The TBX was a dual function stacked potentiometer tone control. From settings 1 to 5, the TBX responded like a normal tone control and routed the signal through a 250k pot with a shunt [...]022uF capacitor to cut treble. Settings 6 to 10 routed the signal directly through a 1 meg pot which supposedly cut bass, although how this was to be accomplished without a series capacitor remains a mystery. This model was available in Black/Gold Paisley, Black/Candy Red Paisley, Pearl White and Frost Red.|$|R
5000|$|The Telecaster Plus (Version One) came {{equipped}} with Lace Sensor pickups; [...] "Dually Red-Red" [...] in the bridge position and [...] "Blue" [...] {{in the neck}} position.

The Telecaster Plus (Version Two) is most-often rumored to have come with three [...] "Gold" [...] Lace <b>Sensor</b> <b>pickups</b> due to the gold lettering on their covers. However, the pickups actually used on the guitar were a T-100 pickup in the bridge, a non-RWRP Chrome Dome Strat pickup in the middle and a TN-100 in the neck.
