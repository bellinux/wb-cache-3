50|$|Many {{applications}} {{can reduce}} {{a major portion}} of <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> by populating <b>data</b> fields based upon the entered ISBN using MARC standards technology via the Internet.|$|R
5000|$|This {{method of}} data {{processing}} involves human operators keying in data {{found on the}} form. The <b>manual</b> process of <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> has many disadvantages in speed, accuracy and cost. Based on average professional typist speeds of 50 to 80 wpm, one could generously estimate about two hundred pages per hour for forms with fifteen one-word fields (not counting the time for reading and sorting pages). In contrast, modern commercial scanners can scan and digitize up to 200 pages per minute. [...] The second major disadvantage to <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> is the likelihood of typographical errors. When factoring {{in the cost of}} labor and working space, <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> is a very inefficient process.|$|R

40|$|Individual-level {{immunization}} data captured electronically {{can facilitate}} evidence-based decision-making and planning. Populating individual-level records through <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> is time-consuming. An {{alternative is to}} use scannable forms, completed {{at the point of}} vaccination and subsequently scanned and exported to a database or registry. To explore the suitability of this approach for collecting immunization data, we conducted a feasibility study in two settings in Ontario, Canada. Prior to the 2011 - 2012 influenza vaccination campaign, we developed a scannable form template and a corresponding database that captured required demographic and clinical data elements. We examined efficiency, data quality, and usability through time observations, record audits, staff interviews, and client surveys. The mean time required to scan and verify forms (62. 3 s) was significantly shorter than <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (69. 5 s) in one organization, whereas there was no difference (36. 6 s vs. 35. 4 s) in a second organization. Record audits revealed no differences in data quality between records populated by scanning versus <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> <b>Data</b> processing personnel and immunized clients found the processes involved to be straightforward, while nurses and managers had mixed perceptions regarding the ease and merit of using scannable forms. Printing quality and other factors rendered some forms unscannable, necessitating manual entry. Scannable forms can facilitate efficient <b>data</b> <b>entry,</b> but certain features of the forms, as well as the workflow and infrastructure into which they are incorporated, should be evaluated and adapted if scannable forms are to be a meaningful alternative to <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of performing extensive calculations on microdensitometer <b>data</b> makes <b>entry</b> of the <b>data</b> {{into a computer}} mandatory for many types of investigative situations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) is {{a viable}} {{alternative}} to the tuberculin skin test (TST) for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, within-subject variability may limit test utility. To assess variability, we compared results from the same subjects when QFT-GIT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed in different laboratories. METHODS: Subjects were recruited at two sites and blood was tested in three labs. Two labs used the same type of automated ELISA workstation, 8 -point calibration curves, and electronic data transfer. The third lab used a different automated ELISA workstation, 4 -point calibration curves, and <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> Variability was assessed by interpretation agreement and comparison of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) measurements. Data for subjects with discordant interpretations or discrepancies in TB Response > 0. 05 IU/mL were verified or corrected, and variability was reassessed using a reconciled dataset. RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects had results from three labs. Eleven (11. 3 %) had discordant interpretations and 72 (74. 2 %) had discrepancies > 0. 05 IU/mL using unreconciled results. After correction of <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> errors for 9 subjects, and exclusion of 6 subjects due to methodological errors, 7 (7. 7 %) subjects were discordant. Of these, 6 (85. 7 %) had all TB Responses within 0. 25 IU/mL of the manufacturer's recommended cutoff. Non-uniform error of measurement was observed, with greater variation in higher IFN-γ measurements. Within-subject standard deviation for TB Response was as high as 0. 16 IU/mL, and limits of agreement ranged from - 0. 46 to 0. 43 IU/mL for subjects with mean TB Response within 0. 25 IU/mL of the cutoff. CONCLUSION: Greater interlaboratory variability was associated with <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> and higher IFN-γ measurements. <b>Manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> should be avoided. Because variability in measuring TB Response may affect interpretation, especially near the cutoff, consideration should be given to developing a range of values near the cutoff to be interpreted as "borderline," rather than negative or positive...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} and scientific usage of patient-reported outcome measures is increasing {{in the health}} services. Often paper forms are used. <b>Manual</b> double <b>entry</b> of <b>data</b> {{is defined as the}} definitive gold standard for transferring data to an electronic format, but the process is laborious. Automated forms processing may be an alternative, but further validation is warranted. Methods: 200 patients were randomly selected from a cohort of 5777 patients who had previously answered two different questionnaires. The questionnaires were scanned using an automated forms processing technique, as well as processed by single and double <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry,</b> using the EpiData <b>Entry</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> program. The main outcome measure was the proportion of correctly entered numbers at question, form and study level. Results: <b>Manual</b> double-key <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (error proportion per 1000 fields = 0. 046 (95 % CI: 0. 001 – 0. 258)) performed better than single-key <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (error proportion per 1000 fields = 0. 370 (95 % CI: 0. 160 – 0. 729), (p = 0. 020)).
