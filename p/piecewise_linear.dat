25|$|PDIFF {{is mostly}} a {{technical}} point: smooth maps are not <b>piecewise</b> <b>linear</b> (unless linear), and <b>piecewise</b> <b>linear</b> maps are not smooth (unless globally linear) – the intersection is linear maps, or more precisely affine maps (because not based) – so they cannot directly be related: they are separate generalizations {{of the notion of}} an affine map.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{adaptive}} {{finite element method}} (AFEM) using <b>piecewise</b> <b>linears</b> on a sequence of triangulations obtained by adaptive √ 3 refinement. The motivation to consider √ 3 refinement {{stems from the fact}} that it is a slower topological refinement than the usual red or red-green refinement, and that it alternates the orientation of the refined triangles, such that certain features or singularities that are not aligned with the initial triangulation might be detected more quickly. On the other hand, the use of √ 3 refinement introduces the additional difficulty that the corresponding finite element spaces are nonnested. This makes the setting nonconforming. First we derive a BPX-type preconditioner for <b>piecewise</b> <b>linears</b> on the adaptively refined triangulations and we show that it gives rise to uniformly bounded condition numbers, so that we can solve the linear systems arising from the AFEM in an efficient way. Then we introduce the AFEM of Morin, Nochetto, and Siebert adapted to our special case for solving the Poisson equation. We prove that this adaptive strategy converges to the solution within any prescribed error tolerance in a finite number of steps. Finally we present some numerical experiments that show the optimality of both the BPX preconditioner and the AFEM. nrpages: 31 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} a long-standing {{question}} of whether certain mesh restrictions are required for a maximum condition to hold for the discrete equations arising from a finite element approximation of an elliptic problem. This is related to knowing whether the discrete Green’s function is positive for triangular meshes allowing sufficiently good approximation of H 1 functions. We study this question for the Poisson problem in two dimensions discretized via the Galerkin method with continuous <b>piecewise</b> <b>linears.</b> We give examples which show that in general the answer is negative, and furthermore we extend {{the number of cases}} where it is known to be positive.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{solving the}} Laplace-Beltrami problem on a smooth two dimensional surface embedded into a three dimensional space meshed with tetrahedra. The mesh does not respect {{the surface and}} thus the surface cuts through the elements. We consider a Galerkin method based on using the restrictions of continuous <b>piecewise</b> <b>linears</b> defined on the tetrahedra to the surface as trial and test functions. The resulting discrete method may be severely ill-conditioned, and {{the main purpose of}} this paper is to suggest a remedy for this problem based on adding a consistent stabilization term to the original bilinear form. We show optimal estimates for the condition number of the stabilized method independent of the location of the surface. We also prove optimal a priori error estimates for the stabilized method...|$|R

We prove that the semi-iterative algorithms enjoy a nice monotone convergence property {{in the sense that}} subsets of the indices consisting of the indices, for which the corresponding components of the iterates violate the constraints, become smaller and smaller. Then the algorithms converge monotonically to the exact solutions of the problems in a finite number of steps.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{adaptation}} of nonconforming finite element methods to the equations of elasticity with traction boundary conditions, the main difficulty in the analysis is to prove that an appropriate discrete version of Korn's second inequality is valid. Such a result is shown to hold for nonconforming piecewise quadratic and cubic finite elements and to be false for nonconforming <b>piecewise</b> <b>linears.</b> Optimal-order error estimates, uniform for Poisson ratio i^ 6 [0, 1 / 2), are then derived for the corresponding P 2 and P ¿ methods. This contrasts {{with the use of}} C finite elements, where there is a deterioration in the convergence rate as v — ► 1 / 2 for piecewise polynomials of degree < 3. Modifications of the continuous methods and the nonconforming linear method which also give uniform optimal-order error estimates are discussed. 1...|$|R

In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the Lagrange–Galerkin finite element approximation by continuous <b>piecewise</b> <b>linears</b> in space of the following problem: Given Ω ⊂ Rd, 1 ≤ d ≤ 3, find u(x, t) and v(x, t) such that ∂tu+ ∂tv −∇.

Here k ∈ R+ and the spatial differential operator is uniformly elliptic, but ϕ ∈ C 0 (R) ∩ C 1 (−∞, 0] ∪ (0,∞) is a monotonically increasing function satisfying ϕ(0) = 0, which is only locally Hölder continuous, with exponent p ∈ (0, 1) at the origin; e. g., ϕ(s) : = [s]p+.

25|$|If a graph {{is drawn}} {{in the plane}} with {{straight}} line edges, then an equilibrium stress is defined as an assignment of nonzero real numbers (weights) to the edges, with the property that each vertex is in the position given by the weighted sum of its neighbors. According to the Maxwell–Cremona correspondence, an equilibrium stress can be lifted to a <b>piecewise</b> <b>linear</b> continuous three-dimensional surface such that the edges forming the boundaries between the flat parts of the surface project to the given drawing. The weight and length of each edge determines the difference in slopes of the surface {{on either side of}} the edge, and the condition that each vertex is in equilibrium with its neighbors is equivalent to the condition that these slope differences cause the surface to meet up with itself correctly in the neighborhood of the vertex. Positive weights translate to convex dihedral angles between two faces of the <b>piecewise</b> <b>linear</b> surface, and negative weights translate to concave dihedral angles. Conversely, every continuous piecewise-linear surface comes from an equilibrium stress in this way. If a finite planar graph is drawn and given an equilibrium stress in such a way that all interior edges of the drawing have positive weights, and all exterior edges have negative weights, then by translating this stress into a three-dimensional surface in this way, and then replacing the flat surface representing the exterior of the graph by its complement in the same plane, one obtains a convex poyhedron, with the additional property that its perpendicular projection onto the plane has no crossings.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{ergodicity}} can {{be broken}} is by the existence of nonlinear soliton symmetries.

They found that {{the behavior of the}} system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited a very complicated quasi-periodic behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the Korteweg–de Vries equation {{led to the development of}} soliton mathematics.|$|E
