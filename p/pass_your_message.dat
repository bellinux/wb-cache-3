As you {{continue}} to use social media, be sure to work to keep <b>your</b> <b>message</b> fresh and in line with current trends. Use feedback from your followers such as comments, re-tweets, and post-sharing {{to figure out which}} types of posts are most popular {{and if there is a}} certain type of content that seems to be the most engaging. Pictures instead of large blocks of text are generally more popular and lead to more engagement from your followers, while a short overview of a blog post followed by a link can lead to more clicks than a link with no description. With platforms such as Twitter, hashtags can allow you to enter into wider conversations, join in on trends, and to find ways to share <b>your</b> <b>message</b> with a larger audience. In addition, be on the look-out for emerging trends and new forms of social media and be open to trying something new to share <b>your</b> <b>message.</b> Setting up a Vine or Instagram account for your lab may not make sense at first thought, but being creative in finding other visual ways to share your science with videos or photos could make all the difference in expanding your online presence.|$|R
