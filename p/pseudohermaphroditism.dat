25|$|Genetic males (46,XY) with 5α-reductase type II {{deficiency}} {{are born}} with undervirilization including <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> (ambiguous genitalia), pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias, and usually undescended testes. Their external genitalia are female-like, with micropenis (a small, clitoris-like phallus), a partially unfused, labia-like scrotum, and a blind-ending, shallow vaginal pouch. Due to their lack of conspicuous male genitalia, genetic males with the condition are typically raised as girls. At the time of puberty however, they develop striking phenotypically masculine secondary sexual characteristics including partial virilization of the genitals (enlargement of the phallus into a near-functional penis and descent of the testes), voice deepening, typical male musculoskeletal development, and no menstruation, breast development, or other signs of feminization that occur during female puberty. In addition, normal libido and spontaneous erections develop, they usually show a sexual preference for females, and almost all develop a male gender identity.|$|E

5000|$|In some cases, {{external}} sex organs {{associated with}} <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> look intermediate between a typical clitoris and penis. In other cases, the external sex organs have an appearance {{that would be}} expected to be seen with the [...] "opposite" [...] gonadal tissue. Because of this, <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> is sometimes not identified until puberty or adulthood.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} are {{associated}} with hypogonadism which is characterized by infertility and <b>pseudohermaphroditism.</b>|$|E
50|$|This isoform of 17β-HSD is {{expressed}} predominantly in the testis and catalyzes {{the conversion of}} androstenedione to testosterone. It preferentially uses NADP as cofactor. Deficiency can result in male <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> with gynecomastia.|$|E
50|$|A {{study on}} a male {{pseudohermaphrodite}} kitten showed {{there was a}} combination of gastrointestinal and urogenital congenital abnormalities. It was confirmed to have type II atresia ani and rectovaginal fistula that is associated with male <b>pseudohermaphroditism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Frasier {{syndrome}} presents {{at birth}} with male <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> (the external genitalia have a female appearance despite an XY genotype), streak gonads and progressive glomerulonephropathy (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis). Patients {{are also at}} increased risk of genito-urinary tumors (usually gonadoblastoma).|$|E
50|$|Aromatase excess {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} familial hyperestrogenism) - A condition that causes excessive estrogen production, resulting in feminization without <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> (i.e., male genitalia at birth and female {{secondary sexual characteristics}} at puberty) in males and hyperfeminization in females.|$|E
50|$|Loss-of-function {{mutations}} in females {{can lead to}} infertility. In 46, XY individuals severe inactivation can cause male <b>pseudohermaphroditism,</b> as fetal Leydig cells during may not respond and induce masculinization. Less severe inactivation can result in hypospadias or a micropenis.|$|E
50|$|Clinically, Denys-Drash is {{characterized}} by the triad of <b>pseudohermaphroditism,</b> mesangial renal sclerosis, and Wilms' tumor. The condition first manifests as early nephrotic syndrome and progresses to mesangial renal sclerosis, and ultimately renal failure—usually within {{the first three years of}} life.|$|E
50|$|Aromatase {{deficiency}} - A {{disorder in}} which, in females, {{is characterized by}} androgen excess and estrogen deficiency, and can result in inappropriate virilization, though without <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> (i.e., genitals are phenotypically appropriate) (with {{the exception of the}} possible incidence of clitoromegaly).|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes a microsomal protein {{expressed}} at {{high levels}} in androgen-sensitive tissues such as the prostate. The encoded protein is active at acidic pH and is sensitive to the 4-azasteroid inhibitor finasteride. Deficiencies in this gene can result in male <b>pseudohermaphroditism,</b> specifically pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias (PPSH).|$|E
50|$|Mutations {{affecting}} the androgen receptor (AR) gene may cause either complete or partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. Androgen, a hormone {{used to describe}} a group of sex steroid hormones, is responsible for affecting male <b>pseudohermaphroditism.</b> The differentiation of the fetus as male takes place during the sixth or seventh week of gestation. The development is directed by the testicular determining factor: the gene SRY (sex determining region on Y chromosome). Throughout 9th to 13th week, {{the development of a}} male genitalia is dependent upon the conversion of testosterone to the more potent androgen by the action of 5α-reductase within the target tissues of the genitalia. A type of internal male <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> is Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome, which is developed through synthesis of Müllerian-inhibiting factor defects. In such instances, duct derivatives are now in 46XY males—this includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina. These individuals with a hernia sac and bowel loops were found with duct derivatives as well as testes.|$|E
50|$|Persistent müllerian duct {{syndrome}} - A rare type of <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> {{that occurs}} in 46 XY males, caused by either a mutation in the Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) gene, on 19p13, or its type II receptor, 12q13. Results in a retention of Müllerian ducts (persistence of rudimentary uterus and fallopian tubes in otherwise normally virilized males), unilateral or bilateral undescended testes and sometimes causes infertility.|$|E
5000|$|Persistent Müllerian duct {{syndrome}} (PMDS) is {{the presence}} of Müllerian duct derivatives (fallopian tubes, uterus, and/or {{the upper part of the}} vagina) [...] in what would be considered a genetically male animal by typical human based standards. In humans, PMDS typically is due to an autosomal recessive congenital disorder and is considered by some to be a form of <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> due to the presence of Müllerian derivatives.|$|E
5000|$|... 17β-Hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} III deficiency {{is a rare}} {{disorder of}} sexual development, or intersex condition, affecting testosterone biosynthesis by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III (17β-HSD III), which can produce impaired virilization (historically termed male <b>pseudohermaphroditism)</b> of genetically male infants and children and excessive virilization of female adults. It is an autosomal recessive condition {{and is one of}} the few disorders of sexual development that can affect the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of both males and females.|$|E
5000|$|The {{suggested}} solution {{put forth}} by ISNA was to restructure the system of intersex taxonomy and nomenclature to not include the words ‘hermaphrodite’, ‘hermaphroditism’, ‘sex reversal’, or other similar terms. This [...] "standard division of many intersex types into true hermaphroditism, male <b>pseudohermaphroditism,</b> and female pseudohermaphroditism" [...] was described by ISNA and its advocates as confusing and clinically problematic, and a replacement term, disorders of sex development was proposed by Alice Dreger, Cheryl Chase and others in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Aromatase excess {{syndrome}} (AES or AEXS), {{also sometimes}} referred to as familial hyperestrogenism or familial gynecomastia, is a rare genetic and endocrine syndrome which is characterized by an overexpression of aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the estrogen sex hormones from the androgens, in turn resulting in excessive levels of circulating estrogens and, accordingly, symptoms of hyperestrogenism. It affects both sexes, manifesting itself in males as marked or complete phenotypical feminization (with the exception of the genitalia; i.e., no <b>pseudohermaphroditism)</b> and in females as hyperfeminization.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of Leydig cell hypoplasia include <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> (i.e., feminized, ambiguous, or relatively mildly underdeveloped (e.g., micropenis, severe hypospadias, and/or cryptorchidism (undescended testes)) external genitalia), a female gender identity or gender variance, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (hypogonadism despite {{high levels of}} gonadotropins), delayed, impaired, or fully absent puberty with an associated reduction in or complete lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics (sexual infantilism), impaired fertility or complete sterility, tall stature (due to delayed epiphyseal closure), eunuchoid skeletal proportions, delayed or absent bone maturation, and osteoporosis.|$|E
5000|$|HSD17B3: Referred to as [...] "androgenic". Major subtype {{in males}} for {{activation}} of androgens from weaker forms (androstenedione to testosterone and DHEA to androstenediol). Also activates estrogens from weaker forms {{to a lesser}} extent (estrone to estradiol). Essential for testicular but not ovarian production of testosterone. Not expressed in the ovaries, where another 17β-HSD subtype, likely HSD17B5, is expressed instead. Mutations are associated with [...] type III deficiency. Males with this condition have <b>pseudohermaphroditism,</b> while females are normal with normal androgen and estrogen levels.|$|E
50|$|A related {{condition}} is luteinizing hormone (LH) insensitivity (termed Leydig cell hypoplasia when {{it occurs in}} males), which presents with similar symptoms to those of FSH insensitivity but with the symptoms in the respective sexes reversed (i.e., hypogonadism and sexual infantilism in males and merely problems with fertility in females); however, males also present with feminized or ambiguous genitalia (also known as <b>pseudohermaphroditism),</b> whereas ambiguous genitalia does not occur in females with FSH insensitivity. Despite their similar causes, LH insensitivity is considerably more common in comparison to FSH insensitivity.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{the male}} {{mutation}} of the GnRH coding gene {{could result in}} hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. A mutation that cause a gain of function for LH receptor {{can result in a}} condition known as testotoxicosis, which cause puberty to occur between ages 2-3 years. Loss of function of LH receptors can cause male <b>pseudohermaphroditism.</b> In females mutations would have analogous effects. Hormone replacement can be used to initiate puberty and continue if the gene mutation occurs in the gene coding for the hormone. Chromosomal mutations tend to affect the androgen production rather than the HPG axis.|$|E
50|$|Isolated 17,20-lyase {{deficiency}} (ILD), {{also called}} isolated 17,20-desmolase deficiency, {{is a rare}} endocrine and autosomal recessive genetic disorder which {{is characterized by a}} complete or partial loss of 17,20-lyase activity and, in turn, impaired production of the androgen and estrogen sex steroids. The condition manifests itself as <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> (partially or fully underdeveloped genitalia) in males, in whom it {{is considered to be a}} form of intersex, and, in both sexes, as a reduced or absent puberty/lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, resulting in a somewhat childlike appearance in adulthood (if left untreated).|$|E
50|$|Same-sex {{marriages are}} not allowed in Singapore. Under the {{category}} of civil marriages, the gender of a person is the one stated in his/her National Registration Identity Card. Therefore, a recognized transgender person may marry {{a person who is}} of the opposite sex from his/her sex as stated in the NRIC. On the other hand, in the context of Muslim marriages, a transgender person is not allowed to marry regardless of sex change done. This is waived if the person is born with both genital organs (hermaphrodite or <b>pseudohermaphroditism)</b> and makes a change.|$|E
50|$|The gender {{taxonomy}} is {{a classification}} {{of the range}} of different levels at which humans vary in sexual characteristics. It is mainly used by medical specialists working in the area of sex research.John Money and Milton Diamond are probably the best known researchers in this field. Money earned his PhD for research into human hermaphroditism and <b>pseudohermaphroditism,</b> now known as intersex conditions. The taxonomy starts at the simplest, biological level and traces differentiations expressed at the increasingly complicated levels produced {{over the course of the}} human life cycle.|$|E
50|$|CYP17A1 is {{a member}} of the {{cytochrome}} P450 superfamily of enzymes localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins in this family are monooxygenases that catalyze synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids and are involved in drug metabolism. CYP17A1 has both 17α-hydroxylase activity and 17,20-lyase activity. The 17α-hydroxylase activity of CYP17A1 is required for the generation of glucocorticoids such as cortisol, but both the hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities of CYP17A1 are required for the production of androgenic and oestrogenic sex steroids by converting 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Mutations in this gene are associated with isolated steroid-17α-hydroxylase deficiency, 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, <b>pseudohermaphroditism,</b> and adrenal hyperplasia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pseudohermaphroditism,</b> or pseudo-hermaphroditism, is a {{clinical}} {{term for the}} condition in which an organism is born with primary sex characteristics of one sex but develops the secondary sex characteristics that are different from what would be expected {{on the basis of}} the gonadal tissue (ovary or testis). It can be contrasted with the term true hermaphroditism, which described a condition where testicular and ovarian tissue were present in the same individual. This language has fallen out of favor due to misconceptions and pejorative connotations associated with the terms, and also a shift to nomenclature based on genetics.|$|E
50|$|Leydig cell {{hypoplasia}} (or aplasia) (LCH), {{also known}} as Leydig cell agenesis, is a rare autosomal recessive genetic and endocrine syndrome affecting an estimated 1 in 1,000,000 genetic males. It is characterized by an inability {{of the body to}} respond to luteinizing hormone (LH), a gonadotropin which is normally responsible for signaling Leydig cells of the testicles to produce testosterone and other androgen sex hormones. The condition manifests itself as <b>pseudohermaphroditism</b> (partially or fully underdeveloped genitalia), hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (decreased or lack of production of sex steroids by the gonads despite high circulating levels of gonadotropins), reduced or absent puberty (lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, resulting in sexual infantilism if left untreated), and infertility.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{significant}} shift from publishing a regular journal titled Hermaphrodites with Attitude and demonstrating {{using the same}} name, the last stated goal of the organization was to eradicate what the organization deemed as [...] "misleading language". The ISNA claimed that nomenclature based on hermaphroditism was stigmatizing to intersex individuals, as well as potentially panic-inducing to parents of intersex children. The suggested solution put forth by the ISNA was to restructure the system of intersex taxonomy and nomenclature to not include the words ‘hermaphrodite’, ‘hermaphroditism’, ‘sex reversal’, or other similar terms.
