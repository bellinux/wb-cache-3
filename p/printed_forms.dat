The development of modems and internet technology in the 1970s led to several advancements. Reynolds provided 3,600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978. The modems communicated with Reynolds' VIM-brand minicomputers at 80 Reynolds locations, which provided computing power and <b>printed</b> <b>forms.</b> This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to Reynolds in tapes and allowed daily access to online services. By the end of the 1970s, batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at the dealership. In the years 1978 and 1982, Reynolds introduced VIM-brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships.|$|E

2500|$|Manuscript miscellanies are {{important}} in the Middle Ages, and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry. [...] Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal documents, recipes, music, medical and devotional literature {{and other types of}} text, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany. [...] They may have been written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience. [...] In the early modern period miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both in manuscript and <b>printed</b> <b>forms,</b> mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry, but also other works. [...] Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the 18th century, when over 1000 English poetry miscellanies were published, before the rise of anthologies in the early 19th century. [...] The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the format of the regularly published magazine, and many early magazines used the word in their titles.|$|E

60|$|Such was Miss Brass in person. In mind, she was of {{a strong}} and {{vigorous}} turn, having from her earliest youth devoted herself with uncommon ardour {{to the study of}} law; not wasting her speculations upon its eagle flights, which are rare, but tracing it attentively through all the slippery and eel-like crawlings in which it commonly pursues its way. Nor had she, like many persons of great intellect, confined herself to theory, or stopped short where practical usefulness begins; inasmuch as she could ingross, fair-copy, fill up <b>printed</b> <b>forms</b> with perfect accuracy, and, in short, transact any ordinary duty of the office down to pouncing a skin of parchment or mending a pen. It is difficult to understand how, possessed of these combined attractions, she should remain Miss Brass; but whether she had steeled her heart against mankind, or whether those who might have wooed and won her, were deterred by fears that, being learned in the law, she might have too near her fingers' ends those particular statutes which regulate what are familiarly termed actions for breach, certain it is that she was still in a state of celibacy, and still in daily occupation of her old stool opposite to that of her brother Sampson. And equally certain it is, by the way, that between these two stools a great many people had come to the ground.|$|E

They would have referred the question to Miss Williams, but she had been deposited by the Colonel on one of the chairs in the furthest corner of the room, and he stood sheltering her agitation and watching the proceedings. Lady Temple still held a hand of each of her rescued victims, as if she feared they were still in danger, and all the time Rachel stood and looked like a statue, unable to collect her convictions in the hubbub, and the trust, that would have enabled her to defy all this, swept away from her by the morning's transactions. Yet still there was a hope that appearances might be delusive, and an habitual low estimate of Mr. Grey's powers that made her set on looking with her own eyes, not with his.|$|E
