50|$|The {{key point}} in this method is that k in {{equations}} (1.1) and (1.2) comes from the time derivative in Maxwell's equations and is the free space propagation constant (actually, the propagation constant of whatever medium the metallic scatterers are embedded in), proportional to frequency as we see in equation (1.3). On the other hand, k0 in the equations above comes from our assumed Bloch wave solution given by equations (2.1) & (2.2). As a result, it represents the propagation constant in the <b>periodic</b> <b>medium,</b> inversely proportional to wavelength. These two k's, i.e. the free space propagation constant and the propagation constant of the Bloch wave, are in general different thereby allowing for dispersion in the solutions we obtain.|$|E
