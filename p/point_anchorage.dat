30|$|The {{frequency}} {{at which}} the cell duplicates is increased as cell spreads. This fact could {{be associated with the}} fact that the more extended cells with larger surfaces are, the greater the number of growth-factors molecules and nutrients they can capture. The cells of the 3 T 3 cell line are, however, virtually unable to grow in suspension but they can duplicate rapidly when they find an <b>anchorage</b> <b>point</b> in any surface by forming a focal contact. Even if this <b>anchorage</b> <b>point</b> is so small for preventing the cell extension, it will enable them to duplicate more frequently.|$|R

50|$|The diamond hitch is a lashing {{technique}} used {{mainly in the}} field of equine packing, to secure a set of objects, for instance a pair of pack-bags, pack-boxes or other gear onto a base, for instance a pack saddle frame, in which case it requires the use of a lash cinch. In the general sense it requires the base to be equipped with at least two <b>points</b> of <b>anchorage,</b> and a rope which is used to lash the object down onto the base. There are two types of Diamond Hitches, a single, shown here, and a double diamond hitch which is not shown.|$|R
