5|$|In mid-December 1982 {{the author}} and future Holocaust denier David Irving was also {{involved}} in tracking the existence of diaries written by Hitler. Priesack had previously told Irving {{of the existence of}} one of the diaries with a collector in Stuttgart. In a visit to Priesack to assess his collection of Nazi documents, Irving found out Stiefel's phone number, from which he worked out the address; he also obtained photocopies of some of the diary <b>pages</b> <b>from</b> Priesack. Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried to find out the name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesack's photocopies and saw a number of problems, including spelling mistakes and the change in writing style between certain words.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven <b>pages</b> <b>from</b> his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated– could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis (ESDA). The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above it is written on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} refined further by {{director}} Val Guest, who cut 30 <b>pages</b> <b>from</b> Landau's script. One of Guest's key {{contributions to the}} script was to tailor the dialogue to suit the brusque style of star Brian Donlevy. With an American actor cast as Quatermass, Guest reverted Briscoe to a British character and reinstated Quatermass's title of professor. Guest also adapted some sections of the script {{in response to the}} concerns of the BBFC. Further stylistic changes were sought by the BBC who retained a script approval option after the sale of the rights and asked Nigel Kneale to work on their suggested changes, much to his indignation. Kneale was tasked with rewriting any scenes featuring BBC announcers to match the BBC's news reporting style.|$|E
5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript <b>pages</b> <b>from</b> Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E

5|$|In November 2010, Viz Media {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Tenjho Tenge manga, stating that their version would be 100% uncut and faithful to the original Japanese.

5|$|Preliminary {{shooting}} {{took place}} at the Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, during late 2007. Principal photography began on January 2008 in New Zealand. One of the filming locations that was selected was Dunedin. Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour's decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink. Fox moved some of the explosives to another area. The explosives were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required thirteen cameras. Jackman and Palermo's Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly. According to Hood, the screenplay was still incomplete as filming begun, with the production in Australia receiving regularly new script <b>pages</b> <b>from</b> Los Angeles, at times in the night before shooting.|$|E
5|$|The fourth edition, {{published}} in 1769, {{is the first}} complete edition in one volume and had hard covers. He added footnotes to make certain issues clearer. In this edition he also added several of his own philosophical essays and completed the volume with an index. The fourth edition was a book volume with hard covers that {{increased the number of}} <b>pages</b> <b>from</b> 154 to 496. Franklin added papers on his lightning rod invention, meteorological observations, human nature, worldwide population increase, waterspouts, experiments on amber, and information on his Pennsylvania fireplace invention. This edition had copper plate illustrations of his lightning rod design, new fireplace, and electrical experiments. The fifth English edition was {{published in}} 1774. There was little difference between the fourth edition and the fifth edition. The only new document added in the fifth edition, that was not in the fourth edition, was the French experiment with lightning done in 1752. There was an advertisement in the Public Advertiser London newspaper of September 9, 1774, that promoted the fifth edition.|$|E
