40|$|THESIS: that {{changing}} transportation technology helped determine {{the limit of}} maximum expansion {{of the city and}} that the physical characteristics of transportation have determined the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> growth to that limit. Population movements and growth have occurred in two stages: influx into the city and explosion to the suburbs. Transportation technology has advanced in two stages: centripetal, emphasizing a single center, and centrifugal, de-emphasizing one center. There is a correspondence between these stages of population and transportation change. The growth of cities occurs in cycles. In a cycle, the dominant mode of transportation sets a <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> land use which determines later need for transportation, and so on, in a continuous cycle of cause and effect. Along a path of transportation, a stop creates a nodal pattern centered around the stop. If the distance between the stops is long, the nodes retain their identity. If this distance is short, the nodes evolve a linear pattern. Growth occurs primarily in the linear or nodal patterns. A third pattern, spread, results when the pace of growth is so rapid that growth occurs in units the size of the basic network or larger. The network is the sum of the paths of a mode of transportation. The growth of Philadelphia, Chicago, and Houston demonstrates that: increasing speed of means of transportation extends the boundaries of the city outward in proportion to speed, the dominant mode of transportation during a cycle of growth establishes its peculiar pattern for future <b>growth,</b> the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> can be categorized as "nodal", "linear", and "spread", and these <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> are determined by the physical characteristics of transportation...|$|R

Increasingly, jurisdictions have adopted incentive based mechanisms, such as purchase of development rights (PDR) programs, to manage the pace and <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> and the conversion of agricultural land. PDR programs provide a third option to landowners in urbanizing areas: in addition to deciding whether to develop or not, landowners can decide whether to preserve their land. To our knowledge no studies have explored how the existence of an option to participate in a PDR program affects landowners' development decisions. This research provides empirical evidence of a previously untested prediction of real options theory: that additional options increase the value of waiting to make irreversible decisions. Our paper considers how an additional land use alternative, preservation, conveys a different type of option value and how that option affects the optimal conversion time. We estimate a hazard model and find significant evidence that the option to enter an easement decreases the hazard rate of development by about 40 %. The results suggest that PDR programs can provide additional open space and amenity values beyond what is provided on preserved parcels, by delaying development (by at least a few years) of parcels that are not actually preserved. agricultural preservation programs, real options, land conversion, Land Economics/Use,...|$|E

The results showed that the urban area as well as the growth rate increased significantly. Three urban growth types were distinguished: infilling, edge-expansion and spontaneous growth. The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> can be described as a ‘diffusion–coales-cence ’ phase transition. Although edge-expansion was the most common growth type, the spontane-ous growth took a greater proportion in area and patch number than the infilling growth at the early stage, but its dominance decreased as urbanization proceeded from the diffusion phase to the coales-cence phase. Hot-zones of urban growth and the distribution pattern of newly urbanized areas in different periods were studied with a buffering analysis. More than 80 % of the growth area occurred within a zone of 1. 4 km wide outwards from the pre-growth urban fringes. The spatial distribution of newly urbanized areas in each period showed a uniform negative exponential decline relative to the distance {{from the edge of the}} urban patches. There existed an outward wave-like shifting of urban growth hot-zones, but the dis-tance-growth area curves varied at different stages of urban growth.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this thesis is to better {{understand}} changes in the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> {{and its impact on}} landscape configuration by conducting a case study in Greater Chengdu, an inland megacity in China. The objectives are as follows: 1) Quantifying changes in the spatial pattern of the study area between 2003 and 2013; 2) Evaluating the degree of urban sprawl over that period; 3) Evaluating urban expansion dynamics; and 4) Examining and defining the types of urban growth. Satellite imagery was employed to distinguish and identify different land surface categories. Integrated remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information System) technique was used to analyse both qualitative and quantitative perspectives regarding the objectives. The results indicate that the urban area of Greater Chengdu doubled from 525. 5 km 2 to 1191. 85 km 2 during 2003 to 2013. The geographic footprint demonstrates that the distribution of the built-up area was dispersed and continues to grow more dispersed. The dominant type of urban growth is outward expansion, by which the city grew within a 10 km to 25 km radius surrounding the city center. A substantial infill phenomenon exists between a 5 km and 10 km radius from the city center. The urban core boundary expanded outward by 5 km, while the fringe of suburban area expanded outward by 10 km during the time period, which both indicate a substantial outward expansion over the city. The significant contribution of this study could benefit to many aspects such as comparative studies between cities or continuous studies relevant to urban growth...|$|E

It is concluded that jobs-housing balance is not an effective solution for traffic congestion and air pollution concerns. Rather, these problems are better addressed in a more direct way...|$|R
40|$|Kampala, {{the capital}} of Uganda, {{is one of the}} fastest growing African cities with annual growth rates of 5. 6 %. The rapid <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> causes major {{socio-economic}} and environmental problems that lower the quality of life <b>of</b> the <b>urban</b> dwellers. A better insight in the controlling factors <b>of</b> the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>pattern</b> is necessary to develop and implement a sustainable urban planning. The recent <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Kampala was mapped using LANDSAT images of 1989, 1995, 2003 and 2010. A spatially-explicit logistic regression model was developed for Kampala. Significant predictors in this model included: the presence of roads, the accessibility of the city centre and the distance to existing built-up area. These variables are used as steering handles to create future urban scenarios. Three alternative scenarios for future <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> were developed: a business as usual, restrictive and stimulative scenario. Our model of growth was applied to these three scenarios to predict <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> to 2030. The scenarios show that the alternative policy options result in contrasting future urban sprawl patterns with a significant impact on the local quality of life. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{challenge of}} global change is managing the uncontrolled spread of cities into their surrounding rural and other land. The phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> ‘sprawl’ is well known, {{but it remains}} controversial {{because there are no}} universal definitions about its etiology, nor of the causes and variables related to it. The goal {{of this study is to}} depict the temporal trend of sprawl, so as to identify a ‘sprawl signature’ and its evolution for the Italian Province of Pordenone focusing exclusively on spatial dispersion features. Data were compiled from multitemporal remote sensing and used to delimit urban expansion over time. We aim to describe the spatiotemporal patterns associated with urban sprawl using the perspective <b>of</b> the cyclical <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> theory and focusing on measures that can detect the degree of spatial dispersion during time related to sprawl both in past and projected urban forms. Exactly how the spatiotemporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> are identified is crucial for urban planners, as knowledge of them allows more efficient calibration of policies to control land-use change in order to satisfy specific needs of the population and prevent the risks and costs related to sprawl. ...|$|R
