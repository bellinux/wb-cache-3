40|$|We {{show how}} the recent {{experimental}} results concerning an electromechanical coupling in smectic C* {{can be obtained from}} the macroscopic dynamic equations derived by the authors. We point out that the coupling observed is a reversible dynamic cross coupling between the change in the polarization inside the layers and velocity gradients. This type of reversible cross coupling is unique to systems which possess a <b>pseudoscalar</b> <b>quantity</b> (e. g. a helix) and does not exist in nonchiral smectic C...|$|E
40|$|The Lehmann effect arising in a cholesteric {{liquid crystal}} drop when a {{temperature}} gradient is applied parallel to its helical axis is investigated theoretically using a local approach. A <b>pseudoscalar</b> <b>quantity</b> is introduced {{to allow for}} cross couplings which are absent in nematic liquid crystals, and the statics and dissipative dynamics are analyzed in detail. It is shown that the Lehmann effect is purely dynamic for {{the case of an}} external electric field and purely static for an external density gradient, but includes both dynamic and static coupling contributions for the cases of external temperature or concentration gradients...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from theoretical studies {{and from a}} series of molecular dynamics simulations undertaken to quantify the effect of chirality on the formation of liquid crystal mesophases. In the theoretical studies we have proposed a scaled chiral index with a formulation which allows comparison to be made between molecules comprising different numbers of atoms. We have undertaken chirality calculations utilizing the proposed scaled chiral index, G_ 0 _S, for one optimized static molecular geometry for a range of liquid crystal chiral dopants and ferroelectric liquid crystal molecules. The scaled chiral index, G_ 0 _S, allows a rapid calculation to be made of a <b>pseudoscalar</b> <b>quantity</b> which shows a good correlation with the helical twisting power of liquid crystal chiral dopants in a nematic liquid crystal solvent. This could prove a powerful aid in the design of novel dopant molecules where the dopant is rigid and the helical twisting is predominantly a steric effect. The same scaled chirality index, G_ 0 _S, calculation for ferroelectric liquid crystal molecules hints at an inverse correlation with spontaneous polarization agreeing with some experimental results. The scaled chiral index is a chemically useful index that can also be decomposed into atomic or functional group contributions, thereby creating a new measure of the asymmetric potential of functional groups and their different possible substitution positions. In the molecular dynamics simulation studies we have investigated two three-site Gay-Berne models, one chiral and the other achiral, each with a rotated central site forming a zigzag shape. In the chiral model one of the end site was additionally rotated out of the plane of the other two sites by a chiral angle #theta#_c. Results from the achiral phase simulations support the theory that steric molecular shape can be associated with a driving force that leads to the smectic A - smectic C phase transition since such a transition was observed in the achiral model configurations with the central site rotated with respect of the two end sites by an angle #alpha# = 30 deg and #alpha# = 31 deg. In order to study real chiral systems it is necessary first to simulate tilled smectic C phases. To meet this aim the achiral model configurations were used as the basis of three chiral models with chiral angles #theta#_c of 0. 5 deg, 1. 0 deg and 2. 0 deg. The smectic C phase was observed in the chiral molecular model #theta#_c = 0. 5 deg and smectic C phase characteristics were observed at larger angels of #theta#_c = 1. 0 deg and 2. 0 deg. This research study has successfully quantified an aspect of molecular steric chirality by creating a link between a scaled chiral index and experimental measurements of real chiral molecules. In addition novel results have been presented from investigations of the molecular dynamics of achiral and chiral systems in an NPT ensemble. A range of chiral rotation angles #theta#_c were studied. The smectic C phase can be observed for one of the configurations resulting in the simulation of smectic C phases for chiral models. The model systems and real molecules were quantified in terms of the scaled chiral index.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} multiple scattering {{of light in}} systems subject to magneto-chiral (MC) effects. Our medium consists of magneto-optically active dipoles placed in a chiral geometry {{under the influence of}} an external magnetic field. We have calculated, for the first time, the total and the differential scattering MC cross sections of this system, explicitely showing that they are proportional to <b>pseudoscalar</b> <b>quantities.</b> This provides a new optical measure for the degree of chirality, a pseudoscalar g, of an arbitrary geometrical configuration of scatterers based on its scattering properties. We have calculated g for some simple chiral systems and we have even used it to probe the degree of optical chirality of random systems. Finally, we have compared $g$ with other recently defined chiral measures in literature. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures, RevTeX. Submitted to PR...|$|R

25|$|In two dimensions, {{the angular}} {{velocity}} {{is a single}} number with an orientation but no direction. The angular velocity in two dimensions is a <b>pseudoscalar,</b> a <b>quantity</b> that changes its sign under a parity inversion (for example {{if one of the}} axes is inverted or if axes are swapped). The positive direction of rotation is taken, by convention, to be in the direction towards the y axis from the x axis. If the parity is inverted, but the orientation of a rotation is not, then the sign of the angular velocity changes.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of a conserved quantity on an oscillatory pattern-forming instability is examined in one space dimension. Amplitude equations are derived which are not only generic for systems with a <b>pseudoscalar</b> conserved <b>quantity</b> (e. g. rotating convection, magnetoconvection) but also applicable to systems with a scalar conserved quantity. The stability properties of both travelling and standing waves are analysed, with particular progress being possible {{in the limit of}} long-wavelength perturbations. For both forms of waves, the corresponding modulational stability boundaries are significantly altered by the presence of the conserved quantity; also, new instabilities are generated. For general perturbations, the full stability regions are found numerically. Simulations of the nonlinear governing equations are performed using a pseudo-spectral code; a variety of stable attractors are thus found of varying degrees of complexity. Previously unseen, highly localized, solutions are observed. D M Winterbottom, P C Matthews and S M Co...|$|R
40|$|Roles of {{turbulence}} in {{the context}} of magnetic reconnection are investigated with special emphasis on the mutual interaction between flow (large-scale inhomogeneous structure) and turbulence. In order to evaluate the effective transport due to turbulence, in addition to the intensity information of turbulence represented by the turbulent energy, the structure information represented by <b>pseudoscalar</b> statistical <b>quantities</b> (helicities) is important. On the basis of the evolution equation, mechanisms that provide turbulence with cross helicity are presented. Magnetic-flux freezing in highly turbulent media is considered with special emphasis on the spatial distribution of the turbulent cross helicity. The cross-helicity effects {{in the context}} of magnetic reconnection are also investigated. It is shown that the large-scale flow and magnetic-field configurations favorable for the cross-helicity generation is compatible with the fast reconnection. In this sense, turbulence and large-scale structures promote magnetic reconnection mediated by the turbulent cross helicity. Comment: 15 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} {{the masses of}} bottom mesons using an improved relativistic action for the b-quarks and the RBC/UKQCD Iwasaki gauge configurations with 2 + 1 flavors of dynamical domain-wall light quarks. We analyze configurations with two lattice spacings: a^{- 1 } = 1. 729 GeV (a ~ 0. 11 fm) and a^{- 1 } = 2. 281 GeV (a ~ 0. 086 fm). We use an anisotropic, clover-improved Wilson action for the b-quark, and tune the three parameters of the action nonperturbatively such that they reproduce the experimental values of the B_s and B_s* heavy-light meson states. The masses and mass-splittings of the low-lying bottomonium states (such as the eta_b and Upsilon) can then be computed with no additional inputs, and comparison between these predictions and experiment provides {{a test of the}} validity of our method. We obtain bottomonium masses with total uncertainties of ~ 0. 5 - 0. 6 % and fine-structure splittings with uncertainties of ~ 35 - 45 %; for all cases we find good agreement with experiment. The parameters of the relativistic heavy-quark action tuned for b-quarks presented in this work can be used for precise calculations of weak matrix elements such as B-meson decay constants and mixing parameters with lattice discretization errors that are of the same size as in light <b>pseudoscalar</b> meson <b>quantities.</b> This general method can also be used for charmed meson masses and matrix elements if the parameters of the heavy-quark action are appropriately tuned.
