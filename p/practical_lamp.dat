Circular and U-shaped lamps were devised to reduce the length of fluorescent light fixtures.

5000|$|It is {{extremely}} improbable that Henry Goebel constructed a <b>practical</b> incandescent <b>lamp</b> in 1854. This is manifest {{from the history}} of the art for the past fifty years, the electrical laws which since that time have been discovered as applicable to the incandescent lamp, the imperfect means which then existed for obtaining a vacuum, the high degree of skill necessary in the construction of all its parts, and the crude instruments with which Goebel worked.|$|R
50|$|The internal-electrodeless lamp {{was invented}} by Tesla after his {{experimentation}} with high-frequency currents in evacuated glass tubes {{for the purposes of}} lighting and the study of high voltage phenomena. The first <b>practical</b> plasma <b>lamps</b> were the sulfur lamps manufactured by Fusion Lighting. This lamp suffered a number of practical problems and did not prosper commercially. Plasma lamps with an internal phosphor coating are called external electrode fluorescent lamps (EEFL); these external electrodes or terminal conductors provide the radio frequency electric field.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for {{measuring}} work function of <b>practical</b> fluorescent <b>lamp</b> electrodes with emissive oxides. The work function measurement is based on the matching between the zero-field thermionic emission currents and various dc lamp currents set in a normal glow discharge by means of a lamp voltage monitoring procedure with an electrode-heating device for thermionic emission measurement. Measuring the work function of <b>practical</b> fluorescent <b>lamp</b> electrodes is a promising approach because changes that occur in the work function of aged-lamp electrodes in some lighting systems will be helpful in evaluating the system. The paper points out the doubtful approach of taking a rather small value of the Richardson constant. To solve this issue, a temperature-dependent work function is introduced. In the first stage of the paper, the Richardson constant is taken as the theoretical value. As a result, work function φ[eV] of a fluorescent lamp electrode halfway through its lamp life was measured and given as : φ= 0. 80 + 1. 36 × 10 ^ T (computed from equation with T^ 2) where T was the electrode temperature [K]. Second, an attempt is made to measure a temperature-dependent work function taking a realistic value of the Richardson constant. The smaller the value of the Richardson constant, the smaller the estimated work function is. Finally, the paper examines how to take a realistic value of the Richardson constant...|$|R

The presented application {{consists of a}} 20 W, 500 kHz switching converter, designed to drive a 1000 lm white-light, solid-state lamp. Key features of the proposed topology are the capability to achieve high step down ratios, a reduced voltage stress on the active components and the capability to automatically balance the average current on its three outputs...|$|R

Xe <b>lamps</b> and high-pressure mercury lamps with the power of 150 and 400  W, respectively, are usually used as light sources in photocatalytic experiment. They will introduce large amount of heat into the catalytic system, which makes it difficult to control the reaction temperature.|$|R
5000|$|During {{this period}} {{commercial}} use of electricity increased dramatically. Starting {{in the late}} 1870s cities started installing large scale electric street lighting systems based on arc lamps. After {{the development of a}} <b>practical</b> incandescent <b>lamp</b> for indoor lighting, Thomas Edison switched on the world's first public electric supply utility in 1882, using what was considered a relatively safe 110 volts direct current system to supply customers. Engineering advances in the 1880s, including the invention of the transformer, led to electric utilities starting to adopting alternating current, up till then used primarily in arc lighting systems, as a distribution standard for outdoor and indoor lighting (eventually replacing direct current for such purposes). In the US there was a rivalry, primarily between a Westinghouse AC and the Edison DC system known as the [...] "War of Currents".|$|R
50|$|Elihu Thomson {{was born}} in Manchester, England, {{and came to the}} United States as a child. Showing an early {{aptitude}} for research and experimentation, he taught at a Philadelphia high school, and developed a <b>practical</b> arc <b>lamp</b> system with a colleague. Funded by New England businessmen, this idea was commercialized, and the Thomson-Houston Electrical Company was by 1890 a leading maker of electrical equipment. In 1892 it merged with Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company to form the company known today as General Electric. His contributions to science and engineering thereafter include a wide range of practical advances in the application of electricity, and included more than 700 patents. Thomson is also credited with establishing the idea that industrial research and development was an important component of a successful business, including the creation of laboratories that perform pure scientific research.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>practical</b> use, the <b>lamp</b> {{is powered}} by an AC voltage source in series with an {{inductive}} [...] "ballast" [...] in order to supply a nearly constant current to the lamp, rather than a constant voltage, thus assuring stable operation. The ballast is usually inductive rather than simply being resistive to minimize energy waste from resistance losses. Because the lamp effectively extinguishes at each zero-current point in the AC cycle, the inductive ballast assists in the reignition by providing a voltage spike at the zero-current point.|$|R
25|$|A compact {{fluorescent}} lamp is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent lightbulb. Some CFL's fit into light fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps and {{they are designed to}} produce the same amount of visible light found in incandescent light. CFLs generally use 70% less energy and have a longer rated life. In 1941, George Inman devised the first <b>practical</b> fluorescent <b>lamp</b> while working for General Electric. The key patent for this light source, U.S. patent #2,259,040 was filed by Inman on April 22, 1936 and issued to him on October 14, 1941. In 1976, Edward E. Hammer invented the first helical or spiraled {{compact fluorescent}} lamp, but due to the difficulty of the manufacturing process for coating the interior of the spiral glass tube, General Electric did not manufacture or sell the device. Other companies began manufacturing and selling the device in 1995.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the rapidly expanding use of lasers for spectroscopic studies of alkali metal vapors. Since the alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium) are theoretically simple ('visible hydrogen'), readily ionized, and strongly interacting with laser light, they represent ideal systems for quantitative understanding of microscopic interconversion mechanisms between photon (e. g., solar or laser), chemical, electrical and thermal energy. The possible implications of such understanding {{for a wide}} variety of <b>practical</b> applications (sodium <b>lamps,</b> thermionic converters, magnetohydrodynamic devices, new lasers, 'lithium waterfall' inertial confinement fusion reactors, etc.) are also discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Thomas Edison began serious {{research}} into developing a <b>practical</b> incandescent <b>lamp</b> in 1878. Edison filed his first patent application for [...] "Improvement In Electric Lights" [...] on 14 October 1878. [...] After many experiments, first with carbon {{in the early}} 1880s and then with platinum and other metals, in the end Edison returned to a carbon filament. [...] The first successful test was on 22 October 1879, and lasted 13.5 hours. Edison continued to improve this design and by 4 November 1879, filed for a US patent for an electric lamp using [...] "a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected ... to platina contact wires." [...] Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using [...] "cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways," [...] Edison and his team later discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last more than 1200 hours. [...] In 1880, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company steamer, Columbia, became the first application for Edison's incandescent electric lamps (it {{was also the first}} ship to use a dynamo).|$|R
40|$|Model {{computations}} {{that give}} the lay-out of a lighting installation have to be implemented in the real world. There, deviations from the ideal performance of just about every element of the installation will be felt. A list of possible sources of non-ideal behavior, based on <b>practical</b> experience, are: <b>lamps,</b> ballasts, reflectors, mounting position, sagging of lamps, and soiling. It is clear that with all possible deviations from the ideal the homogeneity of a real lighting installation can never {{be as good as}} the one computed. The only way to make sure it is nearly as good is by measurement of the actual light distribution. Then, an occasional adjustment or replacement may often yield a satisfactory result. This measurement should really be part of the installation contract...|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, people in {{academic}} or research institutions {{had the opportunity}} for single-person use of a computer system in interactive mode for extended durations, although these systems would still have been too expensive to be owned by a single person. Early personal computersgenerally called microcomputerswere often sold in a kit form and in limited volumes, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians. Minimal programming was done with toggle switches to enter instructions, and output was provided by front panel <b>lamps.</b> <b>Practical</b> use required adding peripherals such as keyboards, computer displays, disk drives, and printers. Micral N was the earliest commercial, non-kit microcomputer based on a microprocessor, the Intel 8008. It was built starting in 1972 and about 90,000 units were sold. This had been preceded by the Datapoint 2200 in 1970, for which the Intel 8008 had been commissioned, though not accepted for use. The CPU design implemented in the Datapoint 2200 {{became the basis for}} x86 architecture used in the original IBM PC and its descendants.|$|R

The burning dust would not disturb to the surrounding environment, it would deposit in the lamp. The concept of environmental protection of the ancient Chinese people's wisdom. the Changxin Palace lantern was known as [...] "China's first light". Former U.S. Secretary of state Kissinger made a trip to China to visit Changxin Palace lanterns, and laments: [...] " [...] Chinese have understood the environmental protection sine 2000 years ago, it is really great."Changxin Palace lantern has been regarded as an important representative of the pinnacle of national arts and crafts. This is not only because of its rarity, the one and only, but also in its exquisite production process and unique artistic conception. Experts on archaeology and history of metallurgy agree that the exquisite design and production process of the lamp are high level, leading the palace lantern in the Han Dynasty. In 1993 it was identified as a national treasure heritage.|$|R
40|$|A strong systems {{approach}} to designing and building <b>practical</b> LED-based replacement <b>lamps</b> is lacking. The general {{method of taking}} high-performance LEDs and marrying them to standard printed circuit boards, drivers and a heat sink has fallen short of the promise of LED lighting. In this program, a top-down assessment of requirements and a bottom-up reinvention of LED sources, electronics, optics and mechanics {{have resulted in the}} highest performance lamp possible. The team, comprised of Color Kinetics, the leaders in LED lighting and Cree, the leaders in LED devices took an approach to reinvent the package, the driver and the overall form and aesthetic of a replacement source. The challenge was to create a new benchmark in LED lighting - the resultant lamp, a PAR 38 equivalent, met the light output, color, color quality and efficacy marks set out in the program as well as being dimmable, which is important for market acceptance. The approach combined the use of multiple source die, a chip-on-board approach, a very efficient driver topology, the use of both direct emission and phosphor conversion, and a unique faceted optic to avoid the losses, artifacts and hotspots of lensed approaches. The integral heat sink provided a mechanical base and airflow using a chimney-effect for use {{in a wide variety of}} locations and orientations. These research results led to a much better understanding of the system effects of component level technologies. It was clear that best-of-breed sub-system results do not necessarily result in the best end result for the complete system. In doing this work, we did not neglect the practical aspects of these systems. These were not rarified results and commercially impractical but lent themselves to eventual commercial products in the marketplace. The end result - a high performance replacement lamp - will save significant energy while providing a high-quality light source...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{realization}} of all-optical sensors {{for the detection of}} chemicals and bio-chemicals by exploiting the properties of surface plasma waves (or plasmons) excited at a dielectric-metal interface, the so called phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR occurs for light with suitable wavelength, incidence and polarization and manifests itself as a strong attenuation of the light reflection coefficient at the metal-dielectric interface. Supposing to use a broadband light source for the interrogation, this turns out in a deep and narrow notch in the reflected spectrum, the position of which is strongly dependent on the refractive index of the substance (the analyte) in contact with the metal layer. These sensors are characterized by very high sensitivity and, after proper functionalization, are therefore used in chemical and biochemical analysis to detect ppb (part-per-billion) concentrations of specific substances, such as pollutants in water. A further reason of interest is the possibility to conduct label-free analyses, without the use of other chemicals to make the analyte detectable. The construction parameters (e. g. metal used, layer thickness, and incidence angle, just to name a few) {{play a key role in}} determining the performance of these sensors. Therefore, in the first part of the thesis a mathematical model is introduced to allow running parametric simulations to optimize the layout according to the different configurations and applications. Then, based on the indications obtained from the simulations, some prototypes both in bulk optic (i. e. using prisms-based setups) and in optical fiber configurations have been realized and fully characterized to validate the implemented models. Optical fiber based sensors are particularly interesting for their small size that makes them well suited in all those applications where it is required the use of a compact, lightweight and minimally invasive system. For this reason, the fiber optic SPR sensor solution is often taken as the reference sensing system throughout the thesis. In a second part of the thesis, in view of long-term monitoring applications, the most critical parameters affecting the sensor resolution have been identified and analyzed in detail. These are: i) the stability of the optical source used to interrogate the sensor; ii) the influence of misalignments and other mechanical instabilities; iii) the effect of temperature fluctuations. As for the optical source stability, the most common source types used in <b>practical</b> setups (halogen <b>lamp,</b> super-continuum laser and SLED) have been measured, and a method to compare their long-term fluctuations and subsequent influence on the sensor performance has been devised. Similar approach based on the analysis of repeated experimental results has been applied also to evaluate the impact of the main mechanical parameters, such as the light beam angle of incidence, both intentionally and unintentionally variable, respectively in the bulk optic setup or in the fiber-based setup. The latter, in particular, is very relevant in the development of fiber sensing probes that to be disposable need to be low cost, and thus they make use of cheap connectors with poor repeatability. Another key issue is the effect of temperature. Indeed, since the refractive index is also function of the temperature and a SPR sensor basically detects changes in the refractive index, if the whole measuring system is not kept at a constant temperature, its drift induces a shift in the position of the plasmon resonance; and this could be erroneously interpreted as a variation in the concentration of the analyte. The solution widely used to reduce this drawback is to stabilize the temperature (typically using Peltier modules) and insert the whole sensing part in robust chassis; this, however, makes the instrument bulky and suitable for lab use only, and definitely not for portable monitoring systems. To overcome these limitations, a new internally compensated sensor configuration has been studied and its behavior assessed through some experiments. In the final part of the thesis all the analyzed aspects and developed solutions are applied to a feasibility study of SPR fiber sensor probes for Continuous Glucose Monitoring application (CGM), a topic of high relevance considering that diabetes constitutes one of the most common diseases, affecting more than 350 million people worldwide, corresponding to more than 8 % of the adult populatio...|$|R
