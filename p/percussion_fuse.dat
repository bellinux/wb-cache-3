50|$|Furthermore, Wilhelm {{invented a}} good corroborating <b>percussion</b> <b>fuse,</b> a {{shrapnel}} grenade, and collapsible tubes for mountain guns. He also gave a {{construction of the}} so-called wedge traits for rifled guns. The results convinced and {{had to go in}} equipping 30 field batteries.|$|E
50|$|Spherical shell used time fuses, while rifled shell {{could use}} timed fuse or be detonated on impact by <b>percussion</b> <b>fuse.</b> Fuse {{reliability}} was a concern; any shell that buried {{itself into the}} earth before detonating had little anti-personnel effectiveness. However, large caliber shells, such as the 32-pounder spherical were effective at breaching entrenchments.|$|E
50|$|Solid cannonballs ("shot") did {{not need}} a fuse, but hollow munitions ("shells") filled with {{something}} such as gunpowder to fragment the ball, needed a <b>fuse,</b> either impact (<b>percussion)</b> or time. <b>Percussion</b> <b>fuses</b> with a spherical projectile presented a challenge {{because there was no}} way of ensuring that the impact mechanism hit the target. Therefore, shells needed a time fuse that was ignited before or during firing and burned until the shell reached its target.|$|R
5000|$|The cargo {{included}} 4,200,000 {{rounds of}} Remington [...]303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, 1,250 cases of empty 3-inch (76 mm) fragmentation shell casings and eighteen cases of <b>percussion</b> <b>fuses,</b> {{all of which}} were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May. However, these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition, were non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. It was perfectly legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo, such as fine aluminium powder, concealed as cheese on her cargo manifests, or guncotton (pyroxylene) disguised as casks of beef, have never been proven. Recent expeditions to the wreck have shown that her cargo holds remain intact and show no evidence of internal explosion.|$|R
25|$|Lusitania had {{the misfortune}} to fall victim to torpedo attack {{relatively}} early in the First World War, before tactics for evading submarines were properly implemented or understood. The contemporary investigations in both the United Kingdom and the United States into the precise causes of the ship's loss were obstructed by the needs of wartime secrecy and a propaganda campaign to ensure all blame fell upon Germany. Argument over whether the ship was a legitimate military target raged back and forth throughout the war as both sides made misleading claims about the ship. At {{the time she was}} sunk, she was carrying over 4 million rounds of small-arms ammunition (.303 caliber), almost 5,000 shrapnel shell casings (for a total of some 50 tons), and 3,240 brass <b>percussion</b> <b>fuses,</b> in addition to 1,266 passengers and a crew of 696. Several attempts have been made over the years since the sinking to dive to the wreck seeking information about precisely how the ship sank, and argument continues to the present day.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{conical casing}} {{enclosing}} a shaped charge and containing 562 grams of TNT, {{fitted with a}} <b>percussion</b> <b>fuse</b> and four cloth ribbons to provide stability in flight after throwing. It could penetrate approximately 100 millimeters of armour. The RPG-6 had a fragmentation radius of 20 metres {{from the point of}} detonation, and proved useful against infantry as well as tanks.|$|E
5000|$|The grenade was {{modelled}} after earlier Polish grenades of the 1920s (such as the Defensive grenade wz.24), {{which in}} turn were based on French World War I F1 grenade. It was fitted with wz.Gr.31 <b>percussion</b> <b>fuse.</b> To increase reliability, the grenade had two blasting caps and two strikers. The casing was produced {{in one of three}} factories, a letter on the casing denoting the producer ("K" [...] for Końskie, [...] "M" [...] for Warsaw and [...] "W" [...] for Wilno).|$|E
5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{intended}} to use torpedoes containing 400 lb (180 kg) of black powder; but those actually employed by it contained 60 lb (27 kg) of fine powder of the kind known in the American service as No. 7. The [...] "obstruction shells" [...] have each an air space left round the powder, so as to allow the free expansion of the gases, and the torpedoes intended for use against vessels are of slightly less specific gravity than water, so that when released from the holder they rise slowly until they come against {{the bottom of the}} vessel under which they are placed. As will be seen by the section, Fig. 2, the powder is so placed in the torpedo that, when the later is released, it floats nearly upright with its point downwards. Within the torpedo case, on one side, is placed a tube, {{at the lower end of}} which is a <b>percussion</b> <b>fuse</b> in communication with the powder. At the upper end of the tube is a ball, which is held from falling upon the <b>percussion</b> <b>fuse</b> by a sliding pin placed beneath it. This pin passes out through the torpedo case, and has an eye formed at its outer end, as shown in Fig. 2. When the torpedo is placed in the casing at the end of the projecting tube, that side of the torpedo through which the sliding pin just mentioned projects is placed downwards, and one end of a cord is attached to the eye of the pin, and the other end to another eye fixed to the casing at the end of the projecting tube. The length of this cord is regulated according to the distance at which it is desired to fire the torpedo - the length generally employed being about 20 ft (6 m) — and it acts in the following manner: When the torpedo has been projected by means of the tube and released, the tube is of course drawn back, and as this movement takes place the cord is tightened, and the sliding pin is withdrawn from the torpedo case, this movement releasing the ball and allowing it to fall upon the <b>percussion</b> <b>fuse,</b> and explode the torpedo.|$|E
5|$|Many late 20th-century musicians such as Fela Kuti have famously fused {{cultural}} {{elements of}} various indigenous music with American jazz and soul to form Afrobeat which has in turn influenced hip hop music. JuJu music, which is <b>percussion</b> music <b>fused</b> with traditional {{music from the}} Yoruba nation and made famous by King Sunny Adé, is also from Nigeria. There is also Fuji music, a Yoruba percussion style, created and popularised by Mr. Fuji, Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister.|$|R
50|$|Lusitania had {{the misfortune}} to fall victim to torpedo attack {{relatively}} early in the First World War, before tactics for evading submarines were properly implemented or understood. The contemporary investigations in both the UK and the United States into the precise causes of the ships loss were obstructed by the needs of wartime secrecy and a propaganda campaign to ensure all blame fell upon Germany. Argument over whether the ship was a legitimate military target raged back and forth throughout the war as both sides made misleading claims about the ship. Before Lusitania sailed, the German embassy had placed warnings in American newspapers that the ship would be targeted as it was carrying war munitions. At {{the time she was}} sunk, she was carrying over 4 million rounds of small-arms ammunition (.303 caliber), almost 5,000 shrapnel shell casings (for a total of some 50 tons), and 3,240 brass <b>percussion</b> <b>fuses,</b> in addition to 1,266 passengers and a crew of 696. Several attempts have been made over the years since the sinking to dive to the wreck seeking information about precisely how the ship sank, and argument continues to the present day.|$|R
50|$|Products of Korea General Chemicals include liquified gas, urea fertilizer, {{ammonium}} nitrate fertilizer, explosives, blasting <b>fuses,</b> <b>percussion</b> caps, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, rubber, rubber asbestos packing materials, aluminum silicon, plastics, alcohols, vinyls, inks, carbides, dyes, chrome yellow, potassium alum and aluminium hydroxide.|$|R
50|$|The No. 77 Grenade was a British white {{phosphorus}} grenade introduced in September 1943 and {{used during the}} Second World War. The No. 77 consisted of 8 ounces of {{white phosphorus}}, an impact fuse and a tin casing. It was intended for laying down smoke screens and as a signalling device. The grenade was also very effective as an anti-personnel and incendiary weapon. As well as being issued to the Home Guard, the Nº 77 smoke grenade was issued to the British army.This grenade was fitted with an 'all-ways' <b>percussion</b> <b>fuse</b> designed to set the grenade off when it hit the ground - the fuse was called 'all-ways' as {{it was designed to}} work no matter what way up the grenade was when it hit the ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{lack of an}} {{effective}} hand grenade, coupled with their perceived danger to the user and their lack of utility meant that they were regarded as increasingly obsolete pieces of military equipment. In 1902, the British War Office announced that hand grenades were obsolete and had no place in modern warfare. Within two years, following the success of improvised grenades in the trench warfare conditions of the Russo-Japanese War, and reports from General Sir Aylmer Haldane, a British observer of the conflict, a reassessment was quickly made and the Board of Ordnance was instructed to develop a practical hand grenade. Various models using a <b>percussion</b> <b>fuse</b> were built, but this type of fuse suffered from various practical problems, {{and they were not}} commissioned in large numbers.|$|E
5000|$|Timed fuse: In a timed fuse grenade, {{the fuse}} is ignited on {{release of the}} safety lever, and {{detonation}} occurs following a timed delay. Timed fuse grenades are generally preferred to hand-thrown percussion grenades because their fusing mechanisms are safer and more robust than those used in <b>percussion</b> grenades. <b>Fuses</b> are frequently fixed, though the Russian UZRGM (УЗРГМ) fuses are interchangeable and allow the delay to be varied, or replaced by a zero-delay pull fuse. This is potentially dangerous due {{to the risk of}} confusion.|$|R
2500|$|The cargo {{included}} 4,200,000 {{rounds of}} Remington [...]303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, 1,250 cases of empty [...] fragmentation shell casings and eighteen cases of <b>percussion</b> <b>fuses,</b> {{all of which}} were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May. However, these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition, were non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. It was perfectly legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo, such as fine aluminium powder, concealed as cheese on her cargo manifests, or guncotton (pyroxylene) disguised as casks of beef, have never been proven. [...] In the 1960s, American diver John Light did several dives on the wreck, trying to prove the existence of contraband explosives in Lusitania 's cargo hold, ignited by the torpedo. Light claimed to have found a large hole on Lusitania 's port side, opposite of where the torpedo had struck, though later expeditions disproved his findings. Recent expeditions to the wreck have shown that her cargo holds remain intact and show no evidence of an internal explosion.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the F1 was {{designed}} to use a lighter-based ignition system, but later it began using a <b>percussion</b> cap <b>fuse.</b> Designs such as the M1916 and M1917 Billant fuses turned the F1 into a time-fused grenade, which was the grenade's final ignition system. By World War II, the F1 used the M1935 fuse, which is a time-based fuse, but it differs from the M1916 Billant fuse internally. The F-1 in its original design was withdrawn from French military service in 1946. The altered models of the grenade remain in military service in countries around the world, among others in the Russian F1 Grenade and American Mk 2 grenade.|$|R
50|$|In addition, KeyNote oversees Shesh-Besh, an {{ensemble}} that brings together musicians from the IPO and the Arab Christian and Muslim communities of northern Israel. The group uses {{a mixture of}} instruments (flute, ney, violin, viola, eastern violin, oud, double bass, and assorted <b>percussion),</b> and thus <b>fuses</b> elements from both Western and Arab music. The group performs {{throughout the country and}} has also toured internationally at Carnegie Hall and at the Tanglewood Music Festival.|$|R
5000|$|... "Renegades of Funk" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Afrika Bambaataa, Arthur Baker, John Miller & John Robie and {{recorded}} by Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic Force. Released in 1983 as a single on the Tommy Boy label, it was also included on the 1986 album [...] "Planet Rock: The Album". The song is an eclectic fusion of electronic music and heavy <b>percussion,</b> with politically <b>fused</b> hip hop lyrics that draw a connection between past revolutionaries and bohemians to present day street artists. It was produced and mixed by Arthur Baker and John Robie. Mastering was by Herb Powers Jr.. It was not until 1986 that the song appeared on [...] "Planet Rock: the Album".|$|R
