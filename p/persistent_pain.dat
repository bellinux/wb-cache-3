40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{knowledge}} about leisure time {{physical activity and}} the body mass index (BMI) as prognostic factors for recovery from <b>persistent</b> back <b>pain.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the influence of leisure time physical activity and BMI on recovery from <b>persistent</b> back <b>pain</b> among men and women in a general population. Methods: The study population (n= 1836) in this longitudinal cohort study consisted of participants reporting <b>persistent</b> back <b>pain</b> in the baseline questionnaire in 2002 - 2003. Data on leisure time physical activity, BMI and potential confounders were also collected at baseline. Information on recovery from <b>persistent</b> back <b>pain</b> (no back pain periods >= 7 days during the last 5 years) was obtained from the follow-up questionnaire in 2007. Log-binomial models were applied to calculate Risk Ratios with 95 percent Confidence Intervals (CI) comparing physically active and normal weight groups versus sedentary and overweight groups. Results: Compared to a sedentary leisure time, all measured levels of leisure time physical activity were associated with a greater chance of recovery from <b>persistent</b> back <b>pain</b> among women. The adjusted Risk Ratios was 1. 46 (95 % CI: 1. 06, 2. 01) for low leisure time physical activity, 1. 51 (95 % CI: 1. 02, 2. 23) for moderate leisure time physical activity, and 1. 67 (95 % CI: 1. 08, 2. 58) for high leisure time physical activity. There were no indications that leisure time physical activity influenced recovery among men, or that BMI was associated with recovery from <b>persistent</b> back <b>pain</b> either among men or among women. Conclusions: Regular leisure time physical activity seems to improve recovery from <b>persistent</b> back <b>pain</b> among women...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Persistent</b> post-surgical <b>pain</b> is {{recognised}} {{as a major}} problem. Prevalence after different {{surgical procedures}} {{has been reported to}} range from 5 % up to 85 %. Limb amputation and thoracotomy have the highest reported prevalence. Prediction of <b>persistent</b> post-surgical <b>pain</b> has over the last decade caught atten- tion. Several factors have been investigated, but in-depth knowl- edge is still scarce. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the prevalence of <b>persistent</b> post-surgical <b>pain,</b> and predictive fac- tors for <b>persistent</b> post-surgical <b>pain</b> 12 months after thoracotomy. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted. One- hundred and seventy patients were recruited before scheduled thoracotomy, and asked to answer a questionnaire. One-hundred and six patients completed the same questionnaire at 12 -month follow-up. Regression analysis was performed to explore vari- ables assumed predictive of <b>persistent</b> post-surgical <b>pain.</b> Results: One-hundred and six patients (62 %) filled out the questionnaire at both time points. Preoperative, 34 % reported muscle-skeletal related chronic pain. At 12 -month follow-up, 50 % of the patients reported <b>persistent</b> post-surgical <b>pain.</b> Of the vari- ables explored in the logistic regression model, only preoperative pain (P < 0. 001) and dispositional optimism (P = 0. 04) were sta- tistically significant. In this study, preoperative pain was a pre- dominant predictor for <b>persistent</b> postoperative <b>pain</b> (OR 6. 97, CI 2. 40 – 20. 21), while dispositional optimism (OR 0. 36, CI 0. 14 – 0. 96) seem to have protective properties. Conclusion: Our results show that preoperative pain is a pre- dominant predictor of future pain. This implies that patients pre- senting with a chronic pain condition prior to surgery should be assessed thoroughly preoperatively and have an individually tailored analgesic regimen...|$|R

40|$|Editor’s {{key points}} † The {{incidence}} and burden of <b>persistent</b> postoperative <b>pain</b> {{is a significant}} problem. † Our understanding of the condition is hampered by the poor quality {{of much of the}} data. † Psychosocial factors, preoperative pain, poorly controlled postoperative pain and nerve injury are often associated factors. † As yet, there is no compelling evidence that the incidence of <b>persistent</b> postoperative <b>pain</b> can be influenced by specific interventions. Summary. There has been considerable interest and controversy around <b>persistent</b> postoperative <b>pain</b> for several years. Most of the available data arise from studies with methodological problems (especially its definition in terms of duration, severity, and effect on quality of life and function); however, more recent investigations have begun to address these issues. Although the quoted incidence varies considerably, analysis of the most conservative data shows that {{there is no doubt that}} <b>persistent</b> postoperative <b>pain</b> is a significant clinical problem and a burden to those who suffer from it. There is a wealth of literature describing factors associated with increased likelihood of <b>persistent</b> postoperative <b>pain.</b> Although it is difficult to be precise, it is clear that psychosocial factors probably play a role in some situations and that significant preoperative pain, severe immediate postoperative pain, and nerve damage are often good predictors. There are some data indicating that the incidence and severity of <b>persistent</b> postoperative <b>pain</b> can be reduced by special perioperative interventions; however, as yet, the evidence is not compelling and consistent. A reliable prevention strategy is not yet emerging from the published literature and considerably more work is required to deliver this...|$|R

25|$|His most {{successful}} season came in 1963. At the 1963 International Cross Country Championships in San Sebastián, Spain, he surprised by topping the field, beating {{the much more}} established Gaston Roelants by over ten seconds. Roelants (the defending champion and later European and Olympic champion) challenged Fowler to a re-match for £3000 (a very large sum for the period), but he refused as he wished to preserve his amateur status for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{metabolic}} and homeostatic changes which result from untreated pain, including an increased requirement for oxygen, accompanied by a reduction in the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs. This combination can lead to inadequate oxygen supply, resulting in potential hypoxemia. In addition, a rise in stomach acidity accompanies the stress reaction precipitated by pain, and there is a risk of aspirating this into the lungs, further endangering lung integrity and tissue oxygenation. In cases of acute, <b>persistent</b> <b>pain,</b> the metabolism becomes predominantly catabolic, causing reduced efficiency of the immune system and a breakdown of proteins caused by the action of the stress hormones. In combination, healing of damaged or infected tissue may be impaired, and morbidity and mortality increased.|$|E

500|$|Light {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths {{of light to}} an area of skin affected by acne. Both regular and laser light have been used. [...] When regular light is used immediately following {{the application of a}} sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate, the treatment is referred to as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapies. Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light) have been used to treat acne, including those that use infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO2 and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment {{is often referred to as}} laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized. Ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with nonablative lasers, with examples being postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, persistent facial redness, and <b>persistent</b> <b>pain.</b> Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum. [...] As of 2012, evidence for various light therapies was insufficient to recommend them for routine use. Disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost, the need for multiple visits, time required to complete the procedure(s), and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities. [...] Various light therapies appear to provide a short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and for outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse; it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications. Typical side effects include skin peeling, temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E

40|$|Herpes zoster (HZ) {{results from}} {{reactivation}} of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which remains latent in the {{dorsal root ganglia}} after varicella. HZ predominantly affects people over 50 years of age without gender distinction, and its incidence increases with age. The most feared complication of HZ is the zoster-associated pains (ZAP), which encompasses the prodromal, concomitant and post-zoster <b>persistent</b> <b>pains.</b> The latter neuralgias are particularly invalidating and notoriously difficult, or even impossible to abate with current therapies. Until now, the best ZAP prevention was achieved by antiviral treatment given during the earliest phase of the eruption. This treatment certainly reduces the duration and intensity of ZAP, but exerts little influence on post-zoster <b>persistent</b> <b>pains.</b> A vaccination boosting the specific anti-VZV immunity in order to decrease the HZ incidence and post-zoster pains appears promising. A recent study performed on 38. 546 immunocompetent patients aged over 60 years assessed the efficacy of a single injection of an anti-zoster vaccine (Zostavax). The incidence of HZ and post-zoster pain was decreased by 50 % and 66 %, respectively. Vaccination could {{be considered as a}} valuable option to alleviate the feared complications of HZ.

Almost two-thirds of participants with <b>persistent</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> reported comorbid mental health conditions. Main outcome measures: Inductive and deductive approaches to analyse and derive key themes from verbatim transcripts. Results: Participants described their daily experiences of living with <b>persistent</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain,</b> their fears and the challenges imposed by the invisibility of pain, and the two-way relationship between their pain and mental well-being. A lack of relevant and accessible information and resources tailored to young people's unique needs, integrated and youth-relevant healthcare services and adequately skilled healthcare practitioners were identified as key care gaps. Participants strongly advocated for the use of digital technologies to improve access to age-appropriate resources and support for co-care. Conclusions: Young people living with <b>persistent</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> described the absence of ageappropriate pain services and clearly articulated their perceptions on the role of, and opportunities provided by, digital technologies to connect with and support improved pain healthcare.
