5|$|Guy of Lusignan, who had {{recently}} been released, came to Antioch in July or August 1188. Bohemond did not <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> military assistance, and Guy left for Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding an}} empty {{treasure}} in Antioch, Raymond-Roupen increased taxation, {{which made him}} unpopular among his subjects. He also refused to assist Leo against the Seljuqs. In 1217, Raymond-Roupen tried to capture Leo, but the Templars assisted Leo to flee to Cilicia. Bohemond visited John, King of Jerusalem, in Acre in autumn 1217. John recognized Bohemond as the lawful prince of Antioch early the next year, but did not <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> military assistance.|$|E
5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> the money to pay back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E

The Indian Consular Services have <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> facilities to address select audiences in Karachi (Pakistan), Jakarta (Embassy of India), Tokyo (Embassy of India), as far as Sydney, Australia. The External Services of All India Radio, over the years, have <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a worldwide audience.|$|R

5|$|The tyrant however, {{was able}} to persuade Vulso to reduce the price to 100 talents and promised to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> 1,000 medimni of wheat. Thus Moagĕtes managed to save his city. When the consul crossed the River Colobatus he was met by ambassadors {{from the town of}} Sinda in Pisidia. The ambassadors asked for {{assistance}} against the city of Termessus who had taken over all their country except for the capitol.|$|E
5|$|Wellington rose {{at around}} 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Blücher {{confirming}} {{that he would}} give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Blücher could <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Blücher's chief of staff, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Blücher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Blücher, promising to support him with three corps.|$|E
5|$|While {{working at}} the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hinde had {{developed}} {{a close relationship with}} George Madison and his nephew John Madison. In 1829 Hinde wrote to their relation, President James Madison, to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> information about the Burr conspiracy for a political history the president was said to be writing. Madison denied the project, but asked Hinde to send copies of The Fredonian to include in his presidential papers. Hinde sent newspaper issues dealing with the Burr Conspiracy. The copies of the newspaper were filed with the President's papers.|$|E

5|$|Wiśniowiecki's indebted {{family was}} not able to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a funeral his rank and fame deserved. In the end, he never {{received}} the large funeral and the temporary location of his body, the monastery of the Holy Cross at Łysa Góra, became his final resting place. His body was lost in the fire {{at the end of the}} 18th century, which also prevents a modern reexamination of the cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|Afonso III of Portugal was not {{the eldest}} son, {{therefore}} heraldic practices stated he should not take his father's arms without adding a personal variation. Before becoming king, Afonso was married to Matilda II of Boulogne but her inability to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, in 1253. He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. It {{is more likely that}} it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its Moorish fortresses, considering that the number of castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned {{offensive}} began, {{and after}} two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. Finnish General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and the realization that he neither the Finnish nor the German high command is going to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> additional forces or substantial reinforcements, he slowed down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point the Finnish 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.|$|E

5|$|In 429 BC, Perdiccas II sent {{aid to the}} Spartan {{commander}} Cnemus in Acarnania, but the Macedonian forces arrived {{too late}} to enter the Battle of Naupactus, which ended in an Athenian victory. In that same year, Sitalces, according to Thucydides, invaded Macedonia {{at the behest of}} Athens to aid them in subduing Chalcidice and to punish Perdiccas II for violating the terms of their peace treaty. However, given Sitalces' huge Thracian invading force (allegedly 150,000 soldiers) and a nephew of Perdiccas II that he intended to place on the Macedonian throne after toppling the latter's regime, Athens must have become wary of acting on their supposed alliance since they failed to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> promised naval support. Sitalces eventually retreated from Macedonia, perhaps due to logistical concerns: a shortage of provisions and harsh winter conditions.|$|E
5|$|New Line {{believed}} Freddy vs. Jason {{needed a}} fresh start, and choose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing Hodder {{was the best}} choice for the role. Hodder did receive the script for Freddy vs. Jason, and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to Hodder, New Line failed to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized the outcry among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to his homeland, Pyrrhus {{found himself in a}} {{difficult}} position. His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and crippled his army, leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment. In order to secure funds to pay his troops, Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas, the new king of Macedon. Citing Antigonus' refusal to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> aid during his Italian expedition as a casus belli, Pyrrhus invaded Macedon in the spring of 274 BC. He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries. It has been speculated that by invading Macedon, Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt, Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this is highly unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Showing acting skill {{early in}} life, Bana began doing {{impressions}} {{of family members}} {{at the age of}} six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather's walk, voice and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> enough income to support himself, however, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{with the}} Welsh continued, and in 1158 Ifor Bach raided the castle and took William hostage for a period. A further attack {{followed}} in 1183. By 1184 town walls {{had been built}} around Cardiff, and the West Gate to the town was constructed in {{the gap between the}} castle and the river. William died in 1183, leaving three daughters. One of these, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was declared the sole heir to the estate by Henry II. This was contrary to legal custom in England, and was done in order that Henry could then marry her to his youngest son Prince John and thus <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> extensive lands. John later divorced Isabel, but he retained control of the castle until she married Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1214.|$|E
5|$|The Angels {{released}} Ramírez in March 2004, {{without being}} promoted beyond the Class A level. Disappointed, Ramírez considered retiring from baseball. With {{the advice of}} his father, Ramírez decided that as Major League Baseball pitchers often relied on a slider or curveball as a complimentary pitch to their fastball, he would develop a different pitch. Ramírez spent his time that year learning a changeup on baseball fields in Miami, Florida, and did not pitch professionally during the 2004 season. Working with Maximo Soto, a fellow minor league pitcher released by the Angels, Ramírez developed his changeup to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a new weapon in his pitching arsenal.|$|E

5|$|The Smuts {{family were}} {{traditional}} Afrikaner farmers. As such, questions {{of property and}} family affairs were extensively governed by custom. Custom dictated that it was upon the first son that family expectations fell; the family would strive, so far as their means allowed, to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> the best possible education {{with the goal of}} paving the way for his entry into one of the professions. As for the others, they would be put to work on the farm, {{while at the same time}} receiving a rudimentary home education. As the second son this was to be Jan's role. While he remained at the farm, his elder brother, Michiel, was sent to begin his schooling in Riebeek West, destined, like his uncle Boudewyn, for a future as a predikant in the Dutch Reformed Church.|$|E
5|$|While under Iso's tutelage, Kanō {{witnessed}} a demonstration by the Yōshin-ryū jūjutsu teacher Totsuka Hikosuke and later {{took part in}} randori with members of Totsuka's school. Kanō {{was impressed by the}} Yōshin-ryū practitioners and realized that he might never be able to beat someone as talented as Totsuka simply by training harder: he also needed to train smarter. It was this experience that first led Kanō to believe that to be truly superior, one needed to combine the best elements of several ryū, or schools, of jūjutsu including Yagyu Shingan-ryū Taijutsu. Toward this end, he began to seek teachers who could <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> superior elements of jūjutsu that he could adopt.|$|E
5|$|Eliab Harvey {{was born}} in Chigwell, Essex to William and Emma Harvey. His father William Harvey was a Member of Parliament for Essex, but died when Harvey was only five years old, in 1763. Until 1768, Harvey was raised at the family estate of Rolls Park in Chigwell, which had passed to his elder brother William {{on the death of}} their father. Harvey then {{attended}} Westminster School for two years before moving to Harrow School in 1770. At the age of thirteen in 1771, Harvey was entered onto the books of the naval schooner HMS Mary, although he did not actually serve aboard the ship. Utilising a standard legal fiction of the time, Harvey's name was entered on the ship's books without his actual presence, a ruse that would <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> sufficient seniority to gain rapid promotion when he did enter the navy. In his summer holidays from school, Harvey served at sea, joining HMS Orpheus in 1773.|$|E
