This study is based on the Rhône Road Trauma Registry for the year 2001, supplemented with data obtained by a self-administered postal questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were analysed in terms of type of journey (on duty and commuting) and crash circumstances.

Taking mileage into account, other categories also seemed to be at particular risk of work-related crashes: <b>postal</b> workers, security <b>guards</b> transporting funds and technicians in the computer and telecommunications sectors...|$|R
