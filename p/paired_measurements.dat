40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{standardize}} and objectivize {{treatment response}} assessment in oncology, guidelines {{have been proposed}} that are driven by radiological measurements, which are typically communicated in free-text reports defying automated processing. We study through inter-annotator agreement and natural language processing (NLP) algorithm development the task of <b>pairing</b> <b>measurements</b> that quantify the same finding across consecutive radiology reports, such that each <b>measurement</b> is <b>paired</b> with at most one other (“partial uniqueness”). Methods and materialsGround truth is created based on 283 abdomen and 311 chest CT reports of 50 patients each. A pre-processing engine segments reports and extracts measurements. Thirteen features are developed based on volumetric similarity between measurements, semantic similarity between their respective narrative contexts and structural properties of their report positions. A Random Forest classifier (RF) integrates all features. A “mutual best match” (MBM) post-processor ensures partial uniqueness. ResultsIn an end-to-end evaluation, RF has precision 0. 841, recall 0. 807, F-measure 0. 824 and AUC 0. 971; with MBM, which performs above chance level (P 0. 960) indicates that the task is well defined. Domain properties and inter-section differences are discussed to explain superior performance in abdomen. Enforcing partial uniqueness has mixed but minor effects on performance.

The ED results were not interchangeable with PAC, because of the large limits of agreement.
