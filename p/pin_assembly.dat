40|$|A {{number of}} steel beam bridges {{exist in the}} United States that contain <b>pin</b> and hanger <b>assemblies.</b> <b>Pin</b> and hanger <b>assemblies</b> are {{fracture}} critical members whose failure would result in collapse of the bridge or render it unable to perform its expected functions.

50|$|<b>Pin</b> and hanger <b>assemblies</b> are {{considered}} fracture critical bridge components, {{meaning that the}} assemblies are non-redundant and failure of these systems could cause part {{or all of the}} bridge to collapse.

40|$|A new piston concept, made of carbon-carbon refractory-composite material, {{has been}} {{developed}} that overcomes {{a number of the}} shortcomings of aluminum pistons. Carbon-carbon material, developed in the early 1960 's, is lighter in weight than aluminum, has higher strength and stiffness than aluminum and maintains these properties at temperatures over 2500 F. In addition, carbon-carbon material has a low coefficient of thermal expansion and excellent resistance to thermal shock. An effort, called the Advanced Carbon-Carbon Piston Program was started in 1986 to develop and test carbon-carbon pistons for use in spark ignition engines. The carbon-carbon pistons were designed to be replacements for existing aluminum pistons, using standard piston <b>pin</b> <b>assemblies</b> and using standard rings. Carbon-carbon pistons can potentially enable engines to be more reliable, more efficient and have greater power output. By utilizing the unique characteristics of carbon-carbon material a piston can: (1) have greater resistance to structural damage caused by overheating, lean air-fuel mixture conditions and detonation; (2) be designed to be lighter than an aluminum piston thus, reducing the reciprocating mass of an engine, and (3) be operated in a higher combustion temperature environment without failure...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) imaging techniques in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) have seen increasing use in {{an array of}} industrial, environmental, military, and medical applications (Goebbels, et al., 1999). A brief overview and three diverse application studies of x-ray CT at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) will be discussed. (1) Bridge pins are fracture critical elements for some multi-span steel bridges. Recently, pins were removed from their hanger <b>pin</b> <b>assemblies.</b> These <b>pins</b> were selected for further examination by laboratory NDE techniques. High-energy x-ray radiography and CT were used to characterize these pins. (2) Cast light metals, aluminum and magnesium, are being used in an ever increasing number of applications to reduce automobile weight for improved gas mileage and lower emissions. After mechanical testing, the damage in notched Al-tensile test specimens was first determined using CT and subsequently by metallography analysis intended to benchmark the CT technique. (3) A computational approach to normal joint kinematics and prosthetic joint analysis offers an opportunity to evaluate and improve prosthetic joint replacements before they are manufactured or surgically implanted. Computed tomography data are combined with computational analysis to reveal regions where the joint design can be improved for better performance and longevity, prior to expensive manufacturing, laboratory tests, and clinical evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Glass-ceramics {{are widely}} {{utilized}} in the electronics industry to provide electrical insulation and to form leak tight joints {{with a range}} of metals. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the glass-ceramic can be controlled by the extent of crystallization to reduce detrimental tensile stresses in the joint. In recent years there has been interest in using titanium alloys, in place of stainless steels, due to their lower density and superior specific strength. In this study, the heat treatment of a strontium boroaluminate glass has been tailored to create glass-ceramics with mean CTEs ranging from 5. 7 ± 0. 1 × 10 - 6 K- 1 to 9. 7 ± 0. 1 × 10 - 6 K- 1 over the temperature range 303 K to 693 K. The resultant glass-ceramic consists of three crystalline phases and residual glass. A glass-ceramic with a mean CTE of 6. 9 ± 0. 1 × 10 - 6 K- 1 was subsequently fabricated to form a compression seal with a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V housing and a pre-oxidized Kovar <b>pin.</b> Single <b>pin</b> <b>assemblies</b> were shown to be reproducible in terms of microstructure and all passed a standard helium leak test, indicating that a successful seal had been produced...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the errors}} {{inherent}} in the heading indications of a magnetic compass {{are related to the}} compass' construction. An aircraft compass consists of an inverted bowl with a magnetized bar attached. The bowl is balanced on a low friction pin. The bowl and <b>pin</b> <b>assembly</b> is enclosed in a case filled with non-acidic kerosene. The magnetized bar tends to orient the assembly with the local geomagnetic field. The bar turns the visible bowl of the compass. The outside surface of the bowl includes markings to indicate a magnetic heading. As the aircraft (and the compass housing) turns, the bowl remains somewhat stationary with respect to the earth due to the magnetic attraction. In summary, the aircraft is free to turn around the stationary bowl.|$|E

40|$|Coaracy Nunes was {{the first}} {{hydroelectric}} power plant in the Amazon region, being located in Araguari River, Amapa State, Brazil. The plant operates since 1976, presenting now a nominal capacity of 78 MW. The shear pins, which are installed in the turbine hydraulic arms to control the wicket gate and regulate the water flow into the turbine blades, suffered several breakdowns since 2004. These shear pins are made of an ASTM 410 stainless steel and were designed to break by a shear overload of 120 kN. Fractographic investigation of the pins, however, revealed two types of fracture topographies: a region of stable crack propagation area, with non-pronounced striation and secondary cracks; and a region of unstable propagation, featuring elongated dimples. These {{results indicated that the}} stable crack propagation occurred by fatigue (bidirectional bending), which was nucleated at machining marks under high nominal load. Finite element analysis was carried out using two loading conditions (pure shear and a combination of shear and bending) and the results indicated that the presence of a bending stress strongly increased the stress concentration factor (85 % rise in the shear stress and 130 % rise in the Von Mises stress). Misalignment during shear <b>pins</b> <b>assembly</b> associated with vibration might have promoted the premature failure of the shear by bending fatigue. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The weapon {{consists}} of a rocket within a launcher consisting of two tubes, one inside the other. While closed, the outer assembly serves as a watertight container for the rocket and the percussion-cap firing mechanism that activates the rocket. The outer tube contains the trigger, the arming handle, front and rear sights, and the rear cover. The inner tube contains the channel assembly, which houses the firing <b>pin</b> <b>assembly,</b> including the detent lever. When extended, the inner tube telescopes outward toward the rear, guided by the channel assembly, which rides in an alignment slot in the outer tube's trigger housing assembly. This causes the detent lever to move under the trigger assembly in the outer tube, both locking the inner tube in the extended position and cocking the weapon. Once armed, the weapon is no longer watertight, even if the launcher is collapsed into its original configuration.|$|E
5000|$|The basic minigun is a six-barrel, air-cooled, and {{electrically}} driven {{rotary machine}} gun. The electric drive rotates the weapon within its housing, with a rotating firing <b>pin</b> <b>assembly</b> and rotary chamber. The minigun's multi-barrel design helps prevent overheating, but also serves other functions. Multiple barrels {{allow for a}} greater capacity for a high firing rate, since the serial process of firing/extraction/loading {{is taking place in}} all barrels simultaneously. Thus, as one barrel fires, two others are in different stages of shell extraction and another three are being loaded. The minigun is composed of multiple closed-bolt rifle barrels arranged in a circular housing. The barrels are rotated by an external power source, usually electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic. Other rotating-barrel cannons are powered by the gas pressure or recoil energy of fired cartridges. A gas-operated variant, designated XM133, was also developed. [...] It is nearly identical but has barrels with ports that align with the piston drive {{in the center of the}} barrel cluster. It fired over 3000 rpm but was not put into production.|$|E
50|$|Though rare, a few {{land mine}} designs (both {{anti-tank}} and anti-personnel) contain no metal whatsoever. Such mines cannot be found using metal detectors {{because there is}} no metal to detect. Typically, 100% non-metallic landmines have a plastic case and a fuze which comprises a glass or plastic vial containing a mixture of friction-sensitive pyrotechnic composition and glass powder. Downward force on the pressure plate overcomes the breaking strain of a plastic shear pin which snaps, allowing the non-metallic firing <b>pin</b> <b>assembly</b> to move. The firing pin is pushed down through a flexible plastic forcing-cone, which abruptly releases it on the other side at much higher velocity. Concentrated pressure is thereby transferred directly onto the glass vial, crushing and fracturing it. Alternatively, when the shear pin breaks, pressure on the fuze is transferred onto a plastic belleville spring which flips downwards, stabbing a non-metallic tapered pin (sometimes made from a glass ceramic) through a thin plastic membrane covering the vial of friction-sensitive pyrotechnic mixture. Either way, this action causes a flash of flame that triggers the detonator and initiates the adjacent booster which in turn detonates the main explosive filling.|$|E
40|$|Reciprocal {{frames and}} {{reciprocal}} structures {{have already been}} considered of great interest in the past, as witnessed {{by the work of}} Leonardo da Vinci and of other important scientists and architects. Recent researches show that both the shape and the mechanical behaviour of such structures are really complexes, due to the concept of reciprocity. The position of each structural element in the space, indeed, as well as the way they transfer loads, depends on the position and on the role of adjacent elements, so that the structure must be studied as a whole and it can hardly be decomposed in simpler substructures. In this paper we focus on the statical and mechanical determinacy of a specific subset of this kind of structures, i. e. the multiple plane reciprocal frames. In this structures the shape can be easily defined in plane coordinates, so that only the mechanical behaviour needs to be studied. The presence of mechanisms or the possibility of self-stress states is largely related to the kind of internal constraints joining each bar to the others. The study is developed starting from the basic works on <b>pinned</b> bars <b>assemblies</b> [5], [8], in which the statical and kinematical determinacy are discussed by means of a matrix formulation of the equilibrium and compatibility equations.

A pair of large steel pins through the plates and girder webbing provide the hinges, holding up the suspended span while allowing it to move longitudinally. Large washers are bolted to {{each end of the}} pin to retain the hangers.
