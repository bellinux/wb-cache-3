5000|$|In contrast, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine {{provided}} a mixed review, criticizing its [...] "dated production and vocals that hark {{back to the}} days when Brit was selling 10 million records". Some critics felt the album was impersonal despite its marketing. The Chicago Tribune compared the album's contents to its title, noting: [...] "the hype about her most 'personal' album yet begins with the album title ... which promotes a sense of intimacy that the songs never quite deliver." [...] The Atlantic described the album as [...] "her most disappointing release yet", calling it [...] "dull" [...] and criticized the album's content matter, noting that [...] "glimpses into Britney Jean Spears, the artist, are, frankly, neither interesting nor informative." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Britney Jean [...] "continues the striptease of Britney's career", and felt that its production prevented the record from coming across as a genuinely personal effort. Billboard noted that the album did [...] "not fully shed light on its author's current mindset," [...] and The New York Times described the album as being [...] "about as personal as an airline <b>preboarding</b> announcement." ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} general pattern of aircraft hijacking in the U. S. between 1361 and 1976, {{the reasons for the}} dramatic reduction in hijackings after 1972, and {{the costs and benefits of}} regulation instituted in 1973 that required mandatory <b>preboarding</b> searches of all passengers and carry-on luggage. The main findings of the paper can be summarized as follows: (1) Increases in the probability of apprehension, the conditional probability of incarceration and the sentence are associated with significant reductions in aircraft hijackings in the 1961 to 1976 time period. These findings are based on two methods of estimating the rate of hijackings, a quarterly time series and the time or flight intervals between successive hijackings, and alternative estimates of the deterrence variables. (2) Regression estimates from the sample period ending in 1972 were used to forecast the number of additional hijackings that would have taken place between 1973 and 1976 if (a) mandatory screening had not been instituted and (b) the probability of apprehension (once the hijacking is attempted) had remained constant and equal to its 1972 value. Under these assumptions, there would have been between 41 and 67 additional hijackings compared to the 11 that actually occurred in the 1973 to 1976 period. (3) Although the mandatory screening program is highly effective in terms of the number of hijackings prevented, its costs appear enormous. The estimated net increase in security costs due to the screening program (which does not include the time and inconvenience costs to persons searched) is $ 194. 24 million over the 1973 to 1976 period. This, in turn, translates into a $ 3. 24 to $ 9. 25 million expenditure to deter a single hijacking. Put differently, if the dollar equivalent of the loss to an individual hijacked passenger were in the range of $ 76, 718 to $ 219, 221, then the costs of screening would just offset the expected hijacking losses. ...|$|E

There are {{subjects}} {{that are necessary}} for any clinical residents not considering their field of specialty. Among the subjects ten {{seems to be the}} most important: research methodology and data analysis, computer-based programs, medical recording, cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation, clinical teaching programs, communication skills, clinical ethics, laboratory examinations, reporting special diseases and death certification, and prescription. Purpose This cross-sectional study assessed educational needs of clinical residents for ten educational subjects. Methods A questionnaire prepared by board faculty members consisted of 10 close-ended questions, and one openÂ­ ended question was distributed among 1307 residents from 22 clinical disciplines, who registered for <b>preboard</b> or promotion exam in June 2000.
