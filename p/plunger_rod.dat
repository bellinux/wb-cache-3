40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a preload release mechanism comprising a preload spring assembly adapted {{to apply a}} preload to a first connector member which is mounted on a support structure and adapted for connection with a second connector member on an object. The assembly comprises telescoped bushings and a preload spring. A tubular shaft extends through the spring assembly and openings in the first connector member and support structure, on which it is clamped. A <b>plunger</b> <b>rod</b> in the shaft is provided with a tip end and a recess in the rod near the other end thereof. A retainer precludes passage of the rod through the shaft {{in one direction and}} an end cap closes the bore of the shaft at the other end and provides a shoulder which extends radially of the shaft. A plunger return spring biases the <b>plunger</b> <b>rod</b> against the plunger retainer with the plunger tip protruding from the shaft and a spring assembly return spring engages at its ends the shoulder of the end cap and one end of the spring assembly. Detents received in lateral openings in the tubular shaft are held captive by the <b>plunger</b> <b>rod</b> and one end of the spring assembly to lock the spring assembly on the tubular shaft and apply a preload to the first connector member. Upon completion of the connection, detents and spring assembly are released by plunger contact with the object to be connected, thereby releasing the preload while the connection is maintained...|$|E
50|$|The model 302 {{is built}} upon a {{rectangular}} steel base plate on which are mounted the ringer unit, the induction coil, a metal can containing two capacitors, and a connector terminal plate. The base {{was supported by}} four felt- or leather-covered triangular feet attached under each corner. The housing sat {{on top of the}} base, secured with screws, and contained the rotary dial and the hook switch, which was activated with two <b>plunger</b> <b>rods</b> in the handset cradle by removing or replacing the handset.|$|R
5000|$|The pump was {{operated}} by a breastshot water wheel which was direct coupled to a three-throw crankshaft (cast in 1912) which swung three 12 ft long beams pivoted at one end through connecting <b>rods.</b> The pump <b>plunger</b> <b>rods</b> connected to the outer free ends of the beams travel in a substantially straight-line motion; these were fitted with back to back 6 in diameter leather cups and non-return valves made from leather flaps. The pump has three cylinders with a 6.5 in bore and a stroke of 13 in. The pump could produce an operating pressure of in excess of [...]|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{primarily}} focused on {{finite element analysis}} and topological optimization of impact <b>plunger</b> and drill <b>rod.</b> Finite element method is an extremely functional, due to which we apply ANSYS software to analyze the stress and strain that impact <b>plunger</b> and drill <b>rod</b> bear in actual working condition and optimize their structure...|$|R
50|$|Telescopic {{cylinders}} {{are designed}} {{with a series of}} steel or aluminum tubes of progressively smaller diameters nested within each other. The largest diameter sleeve is called the main or barrel. The smaller inner sleeves are called the stages. The smallest stage is often called the <b>plunger</b> or piston <b>rod.</b>|$|R
40|$|The most {{advanced}} part of precision agriculture technology is yield monitoring of grain and non-grain crops. In this study, the horizontal pressing force of baling plunger and the angular {{position of the}} <b>plunger</b> connecting <b>rod</b> were simultaneously measured by installing a load cell and a shaft encoder on the connecting <b>rod</b> and <b>plunger</b> flywheel of a small rectangular baler, respectively. The signals of these sensors were processed in an electronic board and the output data were recorded on a portable computer for monitoring and further analysis. Before baling the harvested alfalfa from the test field, random samples were collected and weighted to obtain a referenced measure of the yield variation along the entire field. Comparing the yield data with the pressing energy and angular position data indicated a good correlation between the throughput rate of the baler and the horizontal force imparted on the baler plunger. The estimated crop yield variations were geo-referenced by using a GPS receiver. By combining the output data of the installed sensors and the positioning data, the yield map of the test field was prepared...|$|R
25|$|The ball is {{put into}} play by use of the <b>plunger,</b> a {{spring-loaded}} <b>rod</b> that strikes the ball as it rests in an entry lane, or as in some newer games, by a button that signals the game logic to fire a solenoid that strikes the ball. With both devices {{the result is the}} same: The ball is propelled upwards onto the playfield. Once a ball is in play, it tends to move downward towards the player, although the ball can move in any direction, sometimes unpredictably, due to contact with objects on the playfield or by the player's own actions. To return the ball to {{the upper part of the}} playfield, the player makes use of one or more flippers.|$|R
5000|$|... 1958: Zunow SLR (Japan): first {{internal}} auto-diaphragm (Zunow-matic Diaphragm System) 35 mm SLR and lenses. Well-integrated focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror, pentaprism and auto-diaphragm {{design with}} excellent lenses and good accessory system. Stopping down (closing) the lens aperture (iris) {{to prepare for}} exposure transmits less light to the mirror and the viewfinder may become very dim - perhaps even {{too dark to see}} the image. Auto-diaphragms coupled to the shutter release that automatically stop down when the mirror swings up and reopen when the mirror comes down provides almost continuous fully open aperture viewing. Auto-diaphragm lenses and instant return mirror, focal-plane shutter SLRs require precise camera-to-lens linkage, but can choreograph the entire shutter-button release, close lens, raise mirror, open shutter, close shutter, lower mirror, open lens exposure sequence in as little as â…›th second. Originally, these were mechanical spring/gear/lever systems energized concurrent with manually winding the film, but modern systems are electronically timed and operated by an electromagnet. The financially weak Zunow company was unable to capitalize on its design; few examples of the camera (and much fewer of the wide and tele lenses for it) were produced before the company switched back to lenses for other companies' cameras. Zunow went bankrupt in 1961. Note, the 1954 version of the Ihagee Exakta VX (East Germany) 35 mm SLR introduced an external auto-diaphragm lens system using a spring-loaded shutter button <b>plunger</b> connection <b>rod.</b>|$|R
