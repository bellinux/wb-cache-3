25|$|Health care {{prices in}} the United States {{describes}} market and non-market factors that determine pricing, along with possible causes as to why prices are higher than other countries. Compared to other OECD countries, U.S. healthcare costs are one-third higher or more relative {{to the size of}} the economy (GDP). According to the CDC, during 2015 health expenditures per-person were nearly $10,000 on average, with total expenditures of $3.2 trillion or 17.8% GDP. Proximate reasons for the differences with other countries include higher prices for the same services (i.e., higher <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit)</b> and greater use of healthcare (i.e., more units consumed). Higher administrative costs, higher per-capita income, and less government intervention to drive down prices are deeper causes. While the annual inflation rate in healthcare costs has declined in recent decades, it still remains above the rate of economic growth, resulting in a steady increase in healthcare expenditures relative to GDP from 6% in 1970 to nearly 18% in 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Consumption is {{separated}} from production, logically, because two different economic agents are involved. In the first case consumption is by the primary individual; in the second case, a producer might make something {{that he would not}} consume himself. Therefore, different motivations and abilities are involved. The models that make up consumer theory are used to represent prospectively observable demand patterns for an individual buyer on the hypothesis of constrained optimization.

2500|$|For cost {{reducing}} resource efficiency, {{distinguishing between}} {{direct and indirect}} effects is shown in Figure 1 below. [...] The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and {{measured in terms of}} kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis. [...] An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> of washing. [...] This shifts the household budget line rightwards. [...] The result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price, but also an income effect due to the increased real income. [...] The substitution effect increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the income effect from QS to Q2. [...] The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect. [...] The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2. [...] The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically. In the manufacturing sector, {{it has been estimated that}} there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency. A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur.|$|E

30|$|A brief {{overview}} of energy pricing models for DSM started with the enhancement of the traditional flat electricity tariff (fixed <b>price</b> <b>per</b> consumed <b>unit</b> of energy and identical at all time instances) with inclining block rates (IBRs) [8, 9]. In IBR, the price of each unit depends on {{the total amount of}} energy a customer consumes. IBR was the first simple solution to incentivize energy curtailments, usually during a large time interval. A more sophisticated approach is time-of-use (ToU) pricing where prices are predetermined based on prediction of the relationship between aggregate production and consumption. However, TOU is insensitive to the users’ response to the prices and often creates reverse peaks. Finally, real time pricing (RTP) mechanisms create the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> energy <b>unit</b> depending on the total cost of energy production and the total consumption.|$|R
