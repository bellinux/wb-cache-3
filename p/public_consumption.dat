5|$|New Jersey's {{state parks}} and forests {{prohibit}} the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages except at pre-approved events. There is no state law against <b>public</b> <b>consumption</b> of alcohol in other locations, but most municipalities have open container laws prohibiting or restricting <b>public</b> <b>consumption.</b> The fine for alcohol possession {{in a state}} park is $71, whereas municipal fines for <b>public</b> <b>consumption</b> violations can {{be as high as}} $2000, although they are generally much lower. Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is not a criminal offense, and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication. New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or to a medical facility.|$|E

50|$|The recent {{documentary}} Tapped argues {{against the}} bottled water industry, asserting that tap water is healthier, more environmentally sustainable, and more ecologically sound than bottled water. The film {{focuses on the}} bottled water industry in the United States. The film has received largely positive reviews, and has spawned college campus groups such as Beyond the Bottle. Yet, as many people remain generally unaware of the negative health and environmental impacts associated with bottled water, recent research in environmental psychology has started to investigate how to reduce the <b>public's</b> <b>consumption</b> of bottled water.|$|R

In 1825 he wrote a more sophisticated work, Die Hochzeit des Camacho (Camacho's Wedding), based on an episode in Don Quixote, for <b>public</b> <b>consumption.</b> It was produced in Berlin in 1827, but coolly received.

5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. <b>Public</b> <b>consumption</b> of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at Sandy Hook.|$|E

With the rising demand, the company purchased a borehole outside Sawston, constructing pumping equipment and integrating the water from that borehole into their system in 1979. Tests undertaken both before the purchase, and in 1979, had demonstrated that the water was safe for <b>public</b> <b>consumption.</b> During the late 1970s, concerns were expressed {{about the presence of}} perchloroethene (PCE) in water, and as a result a European Directive was issued in 1980 requiring nations of the European Community to establish maximum acceptable levels of PCE in water; the United Kingdom did this in 1982. PCE was discovered in the borehole; it was not tested for earlier because {{there was no need to}} regulate the levels. As a result, the Cambridge Water Company was forced to cease pumping the water, and instead find a new borehole elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{determines the}} {{conditions}} required for fiscal contractions to be expansionary when government spending is financed by money seigniorage. It {{shows that the}} expansionary effects of permanent fiscal contractions are dependent on the initial rates of inflation prevailing {{in the economy and}} that the set of initial inflation rates under which fiscal contractions are expansionary is affected by the degree of substitutability between <b>public</b> and private <b>consumption.</b> Starting from the benchmark case where <b>public</b> and private <b>consumption</b> are independent, introducing complementarity between <b>public</b> and private <b>consumption</b> gives rise to a weaker set of conditions for fiscal contractions to be expansionary. This implies that economies that print money to finance government spending complementary with private consumption are more likely to experience expansions if they pursue fiscal contractions.

Previous scholars have taken on two sides concerning this topic of the media outlet’s effect on voting. On the one side, scholars propose that, {{because there are so many}} factors influencing a citizen’s decision to vote, there is no reason to expect the coefficient on some ‘media’ independent term to be significant when regressed on some dependent voting variable. On the other hand, there are many scholars who through their specific studies on either the television, newspaper and internet markets have produced regression results conclusive with my argument. Through observing the market expansion of the internet of the past 10 years, and the changing voting turnout in the past 4 election years, I have shown with the help of my fixed-effects model that not only is this relationship between internet use and voting significant, but it is positive...|$|R
