50|$|Following a P300 {{million loss}} {{in the first quarter}} of 2006, the Sunday Standard {{reported}} that the government hurriedly began efforts to privatise the airline before it became insolvent. The newspaper also revealed that the airline defaulted on its US$42,000 - 45,000 payments for the lease of the BAe 146 from April — July 2006, and that the arrears were paid once the airline's Secretary and Corporate Counsel warned that non-compliance with the contracts could lead to the termination of the lease of the aircraft and expose the corporation to claims for damages, which would affect its image during the privatisation process. In September 2006 it was announced that three potential investors had placed bids for the tender to take over the airline: Airlink of South Africa, African World Airways Ltd, and Lobtrans (Ltd), a local truck fuel transporter. Shortlisted companies which did not submit bids included Ethiopian Airlines, Comair, Tourism Empowerment Group, ExecuJet, and Interair South Africa.

40|$|Donabedian’s framework, {{based on}} the structure, {{processes}} and outcomes is widely used to assess quality in health care studies. This study argued the relevance of Donabedian’s framework in exploring changes of quality in health care as perceived and experienced by households. The {{study was conducted in}} three mining townships in Luanshya town. Six focus group discussions composed of 8 – 12 respondents were conducted within the households. In addition, interviews were conducted with the District Director of Health in Luanshya town and the Manager Human Resources at Luanshya Copper Mines Plc. In addition, documents such as newspapers and reports from the Zambia <b>Privatisation</b> <b>Agency</b> were analysed. The study revealed that quality in health care had declined based on thirteen areas of concern. In response, households have adopted coping strategies in their access to health care. Households who incur high costs in their access to health care have reduced access to formal care while those that incur low costs have maintained their access. These findings presented a major limitation in Donabedian’s framework. Whereas the framework focuses only on the micro process of users seeking health, it omits important factors described in the blueprint, which affect access to health care. Based on the findings from households and limitations of Donabedian’s framework a blueprint to conceptualise quality in health care within Zambia was proposed. The blueprint recognises the macro context, which considers the economic and social contexts that affect access to health care and, therefore, influence household’s perceptions of quality. Within the macro context, the economic context, which is privatisation, affected household incomes and the cost of travel. Additionally, the social context reflected by services provided by other health systems, has also affected household utilisation of mine facilities. Both factors have helped form households’ negative perceptions of quality in health care...|$|R
40|$|Privatisation in Central and Eastern Europe can {{be defined}} as the {{transfer}} of property rights from the State to private owners. The transfers are carried out so as to vest the new private owners with the full property rights of use and disposal over their property, these rights being guaranteed by the legal framework established by the rule of law. In Bulgaria, one can distinguish between three main stages in the process of privatisation. Each was shaped by the conflicting resolutions of frequently changing governments and meant to serve different political goals. The first stage (1990 - 1993) is characterised by the blockade of legal privatisation, as ‘spontaneous privatisation’ was accorded high priority. As in other former socialist countries, great emphasis was placed on the so-called commercialisation of state-owned enterprises. This did not involve the actual transfer of State property into private hands, but rather the independent transformation of state-owned enterprises into joint-stock companies, as well as the establishment of subsidiary companies. 1 The goals of introducing more efficient structures and applying modern methods of production by transferring property to a more suitable management were not achieved. The second stage (1993 - 1995) is a cash privatisation, which laid the foundation for an employee/management buy-out, aided by the legal provisions granting concessions in the payment of instalments. The most important factor in the third stage of the process of privatisation in Bulgaria was the adoption of the mass privatisation model as an alternative method of procedure. In 1996, legal regulations for mass privatisation were introduced and a privatisation fund was established. In the meantime, the process has evolved into its fourth stage, during which a strategy of privatisation has been formulated under the supervision of a monetary council, and various agreements with the IMF and the World Bank are being adhered to. Privatisation is the decisive factor in the structural reforms of East European countries. The problem of converting State property into more effective forms of property management has been exacerbated by the additional demand of carrying out the far-reaching structural changes as swiftly as possible. The expectation that a large part of State property would be privatised within a short time in Bulgaria, has not been met for a number of reasons. When the reforms began, the private sector was too weakly developed to become a catalyst for structural changes. Until 1995 there were no laws regulating the stock exchange or securities and bonds - the capital market was practically non-existent. Moreover, the various political parties could not agree upon the various models and objectives of privatisation. The population itself had no capital. The restitution of private ownership which will not be discussed in further detail was limited to the smallest businesses, traders and workshops. Furthermore, the <b>Privatisation</b> <b>Agency</b> and State authorities employed to initiate the privatisation process lacked experience. Another problem hindering privatisation was that the laws passed lacked precision and were constantly subject to change. ...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{economic}} aims of privatisation is improving the efficiency of existing state-owned enterprises while protecting their value. This research evidenced that the longer the time of implementation of the privatisation process, the higher the value that can be destroyed in state-owned enterprises to be privatised. During the <b>privatisation</b> process <b>agency</b> problems between management and the state as an owner increases. The managers are uncertain about their future and the state also increases its control mechanisms on companies to be privatised. The state restricts the authority of managers in operations, investment and financing and governance. These restrictions reduce the management’s decision-making empowerment and destroy the value creation potential of the enterprises. Moreover, the saleability of the large stateowned enterprises in poor developing countries is constrained {{by a lack of}} potentialbuyers and capital markets. Therefore, privatising state-owned enterprises in poor developing countries is more difficult in comparison to the privatisation of stateowned enterprises in the developed countries. The increase in <b>agency</b> problems during <b>privatisation</b> and the constraints encountered in selling state-owned enterprises in poor developing countries result in a ‘privatisation trap’. This study documents theoretical and policy implication of the study and the implications of the research to the conceptual framework (model). The debate on the speed of privatisation is centred on the ‘Big Bang’ approach that is divesting stateowned enterprises as rapidly as possible and the ‘Gradualist’ approach, that is slow privatisation. This study evidences that reforms prior to the announcement of sale improve the value created in enterprises, while once companies are offered for sale quick divestiture is best. Moreover, the debate on the sequencing of privatisation and restructuring is focussed on whether governments should restructure state-owned enterprises prior to sale. This study shows that judgement has to be exercised. The cases studied revealed that selective restructuring and nurturing the value creation potential is essential. In addition another debate on privatisation is whether stateowned enterprises adjust to the market environment. The case study of Eritrea provides mixed evidence that some enterprises in the food processing, beverage and footwear and leather industries adjust to the market environment, while all the textile enterprises are encountering difficulties in adjusting to the market environment. In order to transform the state-owned enterprises in Eritrea into value creating private entities there is a need of changing ownership, finding new markets, reducing material costs, investing in new machinery and upgrading of technology, access to finance, empowering and controlling managers and training management and employees. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} thesis presents two real‐life {{experiences of}} Local Economic Development (LED) {{and the evolution}} of these practices from the dynamics in place prior to the establishment of the practice to its current state of affairs. It uncovers the complexities of LED and how practice has been conditioned by its social, cultural, political and economic environment. There are two stories being presented in this thesis: Montreal LED and Auckland LED. The stories are structured into three patterns of development: the history prior to the establishment of LED; a phase of experimentation; and a phase of what could be described as ‘maturity’. It also offers a detailed picture of current practices. These stories were informed by hundreds of documents and a number of practitioner interviews. Montreal’s first pattern tells a story of empowerment for the French population at both a local and a provincial level. At the local level, the first pattern illustrates the empowerment of community groups and the mobilization of civil society especially in French industrial districts. This had a fundamental impact on the current practices of local economic development as these groups had a significant influence in defining a more socio‐economic focus in LED in Montreal. At the provincial level, empowerment meant a government highly involved in economic development and regional development matters. “Taking control of our own destiny” was a very strong slogan in Quebec during this period. The second pattern shows how the provincial government had a major impact on the development of LED practices. Until recently, provincial government directly funded LED organisations and local organisations reported directly to provincial government. They built trusting relationships over time. The local‐provincial relationships helped favour stability in local economic development areas allowing the long term development of expertise. The second pattern also demonstrates how local economic practices in Quebec are based on the interweaving of bottom up and top down initiatives (from the local community and from the provincial government). Montreal’s third pattern shows how municipal agencies today play a more significant role in local economic development practices, and how they are now major players in controlling funding. Current practitioners that were interviewed described how they have adapted to this change and how they have built new relationships. The third pattern also demonstrates why LED practitioners consult metropolitan economic development plans, and how they attempt to contribute to these plans. Practitioners hold the belief {{that it is important to}} show their relevance in the new paradigm of metropolitan economic development. Auckland’s first pattern tells a story in the context of national financial regulation and agricultural exporting. It highlights a national government highly focused on external trade in the pursuit of economic development. There was little concern in the development of regions, with subsidies xii dedicated to industries with export potential; these tended to primarily support industries in the agricultural sector. The second pattern reviews the characteristics of the significant reforms that took place in New Zealand with the major deregulation of the financial system, cuts to subsidies, implementation of a “private sector” management philosophy into the public system, the <b>privatisation</b> of public <b>agencies</b> and the sale of public assets. Central government no longer wanted to “interfere” in the economy and decentralised initiatives relating to employment. During this period, the national government did not fully recognise LED as a tool for development. In fact LED initiatives were primarily funded by programmes dedicated to fight unemployment through business development. Local economic development was only brought in through the creativity in the practices of people working at the local level, who managed to direct funding towards broader issues at the local level. LED is still today focused on business development but now includes industrial development as well. Auckland’s third pattern demonstrates how regional development and sustainable development came more recently into the political agenda. It also illustrates how local agencies came to play more significant roles in local economic development practices. Auckland was recognised as an important engine of economic growth by the national government. As the perceived issues in the governance of the metropolitan region were uncovered, the decision to force amalgamation significantly changed the face of Auckland and the practice of local economic development. The final discussion highlights through comparisons of the two metropolitan regions how these historical developments have influenced current practice. The conclusion reflects on the impact of the findings on local economic development theory and practice as well as proposing other areas for further investigation...|$|R
