We {{consider}} {{a model of}} correlated defaults in which the default times of multiple entities depend not only on a common and specific factors, {{but also on the}} extent of past defaults in the market, via the <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> process, including the average number of defaults as a special case. The paper characterizes the <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> process when the number of entities becomes large, showing that under some monotonicity conditions the limiting <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> process can be determined by a fixed point problem. We also show that the Law of Large Numbers holds under certain compatibility conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{selection}} of controlled variables (CVs) from available measurements through exhaustive search is computationally forbidding for large-scale processes. We have recently proposed novel bidirectional {{branch and bound}} (B- 3) approaches for CV selection using the minimum singular value (MSV) rule and the local worst- case loss criterion {{in the framework of}} self-optimizing control. However, the MSV rule is approximate and worst-case scenario may not occur frequently in practice. Thus, CV selection by minimizing local <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> can be deemed as most reliable. In this work, the B- 3 approach is extended to CV selection based on local <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> metric. Lower bounds on local <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> and, fast pruning and branching algorithms are derived for the efficient B- 3 algorithm. Random matrices and binary distillation column case study are used to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R
30|$|Thirdly, even {{profitable}} {{strategies such as}} MACD and STOCH-D {{could not}} reliably predict subsequent market directions as their profitable trades are usually less than fifty percent of total number of trades. They make money from having a higher average profit from profitable trades than an <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> from unprofitable ones. Interestingly, optimized parameters do not improve the odds of profitable trades. Our results {{support the idea that}} profitable strategies make money not from outguessing market directions, but from maximizing average profits and minimizing <b>average</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis of various interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines and a surface permanent magnet (SPM) machine {{designed for a}} commuter train. The different IPM machines are characterized by a different rotor geometry and volume of permanent magnets.

30|$|Ireland {{is one of}} the {{countries}} most severely affected by the Great Recession. National income fell by more than 10 per cent between 2007 and 2012, {{as a result of the}} bursting of a remarkable property bubble, an exceptionally severe banking crisis, and deep fiscal adjustment. This paper examines the income distribution consequences of the recession, and identifies the impact of a broad range of austerity policies on the income distribution. The overall fall in income was just under 8 per cent between 2008 and 2011, but the greatest losses were strongly concentrated on the bottom and top deciles. Tax, welfare and public sector pay changes over the 2008 to 2011 period gave rise to lower than <b>average</b> <b>losses</b> for the bottom decile. Thus, the larger than <b>average</b> <b>losses</b> observed overall are not due to these policy changes; instead, the main driving factors are the direct effects of the recession itself. Policy changes do contribute to the larger than <b>average</b> <b>losses</b> at high income levels.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a version of {{sequential}} mastery testing (i. e., classifying students as a master/nonmaster or continuing testing and administering another item or testlet) in which response behavior is modeled by a multidimensional item response theory (IRT) model. First, a general theoretical framework is outlined {{that is based on}} a combination of Bayesian sequential decision theory and multidimensional IRT. Then how multidimensional IRT-based sequential master testing can be generalized to adaptive item- and testlet-selection rules is discussed for the case where the choice of the next item or testlet to be administered is optimized using the information from previous responses. Both compensatory and conjunctive loss structures are considered. Simulation studies are used to evaluate: (1) the performance, in terms of <b>average</b> <b>loss,</b> of multidimensional IRT-based sequential mastery testing {{as a function of the}} number of items administered per testing stage; (2) the effects on <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> when turning the sequential procedure into an adaptive sequential procedure; and (3) the impact on <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> when the multidimensional structure is ignored and a unidimensional IRT model is used in the decision procedure...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to interpret the bitumen-aggregate adhesion based on the dielectric spectroscopic response of individual material components utilizing their dielectric constants, refractive indices and average tangent of the dielectric <b>loss</b> angle (<b>average</b> <b>loss</b> tangent). Dielectric spectroscopy of bitumen binders at room temperature was performed in the frequency range of 0. 01 â€“ 1000 Hz. Dielectric spectroscopy is an experimental method for characterizing the dielectric permittivity of a material as a function of frequency. Adhesion data has been determined using the Rolling bottle method. The results show that the magnitude of the average tangent of the dielectric <b>loss</b> angle (<b>average</b> <b>loss</b> tangent) depends on bitumen type. The <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> tangent in the frequency range 0. 01 â€“ 1 Hz is introduced as a potential indicator for predicting polarizability and, thereby, adhesion potential of bitumen binders to quartz aggregates when using Portland cement. In order to obtain acceptable adhesion of 70 / 100 penetration grade bitumen binders and quartz aggregates when using Portland cement, it is suggested that the binder have an average tan Î´ > 0. 035 in the frequency range 0. 01 â€“ 1 Hz...|$|R
30|$|Annually, each herder lost {{on average}} {{approximately}} 8.5 % of their annual household cash income due to depredation. The <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> {{calculated for the}} current study is higher than the <b>average</b> depredation <b>loss</b> in JSWNP (Wang and Macdonald 2006) and <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> in Tsarap valley in north India (Spearing 2000). The maximum losses attributed to SL and TW were calculated as 0.1 % and 3.5 % of the herderâ€™s total annual income respectively. The difference in the depredation loss between the two prey species could be due to the incidences of the depredation differences on young and adult livestock. TW depredated more on adult yaks, which are valued significantly higher than the young yaks and the sheep. The losses in the study area are four times higher than those in the Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary (Mishra 1997). According to herders, the rate of depredation cases has been increasing and such losses affect their livelihood.|$|R

40|$|In {{standard}} online learning, {{the goal}} of the learner is to maintain an <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> close to the loss of the best-performing function in a fixed class. Classic results show that simple algorithms can achieve an <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> arbitrarily close to that of the best function in retrospect, even when input and output pairs are chosen by an adversary. However, in many real-world applications such as spam prediction and classification of news articles, the best target function may be drifting over time. We introduce a novel model of concept drift in which an adversary is given control of both the distribution over input at each time step and the corresponding labels. The goal of the learner is to maintain an <b>average</b> <b>loss</b> close to the 0 / 1 loss of the best slowly changing sequence of functions with no more than K large shifts. We provide regret bounds for learning in this model using an (inefficient) reduction to the standard no-regret setting. We then go on to provide and analyze an efficient algorithm for learning d-dimensional hyperplanes with drift. We conclude with some simulations illustrating the circumstances under which this algorithm outperforms other commonly studied algorithms when the target hyperplane is drifting. ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} {{packages}} containing enough sanitary supplies for one menstrual period were weighed and distributed to 100 subjects to determine adequacy of supplies and compliance to protocol. Returned packages were then reweighed to determine total menstrual loss. No subject used all the supplies in her package; therefore, packages contents were deemed ample. 7 subjects added their own purchased products to their packages; since added products were specified by name, weight corrections were easily made. 2 subjects lost unused supplies which were specified, and weight corrections were made accordingly.
