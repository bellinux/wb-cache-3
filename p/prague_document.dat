The facades of buildings do not only show structural and decorative details, such as house signs, frescoes and sundials, but also all sorts of features caught in that moment, such as flaking walls, broken windows and climbing plants. In various courtyards and secluded spots we find stores of barrels, a scene from a pig-slaughter or a ladder leaning against a wall. There are no people in the model except for two soldiers standing on guard, as if their unchanging position is part of the street’s appearance.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} evaluation of non-investment public expenditure programs. The main {{aim of the}} thesis is to draw a set of relevant recommendations for proper construc-tion of public tender specifications, which are used to tender external evaluations. The author performed a research with the usage of empirical and statistical methods on a sample of tender documentations and evaluation reports, which were carried out for ESF operational programs 2004 [...] 6 and 2007 [...] 13 in the Czech Republic. Author also used {{a case study of}} an evaluation performed on Objective 3 Single Programming <b>Document</b> (<b>Prague),</b> co-financed by the ESF in the period 2004 [...] 6. In addition to the main objective stated above, the thesis includes data on real public tender documentations and evaluation reports. The output is represented by data on estimated prices of external evaluation, tender documentation contents and also on methods and techniques, which were used in the evaluations examined. Such set of empirical data has been scarcely found in recent studies, which adds to usability of this thesis for expert audience. External evaluation is an expert project financed with public resources, carried out through public procurement. Based on the model process of such evaluation, the author searches for preconditions of realizing an efficient external evaluation. Efficiency and its factors then become main subject of research. As a key factor of performing an efficient evaluation through public procurement, the author identifies the tender documentation and its qualities. This thesis contains a research performed on a sample of evaluations of five programs co-financed by the ESF in the Czech Republic. Examined tender documentations contained serious drawbacks, namely incomplete and inexact definitions of expected outputs, missing list of required methods for the evaluation and also missing scale of statistical samples for the research. Quantitative tests also did not prove any dependence of estimated price of the evaluation stated by the tenderers on pre-defined cost-effective factor. The thesis ends with summative conclusions of the drawbacks and, in accordance with research findings, brings a set of methodical recommendations for proper construction of public tender specifications of an evaluation, which may lead to increase in efficiency of tendering external evaluations...|$|R
5000|$|Müntzer {{initially}} travelled {{over the}} border into Bohemia {{to the town of}} Zatec (Saaz) - this town was {{known as one of the}} five ‘safe citadels’ of the radical Taborites of Bohemia. But Müntzer only used this as a stop-over en route to Prague. It was in Prague that the Hussite Church was already firmly established and Müntzer thought to find a safe home where he could develop his increasingly un-Lutheran ideas. He arrived here in late June 1521, made welcome as a ‘Martinist’, a follower of Luther, and was allowed to preach and to give lectures. He also found the time to prepare a summary of his own beliefs, which appeared in a document known to posterity - slightly misleadingly - as the <b>Prague</b> Manifesto. This <b>document</b> exists in four forms - one in Czech, one in Latin, two in German; one of them is written on a large piece of paper, about 50 cm by 50 cm, much like a poster, but written on both sides. But it is evident that none of the four items was ever published in any shape or form. The contents of this document indicate clearly just how far he had diverged from the road of the Wittenberg reformers, and how much he believed that the reform movement was something apocalyptic in nature. [...] "I, Thomas Müntzer, beseech the church not to worship a mute God, but a living and speaking one; none of the gods is more contemptible to the nations than this living one to Christians who have no part of him." [...] In November or December 1521, having discovered that Müntzer was not at all that they had supposed, the Prague authorities ran him out of town. The next twelve months were spent wandering in Saxony: he turned up in Erfurt and in Nordhausen, in each of which he spent several weeks, applying for suitable posts but failing to be appointed. He also visited his home-town of in Stolberg to give sermons (Easter), and in November 1522 visited Weimar to attend a disputation. From December 1522 until March 1523, he found employment as chaplain at a nunnery at Glaucha just outside Halle. Here he found little opportunity to continue with his desire for change, despite the existence of a strong and militant local reform movement; his one attempt to break the rules, by delivering the communion ‘in both kinds’ (Utraquism) to a noblewoman named Felicitas von Selmenitz probably led directly to his dismissal.|$|R

The bulk of the records are written material, both by Steiner-Prag and about {{the man and his}} work. The collection is arranged in seven series: Personal Documents, Correspondence, Writings by Hugo Steiner-Prag, Artwork and Exhibitions, Writings about Hugo Steiner-Prag, Collected Items, and Photographs. Records concerning Steiner-Prag's personal life, such as academic records, genealogical material, and documents regarding his emigration and last will, may be found in Series I. Series II holds Steiner-Prag's correspondence as well as the correspondence of his wife, Eleanor Feisenberg. Series III contains Steiner-Prag's writings and comprises the bulk of this collection. This series holds mainly manuscripts, including an autobiography, memoirs of his youth in Prague, travel diaries and travelogues, as well as notes and outlines for courses and lectures. Records related to Steiner-Prag's artwork and exhibitions may be found in Series IV, the bulk of which are exhibition catalogues. Series V contains writings about Steiner-Prag and his professional work. Series VI holds miscellaneous records, such as various clippings on <b>Prague</b> and other <b>documents</b> not related directly to Steiner-Prag. Visual materials will be found in Series VII. Please note that several documents in this collection have additional notes attached to them, presumably written by Steiner-Prag's second wife, Eleanor. Hugo Steiner-Prag was born Hugo Steiner in Prague (at that time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) on December 12, 1880. His parents were Hermann Steiner, a bookseller and Berta Steiner (neé Knina), who claimed to be a descendent of the famous Rabbi Judah Loew (1529 - 1609). Hugo Steiner was the youngest of four brothers. Upon leaving secondary school, Hugo Steiner joined Jung-Prag, a group of young artists who tended strongly toward mysticism and the occult. He took private art lessons and finally entered the Prager Kunstakademie (Prague Academy of the Arts) in 1897. In 1900, Steiner moved to Munich to enroll at the Königliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste (Royal Academy of Fine Arts). Concomitantly, he added the name of his native city Prag (using the German spelling) to his last name in order to distinguish himself from other artists bearing the same name. Steiner-Prag soon transferred to the Lehr- und Versuchsstätten in Munich and later became a teacher there. One of his students was Paula Bergmann, whom he married in 1905. The couple moved to Barmen in the Rhineland where Steiner-Prag had been offered a position as a professor for the local Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Arts). They had two children, Detlev and Helga, who were born in 1906 and 1908, respectively. One of Steiner-Prag's major projects during this time was the illustration of E. T. A. Hoffmann's Die Elixiere des Teufels. The sketches were successfully exhibited in the Buchgewerbemuseum in Leipzig. This cemented Steiner-Prag's reputation as an illustrator and book designer. In 1907 he was offered a position as professor at Leipzig's Königliche Akademie für Graphische Künste und Buchgewerbe (Royal Academy of Graphic Arts and Book Trade). This was followed by a very productive period in which Steiner-Prag illustrated books for well-known publishing houses as well as created stage decorations. He also wrote several articles for newspapers and magazines, and in 1913 he designed his own typeface, the Hugo-Steiner-Prag-Schrift. In 1916, Steiner-Prag created twenty-five lithographs for Gustav Meyrink's novel, Der Golem, which would become his masterpiece. Many other drawings originated during study trips to Spain, Portugal and the Balearic Islands in the years between 1909 and 1925. In addition to his work as a professor in Leipzig, Steiner-Prag became art director of the Propylaeen publishing house in Berlin and organized several book exhibits, including the first international book exhibit in Leipzig in 1927. He was also an active member of various organizations dedicated to book arts and design. In 1933, on his return from Paris, Steiner-Prag discovered that the Nazis had terminated his position as professor. He had just spent the summer with Eleanor Feisenberg, with whom he had an affair with since 1930. She was the daughter of Germany's former attorney general. Since her father was Jewish, she had lost her job as a librarian and decided to flee to Paris. Hugo Steiner-Prag decided to leave Germany. He returned to Prague and established a private school for book arts and graphic design, called the Officina Pragensis. In 1937, the publishing house of the Officina Pragensis released fifty stone drawings done by Steiner-Prag of the Jewish Ghetto and cemetery. He was then given the opportunity, in 1938, to establish a school based on the model of the Officina Pragensis in Stockholm. Since the political situation in Prague had grown more severe, Steiner-Prag decided to accept this offer and immigrated to Sweden with Eleanor Feisenberg. In Stockholm, Steiner-Prag became director of the Skolan foer Bok- och Reklamkonst and taught book design, advertising and stage design. Eleanor Feisenberg did not want to remain in Sweden and immigrated to the United States. Steiner-Prag hoped to follow her as soon as possible, but had to wait since his visa application was rejected at first. After divorcing his first wife, Paula and finally receiving his visa, Steiner-Prag left Stockholm on May 15, 1941 for San Francisco via Finland, Russia, Japan and Honolulu. He arrived in the United States at the end of June 1941. Prior to his emigration, Steiner-Prag had been offered a position as professor at the Division of Graphic Arts at New York University, so he settled a respectable commuter distance away in New Haven, Connecticut. He lectured once a week in New York and spent the remainder of his time writing his autobiography and several articles. On January 3, 1942, Hugo Steiner-Prag married Eleanor Feisenberg and the couple moved to New York City. Large publishing houses, such as Random House, began commissioning his work. Steiner-Prag illustrated a volume of Hoffman's tales and worked for Random House, Roy Publishers, and the Book of the Month Club, while his wife Eleanor worked at the Office of War Information. In 1943, he mounted a successful exhibition at the New York Public Library. Throughout 1945, Steiner-Prag's health began to deteriorate and he eventually suffered a heart attack from which he did not recover. Hugo Steiner-Prag died on September 10, 1945 in New York City. Several of his projects remained unfinished, such as a book on the Prague Ghetto and the suffering of the Jews that he wanted to publish together with his friend Franz Werfel (1890 - 1945) who had died only a few weeks before. 10 -page inventory. The finding aid for this collection is available online.
