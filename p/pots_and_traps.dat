40|$|Ghost {{fishing is}} the {{mortality}} caused by lost fishing gear and as such, {{its effect on}} target populations is difficult to quantify. This study seeks to rectify that by developing a methodology to estimate the effect of ghost fishing by lost <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>traps</b> on large crustaceans (crabs and lobsters). Forty-four case studies, consolidated from published literature {{on the amount of}} lost traps and their mortality rates, are used as the basis of the calculations. Missing parameters are inferred from existing values in similar case studies. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyze the sensitivity of the results to uncertainties in the input data. The mean estimate of ghost fishing as a percentage of reported landings, over the forty-four case studies, is 3. 8 %. Ghost fishing is a management issue to contend with, especially in areas where fishing effort is high. Improved legislation on using biodegradable twine and/or Galvanic Time Release mechanisms has and will ameliorate the destructive impact of lost traps on vulnerable ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Exploitation {{patterns}} of the common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, in two Mediterranean areas were studied in three ports, two in the Thracian Sea (Greece, Eastern Mediterranean) {{and one in the}} Catalan Sea (Spain, Western Mediterranean). The study period of one year (July 1998 -June 1999) included a monthly collection of data on commercial landings, fishing effort and length distribution of O. vulgaris. Many gears exploit this species in both areas. Specialised and highly productive artisanal gears (fyke nets, <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>traps)</b> have been developed. Herein it is shown that: (1) trawls are responsible for most octopus landings; (2) trawls exploit mostly the small and immature individuals while the artisanal fleets exploit the large and mature ones; (3) there is a marked seasonality of catches; (4) {{there is little or no}} interaction between the gears fishing octopus, indicating that each gear affects a certain size range; (5) and the octopus specimens from the Greek area are clearly smaller than the ones from the Spanish area. Our results suggest that octopus fisheries require more effective management strategies. The creation of marine harvest refuges may be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|Cold water {{coral reefs}} are of {{enormous}} importance {{to science and}} society, being hotspots of biodiversity, indicators of past climate and a potential source of new medicines. However, their existence is under threat from pressures including climate change and deep sea mining. In western Scotland the fishing industry poses the greatest threat due to the productivity of the waters. Previous {{studies have examined the}} potential impacts of different types of fishing gear upon cold water corals. This dissertation aimed to model potential pressure using fishing activity data in order to inform broader marine policy and conservation strategies. This was achieved by weighting each type of gear in accordance with its potential impact and combining the weighted layers to address three scenarios, revealing spatial and temporal patterns of potential pressure. The results showed that the use of less harmful gear such as nets, hooks, <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>traps</b> warrants greater concern than more destructive gear types because of their greater usage. The results also revealed that inshore reefs face greater pressure than offshore reefs, but that pressure facing offshore reefs is increasing. This could reflect the movement of fishing grounds further offshore as inshore grounds are exhausted. These results were used to recommend corals that are most, least and moderately suitable for marine protection and to produce recommendations for fishing restrictions and regulations, thus contributing towards better management of cold water corals reefs by allowing the implementation of better informed marine conservation strategies...|$|E

50|$|Fishing is a {{traditional}} occupation that has not expanded to any great extent; the catch in 2000 was 257 tons (down from 620 tons in 1990). Some exports (primarily lobsters) are made to the Netherlands Antilles and Puerto Rico; fisheries exports totaled US$245,000 in 2000. Fish is caught by traditional methods such as beach-seining, <b>pot</b> <b>and</b> <b>trap</b> fishing & hand-lining. The catch {{is not enough to}} satisfy local demand for fish. Large quantities of dried, salted and smoked fish, as well as frozen are imported from Canada and USA.|$|R

40|$|The hooded slipper lobster (Scyllarides deceptor) and Brazilian slipper lobster (S. brasiliensis) are {{commonly}} caught by fishing fleets (with double-trawling and longline <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>traps)</b> off the southeastern coast of Brazil. Their reproductive biology is poorly known {{and research on}} these 2 species would benefit efforts in resource management. This study characterized the population structure of these exploited species {{on the basis of}} sampling from May 2006 to April 2007 off the coast of Santos, Brazil. Data for the absolute fecundity, size at maturity in females, reproductive period, and morphometric relationships of the dominant species, the hooded slipper lobster, are presented. Significant differential growth was not observed between juveniles and adults of each sex, although there was a small investment of energy in the width and length of the abdomen in females and in the carapace length for males in larger animals (> 25 cm in total length [TL]). Ovigerous females were caught more frequently in shallow waters in August September than in January February, indicating a possible migration to spawn. Fecundity ranged from 55, 800 to 184, 200 eggs (mean fecundity: 115, 000 [standard deviation 43, 9381 eggs). The spawning period occurred twice a year, with a higher relative frequency between July and October, and the length at 50 % maturity for females was 25 cm TL; both these findings should be considered by resource managers. Proper management of catches of slipper lobsters is important because of the high economic value of this fishery...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the size {{selectivity}} of cod in static fishing gears such as <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>traps.</b> In this field study, floating fishing pots were equipped with 40, 45 and 50 mm square mesh escape windows in order to estimate the size selectivity of cod at different mesh sizes. Relationships between selectivity parameters and mesh size, as well as an optimal mesh size for the escape window with respect to current minimum landing size of cod in the Baltic Sea were sought. The results show that the floating pot is not only species selective when used in the Baltic Sea cod fishery, the implementation of an escape window reduced the proportion of undersized bycatch in the pots by more than 90 %. The estimated length at 50 % retention was found to be a direct function of fish body length (girth) and mesh size of the escape window, while the estimated selection range remained unchanged regardless of mesh size. Optimal mesh size, with respect to the length at 50 % retention and current minimal landing size of 38 cm in the Baltic, was determined to be 45 mm. Strong indications (significant on the 0. 01 probability level in the case of 50 and 40 mm escape windows) suggested that the relative fishing power of the pots increased with the implementation of an escape window. This result could be explained as a "saturation effect", i. e. the probability of cod entering the pot is likely to be negatively dependent on cod density in the pot. The high species selectivity and the low catch rate of undersized fish have consolidated the floating pots position as a highly benign fishing method and the foremost alternative gear for the future coastal cod fishery in the Baltic Sea.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need {{to take into account}} a “mixed fisheries” approach in management, assessment and sampling of fish stocks. To do this effectively it is necessary for groups of fishing trips with homogeneous fishing patterns or tactics to be defined into métiers. Presented here is the result of an Irish case study analysis in applying multivariate statistics to declared logbook landings to define Irish fleet métiers operating in the Irish Sea. Established multivariate statistical procedures, a combination of factorial and cluster analysis, were applied to five variables; landing profile, vessel length category, gear, mesh size range and month. The investigation has shown this methodology to be a suitable tool in identifying métiers without prior assumptions and enabled data to be described from a multivariate statistical perspective providing useful and informative results. In total twenty-two métiers were identified and defined from 2003 landings data, and a further 5 groups were formed to include trips which could not be assigned to a métier. Definitions were applied to 2003 - 2005 landings and effort data to examine their dynamics and stability. The dominant métier (in terms of effort and trips) contained high proportions of landed Nephrops taken by bottom otter trawlers using 70 - 89 mm meshes. The effort in this métier was fairly stable over time. The greatest increases in effort and trip allocation occurred within métiers employing <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>traps</b> for crustacean species. A small number of minor métiers (in terms of landings and effort) became obsolete over the three years examined. The effects of recent management measures are likely to have contributed to declines in the numbers of trips and effort in some métiers. For example, days-at-sea, limited mobile gears such as bottom otter trawls and beam trawls with ≥ 100 mm mesh, have declined. Such changes within métiers over recent years have contributed to a deeper understanding of fleet dynamics in the Irish Sea. This analysis has identified and highlighted a segment of polyvalent Irish fishing vessels, which move between several métiers within a year. The definition of métiers can be used to enhance the Irish sampling programme in the Irish Sea by developing a finer scale, métier based, stratification of sampling. This in turn enables increased precision and robustness of national assessment data thus improving assessments and management advice. Defining métiers will prove advantageous in developing mixed fisheries assessments and advice. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E
40|$|Tese de Doutoramento, Ciências do Mar, da Terra e do Ambiente, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2015 The {{following}} PhD dissertation presents {{information on}} biological, ecological, socioeconomical and governmental {{aspects of the}} fishery of the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris), captured by <b>pot</b> <b>and</b> <b>trap</b> fishing fleets {{in the region of}} Algarve (Portugal), in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The thesis work has been divided into two parts, Part One and Part Two. Part One addresses the fishery dynamics of the common octopus and its relationship with the life cycle of the species, especially those aspects concerning key reproductive stages such as spawning, para-larvae and fishing recruitment, and also its relationship with the environment. Part Two analyses the management of the fishery of the common octopus currently in force in Portugal, particularly in the Algarvian region. A series of workshops were held with stakeholders from this fishery, such as fishermen, scientists and government officials, with the purpose of discussing management approaches aimed to improve this fishery, for example the implementation of a seasonal closure {{in order to protect the}} reproduction of the species. Part One is sub-divided into two chapters, Chapter Two and Chapter Three, which precede the introduction or Chapter One. Chapter One gives an overview of the octopus fisheries around the world, the life cycle of the species and how it affects the management of the fishery, and challenges faced by the fishers and industry. Chapter Two emerges from the necessity of the fishermen to establish the time of the year that is deemed most suitable for implementing a ban on the fishery of the common octopus, in order to protect its reproduction and recruitment. This chapter aims to explain the relationship between the dynamics of the fishery and the octopus's life cycle. By means of multivariate statistical analysis of the last 25 years of data from fishing landing records at 12 main ports of the region, the most important factors linking the fishery dynamics of the octopus and its biology were identified. The results were used to construct an life cycle figure that can be used by fishermen, scientists, students, government officials, among others as a quick reference guide. Chapter Three investigate fishing landing data from the Port of Santa Luzia, one of the most important octopus ports in the Algarvian region. The use of statistical techniques such as Dynamic Factor Analyses (DFA) specifically intended for the analysis of time series including local oceanographic and environmental data is explored in order to find common trends and its relationship with environmental variables relevant to the selected fishing area. The results of these analyses reveal factors that affect the recruitment of the species in the Algarve. Part Two is sub-divided also into two chapters, Chapter Four and Chapter Five. Chapter Four begins with a description of the current socio-economic situation and governance model of the <b>pot</b> <b>and</b> <b>trap</b> octopus fisheries in the country. Using a time line approach, a retrospective of the evolution of this fishery during the last 50 years was developed. Common challenges associated with the steady increase of this fishery were identified. Chapter Five analyses ideas debated at seven participatory workshops, held between 2014 and 2015, on the management of the <b>pot</b> <b>and</b> <b>trap</b> octopus fishery in the Algarvian region. In these meetings, stakeholders (fishermen, marine biology researchers, scientists, representatives of government bodies and public institution, university students, among others) discussed proposals aimed to address current challenges, improve the management of the fishery of this resource, and develop a comanagement model that benefits all parties involved in the activity. These proposals were summarized in a handbook that is included as an annex at the end of this PhD dissertation. This paper concludes in Chapter Six with a general discussion about previous chapters and future research that are considered necessary as a result of this work...|$|R
