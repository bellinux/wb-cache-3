5000|$|On April 9, Lindsey {{posted on}} her PledgeMusic account three teaser {{pictures}} of the upcoming [...] "Shatter Me" [...] music video, only the persons who had pre-ordered the album had access to this images. A week later the [...] "Shatter Me - Studio Behind The Scenes" [...] video was released in which Lindsey talked about recording with the musician and singer Lzzy Hale {{and how did they}} finish knowing each other. Fragments of the song could be heard for moments in the video. On April 18th Lindsey posted on her <b>Pledge</b> <b>account</b> a video of herself having prosthetic makeup for her second single-music video. The single was released on iTunes on April 21st but it wasn't until two days later that the music video was released on YouTube.|$|E
40|$|In {{the large}} LHC {{experiments}} {{the majority of}} computing resources are provided by the participating countries. These resource <b>pledges</b> <b>account</b> {{for more than three}} quarters of the total available computing. The experiments are asked to give indications of their requests three years in advance and to evolve these as the details and constraints become clearer. In this presentation we will discuss the resource planning techniques used in CMS to predict the computing resources several years in advance. We will discuss how we attempt to implement the activities of the computing model in spreadsheets and formulas to calculate the needs. We will talk about how those needs are reflected in the 2012 running and how the planned long shutdown of the LHC in 2013 and 2014 impact the planning process and the outcome. In the end we will speculate on the computing needs in the second major run of LHC...|$|R
50|$|The pledgee has {{a common}} law {{power of sale}} {{in the event of}} a default on the secured {{obligations}} which arises if the secured obligations are not satisfied by the agreed time (or, in default of agreement, within a reasonable period of time). If the power of sale is exercised, then the holder of the <b>pledge</b> must <b>account</b> to the pledgor for any surplus after payment of the secured obligations.|$|R
40|$|In banking {{practice}} the pledge {{plays an important}} role, it {{is often used to}} denote the pledge agreement, as well asthe real right that {{is the result of the}} pledge agreement conclusion and the good that is the object of the pledge. Thepledge is the only real security interest in the range of bank guarantees. Actually, each obligation can beguaranteed by the pledging. Assets diversification and trade needs have led to the development of a new pledgeform. Anyway, regardless of the number and content of the economic material, the licensed banks from the Republicof Moldova attach importance to the correctness of <b>pledge</b> <b>accounting</b> taking into account the deadline. Thus, thisresearch aims to present the <b>accounting</b> of the <b>pledged</b> assets passed to the licensed banks from the Republic ofMoldova for the repayment of the granted loan, taking into account the enforcement of the obligation secured by thepledge deadline, the right to possession of the pledged asset and not the least of its value. In the research there wasmainly used the method of monographic study applying elements of observation, selection, induction and deduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{validity}} of the <b>pledge</b> over bank <b>accounts</b> {{was one of the}} controversial issues of the late 1990 s. Lord Hoffmann's speech in the BCCI No 8 appeal resolved many of the difficulties for England and Wales. The writer examines their validity and utility in Scots law, particularly in view of the liberal insolvency set-off regime in Scotland...|$|R
30|$|For example, in the <b>accounts</b> {{receivable}} <b>pledging</b> service, a {{small enterprise}} plan to <b>pledge</b> its <b>account</b> receivable {{to a bank}} {{in order to obtain}} funds. When the small enterprise is the supplier of a leading enterprise with high credit level, the bank is more willing to accept this financing request. Because the account receivable is paid off by a high credit level enterprise. So the authenticity of the trading background and the trade relationship between SMEs and leading enterprises has significant influence on the credit risk. However, there is very little research on credit risk management in SCF. Therefore, it is of practical significance to analyze SME credit risk from the viewpoint of SCF.|$|R
40|$|Studies and Correspondence of the priests-to-be of the Bohemian Brethren in 1610 - 1618 Markéta Růčková Two wooden {{boxes were}} found during the {{reconstruction}} of the former Minorite monastery Na Karmeli at Mladá Boleslav in 2006. The boxes concealed the so-called Archives of Matouš Konečný. The Archives contained documents that originated in the office of, or were addressed to, one of the four bishops of the Bohemian Brethren, Matouš Konečný (1569 - 1622), whose seat was at Mladá Boleslav. A significant part of the discovery consists of correspondence addressed to Bishop Konečný. A substantial part of the correspondence are documents related to the dispatch of young aspiring Brethren priests for study at educational institutions abroad. Along with letters of the students themselves, sent from Bremen and Beuthen an der Oder (Bytom Odrzański in Poland), where the young men attended academic grammar schools (gymnasia illustria), the boxes contain the students' <b>pledges</b> and <b>accounts</b> of their expenditures. The students' reports are supplemented with the correspondence of their teachers. The collection of letters from students and teachers as well as other documents being thus thematically delimited, our principal objective was to perform an analysis of their content and to prepare an edition of the documents [...] . ...|$|R
30|$|Research on SCF {{credit risk}} in China is mainly {{divided into two}} categories. One {{is the study of}} the causes, features, and {{prevention}} measures of SME credit risk in SCF. Domestic scholars Yang (2007), Chang and Wang (2008), and Wan (2008) studied the risks that banks and other financial institutions are facing in SCF mode including credit risk, operational risks, etc. Wan (2008) conducted an extensive-form game model to illustrate that the risk avoidance mechanism of SCF is likely to fail. The other category of research is the SME credit risk assessment model in SCF services. Domestic scholars Chen and Sheng (2013) constructed an SCF credit risk evaluation index system, which used moral factors, ability factors, and capital factors as second level indicators, and used SME credit levels and leading enterprise credit levels, SME operations, profitability, solvency, development abilities, and the <b>pledge</b> of <b>accounts</b> receivables as the third level indicators. In addition, a multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model was constructed to analyze a single enterprise. Xiong et al. (2009) constructed a binary logistic regression model for SCF credit risk assessment using 102 listed companies’ financial data and qualitative indicator data arising from random simulation. The empirical research improved the objectivity and science in the evaluation process to a certain extent, but was subject to the limitations of large sample requirements. Moreover, the prediction accuracy of a binary logistic regression model is not sufficiently strong for banks (Chen and Huang 2002). Consequently, simulated data has been utilized in this paper and will be discussed in the methodology and results sections.|$|R
25|$|Nationally, {{chapters}} of all fraternities existing {{at the start}} of the new century were wooed into increasingly expansive building projects in the boom years leading up to the Great Depression. The economic downturn became the great leveler; chapters who had extended themselves beyond their means were felled by sharply reduced revenues and growing debt. Within Phi Sig, closely tied as it was to its graduates, alumni were called in to support weakened balance sheets on buildings the undergraduate population alone could no longer afford. In one famous but probably not unique case, chapter advisor Sam Gale went door to door in 1931, successfully seeking alumni backing against the mortgage of Minnesota's newly built Tudor masterpiece. Not only was this impulse acted on at the alumni level: The Fraternity's undergraduate delegates, moved by the plight of their brethren, had fathered a plan at the 1930 Convention that channeled 25 cents each month from each active member (about $10 per month, per man, in 2013 dollars) into a fund to assist chapters stricken by the Depression; the principal of mutual helpfulness could not have been better illustrated. Low manpower, too, had brought about fraternal belt-tightening where possible, while still investing in tactical, significant national services - training in rushing techniques, a <b>pledge</b> manual, better <b>accounting</b> systems and visits by field representatives.|$|R
6000|$|A great {{difference}} of opinion has been expressed by learned men as to whether Bunyan's account of himself is to be understood literally, as it respects his bad conduct before his conversion, or whether he views himself through a glass, by which his evil habits are magnified. No one can doubt his perfect honesty. He plainly narrates his bad, {{as well as his}} redeeming qualities; nor does his narrative appear to be exaggerated. He {{was the son of a}} travelling tinker, probably a gipsy, 'the meanest and most despised rank in the land'; when, alarmed at his sins, recollection that the Israelites were once the chosen people of God, he asked his father, whether he was of that race; as if he thought that his family were of some peculiar people, and it was easy for such a lad to blend the Egyptians with the Israelitish race. When he was defamed, his slanderers called him a witch, or fortune teller, a Jesuit, a highwayman, or the like. Brought up to his father's trade, with his evil habits unchecked, he became a very depraved lad; and when he states his sad character, it is with a solemn <b>pledge</b> that his <b>account</b> is strictly true. Probably, with a view to the full gratification of his sinful propensities, he entered the army, and served among the profligate soldiers of Charles I at the siege of Leicester.[2] ...|$|R
50|$|Phi Sig did {{not escape}} the Great Depression; no fraternal order did.

Nationally, chapters of all fraternities existing {{at the start of the}} new century were wooed into increasingly expansive building projects in the boom years leading up to the Great Depression.
