40|$|We {{introduce}} a new Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach designed for efficient sampling of highly correlated and multimodal <b>posteriors.</b> Parallel tempering, though effective, is a costly technique for sampling such <b>posteriors.</b> Our approach minimizes the use of parallel tempering, only using it {{for a short time}} to tune a new jump proposal. For complex <b>posteriors</b> we find efficiency improvements up to a factor of ~ 13. The estimation of parameters of gravitational-wave signals measured by ground-based detectors is currently done through Bayesian inference with MCMC one of the leading sampling methods. <b>Posteriors</b> for these signals are typically multimodal with strong non-linear correlations, making sampling difficult. As we enter the advanced-detector era, improved sensitivities and wider bandwidths will drastically increase the computational cost of analyses, demanding more efficient search algorithms to meet these challenges...|$|R

40|$|Keyword {{spotting}} (or spoken term detection) is {{an interesting}} task in Music Information Retrieval {{that can be applied}} to a number of problems. Its purposes include topical search and improvements for genre classification. Keyword spotting is a well-researched task on pure speech, but state-of-the-art approaches cannot be easily transferred to singing because phoneme durations have much higher variations in singing. To our knowledge, no keyword spotting system for singing has been presented yet. We present a keyword spotting approach based on keyword-filler Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and test it on a-capella singing and spoken lyrics. We test Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficents (MFCCs), Perceptual Linear Predictive Features (PLPs), and Temporal Patterns (TRAPs) as front ends. These features are then used to generate phoneme <b>posteriors</b> using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on speech data. The phoneme <b>posteriors</b> are then used as the system input. Our approach produces useful results on a-capella singing, but depend heavily on the chosen keyword. We show that results can be further improved by training the MLP on a-capella data. We also test two post-processing methods on our phoneme <b>posteriors</b> before the keyword spotting step. First, we average the <b>posteriors</b> of all three feature sets. Second, we run the three concatenated <b>posteriors</b> through a fusion classifier...|$|R

5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) {{lies in the}} <b>posterior</b> part of the articular {{region of}} the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the <b>posterior</b> {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the <b>posterior</b> wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the <b>posterior</b> hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the <b>posterior</b> notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E

30|$|Several score {{normalization}} {{and system}} combination approaches {{were presented in}} [91]. Score normalization based on term-dependent thresholding, rank normalization and mapping back to <b>posteriors,</b> sum-to-one normalization, and machine learning. The term-dependent thresholding simply re-scores the detection by considering the confidence scores of all the detections of the given term in the ATWV formulation. The rank normalization {{is based on the}} false alarm rate for the given term as score normalization value for each term detection. The mapping back to <b>posteriors</b> approach relies on the average <b>posteriors</b> of the detections of all the terms except that being detected that are ranked in the same position within the detection list for the given term. The sum-to-one approach normalizes the score of the detection by the sum of all the scores of the detections of the given term. The machine learning approach is based on a linear model by applying the Powell’s method [76] to maximize ATWV performance from several input features (e.g., rank normalization, mapping back to <b>posteriors,</b> term length, etc.). System combination merged the detections from different STD systems that rely on different approaches (e.g., GMM-based and DNN-based HMMs) and combined the detection scores from Powell’s method.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} the distributed fusion of multi-object <b>posteriors</b> in the labeled random finite set filtering framework, using Generalized Covariance Intersection (GCI) method. Our analysis shows that GCI fusion with labeled multi-object densities strongly relies on label consistencies between local multi-object <b>posteriors</b> at different sensor nodes, and hence suffers from a severe performance degradation when perfect label consistencies are violated. Moreover, we mathematically analyze this phenomenon from the perspective of Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information and the so called yes-object probability. Inspired by the analysis, we propose a novel and general solution for the distributed fusion with labeled multi-object densities that is robust to label inconsistencies between sensors. Specifically, the labeled multi-object <b>posteriors</b> are firstly marginalized to their unlabeled <b>posteriors</b> which are then fused using GCI method. We also introduce a principled method to construct the labeled fused density and produce tracks formally. Based on the developed theoretical framework, we present tractable algorithms for the family of generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filters including δ-GLMB, marginalized δ-GLMB and labeled multi-Bernoulli filters. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed distributed fusion algorithm are demonstrated in challenging tracking scenarios via numerical experiments. Comment: 17 pages, 23 figure...|$|R
