40|$|The use {{of natural}} plant biostimulants is {{proposed}} as an innovative solution to address the challenges to sustainable agriculture, to ensure optimal nutrient uptake, crop yield, quality, and tolerance to abiotic stress. However, the process of selection and characterization of <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulant</b> matrices is complex and involves a series of rigorous evaluations customized {{to the needs of}} the plant. Here, we propose a highly differentiated <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulant</b> development and production platform, which involves a combination of technology, processes, and know-how. Chemistry, biology and omic concepts are combined/integrated to investigate and understand the specific mode(s) of action of bioactive ingredients. The proposed approach allows to predict and characterize the function of natural compounds as biostimulants. By managing and analyzing massive amounts of complex data, it is therefore possible to discover, evaluate and validate new product candidates, thus expanding the uses of existing products to meet the emerging needs of agriculture...|$|E
30|$|The {{industry}} {{definition of}} biostimulants was originally proposed in 2012 and stated: “Plant biostimulants contain substance(s) and/or microorganisms whose function {{when applied to}} plants or the rhizosphere is to stimulate natural processes to enhance/benefit nutrient uptake, nutrient efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stress, and crop quality. Biostimulants have no direct action against pests, and therefore do not fall within the regulatory framework of pesticides”. Biostimulants were loosely defined {{for a long time}} and often regarded dubiously because of their aggregate nature and the inherent difficulty to determine which specific components were making beneficial contributions. The definition proposed by du Jardin [1] “A <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulant</b> is any substance or microorganism applied to plants with the aim to enhance nutrition efficiency, abiotic stress tolerance and/or crop quality traits, regardless of its nutrients content” represents the clearest and most concise way to define biostimulants.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulant</b> is any {{substance}} or microorganism {{applied to}} plants {{with the aim}} to enhance nutrition efficiency, abiotic stress tolerance and/or crop quality traits, regardless of its nutrients content. By extension, plant biostimulants also designate commercial products containing mixtures of such substances and/or microorganisms. The definition proposed by this article is supported by arguments related to the scientific knowledge about the nature, modes of action and types of effects of biostimulants on crop and horticultural plants. Furthermore, the proposed definition aims at contributing to the acceptance of biostimulants by future regulations, especially in the EU, drawing the lines between biostimulants and fertilisers, pesticides or biocontrol agents. Many biostimulants improve nutrition and they do so regardless of their nutrients contents. Biofertilisers, which we propose as a subcategory of biostimulants, increase nutrient use efficiency and open new routes of nutrients acquisition by plants. In this sense, microbial biostimulants include mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi, bacterial endosymbionts (like Rhizobium) and Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria. Thus, microorganisms applied to plants can have a dual function of biocontrol agent and of biostimulant, and the claimed agricultural effect will be instrumental in their regulatory categorization. The present review gives {{an overview of the}} definition and concept of plant biostimulants, as well as the main categories. This paper will also briefly describe the legal and regulatory status of biostimulants, with a focus on the EU and the US, and outlines the drivers, opportunities and challenges of their market development...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a new <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulant</b> composition, containing low doses of sodium selenate, glycine betaine and a spray adjuvant. We performed an experiment to test the influence of treatments with this new biostimulant composition, on cabbage and cauliflower crops, cultivated under normal watered and water stress conditions. We aimed to prove that an efficient technology of protective biofortification with selenium of crops would solve two technical problems of cruciferous cultivation into a semi-arid area, with selenium soil deficit: (i) safety supplementation of food chain and, concomitant, (ii) enhanced water use efficiency. Normal watered plants were irrigated {{at a rate of}} 100 % crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Water stressed cabbage and cauliflower plants were irrigated under deficit conditions, at a 75 % ETc. Six different treatments, including the new biostimulant composition and its ingredients, separate and/or in combination, were applied on cabbage and cauliflower, in a field experiment, organised in split plot design, with three replications. The treatments were applied by foliar spraying, 3 weeks and 6 weeks after seedlings transplantation in the field. During vegetation, physiological parameters (chlorophyll a fluorescence and stomatal conductance) were assayed. After harvesting, yield parameters were determined, for each treatment applied to both normal watered and water stressed plants. We calculated the water use efficiency as ratio between the marketable yield and the water used. We tested in field conditions this new biostimulant composition, which allows to obtain, under conditions of moderate water stress, a marketable production {{similar to that of the}} normal watered crop. Physiological parameters demonstrated also enhanced water-use efficiency on cabbage and cauliflower treated with the new biostimulant composition, containing sodium selenate, betaine and spraying adjuvant based on ethyl rapeseedate...|$|E

The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of different N levels and ways of biostimulant application on genotypes growth of wheat, tall and semi dwarf. The experiment was carried out, in 2010, at greenhouse located in Rothamsted Research Institute, Harpenden – United Kingdom. The design was in randomized blocks, with four replications. The experiment was a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement consisting by three ways of application using a commercial biostimulant and two N levels provided by nutritive solution and two spring wheat genotypes (Green – tall and Red – semi dwarf). Isolated effect of biostimulant use was not observed on fresh matter and dry matter of aboveground part and root; however, N levels affected same variables, except root dry matter. A significant interaction between biostimulant and N was observed on dry matter of aboveground part. No significant results were found for length, surface, diameter and volume of root after biostimulant application and different N levels in Green and Red genotypes. Seed treatment and leaf spray with biostimulant did not promoted effects on N and C content in aboveground part and root for tall or dwarf wheat; on the other hand, significant differences were observed when N was applied through nutritive solution. Biostimulant application did not promoted increase on growth, N and C content of aboveground part, metabolites production and components of wheat production.

A promising tool would be the use of substances and/or microorganisms defined also as ‘biostimulants’ able to enhance crop quality parameters, nutrient efficiency and abiotic stress tolerance. Protein hydrolysates (PHs) are an important group of <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulants</b> based on a mixture of peptides and amino acids that have received increasing attention in the recent years due to their positive effects on crop performances.

TJ 40 were tested for efficacy against R. solani disease and for their biostimulant effects on bean plants, in growth chamber experiments, and for their direct effect on the pathogen growth, through in vitro experiments. In growth chamber experiments, EM- 5 Sutociu was applied to seed (Sut/Se), substrate (Sut/S) and leaf (Sut/L) many times, EM Bokashi 2 -fi to substrare (Bok/S) once and combined with Sut, T 22 and TJ 40 were applied once to substrate. The pathogen was inoculated to substrate at seeding time (first experiment) or at seedling phase (second experiment). Under our experimental conditions, Bok/S+Sut/S+Sut/L, Sut/S+Sut/L, Sut/Se+Sut/S+Sut/L and T 22, in the first experiment, and all treatments, {{with the exception of}} Bok/S applied alone in the second experiment, gave significantly disease severity reduction and increase of dry weight and leaf area with respect to the infected control.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop instrumental protocols for evaluating physicochemical characteristics of plant biostimulant/biofertiliser formulations. Six formulations (Rygex, Algavyt, Ryzoset, Manek, Ecoryg and Algavyt Zn/Mn) containing algal/plant extracts, humic and amino acids, lipids and inorganic components were assessed for particle size distribution and zeta potential (ZP) by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and gross compositional differences by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Results: The six commercial formulations were assessed by mung bean root and wheat leaf senescence bioassays to determine auxin- and cytokinin-like activities. Among them, Rygex, Manek and Ecoryg showed significant auxin-like activities compared to the other formulations. Only Manek showed very low cytokinin-like activity. In combination, the four instrumental techniques highlighted gross differences in the particle sizes, ZP and compositions of the products, and provided key results on the physicochemical characteristics of the formulations including potential stability of the products. Conclusion: The three techniques (TGA, FTIR and Py-GC/MS) require no sample preparation beyond drying of the materials. The activities of the plant growth hormones have been compared to show advantages of the growth hormone bioassay methods for selecting better formulations.

Amino acid based products are one example of biostimulants with a complex composition and different product characteristics depending on their sources and production processes. Amino acid biostimulants are obtained mainly by chemical or enzymatic protein hydrolysis and the type of hydrolysis determine the content of free amino acids and their enantiomeric purity. While L-amino acids are biologically active, the application of D-amino acids has even shown deleterious. With the aim to highlight different quality compositions of amino acid biostimulants a comprehensive chiral analysis of different types of hydrolyzed protein biostimulants was performed. Results confirmed the high purity in L-amino acids in products obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis as well as a high racemization rate for those obtained through a chemical hydrolysis. Furthermore the application of the commercial biostimulant Terra-Sorb® Foliar with L-amino acids shows multiple agronomic effects such as the improvement of the photosynthetic process and the enhancement of crop tolerance to stress. A proteomic approach in wheat plants was undertaken in order to understand which molecular mechanisms are involved in the stimulating effect of the product.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition of}} water-soluble lignins isolated from four non-food bioenergy crops (cardoon CAR, eucalyptus EUC, and two black poplars RIP and LIM) was characterized in detail, {{and their potential}} bioactivity towards maize germination and early growth evaluated. Lignins were found to not affect seed germination rates, but stimulated the maize seedling development, though to a different extent. RIP promoted root elongation, while CAR only stimulated the length of lateral seminal roots and coleoptile, and LIM improved only the coleoptile development. The most significant bioactivity of CAR was related to its large content of aliphatic OH groups, C-O carbons and lowest hydrophobicity, as assessed by (31) P-NMR and (13) C-CPMAS-NMR spectroscopies. Less bioactive RIP and LIM lignins were similar in composition, but their stimulation of maize seedling was different. This was accounted to their diverse content of aliphatic OH groups and S- and G-type molecules. The poorest bioactivity of the EUC lignin was attributed to its smallest content of aliphatic OH groups and largest hydrophobicity. Both these features may be conducive of a EUC conformational structure tight enough to prevent its alteration by organic acids exuded from vegetal tissues. Conversely the more labile conformational arrangements of the other more hydrophilic lignin extracts promoted their bioactivity by releasing biologically active molecules upon the action of exuded organic acids. Our findings indicate that water-soluble lignins from non-food crops may be effectively used as <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulants,</b> thus contributing to increase the economic and ecological liability of bio-based industries...|$|R

Treatments included biostimulants based on amino acids in four formulations, Aminolforte, Kadostim, Humiforte, and Fosnutren (each of them at 0. 75 and 1. 5 L ha - 1), and application of N. P. K fertilizer as a control treatment (by applied complete fertilizer at 100 kg per hectar with proportion of 15 : 8 : 15 percentage of N:P:K in the fertilizer). Results showed that the essential oil content and its components were significantly affected by biostimulants application. The maximum content of essential oil was obtained at 1. 5 L ha - 1 Humiforte and both concentrations of Aminolforte. While, the highest content of α -pinene, 1, 8 -cineole, and camphor as major components of rosemary essential oil were obtained at 1. 5 L ha - 1 Fosnutren. In addition, the maximum content of linalool, z -pinocamphone, bornyl acetate, and caryophyllene oxide were observed at 1. 5 L ha - 1 Fosnutren. Although, the highest content of myrcene and verbenone was obtained in the treatment with N. P.

40|$|Protein hydrolyzates (PHs) are a {{well-known}} group of <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulants</b> that are obtained by thermal, chemical, enzymatic or mixed hydrolysis from animal or plant sources.

Considering {{the differences in the}} source materials and hydrolytic processes used for their production {{it is not surprising that}} PHs are a very complex and inhomogeneous category of biostimulants. This is a critical point that should be considered by both manufacturers and potential users of such products. With the aim to identify a putative correlation among PHs physic-chemical properties, the different source materials and the hydrolytic process used for their production, 22 PHs available on the market were analyzed for: (i) total amino acids concentration, (ii) free amino acids concentration, (iii) degree of racemization, (iv) degree of hydrolysis and (v) apparent average molecular size. The obtained results confirmed the inhomogeneity PHs. However, the chosen parameters were able to provide information about the above-mentioned correlation. Total amino acids in particular were useful for the identification of the original source material. The degree of racemization was useful for the identification of the type of hydrolysis used during production (chemical or enzymatic). The degree of hydrolysis and free amino acid concentrations were useful for the identification of the intensity of the hydrolytic process. The average molecular size was useful for the identification of polydispersity of the peptide size.

40|$|Plant-derived {{protein hydrolysates}} (PHs) have gained {{prominence}} as <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulants</b> {{because of their}} potential to increase the germination, productivity and quality {{of a wide range}} of horticultural and agronomic crops. Application of PHs can also alleviate the negative effects of abiotic plant stress due to salinity, drought and heavy metals. Recent studies aimed at uncovering the mechanisms regulating these beneficial effects indicate that PHs could be directly affecting plants by stimulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and interfering with hormonal activity. Indirect effects could also play a role as PHs could enhance nutrient availability in plant growth substrates, and increase nutrient uptake and nutrient-use efficiency in plants. Moreover, the beneficial effects of PHs also could be due to the stimulation of plant microbiomes. Plants are colonized by an abundant and diverse assortment of microbial taxa that can help plants acquire nutrients and water and withstand biotic and abiotic stress. The substrates provided by PHs, such as amino acids, could provide an ideal food source for these plant-associated microbes. Indeed, recent studies have provided evidence that plant microbiomes are modified by the application of PHs, supporting the hypothesis that PHs might be acting, at least in part, via changes in the composition and activity of these microbial communities. Application of PHs has great potential to meet the twin challenges of a feeding a growing population while minimizing agriculture’s impact on human health and the environment. However, to fully realize the potential of PHs, further studies are required to shed light on the mechanisms conferring the beneficial effects of these products, as well as identify product formulations and application methods that optimize benefits under a range of agro-ecological conditions...|$|R

These so-called `humic-acids ` {{are likely to be}} the first descrided fer-tilizer with biostimulant proprieties, as we know to-day. However, since they were the result of an incu-bation with soil microrganisms, they differ from the humic acids modern concept.

Moreover, several works showing crop yield enhancement by biostimulants, have not ac-cessed the mode of action of such a products (for a review see Calvo et al., 2014). Many biostimulants categories have been tested, including: bacterial or microbial inoculants, biochemical materials, amino acids, humic substances and seaweed extracts. However, most of these products required miner-al fertilizer amendments to provide relevant plant production improvements in field conditions.

To establish the reasons for low grain yield we studied pollen, embryo sacs, embryos, counted stigmas with compatible pollen and with compatible pollen tubes, and recorded seed set under semi-controlled conditions with open access of pollinators. We also sought to improve seed yield via exogenous application of eight biostimulants at the beginning of flowering. Pin pollen supply to Thrum stigmas was low, due to the imbalance of flower morphs. This did not affect seed set or male success in either flower morph. The pollen of Pin or Thrum was highly viable (97. 9 - 99. 9 %) in all studied cultivars and strains, germinating well on compatible stigmas. The female success of both flower types was much lower; 49 - 59 % of the ovules exhibited signs of degeneration (whole flower buds, ovules only) or abortion (mature embryo sacs, proembryos, embryos); the highest share of mature embryo sac abortions resulted from degeneration of synergids or the whole egg apparatus.

Plants were sprayed with PH at weekly intervals with a solution containing 2. 5 ml L(- 1) of PH. Lettuce plants were grown in sand culture and supplied with three nutrient solutions: standard, saline (25 mM NaCl) or alkaline (10 mM NaHCO 3 + 0. 5 g l(- 1) CaCO 3; pH 8. 1). Salt stress triggered a decrease in fresh yield, biomass production, SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf mineral composition and increased leaf proline concentration, without altering antioxidant enzyme activities. The decrease in marketable yield and biomass production under alkali stress was not significant. Irrespective of nutrient solution, the application of Tablet and especially Tablet + PH increased fresh marketable yield, shoot and root dry weight. This was associated with an improvement in SPAD index, Fv/Fm ratio, CAT and GPX activities and a better nutritional status (higher P, K, and Fe and lower Na with NaCl and higher P and Fe with NaHCO 3) via an increase of total root length and surface. The combination of microbial biostimulant with foliar application of PH synergistically increased the marketable fresh yield by 15. 5 and 46. 7 % compared to the Tablet-treated and untreated plants, respectively. The improved crop performance of Tablet + PH application was attributed to a better root system architecture (higher total root length and surface), an improved chlorophyll synthesis and an increase in proline accumulation.

The theoretical background of thermal imaging, in particular the relationship between leaf temperature and stomatal conductance, was thoroughly reviewed by Cohen et al.

Although imaging-guided expert systems are widely used in medicine (Egger 2013) and agriculture (Ishimwe et al. 2014), there is a gap in applications of real-time thermal imaging in plant physiology. As to our knowledge, thermal imaging has not been applied to study the stress-response of <b>plants</b> treated with <b>biostimulants,</b> such as seaweed extracts.|$|R
30|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that active {{molecules}} contained in biostimulants can promote nitrogen assimilation through stimulation of the activity and transcription of N assimilation and Krebs’ cycle enzymes [7 - 11]. Furthermore, the induction of the metabolic pathway associated with the synthesis of phenylpropanoids in <b>plants</b> treated with <b>biostimulants</b> may explain why these products can help plants to overcome stress situations [14, 15]. In particular, a protein hydrolyzate-based fertilizer obtained from alfalfa hydrolyzate plants (AH) was proved to help maize plants to overcome salinity stress through stimulation of enzymes functioning in nitrogen metabolism, enhancement of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity and transcription, and increase of flavonoid synthesis [16]. PAL is an important enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of phenolics by converting phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and tyrosine to p-coumaric acid, opening {{the way to the}} secondary metabolism. The biostimulant activity of AH was related to the presence of triacontanol (TRIA) and indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), two important regulators of plant metabolism [15].|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In recent years, {{the use of}} biostimulants in {{sustainable}} agriculture has been growing. Biostimulants {{can be obtained from}} different organic materials and include humic substances (HS), complex organic materials, beneficial chemical elements, peptides and amino acids, inorganic salts, seaweed extracts, chitin and chitosan derivatives, antitranspirants, amino acids and other N-containing substances. The application of <b>biostimulants</b> to <b>plants</b> leads to higher content of nutrients in their tissue and positive metabolic changes. For these reasons, the development of new biostimulants has become a focus of scientific interest. Among their different functions, <b>biostimulants</b> influence <b>plant</b> growth and nitrogen metabolism, especially because of their content in hormones and other signalling molecules. A significant increase in root hair length and density is often observed in <b>plants</b> treated with <b>biostimulants,</b> suggesting that these substances induce a “nutrient acquisition response” that favors nutrient uptake in plants via an increase in the absorptive surface area. Furthermore, biostimulants positively influence the activity and gene expression of enzymes functioning in the primary and secondary plant metabolism. This article reviews the current literature on two main classes of biostimulants: humic substances and protein-based biostimulants. The characteristic of these biostimulants and their effects on plants are thoroughly described...|$|R
40|$|Early blight {{of tomato}} is a fungal disease, caused by Alternaria solani (Ellis and Martin) Jones and Grout, {{is a major}} disease of Solanaceae. Therefore, for {{commercial}} cultivation in the field controlling early blight is necessary. The use of natural compounds as alternatives or complements to chemical fungicides would be helpful because the crops require continued prolonged harvesting, during which young unsprayed leaf tissue continuously become available for infestation. Several natural compounds were tested on tomato plants grown under field condition and natural infestation to evaluate the potential of biostimulants on improving tomato plant growth, yield and to induce protection from early blight disease. Foliar application of chitosan (Chit), humic acid (HA), seaweed extract (SE) and thiamine (Thi) proved {{to be effective in}} reducing early blight disease incidence in tomato <b>plants.</b> All tested <b>biostimulants,</b> in particular, thiamine significantly increased tomato growth parameters (shoot length, no. of branches and leaves per plant, shoot fresh and dry weight and leaf area per plant) and some physiological aspects (nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and chlorophyll as well as total carbohydrate content) in the shoot. In addition, tomato yield/fed was also increased. Thi at 50 mg L - 1 and SE at 500 mg L - 1 were the most effective in this concern.

40|$|Agricultural growing {{practices}} have been evolving towards organic, sustainable or environmental friendly systems. The aim of modern agriculture {{is to reduce}} inputs without reducing the yield and quality. These goals {{can be achieved by}} breeding programmes but would be species specific and time consuming. The identification of organic molecules able to activate plant metabolism may allow an improvement in plant performance {{in a short period of}} time and in a cheaper way. <b>Biostimulants</b> are <b>plant</b> extracts and contain a wide range of bioactive compounds that are mostly still unknown. These products are usually able to improve the nutrient use efficiency of the plant and enhance tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this review, the state of the art and future prospects for biostimulants are reported and discussed. Moreover, particular attention has been paid to intensive agricultural systems such as horticultural and floricultural crops. In vegetables, the application of biostimulants allowed a reduction in fertilizers without affecting yield and quality. In leafy vegetables susceptible to nitrate accumulation, such as rocket, biostimulants have been able to improve the quality and keep the nitrates under the limits imposed by EU regulations. Moreover in leafy vegetables, biostimulants increased leaf pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids) and plant growth by stimulating root growth and enhancing the antioxidant potential of <b>plants.</b> In floriculture, <b>biostimulants</b> used in bedding plant production stimulated the growth of plants, which reached the blooming and commercial stages earlier, thus optimizing space in the greenhouse...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Recently, {{strawberry}} growers {{have been}} mostly interested in growing cultivars for the fresh market {{because of its}} profitability, {{but on the other}} hand it requires more complicated technologies and well-educated workers. High quality of the fruit for the fresh market is an important factor attracts customers and determines their choice and prices. Fruit production cost for the fresh market needs to be calculated and efficient methods and technologies also should be taken into consideration. New environmentally friendly mineral-organic fertilizers can improve fruit quality and yield of dessert strawberry cultivars. The desired effects was obtained through the activity of fertilizer’s components, which very often belong to different groups of natural hormones, elicitors, vitamins, flavonoids, amino acids, etc. Numerous breeding programs have been aimed at improving strawberry taste and disease resistance. Three major components of fruit organoleptic quality are flavor, sweetness, and acidity. Several studies have been devoted to strawberry aroma. Fruit with intense flavor also have high titratable acidity and high soluble solids. Numerous studies have addressed strawberry sweetness and acidity. Fruit soluble solids, sugars, titratable acidity, and organic acids at maturity are quantitatively inherited. Moreover, there appears to be genetic variations for these fruit quality traits. Numerous biochemical changes are observed during strawberry development and especially during fruit ripening. The major soluble constituents of maturing and ripe strawberries are soluble sugars and organic acids. The major soluble sugars in strawberries are glucose, fructose, and sucrose. The major organic acid is citric acid. This acid contributes greatly to fruit titratable acidity, which declines gradually during fruit development. The sugar/ organic acid ratio is a major parameter of strawberry taste. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of poly hydroxyl steroids, which have been recognized as a class of plant hormones. These were first explored when Mitchell et al. (1970) reported that cell division and elongation were promoted by the treatment of organic extracts of rape (Brassica napus L.) pollen. Brassinolide (BL) was the first isolated brassinosteroid when Michael et al. (1979) isolated the biologically active molecule. Researches showed that brassinosteroids are essential for many physiological functions in plants, however little is known concerning where and when they are synthesized. In young tomato seedlings BR synthesis activity was observed mainly in apical and root tissues undergoing expansion. In flowers, synthesis activity was observed in the pedicel joints and ovaries, whereas in the fruits it was strongest during early seed development and was associated with the locular jelly and seeds. Quantitative measurements of endogenous BR indicated intense biosynthesis in developing tomato fruits, which were also found to contain high amounts of brassinolide. Moreover, brassinosteroids stimulate cell elongation and cell division, and BR has a specific effect of differentiation. Underling physiological pathways include modification of cell wall properties, effects on carbohydrate assimilation, allocation, and control of aquaporin activities. Brassinosteroids apparently coordinates and integrates diverse processes required for growth, partly via interactions with phytohormones setting the frame for BR responses. The aim of present study was investigation of the role of brassinosteroid on qualitative characteristics improvement of strawberry fruit. Materials and Methods: In this research the effect of different concentrations (0, 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1 mgl- 1) of brassinosteroid sprayat different stages of strawberry growth (30 days after planting, first blooming, green fruit, and pink fruit) on some qualitative characteristics of the strawberry Paros cultivar was considered. This experiment was conducted asfactorial on a randomized complete block design with 4 replications in greenhouse conditions. Parameters such as total soluble solid, inducing sugar, titrable acidity, anthocyanin, phenol, fruit dry weight, fruit water and vitamin C were measured after…. Results and Discussion: Results showed treated plants by brassinosteroid, compared to control, improved fruit qualitative characteristics. So, brassinosteroid application increased total soluble solid, inducing sugar, titratable acidity, anthocyanin, phenol, dry weight, vitamin C. The best effective treatment and the best spraying time was brassinosteroid at 1 mgl- 1 in pink fruit stage, respectively for qualitative characteristics improvement. Because, Brassinosteroid growth induced has been related to increase in RNA and DNA content, polymerase activity, protein synthesis carbohydrate fraction, reducing sugars, non-reducing sugars and starch. The yield increase in fruit trees may be related to improvement in the assimilation efficiency of photosynthetic carbon of the sprayed trees. The brassinosteroid application in wheat and mustard plants stimulated photosynthetic activity expressed by acceleration in CO 2 fixing, increase protein biosynthesis and in mustard, increased photosynthetic rates that were directly related to growth and seed production. In accordance, researchers explained that BRs have been shown to enhance tracheary element differentiation, stimulate membrane hyperpolarization and ATPase activity, promote ethylene biothynsesis, control microtubule orientation and alter the mechanical properties of cell walls. In addition, brassinosteroid treatment greatly stimulated accumulation of photosynthates in the treated internode. This suggests a possible mobilization role for BR in the intact plant. As well as, in persimmon, grapevine and citrus, reported that BR compound showed, the practical effects for fruit setting. While, showed that brassinolide increased fruit weight and sugar content of oranges. In passion fruit orchards, brassinosteroid increased fruit number of plant and in turn yield per hectare and soluble solids content was 1 ° Brix greater than the control. Conclusions: From this study, it is evident that the application of <b>plant</b> <b>biostimulants</b> such as brassinosteroid significantly improved qualitative characteristics. So, brassinosteroid application increased total soluble solid, inducing sugar, titrable acidity, anthocyanin, phenol, dry weight, vitamin C and effective treatment and best spraying was brassinosteroid at 1 mgl- 1 at pink fruit stage for qualitative characteristics improvement...|$|R
