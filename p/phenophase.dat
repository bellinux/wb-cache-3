40|$|Based on plant {{phenology}} {{data from}} 26 {{stations of the}} Chinese Phenology Observation Network of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the climate data, the change of plant <b>phenophase</b> in spring {{and the impact of}} climate warming on the plant <b>phenophase</b> in China for the last 40 years are analyzed. Furthermore, the geographical distribution models of <b>phenophase</b> in every decade are reconstructed, and the impact of climate warming on geographical distribution model of <b>phenophase</b> is studied as well. The results show that (i) the response of <b>phenophase</b> advance or delay to temperature change is nonlinear. Since the 1980 s, at the same amplitude of temperature change, <b>phenophase</b> delay amplitude caused by temperature decrease is greater than <b>phenophase</b> advance amplitude caused by temperature increase; the rate of <b>phenophase</b> advance days decreases with temperature increase amplitude, and the rate of <b>phenophase</b> delay days increases with temperature decrease amplitude. (ii) The geographical distribution model between <b>phenophase</b> and geographical location is unstable. Since the 1980 s, with the spring temperature increasing in the most of China and decreasing in the south of Qinling Mountains, phenophases have advanced in northeastern China, North China and the lower reaches of the Changjiang River, and have delayed {{in the eastern part of}} southwestern China and the middle reaches of the Changjiang River; while the rate of the <b>phenophase</b> difference with latitude becomes smaller...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phenophase</b> {{change is}} an {{important}} indicator of climate and natural environmental changes (Zhu, 1973; Zhang, 1985). At the beginning of 1960 s, China starts the phenology study and the Chinese Academy of Sciences built the Chinese Phenological Observation Network (CPON) (Wan, 1982). From the 1980 s to the 1990 s, several researchers undertook some preliminary studies on relative phenological events {{and the relationship of}} <b>phenophase</b> and climatic change based on the collected data (Zhang, 1995; Chen, 2001).

40|$|Global {{climate change}} is likely to alter the phenological {{patterns}} of plants due to the controlling effects of climate on plant ontogeny, especially in an urbanized environment. We studied relationships between various <b>phenophases</b> (i. e., seasonal biological events) and interannual variations of air temperature in three woody plant species (Prunus davidiana, Hibiscus syriacus, and Cercis chinensis) in the Beijing Metropolis, China, based on phenological data for the period 1962 - 2004 and meteorological data for the period 1951 - 2004. Analysis of phenology and climate data indicated significant changes in spring and autumn <b>phenophases</b> and temperatures. Changes in <b>phenophases</b> were observed for all the three species, consistent with patterns of rising air temperatures in the Beijing Metropolis. The changing phenology in the three plant species was reflected mainly as advances of the spring <b>phenophases</b> and delays in the autumn <b>phenophases,</b> but with strong variations among species and <b>phenophases</b> in response to different temperature indices. Most <b>phenophases</b> (both spring and autumn <b>phenophases)</b> had significant relationships with temperatures of the preceding months. There existed large inter- and intra-specific variations, however, in the responses of phenology to climate change.

This phenological study was performed in a young mixed forest stand situated in the Drahanská vrchovina uplands in the altitude of 625 [*]m. a. s. l. Beginnings and duration of individual <b>phenophases</b> differed in dependence on the course of weather conditions in individual years of study.

40|$|Aims Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} phenological response {{to climate change}} in Western China to understand ecological responses to climate change and evaluate phenological differences on a regional scale. We analyzed spring phenological data from 34 woody plants for the past 45 years in Xi’an. Our objectives were to determine the relationships between plant phenology and air temperature change and to explore the response of spring phenophases to abrupt climate change in Xi’an. Methods The Mann-Kendall {{test was used to}} describe the trend of temperature change and the specific point of climate change. The trends of spring phenophases were described by simple linear regression. The significance of correlation coefficients between phenophases and both temperature and precipitation were examined by t-tests. Important findings Four spring phenophases generally showed advancement, and the characters of phenological change were consistent with climate change, even abrupt climate change. Statistically significant correlation was found between the changes of spring phenophases and the temperatures of one or several months before the <b>phenophase</b> onset. The mean monthly temperature of the onset month or the prior month was the key factor impacting the spring <b>phenophase.</b> Moreover, there was a strong correlation between leaf <b>phenophase</b> and monthly precipitation of one month before the <b>phenophase</b> onset, while the correlation between flower <b>phenophase</b> andprecipitation is not obvious...|$|E

It is found that, in the region north of 33 °N (including Northeast, North China and the lower reaches of the Huaihe River), the <b>phenophase</b> advanced 1. 1 - 4. 3 days per decade for early spring and 1. 4 - 5. 4 days per decade for late spring, but {{in the eastern part}} of the southwest China it was dealyed by 2. 9 - 6. 9 days per decade in early spring and 2. 4 - 6. 2 days per decade in late spring. One outstanding feature is identified in Guangzhou in south China, where significant advance of 7. 5 days per decade in early spring and delay of 4. 6 days per decade in late spring were detected. Statistically siginficant correlation was found between the changes of spring <b>phenophase</b> and the temperatures of one or several months before the <b>phenophase</b> onset. The relationship between the trend of <b>phenophase</b> change and temperature change was highly non-linear (more sensitivity to cooling than to warming) and reached an asymptote 0. 5 °C per decade, which may have implication in the responses of the ecosystem in a future global warming scenario. In addition, we also examined the link between the spring <b>phenophase,</b> and length and mean temperature of the growing season, and the analyses suggested that they were highly correlated as well. © Springer 2006...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{several studies have}} used digital cameras and webcams to monitor green leaf phenology. Such 2 ̆ 2 near-surface 2 ̆ 2 remote sensing {{has been shown to}} be a cost {{effective}} means of accurately capturing phenology. Specifically, it allows for accurate tracking of intra- and inter-annual phenological dynamics at high temporal frequency and over broad spatial scales compared to visual observations or tower-based fAPAR and broadband NDVI measurements. Near surface remote sensing measurements therefore show promise for bridging the gap between traditional in-situ measurements of phenology and satellite remote sensing data. For this work, we examined the relationship between <b>phenophase</b> estimates derived from satellite remote sensing (MODIS) and near-earth remote sensing derived from webcams for a select set of sites with high-quality webcam data. A logistic model was used to characterize phenophases for both the webcam and MODIS data. We documented model fit accuracy, <b>phenophase</b> estimates, and model biases for both data sources. Our results show that different vegetation indices (VI 2 ̆ 7 s) derived from MODIS produce significantly different <b>phenophase</b> estimates compared to corresponding estimates derived from webcam data. Different VI 2 ̆ 7 s showed markedly different radiometric properties, and as a result, influenced <b>phenophase</b> estimates. The study shows that <b>phenophase</b> estimates are not only highly dependent on the algorithm used but also depend on the VI used by the phenology retrieval algorithm. These results highlight the need for a better understanding of how near-earth and satellite remote data relate to eco-physiological and canopy changes during different parts of the growing season...|$|E

The changes in frost risks could have significant implications for agricultural and forestry systems. In this study, we investigated whether plant <b>phenophases</b> changed at a higher or lower rate compared to potentially damaging spring frost events in the temperate monsoon area of China. Based on phenological data derived from the Chinese phenological observation network and meteorological data from 15 study sites, changes in first-leaf dates and first-flowering dates for 12 deciduous woody plants were analyzed in comparison to last-frost dates. The results show that plant <b>phenophases</b> in spring advanced by a mean trend of - 0. 17 d yr(- 1) from 1963 to 2011.

The experimental design was a randomized block with split plots and four replications. Irrigation depths based on reference evapotranspiration (8. 75 %, 17. 5 %, 26. 25 % and 35 % ETo) and a control (0 % ETo) made up the plots, while cropping systems (exclusive cropping, exclusive cropping on mulch and forage cactus-sorghum intercropping) were distributed in the subplots. Cladode emission morphogenesis was used to define the phenological phases, while the extrapolation of the monthly dry matter accumulation rate was applied to obtain the cutting time.

Estimates of <b>phenophase</b> transition dates, such as the start of spring or end of fall, {{can be derived from}} sensor-based time series, but must be interpreted in terms of biologically relevant events. We use the PhenoCam archive of digital repeat photography to implement a consistent protocol for visual assessment of canopy phenology at 13 temperate deciduous forest sites throughout eastern North America, and to perform digital image analysis for time-series-based estimation of <b>phenophase</b> transition dates. We then compare these results to remote sensing metrics of <b>phenophase</b> transition dates derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors. We present a new type of curve fit that uses a generalized sigmoid function to estimate phenology dates, and we quantify the statistical uncertainty of <b>phenophase</b> transition dates estimated using this method. Results show that the generalized sigmoid provides estimates of dates with less statistical uncertainty than other curve-fitting methods. Additionally, we find that dates derived from analysis of high-frequency PhenoCam imagery have smaller uncertainties than satellite remote sensing metrics of phenology, and that dates derived from the remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) have smaller uncertainty than those derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Near-surface time-series estimates for the start of spring are found to closely match estimates derived from visual assessment of leaf-out, as well as satellite remote-sensing-derived estimates of the start of spring. However late spring and fall phenology metrics exhibit larger differences between near-surface and remote scales. Differences in late spring phenology between near-surface and remote scales are found to correlate with a landscape metric of deciduous forest cover.

40|$|Mediterranean {{regions are}} {{projected}} to experience more frequent, prolonged and severe drought {{as a consequence of}} climate change. We used a retractable rainfall shelter, to investigate the impact of extreme droughts on the development of Quercus ilex leaves, flowers and fruit. In 2008, 97 % of rainfall was excluded from a forest plot during the autumn, representing 50 % of the 1127 mm of rain that fell during the year. In 2009, 87 % of rainfall was excluded during the spring, representing 58 % of the 749 mm that fell during the year. The rainfall shelter did not impact neither incident radiation nor air temperature. Autumn rainfall exclusion did not significantly affect leaf, flowers or fruit development. Spring rainfall exclusion resulted in larger and more sustained depression of leaf water potential during the key phases of foliar and floral development. Consequently, only half of the sampled trees (6) reached the shoot lengthening stage which leads to functionally mature leaves (<b>phenophase</b> 4), with one abandoning leaf development at budburst (<b>phenophase</b> 3) and the other two at the bud swelling stage (<b>phenophase</b> 2). All trees of the control plot passed <b>phenophase</b> 4, with most reaching complete leaf development. The impact of extreme droughts on flower development differed between the sexes. The spring exclusion had no effect on male flower, but only one of six trees completed female fruit maturation, compared with four in the control plot. The difference between the male and female drought impacts is likely attributable to the occurrence of male floral development before the period of lowest leaf water potential, and to the lower resource allocation requirements of male flowers. The information provided by our experimental approach may constitute a crucial step to evaluate the impact of increasing drought due to climate change on the most dominant Mediterranean tree species and to help drawing a full picture of the ecological consequences of the decline in water resource on forest dynamics under changing conditions...|$|E

These data could then be compared with local people's perceptions of the species’ <b>phenophases.</b> Method Collection of phenological data was carried out monthly from February 2007 to January 2009 and included activity, intensity and synchronization of reproductive and vegetative <b>phenophases.</b> Ethnobotanical data were gathered using a collaborative approach to access local people’s knowledge about the species’ phenological schedule. Results There were no significant differences in the intensity of <b>phenophases</b> among LUs, and there was a correspondence between people’s perception of <b>phenophases</b> and the phenological data collected. The data show that the different management practices for LUs did not influence the phenology of the species. Conclusion The main conclusion of this study is the use of traditional knowledge as interesting tool for rapid phenological diagnosis. However further studies need to be developed to test this tool in other environments and cultural contexts. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} {{study is}} focused on 50 years of phenological observations (1961 – 2011) of the herbs, shrubs, trees and bird populations and the phenological phases that create a continuous phenological sequence covering the whole spring aspect of the fl oodplain forest ecosystem. Th e phenological phases were observed for 5 herbs, 5 shrubs, 3 trees and 2 bird species. Th e phenological phases were observed as precisely as possible by only one observer during the whole time of observation. All observed plants and bird species showed statistically signifi cant shift s to the earlier time but the rate of shift ing among {{the parts of the}} fl ood-plain forest ecosystem was diff erent. Th e most progressive shift s were detected for herbs (the rate of shift ing was on average 13. 9 days), followed by shrubs (<b>phenophases</b> advanced by 11. 3 days on average), trees (<b>phenophases</b> advanced by 10. 2 days) and fi nally by bird species (<b>phenophases</b> advanced by 9. 6 days on average). Consequently the length of overlap of the chosen phenological phases was elaborated. Th e rate of shortening or lengthening of the overlap diff ers among all parts of the ecosystem and indicates not only the separation of <b>phenophases</b> but also no statistically signifi cant change in the length of overlap in each part of the ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Ab st r act. The {{effect of}} air {{temperature}} on variability of <b>phenophase</b> dates {{and the length}} of spring triticale interphases was investigated by means of simple linear regression analysis. An in-crease in the mean temperature in Poland observed in 1965 - 2004, the biggest for the mean tempera-ture in August (+ 0. 53 oC/ 10 years, P< 0. 01) and April (+ 0. 50 oC/ 10 years, P< 0. 01), caused significant, with P< 0. 01, acceleration of <b>phenophase</b> dates. The bigger the size of changes, the later the pheno-phase it concerned – for beginning of tillering the average acceleration of the date amounted to + 1. 8 day/ 10 years, for beginning of shooting + 3, 4 day/ 10 years, for beginning of heading + 4. 2 days / 10 years, and for wax maturity as many as + 10. 2 days / 10 years. The duration of periods of emergence-tillering and tillering-shooting in 1984 - 2004 became shortened by, respectively,- 1. 0 day/ 10 years and – 1. 5 day/ 10 years, and the period of heading-wax maturity by – 5. 9 day/ 10 years. On the basis of the generalized method of cluster analysis it was determined that the biggest yields of spring triticale crops can be obtained with earlier than average dates from sowing to beginning of heading, and close to average dates of wax maturity and harvesting, and also longer than average interphases: sowing-emergence, emergence-tillering, shooting-heading and periods: sowing-wax maturity and sowing-harvesting, and with close to average duration of periods: heading-wax maturity and wax maturity-harvesting.

40|$|Changes in {{phenology}} are {{indicators of}} climate change. Urban land use influences local climates through mechanisms such as urban heat island (UHI) effects. This research examined the spatio-temporal variations in first flowering {{with changes in}} urban land use in England and Wales. It used standard ordinary least squares (OLSs) regressions and geographically weighted regressions (GWRs) to analyse changes in <b>phenophase</b> observation date between 1934 and 2007 for three tree species. The OLS models suggested that first flowering was getting earlier: blackthorn by 0. 28 [*]days per year, hawthorn by 0. 16 [*]days per year and horse chestnut by 0. 13 [*]days per year. These rates were found to vary spatially when GWR was used and the greatest rates of change {{were found to be}} highly localized. The addition of land use change was found to improve the model fit and suggested that a 10 % increase in urban land use was also associated with <b>phenophase</b> advancement of 1. 20 [*]days for blackthorn, 0. 57 [*]days for hawthorn and 0. 90 [*]days for horse chestnut. When the impacts of urban land use changes was analysed using GWR, the associations with <b>phenophase</b> advancement were found to vary spatially, strongest associations were generally more pronounced in the north and especially in the extreme south-west and the north for all species. The results of this research suggest that the impacts of climate changes and the effects of urban land use changes on phenology vary spatially and that the impacts of urban expansion, such as UHI effects, may not be uniform. These findings suggest the need for spatially explicit analyses to quantify the local impacts and drivers of climate changes and their associated feedback...|$|E
40|$|Satellite-derived {{vegetation}} <b>phenophases</b> {{are frequently}} {{used to study}} the response of ecosystems to climate change. However, limited studies have identified the common phenological variability across different climate and vegetation zones. Using NOAA/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset, we estimated start of growing season (SOS) and end of growing season (EOS) for Chinese vegetation during the period 1982 – 2012 based on the Midpoint method. Subsequently, the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was applied to extract the main patterns of <b>phenophases</b> and their annual variability. The impact of climate parameters such as temperature and precipitation on <b>phenophases</b> was investigated using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The first EOF mode of <b>phenophases</b> exhibited widespread earlier or later SOS and EOS signals for almost the whole country. The attendant time coefficients revealed an earlier SOS between 1996 and 2008, but a later SOS in 1982 – 1995 and 2009 – 2012. Regarding EOS, it was clearly happening later in recent years, mainly after 1993. The preseason temperature contributed to such spatiotemporal phenological change significantly. The first pair of CCA patterns for phenology and preseason temperature {{was found to be}} similar and its time coefficients were highly correlated to each other (correlation coefficient > 0. 7). These results indicate that there is a substantial amount of common variance in SOS and EOS across different vegetation types that is related to large-scale modes of climate variability...|$|R
40|$|Phenology is {{the study}} of time and {{sequence}} of recurring stages in the life history of an organism. The occurrence fashions of the <b>phenophases</b> form different phenological behavior patterns. Despite the importance of phenology and wide applications of knowing <b>phenophases,</b> few studies have been done on the wooden species in Iran. The goals of this study are identification and designation of the <b>phenophases</b> occuring time and their successions, phenological behavior patterns and finally phenological patterns assay of 35 fruitful and fruitless woody species in the northeast of Esfahan during 2003 - 2005. Leaves, flowers, fruits, buds, bark and color changes were observed weekly or every other week. Analysis of the obtained charts and tables shows that with respect to the environmental and climatic condition of the area, observed phenological behavior patterns are two- leaf, two-flower and two-fruit emergent patterns; two-flower peak patterns; three-fruit perpetuity patterns; and three leaf shed patterns. Finally, there are three comparative successions, six-flower and three-leaf phenological patterns. Based on the findings, blooming and leaf shed calendars were also achieved...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To conduct {{comparative}} analysis of agro-meteo­rological elements dynamics {{over the past}} 35 years and the date and duration of main <b>phenophases</b> of plants of apple varieties to be common for Kyiv Oblast. Methods. Field, comparative, statistical ones, generalization. Results. It was established that Kyiv Oblast has experienced the steady rising of average annual temperature (by 0, 6  °С), increase of yearly precipitation (by 20 mm), considerable growth of heat supply level (by 261  °С) in the vegetation period {{that contributes to the}} changes in starting date and duration of main <b>phenophases.</b> Conclusions. A significant increase of the sum of active and effective temperatures accumulated for the last 35 -year period in Kyiv Oblast at climatological date of occurrence of certain <b>phenophases</b> in the development of apple trees, led to an earlier date of flowering (by 4 – 5 days). At the same time it did not influence the duration of this phase, but contributed to the reduction of interphase period «the end of flowering–picking maturity of fruits» by 5 – 12 days...|$|R
