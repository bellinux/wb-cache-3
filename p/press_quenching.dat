In the experiments, a rectangular blank of high strength steel sheet, SPFC 980 Y, 1. 2 mm thick, 20 mm wide and 130 mm long was used and it was resistance-heated {{with a pair of}} parallel electrodes placed 120 mm away from each other, using an AC power supply with a function of input energy control. The relationship between input energy and heating temperature was examined and then hot stamping and <b>press</b> <b>quenching</b> performances were examined. The <b>press</b> <b>quenching</b> was also experimented in hot hat-shaped bending, and the influences of the heating temperature on spring-back and hardness property were investigated. The results of the experiments revealed that hot stamping and <b>press</b> <b>quenching</b> using resistance heating are highly feasible...|$|E
40|$|Defining {{manufacturing}} tolerances {{is an important}} task for a process planner before starting production of a new product or introducing new processes. One of the more complex processes to handle is the heat treatment of gears. <b>Press</b> <b>quenching</b> is a heat treatment method where the gear is mechanically forced to keep or attain the desired geometry, with less geometrical distortions in comparison to oil bath quenching. The objective {{of this paper is}} to discover how design of experiments can be used to scrutinize <b>press</b> <b>quenching</b> of bevel gears. The first part of this investigation shows how different process parameter settings influence geometry of the bevel gear. Based on the results of the experiments, predictions and statistical simulations, the outcome of the <b>press</b> <b>quenching</b> process can be estimated. Estimations for the number of defect parts then form the basis for evaluating whether the proposed tolerances meet the quality requirements. The work is based on an industrial case where 55 bevel gear crown wheels for heavy trucks are carburized and then case hardened in a Gleason <b>press</b> <b>quenching</b> machine.

5000|$|The first type of {{cold saw}} blade, solid HSS, {{may be made}} from either M2 tool steel or M35 tool steel, alloyed with {{additional}} cobalt. Solid HSS saw blades are heat treated and hardened to 64/65 HRC for ferrous cutting applications and 58/60 HRC for non-ferrous cutting applications. This high hardness gives the cutting edges of the teeth a high resistance to heat and wear. However, this increased hardness also makes the blades brittle and not very resistant to shock. In order to produce a high quality HSS cold saw blade, you must start with very flat and properly tensioned raw material. The blades must be <b>press</b> <b>quenched</b> after hardening {{to prevent them from}} being ed. HSS saw blades are typically hollow ground for clearance during the cutting process. The term HSS doesn't necessarily mean what it implies. These blades are usually never run at surface speeds higher than 350 SFM. Solid HSS cold saw blades may be used for cutting many different shapes and types of metal including: tubes, extrusions, structural sections, billets, bars, ingots, castings, forgings etc. These blades may also be coated with special wear resistant coatings such as titanium nitride (TiN) or titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN), but are more commonly used commercially with a black Oxide coating aiding in better coolant distribution over the surface area of the cutting blade.|$|R

Research limitations/implications: The restrictions resulting from legislation force us to develop new materialsand alternative technologies. This provides a technological challenge to the scientists and engineers andincreases the importance of ecological manufacturing as a competitive factor. Practical implications: The quality of a company,s product directly affects its competitive position, profitabilityand credibility in the market. Quality assurance system must undergo a process of continuous improvement,which extends from the deployment of preventive quality assurance methods to the application of closed loopquality circuits. Originality/value: One good example of the use of alternative processes, in the case of preparation of workmaterial, is the replacement of standard method for pre-forming and heat treatment of aluminium alloys byalternative method (<b>press</b> <b>quenching).</b> The second one is the substitution of lead with tin because it is harmfulfor human organisms and environmentally not acceptable element...|$|E
40|$|Scania has {{experienced}} difficulties with large {{variations of the}} slope of the back plane after <b>press</b> <b>quenching</b> of case hardened crown wheels of especially type R 780 Steg supplied from ingot cast material. This leads to {{that a large number of}} crown wheels has to be remeasured and sorted according to back slope which is time consuming for operators. Also, after sorting of the crown wheels, hard machining has to be adjusted according to the different slopes of the back plane of the crown wheels. In some cases, it also leads to scrapping of the crown wheels. This master’s thesis was divided in two parts. The aim of the first part was to confirm that the crown wheel type and casting technique that exhibits the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg originating from ingot cast material. The crown wheel types that were compared were the R 780 Steg, R 780 Slät and R 885 Slät. Crown wheels manufactured from ingot cast material and from continuous cast material were compared. Hence, 6 combinations were examined. The slope of the back plane was measured with the measuring probe FARO after <b>press</b> <b>quenching.</b> The slope of the crown wheels was found to depend on both casting technique and the geometry of the crown wheel. The results confirmed that the crown wheel type and supplier combination that by far yields the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg supplied by Steel Plant A who uses the ingot casting technique. For this combination the variation exceeds 0, 1 mm. All other combinations of crown wheels and suppliers yield acceptable variations. The second part of this master’s thesis was composed of determining if segregations in the cast ingot are the cause of the variations in slope of the back plane of the crown wheel type R 780 Steg. This was done by measuring if there is a correlation between {{the slope of the}} back plane of the crown wheel after <b>press</b> <b>quenching,</b> the chemical composition and the original position of the crown wheel in the ingot. As in the first part of the study, the distortion was measured by the measuring probe FARO. The samples were sent to Degerfors Laboratorium for chemical analysis. Analyses of C, S and N were made by using combustion analyses. For As, P, B and Al optic spectrometry (spark) was used. All other elements were analysed by x-ray fluorescence. Segregations were found to be present and in combination with the geometry of R 780 Steg to be the cause of the large variations in slope of the crown wheels. The results of this thesis show that, for the crown wheel type R 780 Steg, Scania should not use suppliers that employ the ingot casting technique. Instead, only suppliers using the continuous casting technique should be used. However, for the other crown wheel types ingot or continuously cast material can be used...|$|E

40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{is one of}} the {{general-purpose}} detectors to {{be provided}} for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project at CERN. The design field of the CMS superconducting magnet is 4 T, the magnetic length is 12. 5 m and the free bore is 6 m. To reinforce the high-purity (99. 998 %) Al-stabilized conductor of the magnet against the magnetic loadings experienced during operation at 4. 2 K, two continuous sections of Al-alloy (AA) reinforcement are Electron Beam (EB) welded to it. The reinforcements have a section of 24 * 18 mm and are produced in continuous 2. 55 km lengths. The alloy EN AW- 6082 has been selected for the reinforcement due to its excellent extrudability, high strength in the precipitation hardened states, high toughness and strength at cryogenic temperature and good EB weldability. Each of the continuous lengths of the reinforcement is extruded billet on billet and <b>press</b> <b>quenched</b> on-line from the extrusion temperature in an industrial extrusion plant. In order to insure the ready EB weldability of the reinforcement onto the pure aluminum of the insert, tight dimensional tolerances and proper surface finish of the reinforcement are required in the as-extruded state. As well, in order to facilitate the winding operation of the conductor, the uniformity of the mechanical properties of the extruded reinforcement, especially at the billet on billet joints, is critical. To achieve these requirements in an industrial environment, substantial effort was made to refine existing production techniques and to monitor critical extrusion parameters during production. This paper summarizes the main results obtained during the establishment of the extrusion line and of the production phase of the reinforcement. (10 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to quantify whether T 5 temper is equal to T 6 temper in yield strength of 6060 extrusion alloys. Extrusion conditions achieving uniform yield strength along the whole length of extrudate were examined. The optimal ageing conditions relating to thicknesses of 1. 1 mm and 1. 5 mm were studied. Firstly peak age hardening conditions were determined for thicknesses of 1. 1 mm and 1. 5 mm of both T 5 temper and T 6 temper at mid-length of extrudate. For T 6 temper all samples were solution treated at 540 c for one hour in the furnace, followed by water quenching. Then all the specimens for T 6 temper and T 5 temper were artificially aged at 185 c or 205 c in the oven for varying times: 0. 5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 hours, and then tensile tested to compare 0. 2 % proof strength values. Yield strength of extrudate along the whole length was investigated for thickness 1. 1 mm. Samples were treated at 205 c for two and four hours, and at 185 c for six and twelve hours, for both T 5 and T 6 temper. The average cooling rate of thickness 1. 1 mm extrudate was estimated. Chemical composition analysis using ICP-AES was performed. This was to determine Mg concentration distribution in pre-heated billet before extrusion, and in butt and extrudate after extrusion. Results have shown that a cooling rate of greater than 5 c / s in 6060 alloys is sufficient to prevent Mg 2 Si forming during <b>press</b> <b>quenching.</b> Optimal yield strength for thickness 1. 1 mm and 1. 5 mm can be achieved above 180 MPa by <b>press</b> <b>quenching,</b> when homogenizing conditions were held at 575 c for two hours. Ageing at 205 c reached peak yield strength faster than ageing at 185 c for both T 5 and T 6 temper. When subjected to T 5 temper at 205 c held for two hours, thickness 1. 5 mm reached above 180 MPa but thickness 1. 1 mm did not. It required ageing at 205 c for three hours, or at 185 c for five hours. Constant ram speed of 5 mm/s, when pre-heat temperature is 380 - 390 c, gives a nearly constant exit temperature of 530 - 545 c...|$|E
40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{is one of}} the {{experiments}} being designed in the framework of the Large Hadron Collider accelerator at CERN. CMS will contain the largest and the most powerful superconducting solenoid magnet ever built in terms of stored energy. It will work at 4. 2 K, will have a magnetic length of 12. 5 m, with a free bore of 6 m and will be manufactured as a layered and modular structure of NbTi cables embedded in a high purity (99. 998 %) Al- stabiliser. Each layer consists of a wound continuous length of 2. 55 km. In order to withstand the high electromagnetic forces, two external aluminium alloy reinforcing sections are foreseen. These reinforcements, of 24 mm multiplied by 18 mm cross-section, will be continuously electron beam (EB) welded to the pure Al-stabiliser. The alloy EN AW- 6082 has been selected for the reinforcements due to its excellent extrudability, high strength in the precipitation hardened state, high toughness and strength at cryogenic temperatures and ready EB weldability. Each one of the 2. 55 km continuous sections of reinforcement is extruded billet on billet and <b>press</b> <b>quenched</b> on-line from the extrusion temperature in an industrial extrusion plant. The region where billet on billet welds develop is usually defective and represents a discontinuity in the extruded product, where improper quenching conditions associated to the stop of the line induce poorer mechanical properties. In the present case, thanks to an optimisation of the process, almost isothermal extrusion could be achieved, independently of the discontinuous process. This, associated to a proper conditioning of the mating surface of the billet, allowed the local degradation of the yield strength to be reduced from the usual value of 30 to less than 10 %. The extent of the transition region was also decreased from 8 to 2 m. The achievement of homogeneous strength along continuously extruded long shapes, which is important for the CMS coil winding, might also be c...|$|R

In this experimental study, a heated tool was used to decrease the temperature difference between the hot blank and the tool which led to lower cooling rates and softer properties.

Optimum cooling system need to be considered during the quenching process in hot stamping to achieve the highest strength. The material that had been used in this hot press forming process was boron alloyed steel (22 MnB 5) that will produce the highest martensite content after being hot stamped. After being heated in the furnace up to 950 0 C until 10 minutes, the specimens were pressed at 40 bar by using the hydraulic power <b>press</b> and <b>quenched.</b> The investigations were studied on the microstructure and its hardness properties. Every specimen was prepared for the mechanical testing. To get the optimum parameters, ANOVA were used by using the full factorial design. The responses were studied on hardness value. The result shows that by increasing the quenching time and flow rate will increase the hardness value of the specimen while lowering the coolant temperature will increase the hardness value. The heat transfers by conduction were optimum during the pressure holding time process so the optimum cooling systems hardly effect the formation of the blank. The value of hardness are directly proportional with the formation of martensitic microstructure but it was impossible to achieve a fully martensite structure after the blank being hot stamped. The formation of martensite was due to the heating of the blank until its austenite phase and rapid cooling that make the carbon atom stretch along one direction. Besides martensite structure, the formation of bainite and retained austenite structure also appeared after the blank being hot stamped. to achieve an optimum hardness value up to 551. 3 HV 0. 5, the specimen should be quenched at 7 second with the flow rate of 40 L/min and coolant temperature of 27 0 C...|$|R
