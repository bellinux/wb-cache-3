40|$|The {{low-level}} waste form, {{commonly referred to}} as the ‘Monoliths’, originated as liquid low-level from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The liquid {{low-level waste}} was generated from research and development facilities including radiochemical laboratories, radioisotope processing facilities, decontamination operations, and hot cell activities. The liquid was collected, made alkaline, and concentrated by evaporation, which was then stored in tanks. Once settling had occurred, the supernate in the tanks was solidified in metal containers using a mixture of cement, celite, blast furnace slag, and fly ash. After solidification of the supernate, the waste forms were transported to an area within the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) and placed in concrete storage casks. The storage casks were designed as radiation shields to maintain the external radiation dose levels as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). In 1994 and 1995, the Nevada Test Site (NTS) audited the ORNL NTS Certification Program. During this time, transporters and cask vendors were selected and final <b>preparations</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipment</b> were made. However, the shipments were placed on hold awaiting approval for a United States Department of Energy complex-wide Waste Management Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) or an amendment to the NTS Record of Decision (ROD) to allow ORR to ship to NTS.

40|$|The United States, Russian Federation, and the International Atomic Energy Agency {{have been}} working {{together}} on a program called the Russian Research Reactor Fuel Return (RRRFR) Program, {{which is part of}} the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. The purpose of this program is to return Soviet or Russian-supplied high-enriched uranium (HEU) fuel, currently stored at Russian-designed research reactors throughout the world, to Russia. In February 2003, the RRRFR Program began discussions with the Nuclear Research Institute (NRI) in Rež, Czech Republic, about returning their HEU spent nuclear fuel to the Russian Federation for reprocessing. In March 2005, the U. S. Department of Energy signed a contract with NRI to perform all activities needed for transporting their HEU spent nuclear fuel to Russia. After 2 years of intense planning, preparations, and coordination at NRI and with three other countries, numerous organizations and agencies, and a Russian facility, this <b>shipment</b> is scheduled <b>for</b> completion before the end of 2007. This paper will provide a summary of activities completed for making this international shipment. This paper contains an introduction and background of the RRRFR Program and the NRI shipment project.

40|$|The Russian Research Reactor Fuel Return (RRRFR) Program, {{under the}} U. S. Department of Energy’s Global Threat Reduction Initiative, began {{returning}} Russian-supplied high-enriched uranium (HEU) {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF), stored at Russian-designed research reactors throughout the world, to Russia in January 2006. During {{the first years of}} making HEU SNF shipments, {{it became clear that the}} modes of transportation needed to be expanded from highway and railroad to include sea and air to meet the extremely aggressive commitment of completing the first series of shipments by the end of 2010. The first shipment using sea transport was made in October 2008 and used a non-Russian flagged vessel. The Russian government reluctantly allowed a one-time use of the foreign-owned vessel into their highly secured seaport, with the understanding that any future shipments would be made using a vessel owned and operated by a Russian company. ASPOL-Baltic of St. Petersburg, Russia, owns and operates a small fleet of vessels and has a history of shipping nuclear materials. ASPOL-Baltic’s vessels were licensed for shipping nuclear materials; however, they were not licensed to transport SNF materials. After a thorough review of ASPOL Baltic’s capabilities and detailed negotiations, it was agreed that a contract would be let with ASPOL-Baltic to license and refit their MCL Trader vessel for hauling SNF in support of the RRRFR Program. This effort was funded through a contract between the RRRFR Program, Idaho National Laboratory, and Radioactive Waste Management Plant of Swierk, Poland. This paper discusses planning, Russian and international maritime regulations and requirements, Russian authorities’ reviews and approvals, licensing, design, and modifications made to the vessel in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> SNF <b>shipments.</b> A brief summary of actual shipments using this vessel, experiences, and lessons learned also are described...|$|R

40|$|Visual Examination (VE) gloveboxes {{are used}} at the Savannah River Site (SRS) to {{remediate}} transuranic waste (TRU) drums. Noncompliant items are removed before the drums undergo further characterization in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipment</b> to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Maintaining the flow of drums through the remediation process {{is critical to the}} program's seven-days-per-week operation. Conservative assumptions are used to ensure that glovebox contamination from this continual operation is below acceptable limits. Holdup measurements are performed in order to confirm that these assumptions are conservative. High Cs- 137 backgrounds in the VE glovebox areas preclude the use of a sodium iodide spectrometer, so a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector, having superior resolution, is used. Plutonium- 239 is usually the nuclide of interest; however, Pu- 241, Np- 237 (including its daughter Pa- 233) and Pu- 238 (if detected) are typically assayed. Cs- 137 and Co- 60 may also be detected but are not reported since they do not contribute to the Pu- 239 Fissile Gram Equivalent or Pu- 239 Equivalent Curies. HEPA filters, drums and waste boxes are also assayed by the same methodology. If [...] for example [...] the HEPA is contained in a stainless steel housing, attenuation corrections must be applied for both the filter and the housing.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{transuranic}} (TRU) wastes {{generated by}} nuclear weapon programs and other operations at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) have been stored at Technical Area 54 (TA- 54), Material Disposal Area G (MDA-G) {{in anticipation of}} disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). LANL has a Legacy Waste Project whose goal is to dispose of all legacy mixed low-level (MLLW) and TRU wastes located at MDA-G by 2010 so that environmental corrective actions (closure) can be completed by 2015. One component of the legacy waste in interim storage at MDA-G consists of approximately 95 cubic meters of remote-handled (RH) -TRU waste placed in 60 shafts. One of the storage configurations for this RH-TRU waste at MDA-G consists of 16 capped shafts that contain hot cell debris wastes in 55 -gallon drums. Three 55 -gallon drums were emplaced in welded and vented stainless steel canisters designed to be transported in the RH- 72 B cask. In anticipation of the New Mexico Environment Department’s (NMED’s) approval of the WIPP hazardous waste permit modification allowing RH TRU waste to be accepted at the WIPP, the Department of Energy (DOE) and LANL are preparing for the retrieval of the 16 canisters from the shafts at MDA-G for their transport to the WIPP. This paper discusses the cooperative efforts of the DOE Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO), the DOE Los Alamos Site Office (LASO), LANL, and their subcontractors to obtain a determination of acceptable knowledge (AK) sufficiency for the waste, remove the caps and retrieve the canisters from the shafts, and load the canisters into RH- 72 B casks in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipment</b> to the WIPP...|$|E
40|$|Chains are {{frequently}} used {{to tie the}} shipping containers of hazardous material to a truck bed. The tie-down system is nonlinear when the container is subjected to a triaxial force during transit. It is nonlinear because chains cannot carry compressive force, and {{the base of the}} container may partially lift off from the truck bed. A method was developed to calculate the amount of tension in the chains. This methodology includes three assumptions: (1) No friction exists between the container and the truck bed; (2) The container and the truck bed are rigid; and (3) All chains are properly tightened (i. e., no slacks) during <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipment.</b> The methodology employs an iterative process of a linear tie-down system. This linear system is derived from the nonlinear system with two additional assumptions: (a) All chains can carry compression as well as tension; and (b) There is a point contact between the container and the truck bed. This linear system has a closed-form solution. After the first solution of the linear system is obtained, the unreasonable, or physically impossible, rotational degree of freedom of the container and the chains with compressive force are eliminated in the follow-up iterative calculations using the same linear system. Unreasonable rotation is detected when the results indicate a rotation of the container into the truck bed. Zero rotational value is assigned to this degree of freedom in the follow-up iterations. For chains under compression, the chain length is replaced with a fictitiously large value because a long chain carries essentially no load. This process usually needs only two or three iterations and can easily be carried out in a spread sheet using such programs as Microsoft Excel or LOTUS 123...|$|E
