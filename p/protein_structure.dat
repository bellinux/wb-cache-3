5|$|Irreversible {{inhibition}} {{is different}} from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying <b>protein</b> <b>structure</b> but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all <b>protein</b> <b>structure,</b> {{but this is a}} non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.|$|E

Hoping that humans could improve the computers' attempts to solve <b>protein</b> <b>structures,</b> Baker approached David Salesin and Zoran Popović, computer science professors at the same university, to help conceptualize and build an interactive program, a video game, that would appeal {{to the public and}} help efforts to find native <b>protein</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many {{proteins}} (in Eucaryota ~33%) contain large unstructured but biologically functional segments and can {{be classified}} as intrinsically disordered proteins.

5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between proteins whereby the proteins have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. The result is a <b>protein</b> <b>structure</b> with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted proteins – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.|$|E

Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions.

5|$|With Craig Kundrot, Richards {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} high pressure (1000 atmospheres) on <b>protein</b> <b>structure,</b> using hen-egg lysozyme crystals, finding that the structure was robust to such pressures apart from a quite modest compaction in size. In the 1990s, Richards and collaborators used a combination of theory and experiment to investigate how the well-packed interior of proteins can nevertheless accommodate mutations.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate <b>protein</b> <b>structure</b> model.|$|E

5|$|Many {{sequence}} alignment and <b>protein</b> <b>structure</b> alignment algorithms {{have been}} developed assuming linear data representations and as such {{are not able to}} detect circular permutations between proteins. Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models. As an alternative to these, a number of algorithms are built on top of non-linear approaches and are able to detect topology-independent similarities, or employ modifications allowing them to circumvent the limitations of dynamic programming. The table below is a collection of such methods.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the major}} {{distributed}} computing projects involved in protein research, Folding@home {{is the only one}} not using the BOINC platform. Both Rosetta@home and Folding@home study protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, but Folding@home does so much more exclusively. Folding@home almost exclusively uses all-atom molecular dynamics models to understand how and why proteins fold (or potentially misfold, and subsequently aggregate to cause diseases). In other words, Folding@home's strength is modeling the process of protein folding, while Rosetta@home's strength is computing protein design and predicting <b>protein</b> <b>structure</b> and docking.|$|E
5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project aimed at <b>protein</b> <b>structure</b> prediction {{and is one}} of the most accurate tertiary structure predictors. The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E

Further, {{the set of}} solved structures is biased toward proteins {{that can be easily}} subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography.

Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. <b>Protein</b> <b>structure</b> prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E
