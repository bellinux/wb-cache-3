Agrammatism in Hebrew is investigated through an experiment with a patient who displays a highly selective impairment: agreement inflection is completely intact, but tense inflection, use of copula, and embedded structures are severely impaired. A retrospective examination of the literature shows that our findings are corroborated by others. A selective account of the agrammatic production deficiency is proposed, according to which only a subclass of the functional syntactic categories is impaired in this syndrome. The consequence of this deficit is the pruning of the syntactic <b>phrase</b> <b>marker</b> of agrammatic patients, which impairs performance from the impaired node and higher.

40|$|The {{automatic}} prosodic annotation {{of large}} speech corpora gains increasing consideration since appropriate databases {{for the training}} of prosodic models in speech synthesis and recognition are needed.

The structure of the multilayer feed-forward neural network (MFN) had been optimized and adapted to the target database and to the specific annotation task. The method is rather data sensitive—depending on different human labelers and small differences across training databases, like frequency of occurrence or strength of phrase breaks. The MFN method can be easily adapted to the characteristics of different databases (long or short phrases, special formats like dates or web addresses, etc.).

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{model of}} garden path recovery {{that we have}} advocated in previous work holds that no repair processes are intrinsically costly. Repair costs depend entirely on the difficulty of establishing what revisions to make. The diagnosis process {{does not require a}} special-purpose inference system as long as the parser abides by the Attach Anyway principle: when it encounters an input word that doesn’t fit into the current structure, it attaches it in the least unacceptable way. The attachment creates a conflict internal to the <b>phrase</b> <b>marker,</b> which is then resolved in consultation with the grammar by a process we call Adjust. In this chapter we propose a principled constraint on the operations of Adjust: the Grammatical Dependency Principle.

The examples we present show that neither raising repairs nor semantic revisions are difficult per se. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} explores a principally non-constraint-based {{approach to}} locality phenomena in wh-movement, in particular, impossibility of overt extraction of a wh-phrase out of certain structural domains (‘islands’), and the successive cyclic character of wh-movement across a finite clause boundary. The proposed theory of locality utilizes {{the idea in}} the earlier works of Cinque, Bresnan and Cattell, that movement is only possible within a well-defined type of configurations—‘cyclic domains’, and implements this idea in the Minimalist framework (Chomsky 1995, 2000). We argue that under the minimalist view, the notion cyclic domain need not be stipulated; rather, it reduces to a cover term for a <b>phrase</b> <b>marker</b> containing a source and target of movement, in which movement proceeds without intermediate steps. A minimalist theory of cyclic domains is conceptually and empirically superior to the previous transformational theories of locality which are inherently constraint-based. ^ In the first part, we argue, contra traditional theories (cf. ‘Condition on Extraction Domains’), that extractability out of subjects and adjuncts is regulated by different mechanisms of grammar. Overt wh-extraction out of a subject is allowed, but leads to a violation at the syntax-phonology interface if the subject has previously moved in syntax, forming a non-trivial chain. Overt wh-extraction out of adjuncts is precluded in syntax because by the time extraction is supposed to occur, the source and target of extraction are not (yet) within the same <b>phrase</b> <b>marker.</b> This proposal accounts for the cross-linguistic variation in extractability out of subjects and for the apparently universal ban on overt extraction out of adjuncts, and has other welcome empirical consequences. ^ In the second part, we {{address the issue of}} the local character of wh-movement in finite clauses. Particular attention is devoted to investigating the syntax of ‘wh-scope marking’ questions, in the framework of Indirect Dependency, developed by Dayal and adopted and modified here. The key proposal is that the syntactic structure of wh-scope marking questions and questions involving ‘long-distance’ wh-movement is fundamentally similar. Exploring this similarity, we suggest that successive cyclicity in long-distance wh-movement is a residual effect of the underlying wh-scope marking structure, and is therefore epiphenomenal. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} dependency-forming {{featural}} operation Agree and its {{interaction with the}} structure-building operation Merge in the local, derivational framework of Chomsky (2000). Chapter II develops a theory of cyclicity where individual instances of Merge can change the search-space of a probe. Such dynamic cyclicity is motivated from cyclic displacement phenomena where search-space expands downwards from one cycle to the next through evacuation of interveners, and the ergative displacement phenomenon in Basque where search-space expands upwards through cyclic construction of the <b>phrase</b> <b>marker.</b> Chapter III shows how Merge composes with Agree in the derivation to give both movement and copy-raising. The Merge step is constrained by the Agree step because Agree transmits the variable names needed to interpret movement in Heim & Kratzer (1998). Differences between movement and copy-raising reduce to the Binding Theory and copy-deletion in the result, forcing copies in local domains and pronouns in non-local domains. English tough-movement exemplifies copy-raising whose pronoun tail is an Ā-operator.
