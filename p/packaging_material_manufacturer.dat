40|$|The recent {{push for}} lead free {{products}} is resulting in {{significant changes in}} <b>packaging</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>Manufacturers</b> of electronic equipment are requiring materials that consistently withstand peak reflow temperatures of 240 ?C to 260 °C. Reflow soldering at these ext reme temperatures, especially after extended moisture exposure, introduces several challenges that must be solved to produce reliable products. Plastic packages use various organic compounds for molding and die attach that have formulations consisting of an epoxy resin, filler particles and other additives. The epoxy resin in equilibrium with the ambient atmosphere absorbs {{a small percentage of}} moisture, which turns into saturated steam during the printed circuit board reflow process. The extreme pressure from the steam and the drop in flexural strength of the mold comp ound and die attach materials can result in catastrophic failures of the packages. Typical failure modes of packages include encapsulant cracking, substrate cracking, severe package deformation, and delamination of one or more material interfaces. The problem is further exacerbated by the use of very large dies, which are typical of Altera devices. In this paper, we will discuss some of the modifications necessary to meet product reliability and usability requirements for lead free products. We will present the test results to demonstrate the reliability of PQFP, TQFP, BGA and Flip-chip BGA components and relate the results to the different approaches that were taken for different package types to successfull...|$|R
40|$|Reverse {{logistics}} {{is considered}} to be the key for re-manufacturing and sustainable development. It has gained increasing attention in the last decade and has been a new frontier of strategic management. One of the driving forces for firms to adopt the reverse logistics practice is cost saving from reverse logistics activities. Another motivation to put reverse logistics forward is probably due to environmental impacts on non-returnable materials. Reverse logistics, however, may require cooperation of more than one company and hence it is generally poorly managed due to self-interest of different companies. Therefore, a pro-active and collaborative approach to reverse logistics is demanded. This paper reports a case study of using returnable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> between a <b>manufacturer</b> and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplier. A cross-company team was established to pursue the goal of the reverse logistics project. Tangible and intangible benefits of reverse logistics from this case study are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Packaging waste forms a {{significant}} part of municipal solid waste and as such has caused increasing environmental concerns, resulting in strengthening of EU Regulations in order to reduce amounts of packaging waste. Among other materials, a huge range of oil-based polymers is currently used in packaging applications. They are largely non-biodegradable and particularly difficult to recycle or reuse due to mixed levels of contamination and complex composites. In recent years, the development of biodegradable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> from renewable natural resources (e. g. crops) has received increasing attention, particularly in EU countries. Significant progress has been made to produce biodegradable materials with similar functionality to that of the oil-based synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that, as the materials are from renewable resources and biodegradable, they would contribute to sustainable development and if properly managed would reduce their environmental impact upon disposal. This paper discusses the potential impact of biodegradable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> on waste management in terms of landfill, incineration, recycle/reuse and composting. A comparison is also drawn to the oil-based polymer <b>packaging</b> <b>materials.</b> It is the view of the authors that biodegradable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> are most suitable for single use disposable packaging applications where the post-consumer use packaging can be locally composted as a means of recycling the materials.
