5|$|The 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of <b>Polar</b> <b>Bears</b> between Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway (Svalbard), the United States, and the Soviet Union outlawed the {{unregulated}} {{hunting of}} <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> from aircraft and icebreakers, {{as well as}} protecting migration, feeding, and hibernation sites.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} <b>polar</b> <b>bears,</b> and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older <b>polar</b> <b>bears.</b> Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E

5|$|<b>Polar</b> <b>bears</b> are {{the iconic}} symbol of Svalbard, {{and one of}} the main tourist attractions. The animals are {{protected}} and people moving outside the settlements are required to have appropriate scare devices to ward off attacks. They are also advised to also carry a firearm for use as a last resort. A British schoolboy was killed by a polar bear in 2011. Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land share a common population of 3,000 <b>polar</b> <b>bears,</b> with Kong Karls Land being the most important breeding ground.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{writer and}} {{researcher}} Bea Uusma at Karolinska institutet, Sweden, rejected {{the theory that}} larvae of Trichinella spiralis killed the expedition members. After examining the men's clothes, she concluded that at least Strindberg was killed by <b>polar</b> <b>bears.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Polar</b> <b>bears</b> {{are thought}} to have diverged from a {{population}} of brown bears, Ursus arctos, that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts.|$|E

On her own, Kallik decides to go to a gathering place for <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> that her mom told her about. At the gathering, Kallik asks other <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> if they have seen her brother, but no one has. Alone, Kallik meets a female bear Nanuk who helps Kallik around the area. However, Nanuk is killed by a helicopter crash shipping her and Kallik back to the wild. Before she dies, Nanuk tells Kallik about a place where the ice never melts. Hearing this, Kallik sets off to this place.|$|E
5|$|The walrus and {{polar bear}} hunts were filmed in July 1932 at Herald Island in the Chukchi Sea. Walrus {{carcasses}} {{were used as}} dog food and to attract <b>polar</b> <b>bears.</b> Additional polar bear hunting was filmed in March 1933 off Cape Lisburne. The bowhead whale hunt was filmed from late April to July 1933 in two locations: Off Point Hope, Alaska, and off Cape Serdtse-Kamen on the Chukchi Peninsula. The whale hunting shoot took nearly three months because the whales kept fleeing every time they spotted boats. As depicted in the film, the Inupiat also hunted <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> by roping and drowning them, but little of this footage {{made it into the}} picture.|$|E
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of <b>polar</b> <b>bears,</b> while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E

5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. <b>Polar</b> <b>bears</b> are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{opened a}} similar {{fairground}} in 1932, in Bognor Regis, {{on the corner}} of the Esplanade, named the Recreation Shelter. The following year he opened a zoo nearby, which featured <b>polar</b> <b>bears,</b> kangaroos and monkeys. At around the same time he also opened an amusement park in Bognor's neighbouring village of Littlehampton, known as Butlin's Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to humans, three primarily terrestrial mammalian species inhabit the archipelago: the Arctic fox, the Svalbard reindeer, and accidentally introduced southern voles, which are {{found only in}} Grumant. Attempts to introduce the Arctic hare and the muskox have both failed.

5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object.

Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. <b>Polar</b> <b>bears</b> leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E
5|$|In some species, {{offspring}} {{may become}} independent {{around the next}} spring, through some may stay until the female successfully mates again. Bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse; at around 3â€“6 years depending on the species.
