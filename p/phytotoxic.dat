5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A <b>phytotoxic</b> secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the needles and leaf drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the needles becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes.|$|E
5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's <b>phytotoxic</b> secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E
25|$|Digestate {{typically}} contains elements, such as lignin, that {{cannot be}} broken down by the anaerobic microorganisms. Also, the digestate may contain ammonia that is <b>phytotoxic,</b> and may hamper the growth of plants if it {{is used as a}} soil-improving material. For these two reasons, a maturation or composting stage may be employed after digestion. Lignin and other materials are available for degradation by aerobic microorganisms, such as fungi, helping reduce the overall volume of the material for transport. During this maturation, the ammonia will be oxidized into nitrates, improving the fertility of the material and making it more suitable as a soil improver. Large composting stages are typically used by dry anaerobic digestion technologies.|$|E
500|$|The female drills several holes {{through the}} bark {{down to the}} xylem to place one egg in each. At the same time, she inserts spores of Amylostereum areolatum and a <b>phytotoxic</b> {{secretion}}. The holes branch out into several tubes, which lead away radially. The eggs are white, sausage-shaped, and [...] by [...] in size. Small females may lay 20 eggs, while the largest can lay up to 500. Sometimes, eggs are not placed in every tube. In the last tube, the female injects only the secretion and the fungal spores. The females often die after just three or four days, sometimes even during oviposition (egg-laying), through overexertion.|$|E
500|$|Amylostereaceae usually infest only dead or {{cut down}} conifer wood. Three species – A.areolatum, A.laevigatum and A.chailletii – may also {{establish}} a symbiosis with wood wasps (Siricidae), which beside freshly logged trees also infest living trees and infect them with fungi. Symbioses {{have been recorded}} with several species: Sirex noctilio, S.juvencus, S.nitobei, S.cyaneus, S.edwarsii, S.nitidus, and, in Japan, Urocerus antennatus and Xoanon matsumurae. Wasps of the genera Sirex and Urocerus store oidia (the hypha of fungi split up to spores) in special abdominal organs. The wood wasps infect trees by splashing a <b>phytotoxic</b> secretion below the bark {{and at the same}} time injecting fungal spores into the hole. The secretion weakens the tree and temporarily diminishes its immune system, whereby the fungus can spread along the xylem. The infection with Amylostereaceae fulfill two functions for the wasps: it provides the larvae food, because the white rot softens the wood; at the same time, the mycelia of the fungi serves as food for the larvae. After the larvae pupate, it absorbs the mycelia of the Amylostereaceae into its body to oviposit together with its eggs. The fungus benefits from the symbiosis as it spreads faster and more effectively than through airborne spores and furthermore does not need to develop fruit bodies. [...] A.ferreum is the only Amylosterum species that has not been associated with any woodwasps.|$|E
5000|$|High {{concentrations}} of mineral salts in solution within the growing medium can have <b>phytotoxic</b> effects. Sources of excessive mineral salts include infiltration of seawater and excessive application of fertilizers. For example, urea {{is used in}} agriculture as a nitrogenous fertilizer, but if too much is applied, <b>phytotoxic</b> effects can result, either by urea toxicity or by the [...] "ammonia produced through hydrolysis of urea by soil urease". Acid soils may contain high {{concentrations of}} aluminium (as Al3+) and manganese (as Mn2+) which can be <b>phytotoxic.</b>|$|E
50|$|The visual {{observations}} were also constructed in assessing <b>phytotoxic</b> {{symptoms such as}} injury on leaf tips or surface, wilting and etc. Nonetheless, no <b>phytotoxic</b> symptoms were observed on the plants with the treatment. In conclusion, the triazofos of 1250 ml/ ha was most effective against leafhoppers, whiteflies and shoot and fruit borer of brinjal.|$|E
50|$|A {{study in}} 2007 {{discovered}} four new bioactive compounds from basidiomycetes, isolated from fermentations of L. illinita: Illinitone A that exhibited weak <b>phytotoxic</b> and moderate nematicidal activities against Caenorhabditis elegans, Illinitone B that was moderately cytotoxic, Limacellone that exhibited weak cytotoxic and <b>phytotoxic</b> activities and muurolane sesquiterpene 4a {{that was found}} to be inactive in the assays performed there.|$|E
50|$|Phytotoxin is an {{umbrella}} term {{that refers to}} substances (known as <b>phytotoxic</b> substances) that are inhibitory {{to the growth of}} or poisonous to plants. <b>Phytotoxic</b> substances may result from human activity, as with herbicides, or they may be produced by plants, by microorganisms, or by naturally occurring chemical reactions. A good soil will protect plants from toxic concentrations of such substances by ventilating gases, decomposing or adsorbing organic toxins, or suppressing toxin-producing organisms.|$|E

50|$|Herbicides are {{designed}} to kill plants, and are used to control unwanted plants such as agricultural weeds. However herbicides can also cause <b>phytotoxic</b> effects in plants that are not within the area over which the herbicide is applied, for example {{as a result of}} wind-blown spray drift or from the use of herbicide-contaminated material (such as straw or manure) being applied to the soil. The <b>phytotoxic</b> effects of herbicides are an important subject of study in the field of ecotoxicology.|$|E
50|$|Sterpuric acid is a <b>phytotoxic</b> {{metabolite}} {{derived from}} the fungus Stereum purpureum, from which it derives its name. This fungus causes silver-leaf disease of fruit trees.|$|E
50|$|Botrydial is a <b>phytotoxic</b> {{sesquiterpene}} metabolite secreted by {{the fungus}} Botrytis cinerea. Botrydial was first isolated and described in 1974. Botrytis Cinerea is the causal agent of gray mold disease {{and is known}} to attack {{a wide range of}} plants (over 200 species) producing leaf-spot diseases and mildews on lettuces and tomatoes as well as rotting berries. For this reason, botrydial, as well as other Botrytis Cinerea originated sesquiterpene metabolites, represent an economically important disease for ornamental and agriculturally important crops. From all the metabolites produced by this fungus, Botrydial exhibits the highest <b>phytotoxic</b> activity.|$|E

5000|$|Triorganotin {{compounds}} can {{be highly}} toxic. Tri-n-alkyltins are <b>phytotoxic</b> and therefore cannot be used in agriculture. Depending on the organic groups, they can be powerful bactericides and fungicides. Reflecting their high bioactivity, [...] "tributyltins" [...] were once used in marine anti-fouling paint.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogenic}} species S. perseae {{belongs to}} a class of fungi called dothideomycetes. These fungi are known for producing host-specific <b>phytotoxic</b> metabolites. These toxins are marked for their detrimental interaction with a particular host species while potentially having no effect on other species. These toxins trigger the hypersensitive response upon recognition of the host, which for necrotrophs provides continuing opportunity for the spread of infection. The tissue being damaged on the host becomes a source of nutrient for the pathogen to grow and cause more symptoms. A potential secondary metabolite with <b>phytotoxic</b> properties within the Sphaceloma genus is the variety of pigments called elsinochromes. These are red/orange pigments produced by many Elsinoë and Sphaceloma species. The Sphaceloma genus is the anamorph analog of the Elsinoë genus of which the pigments are named so {{it is reasonable to}} presume S. perseae also produces this <b>phytotoxic</b> pigments. Elsinochromes were proven to kill cells of the host plant and even cause necrotic legions on live tissue by reactions of a singlet oxygen species from the pigment. The singlet oxygen breaks down proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids in the plant cells. Toxicity has been demonstrated to decrease in the addition of singlet oxygen quenchers, as they prevent the interaction of the oxygen species with plant cells.|$|E
50|$|L. leucocephala is an {{allelopathic}} tree. <b>Phytotoxic</b> allelochemicals, such as mimosine {{and certain}} phenolic compounds, including p-hydroxycinnamic acid, protocatechuic acid, and gallic acid, {{have been identified}} in the leaves of the species. Bioherbicidal activity of L. leucocephala on terrestrial plants and aquatic weed water hyacinth were reported.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oils derived from leaves, inner bark, and buds of B. nigra are mostly composed of eugenol, linalool, palmitic acid, and heptacosane with many more compounds in smaller concentrations. The combined {{essential oils}} are <b>phytotoxic</b> to lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) seedlings. They have also demonstrated insecticidal, nematicidal, and antibacterial properties.|$|E
50|$|Mycangia of the woodwasps (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) {{were first}} {{described}} by Buchner. Different from highly diverse types in bark and ambrosia beetles, woodwasps {{only have a}} pair of mycangia {{on the top of}} their ovipositor. Then when females deposit their eggs inside the host plant, they inject the symbiotic fungi from mycangia and <b>phytotoxic</b> mucus from another reservoir-like structure.|$|E
50|$|Abraham Z. Joffe (1909-2000) was Professor of Mycology and Mycotoxicology at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. Joffe's {{professional}} {{interests were}} centered primarily in toxigenic fungi associated with production of mycotoxins (aflatoxins, trichothecenes, and other toxins); ecology {{and environmental factors}} favoring formation and distribution of Fusarium mycotoxins in cereal grains, feeds and foods; and <b>phytotoxic</b> action of Fusarium strains, and their toxicity in animals and humans.|$|E
50|$|The rapid {{economic}} growth, industrialization and urbanization {{are associated with}} a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism. Sulfur gases are potentially <b>phytotoxic,</b> however, they may also be metabolized and used as sulfur source and even be beneficial if the sulfur fertilization of the roots is not sufficient.|$|E
50|$|The soils of ultramafic rocks, {{which are}} mining terrains, {{have been a}} refuge for many native plant species of New Caledonia because they are toxic and their mineral content is poorly suited to most foreign species of plants. On New Caledonia {{examples}} of such soils commonly have an excess of magnesium, plus unusually high concentrations of <b>phytotoxic</b> compounds of heavy metals such as nickel.|$|E
5000|$|Organotin {{compounds}} {{can be very}} toxic. [...] "Tri-n-alkyltins" [...] are <b>phytotoxic</b> and, {{depending on}} the organic groups, can be powerful bactericides and fungicides. Other triorganotins are used as miticides and acaricides.Tributyltin (TBT) was extensively used in marine antifouling paints, until discontinued for leisure craft due to concerns over longer term marine toxicity in high traffic areas such as marinas {{with large numbers of}} static boats.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Aspergillus versicolor, aspergillomarasmine A is also {{produced by the}} ascomycete Pyrenophora teres where it acts as a toxin in the barley net-spot blotch disease. In P. teres, a biosynthetic precursor of aspergillomarasmine A, L,L-N-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-aspartic acid has also been isolated and found {{to contribute to the}} <b>phytotoxic</b> properties of this microbe. This precursor, aspergillomarasmine A itself, and a lactam form (anhydroaspergillomarasmine A) are together termed the marasmines.|$|E
50|$|Like {{plants in}} several other Solanaceae genera, many Jaborosa species contain steroid-derived {{compounds}} called withanolides. Many of the withanolides isolated from Jaborosa have been dubbed jaborosalactones. Some withanolides are <b>phytotoxic,</b> having effects on other plants such as inhibiting germination and radicle growth. Some have antifeedant effects, deterring insects such as mealworms (Tenebrio molitor), the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), and the African cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) from consuming the plant.|$|E
