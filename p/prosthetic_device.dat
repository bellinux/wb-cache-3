25|$|There {{were two}} {{significant}} Confederate casualties. Both {{were treated with}} battlefield amputations, {{believed to be the}} first such operations of the war. One was a Virginia Military Institute cadet, Fauntleroy Daingerfield. The other Confederate was James E. Hanger, an 18-year-old college student. After recovering and being released, Hanger returned home to Virginia. He made an artificial leg from barrel staves with a hinge at the knee. His design worked so well that the Virginia State Legislature commissioned him to manufacture the “Hanger Limb” for other wounded soldiers. After the war, Hanger patented his <b>prosthetic</b> <b>device</b> and founded what is now the Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc. As of 2007, Hanger Orthopedic Group is the United States market leader in the manufacture of artificial limbs.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of mucosal lesions among institutionalized adults is quite high and most frequent lesions {{of the oral}} mucosa that are present are those induced by wearing dentures.

25|$|When {{compared}} to the results achieved with a silicone-gel breast implant, the saline implant can yield acceptable results, of increased breast-size, smoother hemisphere-contour, and realistic texture; yet, it is likelier to cause cosmetic problems, such as the rippling and the wrinkling of the breast-envelope skin, accelerated lower breast pole stretch, and technical problems, such {{as the presence of}} the implant being noticeable to the eye and to the touch. The occurrence of such cosmetic problems is likelier {{in the case of the}} woman with very little breast tissue, and in the case of the woman who requires post-mastectomy breast reconstruction; thus, the silicone-gel implant is the technically superior <b>prosthetic</b> <b>device</b> for breast augmentation, and for breast reconstruction. In the case of the woman with much breast tissue, for whom sub-muscular emplacement is the recommended surgical approach, saline breast implants can produce an aesthetic result much like that afforded by silicone breast implants, albeit with greater implant palpability.|$|E
25|$|In 1510, {{the three}} {{brothers}} raided Cape Passero in Sicily and repulsed a Spanish attack on Bougie, Oran and Algiers. In August 1511 they raided the areas around Reggio Calabria in southern Italy. In August 1512 the exiled ruler of Bougie invited the brothers {{to drive out}} the Spaniards, and during the battle Oruç lost his left arm. This incident earned him the nickname Gümüş Kol (Silver Arm in Turkish), {{in reference to the}} silver <b>prosthetic</b> <b>device</b> which he used in place of his missing limb. Later that year the three brothers raided the coasts of Andalusia in Spain, capturing a galliot of the Lomellini family of Genoa who owned the Tabarca island in that area. They subsequently landed on Menorca and captured a coastal castle, and then headed towards Liguria and captured four Genoese galleys near Genoa. The Genoese sent a fleet to liberate their ships, but the brothers captured their flagship as well. After capturing a total of 23 ships in less than a month, the brothers sailed back to La Goulette.|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} of this dissertation is developing neural <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> for chronic brain-computer interface. To maintain a chronically sustainable brain-computer interface, implantable devices should have minimal chronic inflammation, mechanically compliance with neural tissue, {{and long term}} durability under physiological conditions. Traditional neural <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> can seldom fulfill these requirements. This dissertation presents a nanocomposite approach to design the next generation neural <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices.</b> The rationally designed nanocomposite can achieve {{the combination of the}} desired material properties for neural <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices,</b> currently unattainable by traditional materials. In this dissertation, we first fabricated a mechanically compliant neural electrode from carbon nanotubes. The seamless integration of carbon nanotubes and polymer offered both mechanical flexibility and electrical conductivity for neural <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices.</b> Then we explored other nanomaterials to design more exceptional nanocomposites. The gold nanoparticle nanocomposite developed in this research outperformed carbon nanotube composite in term of electrochemical performance. Additionally, we utilized the nanocomposite approach to design flexible insulation material for implantable electronic. By combining aramid nanofibers and epoxy resin, the composite material has outstanding adhesion and biocompatibility. Lastly, we designed a microfabrication process to combine gold nanoparticle composite and aramid nanofiber composite to create tissue compliant and high performance neural electrodes...|$|R
