Disturbances {{in a forest}} environment that cause reductions in forest area, timber volume, and timber growth can be detected on ERTS- 1 combined color composites. However, detection depends on comparing a conventional aerial photograph taken at some base year with an ERTS- 1 image taken in some subsequent year. In a test made on the Atlanta site, 1 : 63, 360 scale aerial <b>photo</b> <b>index</b> sheets made in 1966 were compared with ERTS- 1 image 1264 - 15445 (April 1973). Five factors were found important to detection reliability: (1) {{the quality of the}} imagery; (2) the season of the imagery; (3) the size of the disturbed area; (4) the number of years since the disturbances; and (5) the type of cutting treatment. Of 209 disturbances verified on aerial photography, 165 (or approximately 80 %) were detected on the ERTS- 1 image by one independent interpreter. Improved training and additional experience in using this low resolution imagery should improve detection. Of the two seasons of data studies (fall and early spring), early spring is the best for detecting land use changes. Generally speaking, winter, early spring, and early summer are the best times of year for detecting forest disturbances...|$|E

The number of devices found in a house that are capable of processing data has been increasing in the last few years. However, being able to process data does not mean that these devices are powerful, and, in a home environment, there will be a demand for some applications that need significant computing resources, beyond the capabilities of a single domestic device, such as a set top box (examples of such applications are TV recommender systems, image processing and <b>photo</b> <b>indexing</b> systems). A computational grid is a possible solution for this problem, but the constrained environment in the home makes it difficult to use conventional grid scheduling technologies, which demand a powerful infrastructure.

40|$|Abstract—Given {{the growth}} of Internet photo {{collections}} {{we now have a}} visual index of all major cities and tourist sites in the world. However, it is still a difficult task to capture that perfect shot with your own camera when visiting these places, especially when your camera itself has limitations, such as a limited field of view. In this paper, we propose a framework to overcome the imperfections of personal photos of tourist sites using the rich information provided by large scale Internet photo collections. Our method deploys state-of-the-art techniques for constructing initial 3 D models from photo collections. The same techniques are then used to register personal photos to these models, allowing us to augment personal 2 D images with 3 D information. This strong available scene prior allows us to address a number of traditionally challenging image enhancement techniques, and achieve high quality results using simple and robust algorithms. Specifically, we demonstrate automatic foreground segmentation, mono-to-stereo conversion, field of view expansion, photometric enhancement, and additionally automatic annotation with geo-location and tags. Our method clearly demonstrates some possible benefits of employing the rich information contained in on-line photo databases to efficiently enhance and augment one’s own personal <b>photos.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Image enhancement, internet photo collections, segmentation, 2 D to 3 D conversion, field of view expansion, photometric enhancement, geo-tagging and locating...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent {{development}} of groundwater resources {{is a process}} that requires a thorough understanding of the availability and movement of groundwater. In northern Arkansas knowledge of the deep aquifers is fairly limited, perhaps because economic factors and uncertain yields have discouraged exploitation. The {{development of}} these deeper aquifers to their fullest potential as reliable water sources depends on the delineation of high yield areas, a process that may be facilitated by linear trend analysis as outlined in this study. Satellite and photolineament maps of the 13 counties were prepared by use of LANDSAT images and Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service <b>photo</b> <b>indexes.</b> The lineaments and fracture traces on aerial photographs and LANDSAT images are natural linear features such as aligned stream segments, soil tonal and vegetal alignments, and topographic sags. These features are the surface manifestation of subsurface fracture zones of undermined origin, which are areas where increased solutioning of carbonate rocks has taken place. The results of statistical testing of well yields in the study area show that the fracture trace-lineament method of well location can result in improved well yields. The fact that higher yields are obtained from wells on lineaments shows that these linear features are indeed surface manifestations of increased solutioning in the subsurface. These zones of fracture, enlarged by groundwater circulation, are capable of transmitting a greater volume of water at a faster rate than rocks between lineaments. Wells tapping these zones consequently show higher yields than those drilled randomly. In northern Arkansas where shallow groundwater supplies soon may not meet the demands of a growing population, linear trends interpreted from LANDSAT can be useful in the search for more reliable groundwater sources. Their use will help the development of the deep aquifers of the area as reliable sources for domestic, municipal and industrial water supplies...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} of a fabricated fiber grating device characteristics and its applications, using a phase mask writing technique. The phase mask technique used for writing fiber gratings has the advantages over the traditional holographic method because of its simpler writing setup and more reproducible characteristics. Specifically, the utilization of phase mask relaxes the strict requirement on the coherence of a UV light source. On the other hand, to <b>photo</b> induce an <b>index</b> change in the fiber core, light absorption must somehow occur. Alkins measured the absorption spectrum in a standard germanium doped mono mode telecommunication fiber to the wavelength as short as 200 nm. The results show that a light source in the UV spectral region 228 to 253 nm is most effective in <b>photo</b> inducing refractive <b>index</b> changes in such optical fibers. Therefore, we used a KrF excimer laser with wavelength ~ 248 nm as light source, and applied the phase mask technique to writing fiber grating. This method has the significant advantage for its much less relaxed requirement on the spatial coherence of exposure light source. The device (i-e grating) characteristics especially, in sensing application, were investigated.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a {{syntactic}} string matching approach to solve the frontal face recognition problem. String matching is a powerful partial matching technique, but is not suitable for frontal face recognition due to its requirement of globally sequential representation and the complex nature of human faces, containing discontinuous and non-sequential features. Here, we build a compact syntactic Stringface repre-sentation, which is an ensemble of strings. A novel ensemble string matching approach that can perform non-sequential string matching between two Stringfaces is proposed. It is invariant to the sequential order of strings and the direction of each string. The embedded partial matching mechanism enables our method to automatically use every piece of non-occluded region, regardless of shape, in the recognition process. The encouraging results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using syntactic methods for face recognition from a single exemplar image per person, breaking the barrier that prevents string matching techniques from being used for addressing complex image recognition problems. The proposed method not only achieved significantly better performance in recognizing partially occluded faces, but also showed its ability to perform direct matching between sketch faces and <b>photo</b> faces. <b>Index</b> Terms — Ensemble string matching, face recognition, occlusion, partial matching, stringface, sketch recognition, syntactic.
