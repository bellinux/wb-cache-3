40|$|Private {{resolution}} and <b>public</b> <b>adjudication</b> of disputes are commonly seen as discrete, antipodal processes. There is a generally held {{understanding of the}} dispute resolution processes. The essence of private dispute resolution is that the parties can arrange the disputed rights and entitlements per agreement and without judicial intervention. In <b>public</b> <b>adjudication,</b> however, the sovereign mandates the substantive and procedural laws to be applied, many of which cannot be changed by either a party 2 ̆ 7 s unilateral decision or both parties 2 ̆ 7 mutual consent. Neither approach allows a party an option to unilaterally alter {{important aspects of the}} process, such as the standards of proof and the attorney fee rules. This understanding is commonly accepted and rarely challenged, but it is curious nonetheless. This Article proposes that we move towards procedural optionality, the idea that there can be nuanced mechanisms to allow unilateral, private choice in <b>public</b> <b>adjudication.</b> To show the potential efficacy of this concept, this Article proposes a scheme in which parties can unilaterally shift fees as long as they contractually bond their good faith by assuming a higher standard of proof. These rules are not ordinarily subject to an option of the parties. Uniform application of the law satisfies the concern of fairness and predictability, but this also comes at a real cost. Private choice to alter these rules can better address the problems of frivolous suits and nonprosecution of meritorious but low value claims - two problematic bookends in the spectrum of litigation. By properly structuring party options, the law can create greater convergence of private incentives and social interest. More efficient disputes resolution results, as measured by increased enforcement of and compliance with the substantive laws at lower cost. Lastly, this Article concludes by examining some policy implications of procedural optionality for substantive and procedural laws...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} {{judicial review of}} governmental action and individual legal activism. It investigates whether judicial protection of individual rights and individual legal activism, {{within the field of}} public law, can be seen as an alternative or complement to electoral control of political and administrative powers. To discuss the effect of various standing rules and the potential societal function of <b>public</b> law <b>adjudication,</b> a model for analyzing the character of <b>public</b> law <b>adjudication</b> has been developed. The model allows for a characterization of <b>public</b> law <b>adjudication</b> as either Liberal or Republican, depending on features of standing rules, court proceedings, and court decisions. It concludes that judicial protection of individual rights and individual legal activism within the field of public law can be seen as an alternative or complement to electoral control of political and administrative powers, especially when public trust in, and the powers of, the legislative assembly and political parties is low and decreasing, and if the preconditions for individual legal activism are of such a character that access to justice is available to the larger public and not only a limited group of advantaged individuals. This theoretical framework is then used to analyse judicial protection of individual rights and individual legal activism in post-Socialist Russia. The results show that the Russian state is best described as authoritarian and that the traditional principal-agent relationship is weak. Thus, in order to strengthen the individual in relation to the state, alternatives for exercising control and participation are required. An analysis of the legislative framework, i. e., the law as it is laid down in the books, shows that Russian administrative law is rights-based and that the character of Russian <b>public</b> law <b>adjudication</b> is closer to the Republican model than the Liberal. However, the Russian support structure is still weak and finds itself in an increasingly inhospitable environment – legally, financially, and politically. In addition, this dissertation concludes that Russia’s membership in the CoE has had an impact on judicial protection of individual rights within the sphere of public law in terms of: improving the legislative framework; developing Russian court jurisprudence referring to the ECHR and to the jurisprudence of the ECtHR; exerting pressure on the Russian state to improve practices of the state bureaucracy; stimulating individual legal activism, and increasing individuals’ knowledge and awareness of their lawful rights and how to implement them...|$|R

He acknowledged not having reported the matter to civil or ecclesiastical authorities at the time, saying, [...] "I did not think it was my prerogative to do so on my own" [...] (because the girl's parents had not chosen to report the matter to the police). The girl's mother, June Alexis, disputed this account, based on a 1978 letter from Bennison that she says indicate that he knew that their daughter was being abused by his brother, but did not tell them. John's ex-wife, Margaret Thompson, produced another letter from 1979 in which Charles Bennison asked her not to visit the parish because of the potential for [...] "a public scandal here which, I believe, could cost me my job."

40|$|American {{society does}} not require civil litigants to bear the actual cost of using the court; those costs are borne almost entirely by the {{taxpayer}} (i. e., the “civil judicial subsidy”). In this Article I ask: is that right? Or is there a more desirable way to apportion court usage costs {{between the state and}} litigants? I develop an evaluative framework that facilitates analysis of the purpose, contours, and cost of the current judicial subsidy. We subsidize court use because, in theory, there are certain “social positives” associated with <b>public</b> <b>adjudication.</b> To date the unspoken assumption has been that these social positives - which I categorize and identify - apply with equal force to all court uses by all players in all cases. To the extent that assumption is mistaken, a precisely measured, differentiated subsidy - one which distinguishes between different court uses and different players - may be more attractive than the status quo. I propose considering a partial user pays system, with a generous access subsidy to ensure non-wealthy litigants have court access; a subsidy for appeals; and a retributive tax on losing litigants (who are not otherwise exempted from costs) equal to the winner’s share of court costs. Such could recapture {{a significant portion of the}} current subsidy without threatening the social positives arising from <b>public</b> <b>adjudication...</b>|$|E
40|$|For a long time, {{arbitration}} was {{the only}} game in town for parties who wanted more flexibility in the adjudication of their disputes. They faced a dichotomous choice between accepting the public court system and its attendant procedural rules or opting out entirely and resolving their disputes in arbitration. Private process, however, 2 ̆ 2 has migrated in surprising ways into the public courts: despite public rules of procedure, judicial decisions increasingly are based on rules of procedure drafted by the parties.... 2 ̆ 2 This sort of private procedural ordering gives parties the ability to unbundle the off-the-rack procedures applied in public courts and bargain about individual rules. Customized procedure, in short, offers parties much of the flexibility that once seemed the prerogative of arbitration while maintaining the advantages of <b>public</b> <b>adjudication,</b> including, most significantly, rights to appeal and public subsidization. While arbitration has arguably be-come more like litigation, litigation may be becoming more like arbitration. The promise of more flexible <b>public</b> <b>adjudication</b> presents parties with significant benefits. Yet, given the potential gains from finely tuned procedure, it is puzzling that current empirical evidence suggests that few parties explore the full range of customization theoretically available to them. Indeed, while the evidence we have is far from perfect, it seems to indicate that parties are doing precious little fine-tuning, at least ex ante. This Article evaluates this doctrinal explanation for the puzzle created by the gap between the potential gains of customized procedure and the apparent reality that parties do little of it, at least before a dispute arises. It concludes that a close look at the doctrine does not bear this story out. To the contrary, while express authorization for many forms of customized procedure does not exist, the current trend of doctrine could not be clearer: courts seem ready to enforce parties 2 ̆ 7 autonomous procedural choices. Accordingly, there are minimal risks that a court will refuse to enforce or abide by a procedural customization so long as it does not suffer from some fundamental contract formation flaw, like unconscionability or fraud...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} a causal explanation of adjudicative compliance that {{is distinct from}} both the court 2 ̆ 7 s threat of sanctions and its institutional legitimacy. The new mechanism for compliance {{is the power of}} adjudicative expression. The theory of 2 ̆ 2 expressive adjudication 2 ̆ 2 arises from a previously neglected synergy among three expressive concepts in game theory -correlated equilibria, focal points, and signals. The article identifies the circumstances in which adjudicative expression can, by itself, influence the behavior of existing disputants and of future potential disputants. In each case, ambiguity in the relevant facts or the concepts underlying intentional and spontaneous order can cause a conflict that clarifying expression resolves. This expressive power explains otherwise puzzling instances of compliance with tribunals that lack the power of sanctions, and unifies theories of third-party norm enforcement with a theory of legal sanctions. Finally, the article examines certain normative implications of the expressive theory, including a novel function of adjudicative impartiality, a new justification for the system of <b>public</b> <b>adjudication,</b> and a trade-off between dispute resolution and dispute avoidance...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} the goods or {{services}} that government procures is obviously a very important consideration in deciding which supplier should be awarded a particular public tender. It follows that in the regulation of public procurement, particular attention {{should be given to}} the role of quality (also called functionality) in the <b>adjudication</b> of <b>public</b> tenders and the final award decision. In South African public procurement law, the role of functionality in <b>public</b> tender <b>adjudication</b> has been a fairly controversial issue that has resulted in a continuing interaction between courts and law-makers on how and when quality should be assessed and should impact on the final award decision within the framework for public procurement found in section 217 of the Constitution. This contribution tracks the development of the role of functionality in <b>public</b> tender <b>adjudication</b> as prescribed by public procurement regulation since the enactment of the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act 5 of 2000, which spearheaded the development of contemporary public procurement regulation in South Africa. The analysis shows how the role of functionality has constantly changed since the enactment of the PPPFA and remains uncertain. This uncertainty relates to different interpretations of the constitutional requirements for public procurement primarily contained in section 217 (1) of the Constitution. Whether functionality is used as a qualification criterion, an award criterion or both holds particular practical implications for both suppliers and contracting authorities. It is accordingly important to have certainty on this question. However, it cannot be said that the Constitution and section 217 in particular dictates one approach rather than another. The issue should thus be resolved with reference to the statutory scheme adopted under the PPPFA...|$|R

40|$|The article elaborates on {{the lack}} of {{objective}} guarantees of independence and impartiality in the existing system of investment treaty arbitration. This founds a case for an international investment court to replace the existing system. The argument proceeds in three steps: (1) investment treaty arbitration is uniquely a form of <b>public</b> law <b>adjudication,</b> constituted at the international level; (2) as constituted it does not satisfy standards of independence and impartiality in public law adjudication; and (3) various reasons that might be offered to justify this failing are unsatisfactory in light of the importance of these standards. For this reason, states should be encouraged to establish an international investment court in accordance with well-known principles of judicial decision-making. Above all, alternatives to the existing system should be measured against the criteria that typically apply in public law, especially the related principles of openness and independence. Absent these criteria being met, one does not have a system that depoliticizes disputes and subjects them to the rule of law, or that warrants the utmost respect of all parties, above all developing states...|$|R

40|$|By {{the time}} Professor Richard Delgado {{and his colleagues}} wrote their seminal article on the risk of {{alternative}} dispute resolution (ADR) facilitating prejudice, ADR programs were well-established in the United States, supported by legislative and court mandates, private contracts, and U. S. Supreme Court decisions. Fairness and Formality: Minimizing the Risk of Prejudice in Alternative Dispute Resolution and Delgado’s subsequent review article, ADR and the Dispossessed: Recent Books About the Deformalization Movement, were cited hundreds of times by scholars and practitioners but did little to stop the movement to substitute mediation, arbitration, and other dispute resolution procedures for <b>public</b> <b>adjudication.</b> Conflict resolution theorists and practitioners celebrated mediation for its relationship-preserving and restorative potential, judges celebrated ADR in its various forms for its potential to reduce court workloads, and institutional defendants publicly welcomed the possibility of reducing legal expenses and delay by relying on mediation and arbitration in lieu of litigation. Informal dispute resolution was touted by all {{as an antidote to}} the presumed burdens court procedures imposed on lay litigants. Privately, many corporate defendants hoped that ADR would diminish claiming rates or diminish the settlement value of claims (or both). Delgado et al. hypothesized that because ADR procedures frequently incorporate features that social science research has identified as facilitating prejudice, the procedures would produce biased outcomes. Although framed in normative terms, their hypothesis is subject to empirical testing. In the three decades following the publication of Fairness and Formality, a small cadre of socio-legal scholars took up this challenge. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, we identified thirty-eight efforts to test empirically the hypothesis that mediation and arbitration create systematic differences in dispute resolution outcomes by gender, race, ethnicity or socio-economic stratum. Using a variety of methods, including laboratory and field experiments, surveys, and analyses of reported outcomes, empiricists have produced contrary and ultimately inconclusive results. Small samples and lack of methodological rigor reduce the reliability of the published findings. In sum, {{the answer to the question}} whether informal dispute resolution facilitates prejudice is “we don’t know. ” In an era of increasing economic inequality and ever louder expressions of racial, ethnic, and gender prejudice, we have a responsibility to learn more about how public policies that continue to favor alternative dispute resolution are affecting less powerful groups in U. S. society. At the same time, rather than turning our backs on <b>public</b> <b>adjudication,</b> we should invest in ensuring that our courts truly provide “equal justice for all. ...|$|E
40|$|A central goal in {{devising a}} system of courts is to make {{judicial}} services easily accessible. As a consequence, justice is usually administered in a geographically decentralized fashion: trial courts are distributed across the territory in which the jurisdiction’s law is applied. Corporate law, however, does not fit this pattern: courts are often located {{far away from the}} companies subject to their jurisdiction. In particular, Delaware law governs most publicly-traded firms in the U. S., and is now extending its reach to encompass corporations headquartered around the globe. But Delaware courts are located only in Delaware. Consequently, there is a large and growing disparity between the geographic area where Delaware law is applied and the location of Delaware courts. This disparity is all the more striking because the quality of the Delaware judiciary is a prime reason why firms incorporate under Delaware law. This situation provokes a simple question: would it not be both desirable and feasible to have Delaware, and other jurisdictions whose law has extraterritorial reach, hold hearings and trials out of state? The creation of such extraterritorial courts might well yield significant benefits: litigation costs could be lowered, and regulatory competition between jurisdictions could be increased with regard to both substantive corporate law and judicial services. This paper explores the issues involved in such a regime of extraterritorial courts. We consider those issues as they arise within the U. S., within the EU, and globally. We largely limit our analysis to courts whose jurisdiction is confined to corporate law. We note, however, that much of what we say applies as well to other areas of commercial law. Moreover, whatever the merits of extraterritorial courts as a practical proposal, in exploring their promise we gain important perspective on the basic relationships among substantive law, adjudication, territoriality, and sovereignty, and on the differences between private arbitration and <b>public</b> <b>adjudication...</b>|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of this thesis are to clarify and distinguish {{the existence of}} regulatory expropriation from other types of indirect expropriation and to propose alternative ways to rescrutinise regulatory expropriation in light of its establishment and justification in international law. In pursuing the first objective, the research delves into certain national, regional, and international contexts, identifying the key features of regulatory expropriation – for instance, regulatory autonomy and regulatory interference – and conducts an extensive exploration of the relevant principles of international law. This exploration concentrates especially on the doctrine of police power and on principles that can contribute to an elaborated application of the doctrine for the identification of regulatory expropriation. With regard to the second objective, the research examines the principle of necessity in international law that functions to preclude the wrongfulness of a state’s act and also {{takes into account the}} interacting relationship between customary international law and bilateral investment agreements. In addition, the research goes a step further by means of its analysis of the necessity exception in WTO law. This thesis puts forward the conclusion that an arbitral approach to bona fide regulatory expropriation that can be justified in international law, if {{it is based on the}} elaborated application of the doctrine of police power and on the application of the principle of proportionality within the framework of the ends-means and the cause-effect, will be more desirable for investment treaty arbitration given that arbitration is a type of <b>public</b> law <b>adjudication...</b>|$|R
40|$|The rules {{governing}} {{judicial review of}} adjudication by federal agencies are insensitive to a critical separation of powers principle. Article III jurisprudence requires different treatment of agency adjudication {{depending on whether the}} agency is adjudicating a “private right” or a “public right. ” When agencies adjudicate private rights, review of the agency adjudication must be available to an Article III court on a direct appellate basis. In contrast, Article III jurisprudence does not require review to an Article III court on a direct appellate basis of agency <b>adjudications</b> of purely <b>public</b> rights. That means that federal courts reviewing agency adjudications of private rights have a greater responsibility for vindicating Article III values than federal courts reviewing <b>public</b> rights <b>adjudications.</b> Administrative law’s deference doctrines do not reflect this distinction. The degree of deference courts owe to agencies does not vary depending on whether adjudication involves “public” or “private” rights, in the Article III sense of those terms. In either case, Article III courts review agency adjudication deferentially. This Article challenges that indifference. Courts should calibrate their degree of deference in accordance with the Article III line and apply more robust review to agency adjudication where private rights are at stake. This approach would vindicate separation of powers values, promote better administrative decisionmaking in private rights cases, and dovetail with entrenched doctrines of constitutional and administrative law. Interestingly, the logic of Article III elaborated here suggests one explanation for why some federal courts, in certain cases implicating quasi-private rights, are declining to defer to agency adjudications in a manner recognized to be inconsistent with the demands of ordinary administrative law...|$|R
40|$|This article uses a 2 ̆ 2 process {{characteristics}} and values 2 ̆ 2 approach {{to make the}} case against displacing arbitration finality with substantive judicial review. It responds to a trio of articles in a forthcoming Nevada Law Review symposium on whether and how the Federal Arbitration Act should be amended. In one article, Nevada Law Professor Jeffrey Stempel contends all arbitration awards should be subject to substantive judicial review similar to that of public trial courts. In a second article, Ohio State Professor Sarah Cole argues that substantive review should generally be permitted when the parties agree to it by contract, an issue now pending before the U. S. Supreme Court. In the third article, Kansas Professor Chris Drahozal contends substantive review of arbitration awards should be available for arbitral awards that are in manifest disregard of the law, thus generally codifying a widely held common law view. While all of the arguments they present are plausible and have their compelling points, they nonetheless miss the mark, and rather widely. In my view the displacement of finality with substantive judicial review, if codified, will greatly undermine virtually all of the central {{process characteristics}} and values of arbitration, its attractiveness as an alternative to <b>public</b> <b>adjudication</b> or negotiated settlement, and its utility as an aid to the judiciary as a forum for the expeditious resolution of disputes. Rather than requiring or permitting substantive judicial review, in my view the FAA should continue to hold the line with its limited grounds for judicial review, and make clear that parties cannot contract for substantive judicial review and that courts cannot engage in substantive review for awards that are in manifest disregard of the law. Further, Congress should reclaim its legacy and amend the FAA to make clear that arbitration under the Act must be based on an actual agreement to arbitrate in order to ameliorate some of the underlying concerns that may in part be animating the Stempel, Cole, and Drahozal proposals...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of courts as “open” and “public” institutions is commonplace in national and transnational conventions. But even as those attributes are taken for granted, {{the privatization of}} adjudication is underway. This paper explores how - {{during the last few}} centuries - public procedures came {{to be one of the}} attributes defining certain decision-making institutions as “courts. ” The political and theoretical predicates for such practices can be found in the work of Jeremy Bentham, a major proponent of what he termed “publicity,” a practice he commended for various entities from the Panopticon for prisoners to the Parliament and courts for legislators and judges. Bentham argued the utility of publicity in enhancing accuracy, public education, and judicial discipline. Moving forward in time, I examine various contemporary techniques in several jurisdictions that shift the processes of adjudication toward privatization. Included are the devolving adjudication to less-public government entities such as administrative agencies; outsourcing to private providers; and reconfiguring the processes of courts to render them more oriented toward settlement. For those appreciative of the role courts play in developing and protecting human rights, these new practices are problematic because adjudication can itself be a site offering opportunities to engage in democratic practices. The odd etiquette entailed in <b>public</b> <b>adjudication</b> under democratic legal regimes imposes obligations on government anddisputants to treat each other - before an observant and often times critical public - as equals. Public and private power can be constrained by such performative requirements. When decision making takes place in public, the application of law to fact can engender normative contestation predicated on popular input. This claim of public adjudication’s democratic potential and utilities is, however, not an argument that the judgments provided and the norms developed will necessarily advance a shared view of thepublic welfare. Hence, while eager to re-engage Bentham, I offer different claims for publicity and less optimism about its consequences...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the {{appropriate}} design of the forum for adjudication of employment disputes. By the term “adjudication,” we refer to the resolution of “rights” disputes – disputes over {{the application of a}} contract or the application of a statutory or regulatory rule to a particular factual situation. We are not referring to “interests” disputes – disputes over the substantive content of an initial contract or renewal agreement. In considering the design question, we assume that all involved actors, (employees, employers, unions, etc.) retain whatever endowments they currently possess in terms of intelligence, energy, income, occupational status, access to resources, union representation, and statutory and contractual rights. Holding these endowments constant, we ask what institutional arrangements for adjudicating rights disputes would do the best job of resolving those disputes in a fair, efficient manner for workers, managers and the public generally. On the legislative front, we oppose current efforts in Congress to amend the Federal Arbitration Act to prohibit predispute arbitration agreements. At least if applied in the employment context, this is a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water. Employment arbitration, if it is properly structured and regulated, improves the likelihood that employees, and most especially those who are relatively low-paid, will be able to obtain an adjudication on the merits of their rights disputes with the employer. Abolition of employment arbitration simply relegates those employees to the courts to fare as best they can on their own in a complex, formal litigation environment. Based on what is practically and politically feasible as of this writing, employer-promulgated ADR should be the basis of an employment adjudication system that supplements the work of courts, administrative agencies and, in the union sector, the grievance and arbitration process. We say this because unless adequate resources are provided to administrative agency adjudicators or courts to handle responsibly the vast increase in self-represented employee claims – which we think unlikely – the appropriate legislative response, even for critics of employer-promulgated ADR, is to develop safeguards that help minimize their concerns without driving employers to abandon the process entirely. If we were starting from scratch, we would be inclined to consider a system similar to Great Britain’s. The UK approach started as a wrongful dismissal statute and over time also assumed adjudicatory authority over discrimination claims. The UK system mixes government-supplied mediation services with a tripartite government-funded, <b>public</b> <b>adjudication.</b> The system supersedes any common law cause of action for breach of the employment agreement and employment statutes; employment disputes that go to the regular civil courts are limited to libel and slander, certain torts and claims for injunctive relief for breach of restrictive covenants. Class actions are not authorized. There may be some institutional features of the UK approach that are difficult to replicate here. One such feature is the tripartite adjudicatory structure used in England. With our low union density in private companies and the fact that employers tend not to form representative associations in the employment law field, it will take some ingenuity to develop a regularized procedure for selecting employer- and employee-side adjudicators. The more difficult question is whether there is any political will to adopt something like the UK system. Lawyers representing employees would not necessarily oppose such legislation if they could remove all caps on recovery and retain their ability to bring lawsuits (including class actions) in the courts. Employers might support such legislation, if it did not include abolition of employment at-will and there was some institutional guarantee of modest awards of the UK variety. Most employees, we believe, would be best off under the UK approach but we cannot get there politically. Therein lies the dilemma for law reform. We do believe, however, that working with what is in place at many companies, much can be done to improve employer-promulgated ADR to pick up many of the desirable features of the UK approach but in an American flavor responsive to U. S. legal and popular culture...|$|E

Monetary costs include costs of medical care, future earning/lost wages, <b>public</b> services, <b>adjudication</b> and sanctioning, and property damage and loss. Quality-of-life costs are based on the current U. S Department of Transportation value of statistical life, which increased substantially compared to previous editions of this study. The unit costs for costs for crimes and crashes were computed in a comparable manner. These unit costs were applied to 2015 Michigan traffic crash and index crime incidence data to estimate dollar losses from traffic crashes and index crimes to the state and for each county within the state. Crash costs associated with alcohol-involved traffic crashes, unrestrained occupants of passenger cars, teen-driver-involved crashes, motorcycle crashes, and large truck crashes were also calculated. Findings indicate index crimes in Michigan in 2015 resulted in $ 622 million in monetary costs and $ 2. 6 billion in total ({{monetary and}} nonmonetary quality-of-life) costs. Overall traffic crashes in Michigan in 2015 resulted in $ 4. 6 billion in monetary costs and $ 19. 3 billion in total costs.

40|$|In common-law systems, the {{standard}} of proof for ordinary civil cases requires the party who bears {{the burden of proof}} to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts alleged are true.

This striking difference in common-law and civil-law procedures has received very little attention from either civilian or comparative scholars. The preponderance standard applied in common-law systems is openly probabilistic and produces, on average, more accurate results. This makes continued civilian adherence to a standard of virtual certainty mysterious. The article offers both historical reasons for the divergence between common-law and civil-law standards of proof and tentative explanations for the modern persistence of a high standard of proof in civil-law countries. The most plausible of these explanations is that the high civil-law standard conveys an impression of accuracy and certainty, and thus enhances the perceived legitimacy of judicial decisions.

40|$|Arbitrators are the {{lightning}} rod for investment arbitration’s most contentious political debates. Investment arbitration was originally conceived {{as a means to}} depoliticize international investment law. The regime was designed to extricate investment disputes from national courts and gunboat diplomacy, entrusting them instead to a neutral law-bound process. According to its critics, however, investment arbitration is neither a neutral, nor a legitimate law-bound process. They lay most of the blame with international arbitrators. Critics contend that, instead of law and appropriate policy considerations, investment arbitrators’ decisions are often the product of extra-legal factors — from their own ideology, to the nature of disputants, to their personal self-interest For every hypothesis about what extra-legal factors affect investment arbitrators’ decisions, {{there seems to be an}} equal and opposite hypothesis. The purpose of this paper is to examine the state of empirical research about investment arbitrators as a tool for developing a more comprehensive understanding of international adjudication. Through the lens of specific reform proposals that draw from empirical studies in the field, it analyzes the limitations and potential contributions of empirical research to the development of investment arbitration. Part I of this paper examines some of the methodological challenges raised by empirical research that seeks to prove or disprove these claims about investment arbitrators. Part II offers an evaluation of selected reforms that have been proposed for investment arbitration based, in part, on some findings in empirical research. In Section A, I examine Albert van den Berg’s study of dissenting opinions by party-appointed arbitrators, and related proposals to dramatically reduce if not eliminate dissenting opinions. Section B examines Gus Van Harten’s study of jurisdictional rulings, and related proposal for a permanent International Investment Court. Part III examines the risks of allowing substantive policy preferences to affect empirical analysis, and argues for integration of research about investment arbitrators into a comprehensive theory of international adjudication as a neutral and law-bound process. To that end, it proposes that future research be integrated into comparative institutional analysis with other forms of <b>public</b> international <b>adjudication</b> to develop a more comprehensive theory of international adjudication...|$|R
40|$|Scholars have {{approached}} arbitration, especially under the Federal Arbitration Act, {{from a variety}} of perspectives, including doctrinal, historical, empirical, and practical. One aspect that has not yet been fully considered, however, is the relationship between arbitration and constitutional democracy. Yet, as a dispute-resolution process that is often sanctioned by the government, that sometimes inextricably intertwines governmental and private conduct, and that derives its legitimacy from the government, it is appropriate [...] indeed, our responsibility [...] to ask whether arbitration furthers the goals of democratic governance. It is only sensible that state-supported dispute resolution in a democracy should strengthen, rather than diminish, democratic governance and the civil society that supports it. The debate over “mandatory arbitration” [...] that is, the imposition of binding arbitration through contracts of adhesion, employee handbooks, consumer terms and conditions, and other unilaterally drafted documents, under the authority of the Federal Arbitration Act and related state laws [...] seems to call the question. Since the late 1980 s, plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 and defense lawyers have been engaged in an intense battle over mandatory arbitration in the courts, the legislatures, and the media. This is not merely a fight over a pocketbook issue. Rather, the deeply felt arguments of both sides resonate with the most fundamental of democratic virtues: individual liberty, the rule of law, and fundamental fairness. This is not surprising considering the profound importance {{of the rule of law}} and dispute resolution in the daily functioning of any democracy. What is surprising, however, is how little scholarly or judicial attention has been given to the topic. With rare exception, the question of the relationship between arbitration and democracy, or for that matter, democracy and dispute resolution generally, has simply fallen through the cracks of scholarly attention. A full exploration of the relationship between democracy and dispute resolution is beyond the scope of this inquiry. This article seeks only to bring the submerged issue of arbitration 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to democracy to the surface of the mandatory arbitration debate. Its goal is relatively modest: to recognize and articulate the relationship between democracy and arbitration as an issue worth considering, to analyze the democratic character of arbitration, and to suggest some implications of this assessment. The discussion draws primarily upon U. S. constitutional democracy, but hopefully is broad enough to begin to inform the experiences of other democracies. Part II establishes an operative understanding of what democracy is, explores the role of dispute resolution in a democracy, and identifies certain core substantive values of democratic governance that may be used to assess the democratic character of a dispute-resolution method, process, or system, namely: personal autonomy, participation, accountability, transparency, rationality, equality, due process, and the promotion of a strong civil society. Part II suggests that <b>public</b> <b>adjudication</b> represents a high embodiment these values and that, under U. S. democracy, it constitutes democracy 2 ̆ 7 s endowment for dispute resolution. Part III applies this lens of democratic theory to arbitration and concludes that arbitration has a contingent democratic character: As a dispute-resolution process, arbitration is generally undemocratic, but it acquires democratic legitimacy when parties actually agree to arbitrate their disputes because it furthers the unifying democratic value of personal autonomy. When involuntary, however, arbitration only frustrates the larger goals of democratic governance. Part IV discusses the potentially significant systemic costs of institutionalized, mandatory, and binding arbitration: the possible diminishment of public trust in the rule of law as an institution, and a concomitant erosion of the social capital that is necessary for effective democracy. Finally, the Article concludes by raising some theoretical, empirical, and practical questions for further research, including how a recognition of arbitration 2 ̆ 7 s contingent democratic character might be integrated into U. S. law...|$|E
40|$|This essay – and {{the thirty}} images {{included}} – reflect themes in Representing Justice: Invention, Controversy, and Rights in City-States and Democratic Courtrooms, {{in which we}} explored the relationship, over centuries, between courts and democracy. We argue that courts {{as we know them}} today are recent inventions. The constitutive elements – open access, independent judges authorized to sit in judgment of the state and to assess the fairness of their own as well as other decision-making procedures, equal and dignified treatment of all participants – are outgrowths of social movements that transformed the meaning of legal “personhood,” the idea of justice, and the obligations of government. Yet the new equality puts pressure on the visual displays within courthouses, often marked as such by a statute of the Virtue Justice. As women and men of all colors gained recognition as rights holders, entitled to sue and be sued, to testify, and to judge, a female figure of Justice, became less an abstraction and more a representation of a person. But who should decide how “she” – Justice – is to look? Once, elite groups of rulers and patrons controlled commissions – filling courthouses with portraits of elder statesmen along with the draped (or naked) female figure of Justice. In contrast, during thetwentieth century, conflicts over Justice’s color and shape came to the fore. Protests, detailed below, erupted in the 1930 s about a “mulatto” Justice in a federal courthouse in Aiken, South Carolina. The result was to put the image behind drapes. In contrast, inthe same era, a mural on the Ada County Courthouse in Idaho displayed an “Indian” with hands tied behind his back and about to be strung up by gun-carrying men. Pressures of another kind are undermining the public and didactic practices of adjudication. Democracy has not only changedcourts but also challenged them profoundly. Egalitarianism poses deep problems for polities that have thus far been unwilling to commit the resources that would support all the adjudicatory opportunities promised. As the ranks of rights holders expanded, nations responded not only by creating more judgeships and more courthouses but also by moving some forms of adjudication offsite, to administrative tribunals and to procedures that have come to be known by the acronym ADR – alternative dispute resolution. The resulting fragmentation and privatization of adjudication has profound implications for the democratic character ofcourts. The movement away from <b>public</b> <b>adjudication</b> is a problem for democracies because adjudication has important contributions to make to democracy. By democracy, we speak not of majoritarian political processes but rather of aspirations for lawmaking through egalitarian methods that foster popular input into governing norms and impose robust constraints on both public andprivate power. Furthermore, by courts, we focus on the quotidian activities of ordinary litigation rather than only on the outcomesof the highest judicial bodies. Constitutional scholars debate the legitimacy of judicial review in democracies, while we argue that adjudication itself is a democratic process, which reconfigures power as it obliges disputants and judges to treat each other as equals, to provide information to each other, and to offer public justifications for decisions, based on the interaction of fact andnorm. Courts’ mandate to operate in public endows the audience – the public – with the ability and the authority of critique. Through such participatory parity, public processes both teach about democratic practices of norm development and offer theopportunity for popular input to produce changes in legal rights. The redundancy of various claims of rights enables debate aboutthe underlying legal rules. The particular structural obligations of trial level courts have advantages for producing, redistributing, and curbing power in a fashion that is generative in democracies. Our account is not only a reconstruction of a many-century history of the idea of “courts” and a normative exploration of the utilityof courts for democratic orders. Our aim is also to make plain the fragility and contingency of the twentieth-century project for which the word “court” has become a shorthand. While monumental in ambition and often in physical girth, the durability of courtsas active sites of public exchange before independent jurists ought not be taken for granted. Like other venerable institutions ofthe eighteenth century – the postal service and the press – courts are vulnerable. The continuation of accessible court services for ordinary disputants seeking state assistance is far from assured...|$|E
40|$|In this essay—considering 2 ̆ 2 privacy 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secrecy 2 ̆ 2 in courts—I first offer a {{brief history}} of the <b>public</b> performance, through <b>adjudication,</b> of the power of rulers, who relied on open rituals of {{judgment}} and punishment to make and maintain law and order. Second, I turn to consider why, during the twentieth century, the federal courts became an unusually good source of information about legal, political, and social conflict. Third, I map how, despite new information technologies, knowledge about conflicts and their resolution is being limited by the devolution of court authority to agencies, by the outsourcing of decisions to private providers, and by the internalization in courts of rules that promote private management and settlement of conflicts in lieu of adjudication. Fourth, I argue that deployment of new procedures of dispute resolution requires new answers to questions about what processes should be presumptively public and that, given their political implications, these answers should not be left to judges, as rulemakers or doctrine-producers alone. Fifth, I explain why new regulations are needed to protect the public dimensions of courts and to create public dimensions for their alternatives. Public processes generate not only knowledge about the uses of power but also a commitment to fair treatment by government, to accountability in government, and to norm development, all of which should not be controlled exclusively by the parties to a dispute nor by those empowered to resolve it...|$|R
40|$|In this article, the {{possible}} tension between adjudication, {{understood as a}} public service, on the one hand, and the inevitable tendencies in a modern democracy towards the rationalization and personalization of this service, on the other, will be analysed. It will be shown that these tendencies in themselves {{do not have to}} be problematic, but that some particular manifestations thereof indeed are. To understand why this is the case, we need a thorough understanding of the <b>public</b> character of <b>adjudication</b> and its significance for society as a whole. It will be shown that the notion of the public realm, as elaborated by Hannah Arendt, gives us an interesting and important starting point for such an understanding. While her thinking provides strong foundations for modern democracy, it also provides a footing for a critical analysis of the rationalization and personalization of modern society. The insights of Arendt will be used to understand and critically assess recent developments in law and adjudication. Not only will we discover the crucial part which the judiciary plays in a democratic society, but also that to be able to play this part some limits of rationalization and personalization must be respected. First, the notion of the public realm will be elaborated. Next, it will be explained why law and adjudication can be understood as prerequisites of this public realm. After that, the phenomena of rationalization and personalization in modern society will be analysed. It will be explained how these phenomena can disintegrate the public realm, and also how they affect law and adjudication. At the end a positive account of law and adjudication as the backbone of the public realm will be given, in describing their place in the public realm ‘middle’ between a rational and a personal approach...|$|R
40|$|Almost unnoticed, a {{new kind}} of {{adjudication}} system has appeared in American law. In forty-one states and the District of Columbia, special entities have been established to resolve contract and tort claims. State law created and mandates each system; these are not arbitrations agreed to by contract between the parties. Despite their public nature, however, these systems are not offered or operated by courts; the <b>public</b> function of <b>adjudication</b> is entirely outsourced to private actors. The decision-makers are neither elected nor appointed, nor are they public sector employees; they work in private companies. Most do not write opinions, and they neither establish nor follow precedent. These new entities are the external review systems set up to resolve disputes between patients and managed care organizations (MCOs), which arise when such organizations deny coverage for medical treatment, services, or equipment that the patient, generally upon the recommendation of a physician, believes to be medically necessary. When pre-authorization for care is required, the coverage decision about whether to pay also becomes in effect a treatment decision that determines whether the care will ever be rendered. The payor 2 ̆ 7 s decision merges with and trumps what used to be solely the treating physician 2 ̆ 7 s decision. It is this massive shift in the ramifications of these disputes that has caused lawmakers to pay much greater attention to the processes for resolving them. This Article examines how legal, political, and economic change produced a new adjudicatory mechanism for resolving disputes between patients and MCOs. It is in essence a case study of the multiple determinants of procedure in a particular field-health law-at a time of rapid change in the underlying industry. We will see how these changes, plus a broader cultural shift toward less acceptance of professional omniscience, are reshaping our core concepts of medical decision-making in an increasingly corporate environment. Through close analysis of this example, we can also learn a significant amount about newly-emerging models of procedural justice...|$|R
40|$|In a {{democracy}} {{it is the}} citizens who choose their leaders. Through elections, the people constitute government to preside over public affairs. However, in several African countries {{the quality of the}} elections has been vitiated by fraud, incompetence, unequal playing field and violence. Part of the problem is historical. Within the first decade of attaining independence in the 1950 s and 1960 s, many African regimes rapidly descended into autocracy and many countries formally recognised one-party regimes. Despite many one-party regimes having been abolished after the democratisation wave of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, challenges of holding free and fair elections persist. Several elections held since this democratic wave were generally not considered by independent observers as free and fair. Indeed Africa has become well known for flawed elections, such {{as was the case in}} the 2007 elections in Kenya, the 2008 elections in Zimbabwe and the 2010 elections in Ivory Coast. Due to the stifled democratic climate, where even elections had a predetermined outcome, coups became a common and regular method of showing discontent or removing government. While the phenomenon of problematic elections is going on, at the continental level, Africa seems to be making renewed commitment towards democratic governance. With the transformation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) into the African Union (AU) through the adoption of the Constitutive Act of the African Union in 2000, the AU, inter alia, committed to promoting “democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance” and seems determined to depart from the legacy of poor governance. It is in view of the foregoing background that this research sought to investigate the challenges the judiciary in Africa has faced in adjudicating presidential election disputes. And, in light of the growing trend towards establishing common African democratic standards and seeking collective solutions, the research also sought to explore the viability of establishing a continental supranational mechanism for resolving disputed presidential elections through <b>adjudication.</b> <b>Public,</b> Constitutional and International LawLL.

40|$|International {{customary}} law requires interpreting treaties and settling related disputes ‘in conformity with principles of justice’ {{and the human}} rights obligations of states. Yet, in contrast to UN law, European economic law and related adjudication by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and European courts, international trade and investment agreements and related adjudication tend to avoid references to ‘principles of justice’ and human rights. This contribution argues for a more coherent ‘judicial methodology’ in multilevel economic adjudication {{in order to promote}} ‘judicial comity’ and transnational rule of law for the benefit of citizens. As the incorporation of human rights into positive international law entails the recognition of individuals as legal subjects, judicial regard to human rights and other ‘principles of justice’ is indispensable for determining the ‘object and purpose’ of modern international economic law (IEL) (i). By acknowledging the ‘dual nature’ of modern legal systems (ii) and the common core of ‘principles of justice’ underlying multilevel guarantees of equal freedoms and sovereign rights to protect <b>public</b> interests, economic <b>adjudication</b> could become more legitimate and more coherent (iii). The ‘methodological individualism’ underlying human rights law (HRL) and constitutional democracies justifies a presumption of conceptualizing private and public economic regulation as integral parts of IEL aimed at protecting reasonable self-interests and equal rights of citizens (iv). The ‘consistent interpretation principle’ recognized in national and international legal systems confirms the need for ‘de-fragmenting IEL’ based on ‘normative individualism’ (v). Economic adjudication derives its constitutional legitimacy from protecting ‘constitutional justice’ as a constitutive principle not only of HRL but also of modern trade and investment adjudication (vi) It requires respect for legitimate ‘constitutional pluralism’ (vii) and transnational cooperation among courts so as to protect rule of law {{not only in terms of}} rights of governments but also for the benefit of private economic actors (viii). Judicial rule-clarification (ix) and judicial ‘system building’ are necessary parts of judicial protection of transnational rule of law so as to improve the ‘incomplete’, fragmented and often power-driven IEL system for the benefit of citizens as the ultimate sources of values and democratic owners of governance institutions (x) ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{dependable}} ways of demonstrating the inconsistency of a general principle, theory, or proposition is to deduce some necessarily contradictory consequences from its major premises. In 1849, Gustave de Molinari confronted his fellows at the Journal Des Economistes—a bastion of free-market thought—with this Aristotelian truth using a disturbing alternative. Either the laissez-faire principle is firmly grounded and thus always applies {{to the production of}} every good, and hence must apply to the administration of justice, or this principle is partial and relative, which is to say, it is not a principle at all. Either it is logical and true that the production of security should remain subject, {{in the interest of the}} consumers, to the law of free competition, or “the principles on which economic science is based are invalid ” (Molinari 1849, p. 280). Molinari was challenging the premises on which the economic functionality of the state (including the <b>public</b> provision of <b>adjudication)</b> is based. He was addressing the legitimacy of a dichotomy which is still prevalent in economics today. Indeed, this statement from the first modern libertarian (Hart 1981 a,b; 1982; and Hoppe 1989) brilliantly underscores the tension that results from the coexistence of different analytical standards within the same logical framework. Moreover, this seemingly provocative proposition hides a more fundamental question: What is an economic good? This elementary problem of where to draw the borders of the realm of economic analysis should elicit a common solution within the profession, but it does not. Hence, a restatement of the essential features of what constitutes an economic good may help to clarify some fundamental controversies such as whether markets can provide justice and security. Therefore, this article aims to show that these controversies are rooted in incompatible definitions of a good or, more accurately, of what makes a good an economic good. What is at stake in the definition of an economic good goes well beyond semantics; it goes to the heart of crucial analytical and normative issues. On the GAEL J.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} role of law as a tool in struggles against social inequalities, by tracing the history of Ontario’s human rights legislation and enforcement from the enactment of fair practices statutes in the 1950 s through the restructuring of the enforcement regime in 2006. Ontario was the first Canadian province to pass anti-discrimination legislation and to establish a human rights commission enforcement process. This legislation and the commission enforcement process were the models for all other Canadian jurisdictions. The dissertation approaches {{the role of}} law through the framework of tensions between the “aspirations” and the “practices” of law. On the one hand, law holds out the promise of enhancing citizen agency and imposing responsibility for conduct by promoting access to justice {{through the power of}} legal norms, institutions, and enforcement and other processes. On the other hand, efforts to fulfill this promise raise questions about the content of legal norms, the operation of legal institutions, the practice of legal processes, and the relationship between law and social power. The historical record examined in the dissertation shows human rights advocates successfully engaging {{the power of the state}} to enact anti-discrimination legal norms, but then facing new challenges in their efforts to engage the power of the state to enforce these norms. Although access to the coercive power of law was a consistent theme in the advocacy for anti-discrimination legislation and enforcement, in practice there has been relatively little access to this power. Both the government agency model, and the tribunal model which replaced it, have emphasized informal, non-public and voluntary resolution over formal, <b>public,</b> more coercive <b>adjudication.</b> The emphasis on private, voluntary resolution of anti-discrimination claims may increase the potential for private social outcomes, however, these social outcomes may also reflect rather than redress imbalances in social power relations. The emphasis on private, voluntary resolution also has the potential to limit the public development of anti-discrimination legal norms. Thus, while anti-discrimination legislated norms have become important tools for citizen agency, this agency has arguably been most effective outside of the formal legal enforcement processes...|$|R
40|$|Can {{eighteenth-century}} constitutional {{commitments that}} “courts shall be open” for private rights enforcement be coupled with twentieth-century aspirations that democratic orders provide “equal justice under law”? That question {{sits at the}} intersection of three cases, AT 2 ̆ 6 T v. Concepcion, Wal-Mart v. Dukes, and Turner v. Rogers, decided in the 2010 Supreme Court Term. In each decision, Justices evaluated the fairness of particular procedures (class arbitrations, class actions, or civil contempt processes) when making choices about the meaning of governing legal regimes - the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and state unconscionability doctrine in AT 2 ̆ 6 T; Rule 23 and Title VII in Wal-Mart; and the Due Process Clause and child support obligations in Turner. AT 2 ̆ 6 T and Wal-Mart presented related questions about how the form of dispute resolution (individual or aggregate) and the place of dispute resolution (public or private, state or federal) affect the level of public regulation of consumer and employment transactions predicated on boilerplate, rather than negotiated, terms. The issue in Turner was whether state-funded lawyers were required before a person could, {{at the behest of the}} child’s custodian, be incarcerated for contempt for failure to pay child support. The specific case involved two individuals, but their circumstances illustrated the challenges faced by millions of other lawyer-less litigants in state and federal courts. Each case exemplifies the challenges that new rights, produced by twentieth-century social movements, pose for courts. When claimants such as consumers, employees, and household members presented themselves as entitled to equal treatment, jurists responded by interrogating their own procedural parameters. Relying on the Due Process Clause, courts developed distinct lines of analyses that - depending on the context - imposed criteria on decisionmaking procedures, mandated subsidies to address resource asymmetries between adversaries, shaped processes to reduce intra-litigant disparities, and facilitated access to courts. Requisite to those efforts was a practice that is intertwined with fairness - the <b>public</b> quality of <b>adjudication</b> that endows an audience with the authority to watch, critique, and respond through democratic channels to the legal norms announced. A “fairand public hearing” became a touchstone of what democratic orders required their courts to provide. But, as this trio of cases demonstrates, whether seeking to implement those egalitarian aspirations or simply to function, courts have to grapple with economically disparate claimants and a vast volume of eligible rights holders. If eighteenth-century constitutional entitlements to open courts are to remain relevant to ordinary litigants, the question is not whether to aggregate, subsidize, and reconfigure process but how to do so “fairly,” in terms of what groups, which claims, by means of which procedures, and offering what remedies. But without public disclosures and oversight of dispute resolution - in and out of court, single file and aggregated - one has no way to know whether fairness is either a goal or a result...|$|R
