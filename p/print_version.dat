The <b>print</b> <b>version</b> comprises ten 500-page volumes. The first edition was published in January 2003 by the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, {{with a plan to}} update it every two years. The second edition was issued in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times International Edition is a <b>print</b> <b>version</b> of {{the paper}} {{tailored}} for readers outside the United States. Formerly {{a joint venture with}} The Washington Post named The International Herald Tribune, The New York Times took full ownership {{of the paper}} in 2002 and has gradually integrated it more closely into its domestic operations.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 the Monitor {{discontinued}} its daily <b>print</b> <b>version</b> {{to focus}} on web-based publishing, replacing its daily print edition with a weekly news magazine with an international focus. Mark Sappenfield became the editor in March 2017.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2016, a {{press release}} emanating from then owner FriendFinder Networks {{announced}} that Penthouse would shutter its print operations and move to all digital. However, managing director Kelly Holland quickly disavowed the decision and pledged to keep the <b>print</b> <b>version</b> of the magazine alive.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012 the Daily Mail {{published}} an apology following a piece written by Littlejohn which insinuated that ethnic minority staff had got their jobs through discrimination and {{had threatened to}} sue the Equality and Human Rights Commissions.

25|$|While {{most of the}} {{character}} designs and basic settings were directly adapted from the original manga, the restructured plot of the movie differs considerably from the <b>print</b> <b>version,</b> pruning much {{of the second half}} of the series. The film Akira is regarded by many critics as a landmark anime film, one that influenced much of the art in the anime world that followed its release.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, Vander Ark was {{contacted}} by Roger Rapoport, President of RDR Books, and {{asked about the}} possibility of publishing a for-profit <b>print</b> <b>version</b> of the site. Although Vander Ark had previously claimed he had no interest in doing so, Rapoport assured Vander Ark that such a publication would be legal. To further pacify Vander Ark's concerns, he added an addendum to the contract that stated that RDR Books would act to defend him in any future lawsuits.|$|E
25|$|In early 2010, Bonnier {{partnered with}} London-based design firm BERG to create Mag+, a {{magazine}} publishing platform for tablets. In April 2010, Popular Science+, the first title on the Mag+ platform, {{launched in the}} iTunes Store {{the same day the}} iPad launched. The app contains all the content in the <b>print</b> <b>version</b> as well as added content and digital-only extras. Bonnier has since launched several more titles on the Mag+ platform, including Popular Photography+ and Transworld Snowboarding+.|$|E

25|$|In 1990 the Britannica's sales {{reached an}} all-time high of $650 million, but Encarta, {{released}} in 1993, soon became a software staple with almost every computer purchase and the Britannica's market share plummeted. Britannica countered by offering a CD-ROM version of their product, although it could not generate the print version's $500–600 in sales commissions. Britannica decided to charge $995 for just the CD-ROM, while bundling a free disc with the <b>print</b> <b>version,</b> hoping that including the CD-ROM would persuade buyers {{to stay with the}} brand.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, the Britannica {{responded to}} reader {{requests}} by restoring the index as a two-volume set. The number of topics indexed by the Britannica has fluctuated from 500,000 (1985, {{the same as}} in 1954) to 400,000 (1989,1991) to 700,000 in the current 2007 <b>print</b> <b>version.</b> Presumably, this recent increase reflects the introduction of efficient electronic indexing, since the size of the encyclopedia has remained nearly constant at approximately 40 million words from 1954 to the present and far less than 40% of the encyclopedia has changed from 1985 to 2007.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 <b>print</b> <b>version</b> of the Britannica has 4,411 contributors, many eminent {{in their}} fields, such as Nobel laureate {{economist}} Milton Friedman, astronomer Carl Sagan, and surgeon Michael DeBakey. Roughly {{a quarter of}} the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 (Alfred North Whitehead), while another quarter are retired or emeritus. Most (approximately 98%) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is Christine Sutton of the University of Oxford, who contributed 24 articles on particle physics.|$|E

25|$|As the Britannica is {{a general}} encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with {{specialised}} encyclopaedias such as the Encyclopaedia of Mathematics or the Dictionary of the Middle Ages, which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the Britannicas main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, Rees's Cyclopædia and Coleridge's Encyclopædia Metropolitana. In the 20th century, successful competitors included Collier's Encyclopedia, the Encyclopedia Americana, and the World Book Encyclopedia. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the Britannica was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia, especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors. The <b>print</b> <b>version</b> of the Britannica was significantly more expensive than its competitors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} era (1994–present), digital {{versions}} {{have been developed}} and released on optical media and online. In 1996, the Britannica was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the <b>print</b> <b>version,</b> and the other, Britannica.com Inc., developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua, who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the Britannica name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, {{announced that it would}} not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools.|$|E
25|$|The Gazettes {{began as}} an experimental, semi-professional, online {{magazine}} featuring fan fiction and nonfiction edited by Flint and (eventually) a volunteer editorial board. At the time of Jim Baen's death {{in the summer of}} 2006 ten Grantville Gazettes were under contract and they had (with some fits and starts) settled into a new version roughly and irregularly three times a year. Baen's production staff was somewhat overworked by the deadline and the serialized magazine gave way to an e-book release from the sixth volume onward—though this was explained by Flint as primarily being due to Flint's other commitments, such as editing the new science fiction magazine Jim Baen's Universe. Earlier on, he'd explained the production delays in terms of overworked proofreaders, executive editors, and so forth. IssuesVI through X, after being released as e-books, seem unlikely to see print; whereas Jim Baen has been releasing (all but the first) issues some months later as hardcover books, the last he bought has yet to appear. Flint has explained that the market for anthologies is always very soft, no matter the genre, and it seems likely that any new <b>print</b> <b>version</b> from the Gazettes will be a Best of The Grantville Gazettes.|$|E

500|$|The CD-ROM {{version of}} Banglapedia has more entries than the <b>print</b> <b>version,</b> along with 65 video clips, 49 audio clips, 2,714 images and thumbnails, and 647 maps. The audio clips include songs by Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam, while the video clips include Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's speech on 7 March 1971. Some images {{that appear in}} black and white in the <b>print</b> <b>version</b> are in color in the CD-ROM version. Designed to run on Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000 and Windows NT, the CD-ROM version {{includes}} about 70,000 links and an option to create a personal [...] "favorite list".|$|E
500|$|Using press {{releases}} from the Copley News Service, {{the book was}} widely publicized throughout the state of Illinois, and it was even reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
