5|$|Some {{parts of}} Western Europe, {{especially}} Scandinavian {{countries have been}} creating family friendly <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> aided them in equalizing the gender difference in {{participation in the work}} force. Nordic countries have the highest female participation rates in the work force in the world and salary differences are among the lowest. Government aid in providing care to the elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia {{to be a part of}} the working population in nearly a high rate as men. Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{reducing}} {{poverty and}} increasing China's wealth, Deng's reforms {{have been criticized}} by the Chinese New Left for increasing inequality and allowing private entrepreneurs to purchase state assets at reduced prices. These accusations were especially intense during the Lang-Gu dispute, in which New Left academic Larry Lang accused entrepreneur Gu Sujung of usurping state assets, after which Gu was imprisoned. The Hu-Wen Administration adopted some New Left policies, such as halting privatizations and increasing the state sector's importance in the economy, and Keynesian <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been criticized by some Chinese economists who advocate a policy of deregulation, tax cuts and privatization.|$|E
25|$|The Peranakans, {{descendants}} of mixed Malay and Chinese ancestries, were once {{the political and}} business elites in George Town. Some of the city's most influential associations, such as the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Penang Straits Chinese British Association, were led by the Peranakans, who also represented Penang in the Straits Settlements Legislative Council. As the Peranakans {{tended to be more}} loyal to the British Crown than to China, they were also known as the King's Chinese. In spite of Malaysia's ethnic <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> effectively forced the Peranakans to identify themselves as Chinese, Peranakan culture still thrives in George Town to this day, in the form of Straits Chinese architectural styles and dishes like asam laksa.|$|E

25|$|On 2 February 2012, Garrett, with Jenny Macklin, the Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister, {{announced}} {{an expansion of}} the Improving School Enrollment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure (SEAM), a controversial program under which parents of indigenous students in the Northern Territory can have their Centrelink payments suspended for three months if their children are not attending or enrolled in school. Though the Government claimed that the program improved indigenous school attendance, it was heavily criticised by indigenous spokespeople and academics for being excessively punitive rather than implementing other <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been far more effective in improving school attendance, such as reinstating bilingual learning. Furthermore, the Government was criticised for being deceptive about getting a mandate for this from consultation with indigenous leaders.|$|E
25|$|Some {{international}} volunteer organizations {{define their}} primary mission as being altruistic: to fight poverty {{and improve the}} living standards {{of people in the}} developing world, (e.g. Voluntary Services Overseas has almost 2,000 skilled professionals working as volunteers to pass on their expertise to local people so that the volunteers' skills remain long after they return home). When these organizations work in partnership with governments, the results can be impressive. However, when other organizations or individual First World governments support the work of volunteer groups, there can be questions as to whether the organizations' or governments' real motives are poverty alleviation. Instead, a focus on creating wealth for some of the poor or developing policies intended to benefit the donor states is sometimes reported. Many low-income countries’ economies suffer from industrialization without prosperity and investment without growth. One {{reason for this is that}} development assistance guides many Third World governments to pursue development <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been wasteful, ill-conceived, or unproductive; some of these policies have been so destructive that the economies could not have been sustained without outside support.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{accession}} {{can be broken}} down into four major stages: a country wishing to accede to the WTO submits an application to the General Council. The government applying for membership has to describe all aspects of its trade and economic <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> a bearing on WTO agreements. The application is submitted to the WTO in a memorandum which is examined by a working party open to all interested WTO Members, and dealing with the country's application. For large countries such as Russia, numerous countries participate in this process. For smaller countries, the Quadrilateral group of countries – consisting of the EU, the United States, Canada and Japan – and an applicant's neighboring countries are typically most involved. The applicant then presents a detailed memorandum to the Working Party on its foreign trade regime, describing, among other things, its economy, economic policies, domestic and international trade regulations, and intellectual property policies. The Working Party Members submit written questions to the applicant to clarify aspects of its foreign trade regime with particular attention being paid to the degree of privatization in the economy {{and the extent to which}} government regulation is transparent. After all necessary background information has been acquired, the Working Party will begin meeting to focus on issues of discrepancy between the WTO rules and the Applicant's international and domestic trade policies and laws. The WP determines the terms and conditions of entry into the WTO for the applicant nation, and may consider transitional periods to allow countries some leeway in complying with the WTO rules.|$|E

Similar reactions were reported by Kentucky Senator Sherman Cooper, and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse, who compared Birmingham to South Africa under apartheid. A New York Times editorial called the behavior of the Birmingham police [...] "a national disgrace." [...] The Washington Post editorialized, [...] "The spectacle in Birmingham... must excite the sympathy {{of the rest of the}} country for the decent, just, and reasonable citizens of the community, who have so recently demonstrated at the polls their lack of support for the very <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> produced the Birmingham riots.
