5|$|A female may lay {{from several}} dozen to several {{thousand}} eggs during her lifetime, {{depending on the}} extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf, to the parental care provided by scarab beetles, which house, feed and <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> young. The Attelabidae roll leaves and lay their eggs inside the roll for protection.|$|E
5|$|According to an anecdote, {{the idea}} arose after {{a group of}} Royal Navy {{officers}} saw a similar, but fictional, bomb depicted in the 1943 Walt Disney animated propaganda film Victory Through Air Power, and the name Disney was consequently given to the weapon. The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft capable of carrying it. The navy was interested in a concrete-penetrating weapon due to the German navy's extensive use of fortified submarine pens to <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> U-boats and E-boats from air attack while docked.|$|E
5|$|Although the British built Fort Mackinac to <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> {{settlement}} from {{attack by}} French-Canadians and native tribes, the fort was never attacked during the American Revolutionary War. The entire Straits area was officially {{acquired by the}} United States through the Treaty of Paris (1783). However, much of the British forces did not leave the Great Lakes area until after 1794, when the Jay Treaty established U.S. sovereignty over the Northwest Territory.|$|E

Sentinels {{are able to}} hover around in enclosed spaces and produce an energy shield when under attack. They lack durability, but use powerful laser beam weapons and are immune to infection by the Flood.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British {{captured}} the fort in the Siege of Fort Mackinac, the first {{battle of the}} conflict, because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> prize by building Fort George on the high ground behind Fort Mackinac. In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second battle {{on the north side}} of the island. The American second-in-command, Major Andrew Holmes, was killed and the Americans failed to recapture the island.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{elephants}} {{were considered}} formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour to <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass {{if they were}} large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier {{to the ground and}} impale him.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers of {{newcomers}} were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} {{children}} were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where {{he said he had}} no children. However, it is thought that he did not mention them in order to <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> mothers, as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaqu√≠n Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E
5|$|Omphalea, {{like many}} {{other members of the}} Euphorbiaceae, {{possesses}} leaf nectaries that attract polistine wasps, which are predators of early instar caterpillars. The leaf nectaries also attract ants. The ants usually <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> host plant, eating both the nectar and plant-eating insects on it. However, they generally completely ignore Chrysiridia caterpillars, making it likely that the caterpillars possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence. This chemical deterrent comes from the host plants. Omphalea species contain polyhydroxy alkaloids potentially sequestered or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.|$|E

50|$|The {{name comes}} {{originally}} from the insurance industry. Insurance companies worried that <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> clients from risks (like fire, or car accidents) might encourage those clients {{to behave in}} riskier ways (like smoking in bed or not wearing seat belts). This problem may inefficiently discourage those companies from <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> clients {{as much as the}} clients would like to be protected.|$|R

5|$|Once {{a planet}} reaches {{sufficient}} mass, the materials of different densities segregate within, during planetary differentiation. This process can form a stony or metallic core, {{surrounded by a}} mantle and an outer crust. The core may include solid and liquid regions, and some planetary cores generate their own magnetic field, which can <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> atmospheres from solar wind stripping.|$|E
5|$|Slaves {{had special}} sexual {{restrictions}} and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave {{shall not be}} the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to <b>protect</b> <b>their</b> safety at all times.|$|E
