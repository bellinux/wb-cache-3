40|$|A {{friction}} {{model is}} developed {{by considering the}} Coulomb friction model, a probabilistic approach of wear prediction, the kinematics of the pin-on-disc configuration and the elastic theory of bending. The model estimates the magnitude {{and direction of the}} frictional force, the <b>pin</b> <b>torque,</b> the probability of asperity contact and the real area of contact distinguishing between the part due to elastic and plastic asperity contacts respectively. Therefore, the proposed model is suitable for the prediction of adhesive wear. It can be applied to metal contacts for conductance characterisation through the plastically deformed asperities which is of great interest for electrical contact resistance studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} {{research project}} {{consists of two}} major parts. First, the material flow in solid-state, friction stir, butt-welds as been investigated using a marker insert technique. Changes in material flow due to welding parameter as well as tool geometry variations have been examined for different materials. The method provides a semi-quantitative, three-dimensional view of the material transport in the welded zone. Second, a FSW process model has been developed. The fully coupled model is based on fluid mechanics; the solid-state material transport during welding is treated as a laminar, viscous flow of a non-Newtonian fluid past a rotating circular cylinder. The heat necessary for the material softening is generated by deformation of the material. As a first step, a two-dimensional model, which contains only the pin of the FSW tool, has been created to test the suitability of the modeling approach and to perform parametric studies of the boundary conditions. The material flow visualization experiments agree very well with the predicted flow field. Accordingly, material within the pin diameter is transported only in the rotation direction around the pin. Due to the simplifying assumptions inherent in the 2 -D model, other experimental data such as forces on the <b>pin,</b> <b>torque,</b> and weld energy cannot be directly used for validation. However, the 2 -D model predicts the same trends {{as shown in the}} experiments. The model also predicts a deviation from the "normal" material flow at certain combinations of welding parameters, suggesting a possible mechanism for the occurrence of some typical FSW defects. The next step has been the development of a three-dimensional process model. The simplified FSW tool has been designed as a flat shoulder rotating {{on the top of the}} workpiece and a rotating, cylindrical pin, which extends throughout the total height of the flow domain. The thermal boundary conditions at the tool and at the contact area to the backing plate have been varied to fit experimental data such as temperature profiles, torque and tool forces. General aspects of the experimentally visualized material flow pattern are confirmed by the 3 -D model...|$|E
30|$|Pommer et al. [39] {{conducted}} {{a similar study}} but evaluated pin site infection rate, pin removal, and <b>pin</b> extraction <b>torque</b> as the outcomes of interest. A total of 46 patients undergoing segmental bone transport or tibial lengthening were randomized {{to the use of}} either standard titanium or HA-coated stainless steel Schanz pins and were followed prospectively for a mean of 38  weeks. The uncoated pins had a 12  % infection rate with 1 extensive intramedullary canal infection, while none of the HA-coated pins became infected. None of the HA-coated pins required removal throughout the study in contrast to 13  % of the uncoated <b>pins.</b> The extraction <b>torque</b> of the HA-coated pins was significantly greater than the uncoated pins (0.43 vs. 0.10  N m, p <  0.001).|$|R

40|$|Gillespie, John W. The {{present study}} {{involves}} the transverse static and fatigue loading of bolted joints in a discontinuous ceramic cored sandwich structure (DCCSS). DCCSS structures {{are commonly used}} in armored vehicle applications. The DCCSS is a hybrid symmetric composite laminate {{made up of a}} face sheet, adhesive interlayer, and a discontinuous tile array core infused with FCS 2 epoxy resin. Static tests were performed with the varying of support conditions from simply supported, <b>pinned,</b> and <b>torqued</b> bolts. The goal was to understand the change in strength and failure modes due to the joint under transverse loading. Optimization of the joint was also involved, thus the torque levels were also varied to conclude t he best torque level for performance of the joint. It was found out that the bolted joint improved the performance and strength of the DCCSS in comparison to the simply supported and pinned support conditions. The failure mode of the DCCSS changed with each support condition, but ultimate failure was consistently due to delamination between the adhesive interlayer and face sheet. The optimal torque level of 90 ft-lbs. was determined from static testing. The influence of fatigue on stiffness retention, residual strength and damage were also conducted for both <b>pinned</b> and <b>torqued</b> support conditions to study durability. The bolted joint helped maintain the strength of the joint and stiffness of the structure in comparison to the pinned condition. University of Delaware, Department of Civil EngineeringM. C. E...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a randomized controlled trial {{in order to}} assess the effect silver coating of an external fixator pin has on pin infection. The experimental silver coated pins (SC) were compared to control stainless steel (SS) pins. A clamp design monolateral fixator was used, and pins were randomized to clamp position to allow side-by-side comparisons of pins in a similar environment. Nineteen patients and 33 clamps were entered and completed the study. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two types of pins in the rate of pin tract infection, clinical appearances of the pin sites, bacteriology of the <b>pin</b> tracts, <b>torque</b> to remove the pins, or radiographic lucency around the pin. We concluded that with the numbers available in this study, there were no detectable differences between the performance of SC and SS pins...|$|R
30|$|These results {{demonstrate}} that bolts achieve good stability {{at the half}} pin–Rancho cube interface by tolerating higher axial loads than grub screws before loosening. This is a result from the greater torque that can be produced using a spanner or wrench. Whilst the point profile of the grub screw secures a better hold of the half <b>pin</b> when the <b>torque</b> used is equal, the driver used to insert the grub screw is limited in delivery of a high maximum torque before breakage; {{this appears to be}} the limiting factor for the security of hold on the half pin by grub screws.|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the mechanical properties of piano pin blocks. Three pin block types were used, all made from multi-layered beech-plywood. Pin block were divided to eight sections, drilled and fitted by tuning <b>pins.</b> Tightening <b>torque</b> of tuning <b>pins</b> was measured using a torque wrench, depending on the diameter of the hole. Mechanical resistance of the material was measured by microdrill Resistograph. Density distribution in pin blocks and moisture content were determined with gravimetric method. The universal testing machine was used for determination of Janky's and Brinell's hardness, the mechanical properties in compression in plane of the board. Results of tests were evaluated using statistical methods and cross-correlated. A finite-element model in ANSYS software was built, in ordner to clarify the degree and distribution of stress around the hole for tuning pin. Statistically significant differences were found for properties of individual types of pin blocks (especially the density, hardness and compressive strength and tightening torque). Hardness differs significantly when tested perpendicular to the fibers in the plane and along the fibers in the edge. Measurements in individual sections of pin block brought uneven results and did not show statistically significant differences. Significant correlation was found only between the folowing characteristic: type A: the density distribution and the mechanical properties of the plane, density distribution and tightening torque after loosening. Type B: Resistograph resistance and tightening torque after 14 days, the density distribution and mechanical properties of the plane. Type C: density distribution and tightening torque after driving and loosening. Accurate results would be achieved by multiple measurements on multiple pieces of the pin blocks...|$|R
40|$|Over {{recent years}} Anglo Coal Underground CM mines have {{consistently}} {{been able to}} increase production output by improving their production process efficiency. However, in the very same time, the utilization of available production time has declined. This report will explore {{the architecture of the}} current Performance Management System (PMS) for frontline production section in Greenside Colliery, with specials impetus given to the measurement front line time utilization. Guided by existing literature and case studies on Performance Measurement Systems and equipment time losses one was then able to conduct work studies in the erratic underground coal mining sections. This was done with the view of building a factual basis for process flows and root cause identification. Informed by the above the report will give recommendations, on the short comings and suitability of the current PMS, a concise definition of what ìproduction downtimeî and illuminate critical areas of lost production. From the study of best practices the PMS was found to be suited generally for frontline coal management. However {{more needs to be done}} in improving the accuracy of the data recorded and its communication. A definition was fabricated for Lost Production Time based on the existence of a critical value chain. Based on this definition the critical areas of lost production time were identified and summarized in diagrammatic form that will be used in the data capturing of the new PMS. The study found that Continuous Miner operational stoppages and Feeder Breaker breakdowns present the best opportunities of improvement and recommends that work studies be done to improve the operational stoppages and equipment redesign consideration be made to reduce shearing <b>pin</b> and <b>torque</b> shaft damage. The report culminates by giving further recommendations based on findings on other aspects that are not contained within the project scope but however do have a bearing on the efficiency of the total PMS.

40|$|Large {{diameter}} {{helical piles}} are being utilized increasingly to support large compressive and tensile loads. Both {{the magnitude of}} the required installation torque and the pile capacity can be directly attributed to the soil shearing resistance developed over the embedded area of the pile including the shaft and helical plates. Hence, the pile capacity can be correlated to the installation torque. Such correlations are widely used in helical pile industry as a means for quality control/quality assurance. However, the reliability of capacity-torque correlations for predicting the large diameter helical piles is adversely affected by the inaccurate measurement of the installation torque employing hydraulic pressure torque indicators. In the current study, a <b>torque</b> <b>pin</b> was fabricated using strain gauges methodology to facilitate accurate measurement of installation torque. A total of 17 piles, including seven fully instrumented, were installed while monitoring the installation torque continuously with depth using the fabricated device. The results of installation torque monitoring were demonstrated to be accurate and repeatable. In addition, six compressive and four tensile axial load tests were conducted on the test piles. The load test results were analyzed to determine the interpreted ultimate capacity of the test piles. The results demonstrated that the ultimate capacity of large diameter helical piles can be determined from the pile load tests data employing the interpreted failure criteria proposed by Elkasabgy and El Naggar (2015) and Fuller 2 ̆ 6 Hoy (1970). The measured installation torque and the corresponding ultimate capacity values were used to define torque-to-capacity correlation based on embedded pile area, which is suitable for large diameter piles with single and double helices. Furthermore, the results from the seven test piles that were instrumented with strain gauges provided a description of the load transfer mechanism at various levels of axial loading. It was found that significant settlement may be required to mobilize the bearing resistance provided by the lead helix for both compressive and tensile loading conditions. Finally, the rear helix provides significant capacity contribution under compression loading but little contribution under tensile loading...|$|R
