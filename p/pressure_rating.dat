5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>rating</b> of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{modified}} Reynolds stress turbulence {{model for}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> of strain can be derived for dispersed two-phase flows taking into account gas-particle interaction. The transport equations for the Reynolds stresses {{as well as the}} equation for the fluctuating pressure can be derived starting from the multiphase Navier– Stokes equations. The unknown <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> of strain correlation in the Reynolds stress equations is then modelled by considering the multiphase equation for the fluctuating pressure. This leads to a multiphase <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> of strain model. The extra particle interaction source terms occurring in the {{model for the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> of strain can be constructed easily, with no noticeable extra computational cost. Eulerian–Lagrangian simulation results of a turbulent dispersed two-phase jet are presented to show the differences in results with and without the new two-way coupling terms...|$|R

40|$|Effects of keishibukuryogan (KBG) on {{platelet}} aggregation were investigated.

The platelet aggregation of each test drug was measured by the screen filtration pressure method using whole blood of guinea pigs and expressed as a collagen-induced <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> (%) or a collagen concentration required for 50 % increase in the <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> (PATI value).

The severity of autonomic damage was assessed by measuring the variabilities in R-R intervals of 100 consecutive heart beats in ECGs during quiet and deep breathing in the supine position and with the Schellong test. According to the results, the diabetics were divided into three groups: Normal ANS (31 patients without diabetic autonomic neuropathy), Abnormal PS (27 patients with parasympathetic damage alone) and Abnormal PS+S (10 patients with both parasympathetic and sympathetic damage). The blood <b>pressure</b> and heart <b>rate</b> of all subjects were recorded for 24 hours under near-basal conditions using an ambulatory blood pressure recording device (Pressurometer® Ⅱ, Del Mar Avionics, USA). The patterns of diurnal variations and the diurnal variabilities in blood <b>pressure,</b> heart <b>rate</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> product were analyzed in 22 control, 21 normal ANS, 20 abnormal PS and 10 abnormal PS+S patients. The effects of atropine sulfate (2. 0 mg daily, p. o.) were also studied in 11 control, 10 normal ANS and 11 abnormal PS patients {{to determine the effect}} of parasympathetic nerve damage on the variations. Hourly mean heart rates during the daytime and mean 24 -hour heart rates were not different among the groups. However, with the progress of autonomic neuropathy, there was a significant reduction in the diurnal variation in heart rates, with greater mean night heart rates and greater hourly minimum mean heart rates. On the other hand, with the progress of autonomic neuropathy, there was {{a significant increase in the}} diurnal variation in the systolic blood pressure. However, diastolic blood pressure varied to the same extent regardless of the severity of autonomic nerve damage. The diabetics with autonomic neuropathy had significantly greater hourly mean and mean 24 -hour systolic and diastolic blood <b>pressure,</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> product. The diurnal variation in the <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> product was similar to the heart rate results. Indices of the diurnal {{variations in}} heart rate and systolic blood pressure in controls and normal ANS patients approached those of abnormal PS patients after atropine sulfate administration.
