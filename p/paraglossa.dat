40|$|The {{lengths of}} the {{mouthparts}} of bees, the glossa, <b>paraglossa,</b> stipes, galea, labial palpus, maxillary palpus, cardo, lorum, mentum and prementum, were studied in Caucasian and Africanized bees {{and in their}} F 1 descendants. Only the lengths of the <b>paraglossa,</b> stipe, galea, mentum, prementum and maxillary palpus differed significantly between these two bee types. These six variables were studied in the F 1 descendants of two types of crosses, i. e., Caucasian queens x Africanized males (cross 1) and Africanized queens x Caucasian males (cross 2). Multidimensional analyses were also performed and the generalized Mahalanobis distances (D 2) between the F 1 descendants and the parental lines were determined. There was an apparent dominance of Africanized bees in both unidimensional and multidimensional analyses. Correlation analysis showed that bees with longer glossae collected more food (sugar syrup) and flew more slowly from the colony to the food source...|$|E

50|$|The {{generalized}} {{condition in}} hexapods {{is for the}} first pair of maxillae to consist of a basal triangular sclerite called the cardo and a large central sclerite called the stipes from which arise three processes: the lacinia, the galea and the maxillary palp. The lacinia is often strongly sclerotized and toothed. It functions to cut and manipulate food in the mouth. The galea is a broad, scoop-like, lobe structure, which assists the maxillary palps in sampling items before ingestion. The maxillary palp is serially homologous to the walking leg while the cardo and stipes are regarded by most to be serially homologous to the first leg segment, the coxa.The labium is immediately posterior to the first maxillae and is formed from the fusion of the second maxillae, although in lower orders including the Archaeognatha (bristletails) and Thysanura (silverfish) the two maxillae are not completely fused. It consists of a basal submentum, which connects with the prementum through a narrow sclerite, the mentum. The labium forms the lower portion of the buccal cavity in insects. The prementum has a pair of labial palps laterally, and two broad soft lobes called the <b>paraglossae</b> medially. These <b>paraglossae</b> have two small slender lobes called glossae at their base.|$|R
50|$|The prementum bears a {{structure}} called the ligula; {{this consists of}} an inner pair of lobes called glossae and a lateral pair called <b>paraglossae.</b> These structures are homologous to the lacinia and galea of maxillae. The labial palps borne {{on the sides of}} labium are the counterparts of maxillary palps. Like the maxillary palps, the labial palps aid sensory function in eating. In many species the musculature of the labium is much more complex than that of the other jaws, because in most, the ligula, palps and prementum all can be moved independently.|$|R

All available data on the biology of this putative endemic species of Cyprus are summarized.

25|$|In mandibulate mouthparts, the labium is a quadrupedal structure, {{although}} it is formed from two fused secondary maxillae. It {{can be described as}} the floor of the mouth. With the maxillae, it assists with manipulation of food during mastication or chewing or, in the unusual case of the dragonfly nymph, extends out to snatch prey back to the head, where the mandibles can eat it. The labium is similar in structure to the maxilla, but with the appendages of the two sides fused by the midline, so they come to form a median plate. The basal part of the labium, equivalent to the maxillary cardines and possibly including a part of the sternum of the labial segment, is called the postmentum. This may be subdivided into a proximal submentum and a distal mentum. Distal to the postmentum, and equivalent to the fused maxillary stipites, is the prementum. The prementum closes the preoral cavity from behind. Terminally, it bears four lobes, two inner glossae, and two outer <b>paraglossae,</b> which are collectively known as the ligula. One or both pairs of lobes may be absent or they may be fused to form a single median process. A palp arises from each side of the prementum, often being three-segmented.|$|R
40|$|AbstractExternal and {{internal}} head structures of Macroxyela ferruginea (Say) and Xyela julii (Brébisson) were examined. A detailed description is provided for Macroxyela. The results are {{compared to the}} conditions found in other basal hymenopterans and representatives of other groups of endopterygote insects. Hitherto unnoticed autapomorphies of Hymenoptera are the concavity of the posterior head capsule, the very dense, regular vestiture of hairs, the collar-like, strongly developed posterior tentorium, and a large epipharyngopharyngeal lobe. Microphagous habits and associated features (asymmetric mandibular molae, epipharyngeal brush, infrabuccal pouch) are possibly groundplan features of Hymenoptera and Endopterygota. A switch to more or less liquefied food took place early {{in the evolution of}} Hymenoptera. The sitophore plate and a constricted, elongated prepharyngeal tube are likely synapomorphies of Hymenoptera and Mecopterida. Monophyly of Hymenoptera excluding Xyelidae is supported by the reduction of the mandibular molae and epipharyngeal brush. These changes are likely related to modified feeding habits. Widely separated mandibular bases, the loss of the median labral retractor (parallel loss in Xyelidae), and the presence of a hypostomal bridge are potential apomorphies of Hymenoptera excluding Xyelidae and Tenthredinoidea. Monophyly of Xyelinae and Macroxyelinae, respectively, is well supported by the results of our study. There is conflicting evidence as to whether Xyelidae is monophyletic. The presence of a subdivided galea is a putative autapomorphy of the family. The presence of unsclerotised <b>paraglossae</b> with dense fringes of thin hairs and the presence of a muscle connecting the anterior tentorial arm with the posterior edge of the sitophore plate are features shared by Xyelinae and members of non-xyelid families...|$|R
