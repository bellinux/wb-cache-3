5|$|On March 21, 2017, a new iPad was announced. The {{hardware}} {{includes an}} A9 <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> {{is designed to}} be a budget version of the iPad.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} MacBook, {{available in}} {{black or white}} colors, was released on June 28, 2006, and used the Intel Core Duo <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> 945GM chipset, with Intel's GMA 950 integrated graphics on a 667MHz front side bus. Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the Core 2 Duo <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> the GM965 chipset, with Intel's GMA X3100 integrated graphics on an 800MHz system bus. Sales of the black polycarbonate MacBook ceased in October 2008, after {{the introduction of the}} aluminum MacBook.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 <b>processor,</b> <b>and</b> VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the Apple A7 <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we show how a {{distributed}} system with synchronous <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> asynchronous message delays can be simulated {{by a system}} with both asynchronous <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> asynchronous message delays {{in the presence of}} various types of processor faults. Consequently, the result of Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson (1985, J. Assoc. Comput. Mach. 32, 374 – 382) that no consensus protocol for asynchronous <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> communication can tolerate one failstop fault, implies a result of Dolev, Dwork, and Stockmeyer (1987, J. Assoc. Comput. Mach. 34) that no consensus protocol for synchromous <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> asynchronous communication can tolerate one failstop fault...|$|R
5|$|In May 2009, Java SE was ported and {{optimized}} for Snapdragon. At the November 2009 Computex Taipei show, Qualcomm announced the QSD8650A {{addition to the}} Snapdragon product suite, {{which was based on}} 45 nanometer manufacturing processes. It featured a 1.2GHz <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> had lower power consumption than prior models.|$|E
5|$|The Cray-3 system {{architecture}} comprised a foreground processing system, up to 16 background processors {{and up to}} 2 gigawords (16 GB) of common memory. The foreground system was dedicated to input/output and system management. It included a 32-bit <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> four synchronous data channels for mass storage and network devices, primarily via HiPPI channels.|$|E
5|$|The tablet was {{released}} in ten countries on March 16, 2012. It gained mostly positive reviews, earning praise for its Retina display, <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> 4G (LTE) capabilities.

40|$|Abstract. FPGAs {{have been}} {{proposed}} as high-performance alterna-tives to DSP processors. This paper quantitatively compares FPGA performance against DSP <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> ASICs using actual applica-tions and existing CAD tools and devices. Performance measures were based on actual multiplier performance with FPGAs, DSP <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> ASICs. This study demonstrates that FPGAs can provide {{an order of magnitude}} better performance than DSP <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> can in many cases approach or exceed ASIC levels of performance. ...|$|R

5|$|The Tongan Meteorological Service {{reported}} {{that some of}} its property and equipment had been damaged. The property damage had an approximate value of about $2,000 (2009TOP, $1,0002009 USD). This included a Stevenson screen, office guttering, a HF radio antennae, signal <b>processor,</b> <b>and</b> satellite receiver. They also {{reported that}} the National weather forecasting center in Fua’amotu had experienced power failure on April 4 at 1600 UTC; for this reason the center operated using a small portable generator until early {{the next day when}} they stopped issuing warnings as Lin was no longer a threat to Tonga. Power was eventually restored later that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD {{display at}} {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E
5|$|Chris Stamper {{was born}} in 1958. He had a long-standing {{interest}} in electronics, and built an oscilloscope in his youth. While at university, he built a kit computer with an 8-bit <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> taught himself how to program by creating traffic light signalling software. He attended Loughborough University of Technology {{with the intent of}} earning degrees in electronics and physics, but left the university in 1981 to pursue computer programming full-time. Chris worked with arcade machine electronics, resolving software bugs and converting Space Invaders into Galaxian machines. He persuaded his brother Tim, two years younger (b. February 1961) to join him. The brothers worked as game designers at the arcade game company Associated Leisure with a college friend, John Lathbury. They followed the company's director when he started his own business, Zilec Electronics, which worked on arcade conversions. They worked on 12 arcade games, including Gyruss and Blue Print, and others whose names were kept secret and sold to other arcade manufacturers, including Konami and Sega. The job included international travel to Japan, where the brothers became acquainted with the Japanese game industry. During this time, Chris purchased, studied, and taught himself to program the new ZX80 processor within two years.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) {{which has}} some <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> memory cells faulty. The faults considered are static, i. e., once the machine starts to operate, the operational/faulty status of PRAM components does not change. We develop a deterministic simulation of a fully operational PRAM {{on a similar}} faulty machine which has constant fractions of faults among <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> memory cells. The simulating PRAM has n <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> m memory cells, and simulates a PRAM with n <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> a constant fraction of m memory cells. The simulation is in two phases: it starts with preprocessing, which {{is followed by the}} simulation proper performed in a step-by-step fashion. Preprocessing is performed in time O((m/n+ n) n).
