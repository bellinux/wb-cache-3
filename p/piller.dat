5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} <b>Piller</b> would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity to}} write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. <b>Piller</b> immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. <b>Piller</b> felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} of a new Star Trek incarnation, Star Trek: Voyager co-creators Rick Berman, Michael <b>Piller,</b> and Jeri Taylor conceived the basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings. The Kazon were originally created {{as a part of}} the show's basic premise of Voyagers crew being stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Berman, <b>Piller,</b> and Taylor reasoned that the characters would be traveling through an area of space controlled by a new alien race, serving as the show's primary antagonists, and created the Kazon to fill this role.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Star Trek: The Next Generation third season, Michael <b>Piller</b> became the head writer for the series. Among the changes he implemented was {{the opening of the}} story submission process to non-professional and unrepresented writers. Despite Paramount Television's resistance to the change, The Next Generation became the first show produced in Hollywood to allow such writers to submit their scripts. The studio received more than 5,000 scripts in a year.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pillers</b> made a game-saving {{play in the}} 1981 NFC Championship Game {{against the}} Dallas Cowboys. After Dwight Clark made [...] "The Catch" [...] to give the 49ers a 28-27 lead in the final minute, Dallas drove into 49ers {{territory}} {{trying to set up}} a game-winning field goal. <b>Pillers</b> sacked Danny White, forcing White to fumble, and the 49ers recovered to preserve the win.|$|R

5|$|Patrick Stewart {{sought a}} {{change to the}} script to have the crew defend the Ba'ku village {{in the manner of}} the Battle of the Alamo instead of fleeing into the mountains. <b>Piller</b> could not find a {{feasible}} way to include this in the script, and the budget ruled out the creation of Alamo-like structures in the mountains. Several titles were considered for the film as shooting approached. Star Trek: Where Time Stands Still, Star Trek: Forever and Star Trek: Beyond Paradise were all considered but were rejected. Piller's favorite was Star Trek: Sacred Honor, but the studio rejected this because they were concerned that it sounded too religious. When shooting began, the film was still called Star Trek IX.|$|E
5|$|Scully becomes {{worried about}} Piller's {{influence}} over Mulder. The agents return to Washington, D.C., where Mulder keeps searching for {{evidence in the}} case. Meanwhile, <b>Piller</b> gets another vision of Samantha, leading Mulder to April Air Force Base. Scully finds evidence that Samantha's disappearance is linked to The Smoking Man (William B. Davis); when she returns to her apartment, she finds him waiting for her. He tells {{her that he had}} called off the search for Mulder's sister when she vanished because he knew she was dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{received}} by script editor Melinda M. Snodgrass at a fortunate time. The crew {{were looking for}} a script which could go immediately into production in order to free up time to work on other scripts which needed more work. She handed it to executive producer Michael <b>Piller,</b> who thought it didn't need much work. He passed it onto fellow executive producer Rick Berman, who held onto it for a week while the writers chased the production crew for updates. The script was then purchased, and Bailey, Bischoff and White were informed that it was due to go into production a week later.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pillers</b> played college {{football}} at Alcorn State University and was {{drafted in the}} eleven round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Jets. He {{was a member of}} the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XIX winning teams.|$|R

5|$|The {{final version}} of the script was {{distributed}} to the cast, but Patrick Stewart did not receive a copy. Berman was concerned that if anyone had a problem with it, they would call Stewart to complain and it would appear as though Stewart was being left out because he had criticized the story. LeVar Burton called Stewart to praise the script. Stewart was sent a copy and requested a meeting to discuss changes. <b>Piller</b> feared the worst, but after a twenty-minute meeting with Stewart, who requested several dialogue changes, the script was finalized. During pre-production, the marketing department wanted to decide a title, preferring Star Trek: Revolution. Alan Spencera friend of Pillersuggested Insurrection, which was selected from a choice of Insurrection, Rebellion, High Treason and Act of Treason.|$|E
5|$|Both Berman and <b>Piller</b> {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E
5|$|In a rare move, District Judge Earnest Lau {{released}} a 14-page judgment explaining the court's denial of Odex's request for Pacific Internet's client information. He compared Odex's demands to an Anton <b>Piller</b> order, which {{provides for the}} right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. Seen as draconian, it is only used under extreme circumstances. He held that only copyright holders themselves, or their exclusive licensees, can bring such applications and that he was not satisfied with the evidence harvested by BayTSP for the identification of downloaders. Out of all the anime licensed to Odex, only the license in respect of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED had been granted exclusively to the company. The judge noted that, out of the 13 authorisation letters presented in court, ten of them authorised the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS), not Odex, to act for the copyright holders. Odex was ordered to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$7,000.|$|E

25|$|In civil cases, a judge may grant an Anton <b>Piller</b> order authorising {{the search}} of {{premises}} and seizure of evidence without prior warning. The order's purpose is to prevent the destruction of incriminating evidence, particularly in cases of alleged intellectual property infringement.|$|E
25|$|Star Trek: The Next Generation (abbreviated as TNG and ST:TNG) is an American {{science fiction}} {{television}} {{series in the}} Star Trek franchise created by Gene Roddenberry that ran between 1987 and 1994. Roddenberry, Maurice Hurley, Rick Berman, Michael <b>Piller</b> and Jeri Taylor served as executive producers at different times throughout its production.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{introducing}} one alien race, three were introduced simultaneously: the Changelings, the Vorta and the Jem'Hadar. These three {{were intended to}} represent the front of an ancient civilization coupled together by fear, to contrast with {{the unity of the}} Federation enabled by bonds of friendship. Behr, Wolfe, writer Peter Allan Fields and Jim Crocker attended meetings to develop the concepts of these species and found general inspiration in Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy novels. Executive producer Michael <b>Piller</b> suggested the idea that the Founders of the Dominion be the race to which Odo belongs, toward the end of Season Two production, and discovered that Behr and Wolfe had also discussed this possibility. This character had been introduced with no knowledge of his true origins. <b>Piller</b> asserts the endeavor to create a new villain {{was one of the most}} difficult tasks he undertook in his work on Star Trek. Wolfe perceives similarities between the fictional Founders and the Roman Empire, in that the species first uses diplomacy, deception and cultural imperialism to achieve their aims before ultimately resorting to coercion.|$|E
5000|$|Releasing three albums on Eddie <b>Piller's</b> Acid Jazz Records, they {{received}} radio airplay for their single [...] "Something In My Eye" [...] in 1993, but national chart success evaded them, although several singles from their 1993 album High Havoc charted in the UK Independent Chart. Their 1994 album, Out of Here, reached number 73 in the UK Albums Chart.|$|R

Smith, the landlord, got 'im a easy-chair {{and a couple of}} <b>pillers</b> out o' the parlour, and Bill sat there like a king, telling us all his sufferings and wot it felt like to be shot.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Star Trek: The Next Generation, {{interpersonal}} conflicts were prominently {{featured in}} DS9. This {{was at the}} suggestion of Star Trek: The Next Generations writers, many of whom also wrote for DS9, who felt that Roddenberry's prohibition of conflicts within the crew restricted their ability to write compelling dramatic stories. In <b>Piller's</b> words, [...] "People who come from different places—honorable, noble people—will naturally have conflicts".|$|R
25|$|After {{an injury}} to tackle Zach <b>Piller,</b> Vanderbilt sacked and {{stripped}} Danny Wuerffel, and Jamie Duncan returned the fumble for a touchdown. A 2-point conversion on a pass to Todd Yoder brought the score to 28–14 and inspired the Commodores. Early in the fourth quarter, Vanderbilt back Jason Dunnavant broke off a 34-yard touchdown run and the score was 28–21. Vanderbilt missed a field goal, and one final drive was stopped at its own 47-yard line.|$|E
25|$|Section 3 of the Courts and Legal Services Act amends the County Courts Act 1984 {{to allow}} the County Courts to award any remedy used by the High Court. There were several {{exceptions}} because {{the status of the}} County Courts made it illogical {{to allow the}}m to write orders of mandamus or certiorari. The new section also allows the Lord Chancellor to prohibit the County Courts from making certain other types of order, with these types to be introduced by Statutory Instrument. Again, these are orders which it would be illogical to allow the County Courts to write, such as Anton <b>Piller</b> orders or Mareva injunctions.|$|E
500|$|After Ganino and Stilwell pitched him the new script, <b>Piller</b> {{suggested}} to producer Rick Berman that the story, not the script, be purchased. In a meeting, <b>Piller</b> told Ganino {{that he wanted}} to make changes to the story, which included the addition of Tasha Yar. Fearing that what they considered a better story would be lost if the changes were made to [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", Stillwell talked to <b>Piller</b> and pitched their Guardian of Forever story. While intrigued by elements of the story, <b>Piller</b> felt the use of the Guardian was a [...] "gimmick" [...] and wanted The Next Generation to stand on its own. Instead, <b>Piller</b> suggested that they merge the two stories, with Stillwell and Ganino sharing writing credit. <b>Piller</b> suggested that the Enterprise crew would immediately undergo a transformation due to the presence of the older Enterprise, and that Guinan would be integral to the realization that something was wrong. Ganino and Stillwell were given two weeks to complete their new story.|$|E

He also directed {{a production of}} “Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris” for The Playhouse (Fredericton). This led to directing (and performing in) another revival of the show for Marlene Smith and Strut Productions, at the Teller’s Cage in Toronto (1975).|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Segan {{approached}} the <b>Pillers</b> {{to develop a}} television series from Stephen King's novel The Dead Zone. The series starred Anthony Michael Hall and ran from 2002-2008 on the USA Network. In 2005, Wildfire debuted on the ABC Family channel, starring Deep Space Nines Nana Visitor. The fourth and final season of Wildfire premiered in early 2008. Greek debuted {{in the summer of}} 2007 and became the longest-running series on ABC Family.|$|R
2500|$|The sixth season {{brought a}} new set of changes. [...] Rick Berman and Michael <b>Piller's</b> time was split between the newly created [...] and The Next Generation.

500|$|The {{story for}} [...] "The Perfect Mate" [...] {{was created by}} René Echevarria and Rueben Leder and then written as a teleplay by Leder and {{executive}} producer Michael <b>Piller.</b> A great deal of edits {{were made to the}} script by a number of staff members, and <b>Piller</b> felt that it was a difficult one due to the subject matter. As <b>Piller</b> explained to Echevarria in a memo, he felt that Kamala had to be a well-rounded character which would be loved by the viewer in order for the episode to work.|$|E
500|$|Biller and Piller's {{dramatic}} {{second draft}} changes required {{changes in the}} episode's sets and shooting schedule, what <b>Piller</b> described as [...] to change the whole thing overnight." [...] The chaos of the changes prompted a meeting with <b>Piller</b> and the production staff where he defended the upheaval as response to improving the script and overall episode.|$|E
500|$|Michael <b>Piller</b> {{left the}} staff of Voyager after the third season to work with Rick Berman on the script for the film [...] (1998). Previously, he {{had worked as a}} {{consultant}} script editor for the series. Brannon Braga came in as a co-executive producer after Jeri Taylor sought to reduce her involvement on the show. Braga originally joined the franchise when he was an intern on he went on to write more than 40 episodes as well as Star Trek Generations (1994) and [...] (1996). Taylor was initially daunted by the departure of <b>Piller,</b> but found that it opened up the ability to explore other types of stories. [...] For example, the episode [...] "Distant Origin" [...] would not have been made with <b>Piller</b> on the staff because of its unusual plot structure; the story focuses first on an alien race, not just the crew of Voyager. After watching the episode, <b>Piller</b> believed it was the best installment of Voyager at that time. After Taylor left the show {{at the end of the}} season, Braga became the executive producer.|$|E
