There she remained for fifty years and learned ornithology, palaeontology, geology and anatomy. She was a <b>piece-worker,</b> paid by the number of fossils she prepared.|$|E

Alisjaya CiptaTama has both of suitable and unsuitable with jamsostek programs. The suitable implementation is issuing the jamsostek for permanent labors, while the unsuitable implementation is for <b>piece-worker</b> were not included to jamsostek program, this is breaking the Labor Ministry Decision Number KEP- 150 /MEN/ 1990 that both of day-to-day labor, <b>piece-worker,</b> and temporary labor who working less than there months must be included in working accident insurance and death insurance, while who working {{more than three months}} must be included in working accident insurance, death insurance, old age insurance, and health insurance...|$|E

5000|$|... on {{the trade}} union demand for means for {{securing}} trustworthy records of wage-contracts between employer and workman, e.g. the section requiring particulars of work and wages for <b>piece-workers.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{showed them}} how they could turn out more work and make more money by my plan. This appealed to the <b>piece-workers.</b> I {{demonstrated}} to the others that the right way is the easiest way--I showed {{them how they}} could earn their wages with less effort." ...|$|R
5000|$|... (b) by {{ensuring}} that <b>piece-workers</b> in the textile trades (and other trades specified {{by the secretary of}} state) shall receive, before commencing any piece of work, clear particulars of the wages applicable to the work to be done and of the work to which that rate is to be applied.|$|R
60|$|By {{three in}} the {{afternoon}} the strain of the <b>piece-workers</b> in the humid, heated room grew tense. Elderly women gasped and sighed; the color {{went out of the}} cheeks of the young women, their faces became drawn and dark circles formed under their eyes; but all held on with weary, unabated speed. The tireless, vigilant forewoman kept a sharp lookout for incipient hysteria, and once led a narrow-chested, stoop-shouldered young thing out of the place in time to prevent a collapse.|$|R
50|$|The duty {{to receive}} {{employees}} into service {{does not mean}} that employers must necessarily provide employees with work to keep them busy, although this general rule is subject to some exceptions: where, for example, remuneration is based on the volume of work done, {{as in the case of}} <b>piece-workers</b> or salespersons working on commission, or where the failure to allow the employee to work degrades his status. A duty to provide work may also arise where the employer has contracted to train the employee in a particular profession or trade, as in the case of article clerks and apprentices.|$|R
5000|$|Shapiro {{was born}} at Bethnal Green Hospital in the East End {{district}} of Bethnal Green, London. Her early childhood was spent in a Clapton council house in the London borough of Hackney, where she attended Northwold Primary School and Clapton Park Comprehensive School until Christmas 1961. She is the granddaughter of Russian Jewish immigrants; her parents, who were <b>piece-workers</b> in the garment industry, attended Lea Bridge Road Synagogue. The family moved from Clapton to the Victoria Park area of Hackney, on the Parkside Estate, when she was nine. [...] "It was, and remains, a beautiful place," [...] {{she said in a}} 2006 interview.|$|R
5000|$|The strike quickly {{came to a}} close after city {{public works}} {{employees}} joined the action. The Philadelphia city government announced that the [...] "hours of labour of the working men employed under the authority of the city corporation would be from 'six to six' during the summers season, allowing one hour for breakfast, and one for dinner." [...] On June 22, three weeks after the coal heavers initially struck, the ten-hour system and an increase in wages for <b>piece-workers</b> was adopted in the city. As news of the strikers' success spread to other cities, a wave of general strikes forced most of the country to adopt the same standard.|$|R
50|$|During the strike, {{the police}} found {{explosives}} {{in three different}} places along the mills. Meanwhile, Wood settled with the strikers, giving them time and a quarter for overtime and thirty cents more a week to <b>piece-workers.</b> The problem was solved for the moment, but the authorities were looking into the explosives. Eventually, by tracing the serial numbers on the dynamite, the authorities received a confession from the mill contractor, Ernest Pittman. He told them that he and another man, John Breen, had planted the explosives to implicate the IWW. Since they were both employed by William Wood, Wood was indicted for conspiracy to destroy the mills. After a long trial, the grand jury found William Wood not guilty on June 6, 1913.|$|R
5000|$|... (d) {{to raise}} the age of {{employment}} of children and restrict the employment of women immediately after childbirth;(e) to require particulars of rate of wages to be given with work to <b>piece-workers</b> in certain branches of the textile industries;(f) to amend the act of 1878 in various subsidiary ways, with the view of improving the administration of its principles, e.g. by increasing the means of checking the amount of overtime worked, empowering inspectors to enter work-places used as dwellings without a justice's warrant, and the imposition of minimum penalties in certain cases. On this act followed four years of greatly accelerated administrative activity. No fewer than sixteen trades were scheduled {{by the secretary of}} state as dangerous to health. The manner of preparing and establishing suitable rules was greatly modified by the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 and will be dealt with in that connexion.|$|R
5000|$|Of the {{sections}} touching on wages questions, {{the prohibition of}} the payment of wages in public-houses remains unaltered, being re-enacted in 1887; {{the sections}} relating to payment by weight for amount of mineral gotten by persons employed, and for checkweighing the amount by a [...] " [...] checkweigher [...] " [...] stationed {{by the majority of}} workers at each place appointed for the weighing of the material, were revised, particularly as to the determination of deductions by the act of 1887, with a view to meeting some problems raised by decisions on cases under the act of 1872. The attempt seems not to have been wholly successful, the highest legal authorities having expressed conflicting opinions on the precise meaning of the terms [...] " [...] mineral contracted to be gotten." [...] The whole history of the development of this means of securing the fulfilment of wage contract to the workers may be compared with the history of the sections affording protection to <b>piece-workers</b> by particulars of work and wages in the textile trades since the Factory Act of 1891.|$|R
50|$|The {{requirement}} of annual returns from occupiers of persons employed, and the competency {{of the person}} charged with infringing the act to give evidence in his defence, were important new provisions, as was also {{the adoption of the}} powers to direct a formal investigation of any accident on the lines laid down in section 45 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act 1887. Other sections, relating to sanitation and safety, were developments of previous regulations, e.g. the fixing of a standard of overcrowding, provision of sanitary accommodation separate for each sex where the standard of the Public Health Act Amendment Act 1890 had not been adopted by the competent local sanitary authority, power to order a fan or other mechanical means to carry off injurious gas, vapour or other impurity (the previous power covering only dust). The fencing of machinery and definition of accidents were made more precise, young persons were prohibited from cleaning dangerous machinery, and additional safeguards against risk of injury by fire or panic were introduced. On the question of employment the foremost amendments lay in the almost complete prohibition of overtime for young persons, and the restriction of the power of an employer to employ protected persons outside his factory or workshop {{on the same day that}} he had employed them in the factory or workshop. Under the head of particulars of work and wages to <b>piece-workers</b> an important new power, highly valued by the workers, was given to apply the principle with the necessary modifications by order of the secretary of state to industries other than textile and to outworkers as well as to those employed inside factories and workshops.|$|R
