In American oil palm (Elaeis oleifera) fruit mesocarp, C 16 : 0 content can be minimized by <b>post-transcriptional</b> PATE <b>gene</b> <b>silencing.</b> In this study, 12 weeks old immature zygotic embryos (IZEs) of E. oleifera were transformed with a construct carrying 619 bp long antisense PATE (antiPATE) gene driven by oil palm mesocarp-tissue-specific promoter. The particle bombardment-mediated method of plant transformation was used. Selection of the transformed IZEs was carried out using hygromycin (HYG) as a selection marker. Plantlets were regenerated from the HYG resistant IZEs. A total of 56 HYG resistant plantlets were regenerated successfully.

In the present study, we explored the expression patterns and function of epithin, a mouse type II transmembrane serine protease, during preimplantation embryo development. RT-PCR analysis showed that epithin mRNAs were detectable during the cleavage stages from a 1 -cell zygote to the blastocyst. Immunocytochemical studies revealed that epithin protein was expressed at blastomere contacts of the compacted 8 -cell and later embryonic stages. Epithin colocalized with E-cadherin at the membrane contacts of the compacted morula-stage embryo as revealed by double-staining immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy, respectively. <b>Post-transcriptional</b> epithin <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in the blockade of 8 -cell in vitro-stage embryo compaction and subsequent embryonic deaths after several rounds of cell division.

Three suppressor of pas 2 (sop) mutations modified {{the degradation of}} mis-spliced pas 2 - 1 mRNA species, allowing the synthesis of a functional protein.

General therapeutic principles to correct these genetic defects mostly rely on <b>post-transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> regulation (RNA <b>silencing).</b> Engineered zinc-finger (ZF) protein-based repression of transcription may represent a novel approach for treating gain-of-function mutations, although proof-of-concept of this use is still lacking. Here, we generated a series of transcriptional repressors to silence human rhodopsin (hRHO), the gene most abundantly expressed in retinal photoreceptors. The strategy was designed to suppress both the mutated and the wild-type hRHO allele in a mutational-independent fashion, to overcome mutational heterogeneity of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa due to hRHO mutations. Here we demonstrate that ZF proteins promote a robust transcriptional repression of hRHO in a transgenic mouse model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Furthermore, we show that specifically decreasing the mutated human RHO transcript in conjunction with unaltered expression of the endogenous murine Rho gene results in amelioration of disease progression, as demonstrated by significant improvements in retinal morphology and function. This zinc-finger-based mutation-independent approach paves the way towards a ‘repression–replacement’ strategy, {{which is expected to}} facilitate widespread applications in the development of novel therapeutics for a variety of disorders that are due to gain-of-function mutations...|$|R

Whereas two homologs exist in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has remained uncertain whether metazoans possess different paralogs or isoforms of Tpr that might explain controversial reports on the subcellular localization of this protein. To address these possibilities, we first determined the sequence {{and structure of the}} murine tpr gene, revealing a TATA box-less gene of approximately 57 kb and 52 exons. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA and radiation hybrid mapping showed that murine tpr exists as a single-copy gene on chromosome 1; RNA blotting analyses and EST (expressed sequence tag) database mining revealed that its expression results in only one major mRNA in embryonic and most adult tissues. Accordingly, novel antibodies against the N- and C-terminus of Tpr identified the full-length protein as the major translation product in different somatic cell types; reinvestigation of Tpr localization by confocal microscopy corroborated a predominant localization at the nuclear pore complexes in these cells. Antibody specificity and reliability of Tpr localization was demonstrated by <b>post-transcriptional</b> tpr <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> using siRNAs that eliminated the Tpr signal at the nuclear periphery but did not affect intranuclear staining of Tpr-unrelated proteins. Finally, we defined several sequence and structural features that characterize Tpr polypeptides in different species and used these as a guideline to search whole-genome sequence databases for putative paralogs of Tpr in higher eukaryotes. This approach resulted in identification of the Tpr orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans, but also in the realization that no further paralogs of Tpr exist in several metazoan model organisms or in humans. In summary, these results reveal Tpr to be a unique protein localized at the nuclear periphery of the somatic cell in mammals...|$|R

In the case of TGS, AGO interacts with plant-specific RNA Pol V and its transcripts, which are again complementary to the sRNA. This interaction allows assembling of a protein complex facilitating DNA and histone methylation inhibiting RNA Pol II transcription. There are numerous ways the dsRNA can arise. A significant part of dsRNA cell production is dependent on synthesising the complementary strand of the dsRNA by RDR 6 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6).
