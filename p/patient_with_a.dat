However, differences in the all-cause and cause-specific mortality risk between catheter use and arteriovenous access use in young and elderly haemodialysis patients {{have not yet been}} investigated. In this prospective cohort study of 1109 incident haemodialysis patients from 38 centres in the Netherlands, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated for 2 -year all-cause, infection-related and cardiovascular mortality in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> catheter as compared to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> arteriovenous access stratified for age (< 65 years and ≥ 65 years). Of the 1109 patients, 919 had an arteriovenous access and 190 had a catheter. The mortality rate was 76 per 1000 person-years in young <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> arteriovenous access, 129 per 1000 person-years in young <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> catheter, 222 per 1000 person-years in elderly <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> arteriovenous access and 427 per 1000 person-years in elderly <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> catheter.

5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E

40|$|Objective: A prospective, monocentric {{study was}} {{performed}} to analyze pulmonary haemodynamics in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> open and closed atrial septal defect (ASD). We hypothesized that <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> open ASD more frequently develop higher pulmonary artery pressures. Methods: Tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV), left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) velocity time integral (VTI) were measured by Doppler echocardiography during supine bicycle exercise in 6 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> open ASD and in 6 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> closed ASD. The protocol started at 25 Watts with increments of 25 Watts every 2 -minute stage. 2 D, Doppler and Tissue Doppler images were digitized at each stage for off-line analysis. Tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) was estimated using the simplified Bernouillie equation; pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was estimated as the ratio of peak TRV and RV VTI. Results: Whereas {{there was no difference}} in TRPG at rest (19, 6  5, 0 versus 22, 15  8, 2; p = 0, 546), mean TRPGs at 125 Watts tended to be higher in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> open ASD compared to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> closed ASD (53, 5  11, 3 versus 36, 7  2, 5; p = 0, 066).

40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> acute {{ischemic stroke}} often present {{subsequent}} new diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions. These new DWI lesions typically lack clinical symptoms {{but they are}} associated <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased risk for vascular events in the future. An independent risk factor for new DWI lesions is the initial lesion pattern: In previous studies <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non single lesion pattern had an increased risk for new DWI lesions. So far this risk factor has not been analyzed in detail. A more precise differentiation according to vascular supply territories may help to identify those <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> the highest risk for new DWI-lesions. Methods: Stroke patients underwent three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, 3 Tesla) examinations within the first week after the initial event: on admission, {{on the following day}} and four to seven days after symptom onset. The DWI images were anonymized, randomized and analyzed by raters blinded to clinical information. DWI lesions were delineated manually. Then DWI images were coregistered. The lesion pattern was assessed on the first image. The second and third images were analyzed for new hyperintensities. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> more than one lesion in only one vascular supply territory were defined as <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scattered lesion pattern. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> more than one lesion in more than one vascular territory were defined as <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> multiple lesion pattern. Three different vascular supply territories were distinguished: territory of the left internal carotid artery, territory of the right internal carotid artery, and the vertebrobasilar territory. Results: In this study, 340 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> acute ischemic stroke were included. Of these 147 patients (43 %) had a single lesion pattern, 136 patients (40 %) had a scattered lesion pattern and 57 patients (17 %) had a multiple lesion pattern. New DWI lesions were detected in 38 % of the study population. The risk for new DWI lesions was about four times higher in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> multiple lesion pattern (Odds Ratio = 3. 64, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 75 – 7. 58) and about two times higher in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scattered lesion pattern (Odds Ratio = 1. 96, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 09 – 3. 56) compared to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single lesion pattern. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> multiple lesion pattern had diabetes mellitus more often compared to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scattered lesion pattern. Also new DWI lesions in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> multiple lesion pattern were located remotely from the initial area of hypoperfusion more often compared to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scattered lesion pattern.
