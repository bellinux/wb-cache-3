40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} relation between equity returns and <b>profitability.</b> I develop several dynamic equity valuation models that have the common characteristic that a value maximizing manager suspends corporate growth upon low <b>profitability.</b> <b>Profitability</b> {{increases the likelihood of}} future growth which engenders risk and increases return. Thus, over some range of <b>profitability,</b> returns and <b>profitability</b> relate positively. I use these dynamic equity valuation models to investigate a number of hitherto unexplained phenomena in equity markets. These phenomena are all related to the “value-premium” which is the empirical observation that low market/book “value” stocks have higher returns than high market/book “growth” stocks. First, I propose a new explanation for the value-premium: the “limits-to-growth hypothesis. ” With organizational limits on growth expenditure, <b>profitability</b> decreases risk for high <b>profitability</b> “growth” firms but increases risk for low <b>profitability</b> “value” firms in anticipation of future growth-leverage. Consistent with {{a modified version of the}} limits-to-growth hypothesis, I find that <b>profitability</b> increases returns to a greater extent for value compared to growth firms. Second, I find no evidence of limited growth opportunities that would otherwise induce low returns for high <b>profitability</b> non-dividend paying companies. Non-dividend paying firms do not face the same growth limits as dividend paying firms. They finance growth investments internally only as <b>profitability</b> permits. These investments increase risk and return. Consistent with this prediction, I find high returns for high <b>profitability,</b> high market/book, growth stocks, which is a negative value-premium for non-dividend paying stocks. Third, I show that distress-risk is part of the reason for the value-premium despite the commonly reported anomalous observation that high distress-risk firms have low returns. <b>Profitability</b> impacts two risks in opposite ways. <b>Profitability</b> decreases distress-risk but increases growth-leverage. Thus, high <b>profitability</b> firms with low distress-risk and high growth-leverage can have higher returns than low <b>profitability</b> firms with high distress-risk and low growth-leverage. The value-premium for firms in financial distress arises from a U-shaped relation between returns and <b>profitability</b> and a hill-shaped relation between market/book and <b>profitability.</b> When market/book is low (high or low <b>profitability),</b> returns are high...|$|R

2500|$|Oystercatcher mussel feeding {{provides}} an example of how the optimal diet model can be utilized. [...] Oystercatchers forage on mussels and crack them open with their bills. The constraints on these birds are the characteristics of the different mussel sizes.

This means that while large mussels have a higher energy content (E), they also have a longer handling time (h). The profitability of any mussel is calculated as E/h. [...] The oystercatchers must decide which mussel size will provide enough nutrition to outweigh the cost and energy required to open it. In their study, Meire and Ervynck tried to model this decision by graphing the relative <b>profitabilities</b> of different sized mussels.

However, they observed that if an oystercatcher rejected too many small mussels, the time it took to search for the next suitable mussel greatly increased.

[...] However, while this model predicted that oystercatchers should prefer mussels of 50–55mm, the observed data showed that oystercatchers actually prefer mussels of 30–45mm.

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-stage principal-agent screening environment in a decentralized supply chain with retailers, distributors, and a supplier. The retailers possess private information regarding their local market <b>profitabilities.</b> The distributors can partially observe the retailers' <b>profitabilities</b> and are heterogeneous {{with regard to}} the precision of that information. The supplier determines the level of production, but knows neither the local market <b>profitabilities</b> nor the precision of the distributors' information. The supplier first allocates finished products to distributors, and the distributors then contract with local retailers with a capacity constraint. We find that due to the distributors' superior information, the quantity distortion on the retailers' side is mitigated, and the upstream information asymmetry subsequently affects the quantity allocation among the downstream retailers. The supplier may not benefit from contracting with the distributors. In addition, no distributor is excluded based on the heterogeneity of the information precision, even though some distributors do not have better information than the supplier. In the numerical examples, we further analyze how the local market heterogeneity and inventory costs affect the capacity allocation, the retailers' payoffs, and the supply chain profits.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a better {{understanding}} of the evolution of small firm performance.

The majority of earlier studies tend to focus on the evolution of firm growth or <b>profitability</b> separately.
