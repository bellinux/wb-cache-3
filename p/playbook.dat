5|$|McElhenny was {{a first-round}} {{pick of the}} San Francisco 49ers in the 1952 NFL Draft, ninth overall, and made an {{immediate}} impression as a rookie. His first play as a professional was a 40-yard touchdown run which had been drawn in the dirt because {{he had not yet}} learned the team's <b>playbook.</b> He recorded the season's longest run from scrimmage (89 yards), the longest punt return (94 yards), and the top rushing average (7.0 yards per carry).

5|$|Brown is {{credited}} {{with a number of}} American football innovations.

5|$|Industry analysts {{feared that}} the storm could seriously impact the box office {{prospects}} of two films opening that weekend, Identity Thief and Side Effects, {{both of which were}} seen as having potential to do better than most winter movies.

Side Effects finished a distant third with a quarter of Identity Thiefs take. The clearest sign of the storm's effect, according to Box Office Mojo, was the 35% drop in earnings for Silver Linings <b>Playbook,</b> then in wide release after several Oscar nominations.|$|E
