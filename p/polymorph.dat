5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or <b>polymorph.</b> For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second <b>polymorph</b> was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E

There {{was no difference between}} <b>polymorphs</b> from the two groups of ewes in their ability to phagocytose Pseudomonas organisms. <b>Polymorphs</b> from the infected ewes showed significant phagocytic superiority over cells from ewes given the killed vaccine when S. aureus was the target organism. This phagocytic superiority could be abrogated by removal of cytophilic immunoglobulin from <b>polymorphs</b> and restored by replacement of cytophilic immunoglobulin. It was shown by staining <b>polymorphs</b> with FITC-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin sera that cytophilic immunoglobulin on the surface of <b>polymorphs</b> belonged to the IgG 2 class of immunoglobulins. When 'neutral' <b>polymorphs</b> (from non-immunized ewes) were coated with IgG 2 purified from the sera of infected ewes, they exhibited enhanced phagocytosis of staphylococci compared with 'neutral' <b>polymorphs</b> carying IgG 2 from the sera of ewes given the killed vaccine...|$|R
50|$|Inversion is {{a complex}} form of neomorphism in which the {{recrystallization}} process transforms <b>polymorphs</b> into different <b>polymorphs.</b> <b>Polymorphs,</b> to be clear, are minerals that differ from one another in their crystalline structures but are otherwise composed of identical quantities and types of elements.

It was found that one-, two- or three-dimensional isostructurality is exhibited by {{approximately half of the}} compounds analyzed. Among the isostructural <b>polymorphs,</b> the frequency of one-, two- and three-dimensional isostructurality is similar. From the examples, it appears that three-dimensional isostructurality is connected to the gradual ordering of crystal structures, while one- and two-dimensional isostructurality can often be related to specific packing interactions. The possibility of many similar interactions seems to decrease the probability of the occurrence of isostructural <b>polymorphs.</b> Conformational <b>polymorphs</b> do not exhibit isostructurality...|$|R
5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is {{the most}} widely used <b>polymorph.</b> It is a good {{lubricant}} at both low and high temperatures (up to 900°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E

Most researchers, however, find this hypothesis highly unlikely because it is not an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the rate the P. rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable food source {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer <b>polymorph</b> of P. rebeli).

40|$|Formation of {{multiple}} <b>polymorphs</b> during two-dimensional (2 D) crystallization of organic molecules {{is more of}} a routine occurrence than rarity. Although such diverse crystalline structures provide exciting possibilities for studying crystal engineering in 2 D, predicting the occurrence of <b>polymorphs</b> for a given building block is often non-trivial. Moreover, there is scarcity of methods that can experimentally verify the presence of such crystalline <b>polymorphs</b> in a straightforward fashion. Here we demonstrate a relatively simple experimental approach for screening of 2 D <b>polymorphs</b> formed at the solution–solid interface. The strategy involves use of solution flow produced by contacting a piece of tissue paper to the sample to generate a lateral density gradient along the substrate surface. In situ generation of such gradient allows rapid discovery and nanoscale separation {{of multiple}} 2 D <b>polymorphs</b> in a single experiment.

25|$|For a {{while it}} was thought that there were two polymorphs of solid {{carbonic}} acid, called α and β. The <b>polymorph</b> denoted β-carbonic acid was prepared by heating alternating layers of glassy aqueous solutions of bicarbonate and acid in vacuum, which causes protonation of the bicarbonate, followed by removal of the solvent.

25|$|The {{carbonate}} minerals {{are those}} were the main anionic group is carbonate, 2−. Carbonates tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid. Due to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates. The reaction of acid with carbonates, most commonly found as the <b>polymorph</b> calcite and aragonite (CaCO3), relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral, which is a key {{in the formation of}} limestone caves, features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites, and karst landforms. Carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments. The carbonate group is structurally a triangle, where a central C4+ cation is surrounded by three O2− anions; different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles. The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, and is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble. Calcite, CaCO3, can have a high magnesium impurity; under high-Mg conditions, its <b>polymorph</b> aragonite will form instead; the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an aragonite or calcite sea, depending on which mineral preferentially forms. Dolomite is a double carbonate, with the formula CaMg(CO3)2. Secondary dolomitization of limestone is common, where calcite or aragonite are converted to dolomite; this reaction increases pore space (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite), which can create a reservoir for oil and gas. These two minerals species are members of eponymous mineral groups: the calcite group includes carbonates with the general formula XCO3, and the dolomite group constitutes minerals with general formula XY(CO3)2.|$|E
25|$|Polymorphism {{can extend}} beyond pure {{symmetry}} content. The aluminosilicates are {{a group of}} three minerals – kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite – which share the chemical formula Al2SiO5. Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These difference arise correspond to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination by oxygen; the silicon, as a general rule is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a case like stishovite (SiO2, an ultra-high pressure quartz <b>polymorph</b> with rutile structure). In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as AlAlSiO5, to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5).|$|E
40|$|In acute {{immunologic}} injury {{of tissues}} {{one of the}} common features noted is the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<b>polymorphs)</b> along with antigen, antibody, and host complement (C') at the site of damage.

Once the incorporation level exceeds a certain threshold, both additives kinetically stabilize the metastable A. To understand why the additives stabilize A, Cerius 2 was used to study the molecular interaction between additives and WAY.
