In M2M applications where there is no requirement to change the SIM card, this avoids the requirement for a connector, improving reliability and security. GSMA has been discussing the possibilities of a software based SIM card since 2010. While Motorola noted that eUICC is geared at industrial devices, Apple [...] "disagreed that there is any statement forbidding the use of an embedded UICC in a consumer product." [...] in 2012, The European Commission has selected the Embedded UICC format for its <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> service known as eCall. All new car models in the EU will need to have one by 2018 to instantly connect the car to the emergency services in case of an accident. In Russia there is a similar plan with the ERA-GLONASS regional satellite positioning system and in Brazil with the SIMRAV anti-theft system.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{diffusion}} of in-car navigators, location-enabled smartphones and various reasons for tracking vehicles - either for insurance and recovery, fleet management or for electronic tolling - are making floating car data (FCD) a leading solution for traffic monitoring. In the next years, this solution might be much more strengthened by the introduction and diffusion of black boxes, installed on commercial or private vehicles devoted to monitor or validate new safety technologies (e. g., the automatic <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> service eCall in Europe). 1 FCD, possibly integrated with data coming from infrastructure-based monitoring systems, represents a valuable platform for intelligent transport systems (ITS). Traffic monitoring based on FCD relies on a processing algorithm for aggregating the measured data into an accurate and complete traffic map. In this paper we present an experimental study on FCD processing based on a unique large amount of data in Italy, provided by heavy-duty vehicles used as probes over the Italian A 4 motorway. A processing procedure is proposed for identifying the typical speed patterns, {{to be used as}} baseline for automatic anomaly detection, transport planning or traffic analysis applications. A first assessment based on real traffic-event information shows that the comparison of the probe data to previously identified historical speed patterns allows a clear detection of anomalous event...|$|R

40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the problems with}} positioning of <b>emergency</b> telephone <b>calls.</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>calls</b> to the <b>emergency</b> number “ 112 ” answered by the emergency service in Sweden cannot always be positioned. That is, it cannot be decided where the call is coming from. The problem with positing of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> is mainly caused by <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> coming from Internet Protocol (IP) telephones. Since the use of IP telephones are {{increasing the number of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> coming from IP telephones will increase. For the emergency service to provide a secure and reliable service to the public it is crucial that all <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> can be positioned correctly. The report explains how <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> are connected towards the emergency service in Sweden, from the different types of telephones that support <b>emergency</b> <b>calls.</b> For the traditional fixed land line all <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> can be positioned, when using a mobile telephone 90 % of the <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> can be positioned. The IP telephones can be divided into two categories, fixed and nomadic. When a fixed IP telephone is used the <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> can always be positioned correctly, the problem occurs when a nomadic IP telephone is used. Interviews have been held with the four largest IP telephone operators to get their views of the problem and whether they have an opinion on how to solve the problem. Practical tests have been performed to show the problem and when it occurs. To solve the problem with positioning of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> coming from IP telephones an international standard must be set. New features needs to be implemented in the networks so that the calls coming from IP telephones can be positioned and utilize positioning features such as GPS. A lot of work still remains before an international standard can be set...|$|R

40|$|A {{key feature}} of civil safety {{is the ability}} to respond to {{unwanted}} incidents. The first link in the response chain is usually the <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> centers, and {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the work at an <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> center in connection with large scale incidents. The delivery of the study is two-fold: firstly, a bottom-up analysis was performed in order to outline work at the <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> center during large scale incidents. This approach resulted in a content model depicting the features of work during large scale incidents. Secondly, a theory driven top-down analysis was performed based on the same data in order to investigate whether a resilience perspective on safety is an appropriate framework for work at the <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> center during large scale incidents. The data consisted of <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> center operators’ reflections around their own work during large scale incidents, and was gathered through semi-structured interviews. Statistical comparisons between the resilience model and the content model revealed that the former was not able to account for all the statements captured in the content model, and hence it does not provide a complete framework for understanding work at the <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> center during large scale incidents. This study provides insight to a field that has received little attention from previous research and contributes to a better understanding of the role <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> centers play with regard to emergency management and hence to civil safety...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} stage of life, palliative care {{patients}} often experience episodes of respiratory distress, bleeding, pain or seizures. In such situations, caregivers may <b>call</b> <b>emergency</b> medical services leading to unwanted hospital admissions. The study aims {{to show the}} influence of our palliative care team to reducing <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> by cancer patients or their relatives during the last six month of life. Methods Fifty relatives of deceased patients who had been attended by our palliative care team were randomly selected. Data was obtained retrospectively during a structured interview. In addition to demographic data, the number of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> made during the final {{six months of the}} patient's life, the reason for the call and the mental compound score (MCS- 12) of the caregivers was registered. Results Forty-six relatives agreed to the interview. <b>Emergency</b> <b>calls</b> were placed for 18 patients (39 %) during the final six months of their lives. There were a total of 23 <b>emergency</b> <b>calls.</b> In 16 cases (70 %) the patient was admitted to the hospital. Twenty-one (91 %) of the calls were made before patients had been enrolled to receive palliative care from the team, and two (9 %) were made afterwards. The mean mental compound score of the caregivers {{at the time of the}} interview was 41 (range 28 – 57). There was a lack of correlation between MCS- 12 and number of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls.</b> Conclusion <b>Emergency</b> <b>calls</b> were more likely to occur if the patients were not being attended by our palliative care team. Because of the lack of correlation between MCS- 12 and the number of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls,</b> the MCS- 12 cannot indicate that acutely stressful situations triggered the calls. However, we conclude that special palliative care programs can reduce psychosocial strain in family caregivers. Therefore, the number of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> may be reduced and this fact allows more palliative patients to die at home. </p...|$|R
40|$|Stress at work is {{a public}} health concern. Phone {{operators}} in emergency medical dispatch centers are particularly at risk. We aimed {{to demonstrate that the}} most stressful time for emergency medical dispatchers is the shift when they receive <b>emergency</b> incoming <b>calls,</b> with cortisol as a biomarker of stress. For each emergency medical dispatcher, we measured outcomes over a control day and during three types of shift: Incoming <b>emergency</b> <b>call,</b> Dispatch and Re-assessment. The pattern of shifts was randomized. Saliva was sampled every 15 minutes for 2 hours, i. e. 6 consecutive times, starting 15 minutes after the first life-and-death incoming <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> between 2 and 5 pm during three types of shift. We measured saliva cortisol every 2 hours over a control day, from 7 am to 9 pm. Perceived stress was assessed by a visual analog scale. We recruited 22 phone operators aged 36. 4 +/- 10. 8 years old (14 women and 8 men). Cortisol values were higher during the Incoming <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> shift than during the Dispatch (p =. 04) and Re-assessment (p =. 04) shifts. The increase in cortisol levels was greater in men than in women (p =. 009). There were no differences between control values and those of the three shifts. The kinetics of cortisol increased with greater perceived stress overall (p <. 001) and for each type of shift (Incoming <b>emergency</b> <b>call,</b> p =. 02; Dispatch p =. 03; Re-assessment: p <. 001). The kinetics of cortisol in response to incoming <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> was greater when the call was an absolute emergency (p =. 03), and also tended to further increase when a subsequent absolute incoming <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> was received (p = 0. 07). In conclusion, the incoming <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> shift carries particular risk for dispatchers, who have greater perceived stress and a greater increase in cortisol levels...|$|R
