5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E

25|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} to Brevik were first put forward in 1875, {{but not until}} 4 July 1891 did Parliament pass {{legislation}} to build the line. The main proponent for the line was Brevik Municipality, while Eidanger Municipality was less eager. Brevik therefore agreed to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> expropriations for the right-of-way within Eidanger. However, Eidanger Municipality wanted {{a branch of the}} Brevik Line to Eidangerfjorden somewhere south of Nystrand, but this was never fulfilled.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the railway}} would {{be located in}} the former Eidanger Municipality. Eidanger Municipal Council was not {{particularly}} interested in the railway, and was not willing to pay for expropriation in their own municipality. Thus Brevik Municipality was forced to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> expropriation along the line and limited their support for the entire project to NOK16,000. Brevik Municipal Council passed the plans and their financing on 31 March 1893. However, there was not community consensus as to the location of Brevik Station, with large camps each preferring Strømtangen and Setretangen. The municipal council voted in favor of Strømtangen on 25 June.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 the Green Line was realigned {{slightly}} {{north and}} away from the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub, allowing for the opening of the extension to the Salt Lake City International Airport. Several months later, in August 2013, the Blue Line was extended further south to Draper (which opened August 18, 2013). The extensions to South Jordan, West Valley City, Draper, and the Airport were funded in part by a Salt Lake County sales tax increase that would <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> four of the proposed TRAX extensions. A letter of intent signed with the Federal Transit Administration on September 24, 2007 secured the remaining funding for the light rail lines.|$|E

25|$|New York State Route990L (NY990L) is a {{reference}} route in Chenango County, New York, in the United States. The western terminus {{of the route}} is at an intersection with NY12 {{in the city of}} Norwich. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY23 in the town of Norwich. NY990L is one of four reference routes in New York that has been erroneously signed as a touring route. The highway is known as East Main Street in the city of Norwich and as East River Road in the town of Norwich. Both roads were designated state arterial highways in 1954, requiring the state to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> maintenance on the roads.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} and middle Republican era, conscripted {{soldiers}} and their officers were expected to provide or <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> their personal equipment. From the late republic onwards, they were salaried professionals, and bought their own clothing from legionary stores, quartermasters or civilian contractors. Military needs were prioritised. Clothing was expensive to start with, and the military demand was high; this inevitably pushed up prices, and a common soldier's clothing expenses could {{be more than a}} third of his annual pay. In the rampant inflation of the later Imperial era, as currency and salaries were devalued, deductions from military salaries for clothing and other staples were replaced by payments in kind, leaving common soldiers adequately clothed but with little cash for their dependents, or eventual retirement.|$|E
25|$|Privatization {{works when}} the person who owns the {{property}} (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving {{the tragedy of the}} commons. Internalizing the externalities, in other words ensuring that the users of resource <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.|$|E

25|$|The Richard E. Jacobs Group had {{constructed}} Society Center for Society National Bank. The 57-story skyscraper, Cleveland's tallest building, opened in January 1992. In February 1996, KeyCorp leased eight floors in the McDonald Investment Center and three floors at Society Center, but agreed to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the operational costs at Society Center. On March 8, 1996, the Jacobs Group acquired the Cleveland Trust Company Building for $10. KeyCorp {{agreed to the}} extremely low purchase price because it had assumed control of Society Center. Society Center was renamed Key Tower on March 20, With all banking operations now centralized in Key Tower, the Cleveland Trust Company Building and the Cleveland Trust Tower were no longer needed. Both buildings closed in December 1996 {{as part of a}} wide-ranging closure of numerous KeyCorp branches.|$|E
25|$|In fall 2003, Nadeau began {{discussions with}} MB2 Motorsports boss Jay Frye about a {{long-term}} comeback. Frye gave Nadeau a test at Concord Speedway, {{where he was}} unable to feel his car's brake pedal. He also suffered a loss of stamina during this test. Because of the effects of his accident, Nadeau had to learn to walk. He also experienced slurred speech. He undertook physical therapy five times during the week. This was later reduced to three when his condition improved. While Nadeau received a small financial settlement from NASCAR, it was not enough to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> of his rehabilitation, so he sold his large house near Lake Norman and moved to Davidson, North Carolina. He also suffered from depression caused by the loss of his racing career.|$|E

L. Gore and Associates. Between 2009 and 2014 the hardest-hit sectors, in terms of jobs, were Information and Communication, Construction and Manufacturing which each lost around 500 full-time jobs. By contrast, the Professional, Scientific and Technical sector saw an upsurge in jobs {{in addition to the}} Business Administration and Support Service sector which increased by approximately 1,000 full-time and 300 part-time jobs in the same six-year period. Gross median weekly earnings of full-time employees in Dundee in 2015 was £523.50; men received £563.40 and women £451.80. Gross weekly <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> employees in Dundee has increased from £325.00 in 2000 to £380.00 in 2015.|$|E

50|$|Aramark {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} a number of scandals {{regarding}} labor practices and business ethics.

25|$|To ensure {{every single}} {{operation}} showed a clear profit {{on a full}} costing basis, i.e. inclusive of all overhead costs, the company required each operation to be budgeted in detail before deciding whether to accept it. The managing director's authorisation was required to dispense with this rule in exceptional cases where the risk of accepting a contract that was only marginally profitable, i.e. excluding overheads, was outweighed by {{the risk of having}} an aircraft sit idly on the ground. An immediate financial analysis that compared actual costs and revenues with their budgets followed the completion of each flight, thereby instantly gauging that flight's profitability and validating the effectiveness of the firm's pricing policy. A policy of requiring aircraft commanders to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> operating expenses other than fuel in cash proved to be an effective method to exercise instant cost control over fees and charges incurred for products and services supplied by third parties, such as ground handling fees, technical support services and catering supplies.|$|E
25|$|Within {{one week}} of the crash, cash {{payments}} ranging from $1,000 to $3,700 (all figures in this article in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated) were given to passengers for interim emergency use. These funds were given to passengers through an emergency centre {{set up in the}} Novotel Hotel in Mississauga, near the airport. These payments were independent of the claims process, which has been started for passengers who have not retained counsel. It is expected that the insurers of Air France will <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> damages as well as extra compensation for having passengers go through the ordeal; however, only amounts of €6,000 to €9,000 have been offered, prompting passengers to turn to the lawsuit to seek legal action. The insurance is handled by the Societé de Gestion & D'Expertises D'Assurances in France. All passengers have also been offered a free round-trip ticket to any Air France destination in the world in the same fare class in which they were originally booked on AF358.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{departure}} made by Galactic Civilizations II {{from other}} 4X games is its economic system, {{which is very}} different from the systems used in most strategy games. Typically, 4X strategy games receive money based on a tax rate or based on the income of specific tiles in use by a city or planet. Civilization IV uses this system, and most other 4X strategy games use a variant of it. These incomes are increased by economic structures and sometimes by population, and the profit made off this economic income is used to pay maintenance fees and rush-build units. Galactic Civilizations II adds another layer of complexity by requiring that the income of an empire is used to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> forms of production. In order to produce one unit of product, be it research or manufacturing, the player must pay credits (usually in denominations of a Billion Credits, or BC). It is therefore critical that the player balances the economic income of their empire with their industrial output, and not just with the maintenance of their empire. If the player does not have the economy required to support an industrial planet, then they will have to spend at a deficit, and if the player does not correct their economy, they will eventually go broke. This stands in stark contrast to the Civilization series, where industrial output has nothing to do with the player's economic income.|$|E
