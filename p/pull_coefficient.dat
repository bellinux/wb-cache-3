40|$|Two nearly {{identical}} Boeing-GM wire-mesh Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) wheels were laboratory {{tested in a}} lunar soil simulant to {{determine the influence of}} wheel speed and acceleration, wheel load, presence of a fender, travel direction, and soil strength on the wheel performance. Constant-slip and three types of programmed-slip tests were conducted with a single-wheel dynamometer system. Test results indicated that performance of single LRV wheels in terms of <b>pull</b> <b>coefficient,</b> power number, and efficiency were not influenced by wheel speed and acceleration, travel direction, the presence of a fender, or wheel load. Of these variables, only load influenced sinkage, which increased with increasing load. For a given slip, the <b>pull</b> <b>coefficient</b> and power number increased with increasing soil strength. However, for a given <b>pull</b> <b>coefficient</b> or slope, slip was less in firmer soil; thus, the power number decreased and efficiency increased with increasing soil strength...|$|E

Secondly, by studying on total retail sales of social consumer goods of Sichuan and Hangzhou these 2 places, tourism incomes and the number of tourists at home, selecting the degree of tourism dependence, the contribution rate of tourism to economy and the growth rate of economy which tourism brought these 3 standards, and according to some related statistics of Sichuan from 2002 to 2009, the paper makes a detailed study on influences of tourism on economy by means of Grey Relational analysis in terms of small samples and inadequate information. And analyzing the rates of dependence, contribution and <b>pull</b> <b>coefficient</b> of tourism on economy by comparing Sichuan with Hangzhou these 2 places. The results show that influence of tourism on goods consumption of Hangzhou is much bigger than that of Sichuan. The degree of dependence of GDP in Hangzhou is bigger than that in Sichuan. Except in 2006 and 2007, the contribution rate of tourism on economy and the power of accelerating of tourism of Hangzhou is bigger than that of Sichuan. And finally, this paper proposes that the government should increase the investment in places of scenic beauty and improve the management of the scenery to accelerate the development of tourism of Sichuan.

40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} {{characteristics}} of cargo extraction, the initial phase of airdrop process, a high fidelity and extendibility simulation model with uniform motion equations for all states during extraction is developed {{on the basis of}} dynamics methods and contact models between cargo and aircraft. Simulation results agree well with tests data. Cargo exit parameters, which contribute to cargo pitch after extraction, are studied. Simplified computation model of dimensionless exit time is developed and used to evaluate the relation between extraction phase and landing accuracy. Safe interval model is introduced to evaluate the safety of extraction process. Also, relations between initial parameters, including <b>pull</b> <b>coefficient,</b> aircraft pitch and CG coefficient, etc, and result parameters, including exit time, cargo safety, pitch, etc, are developed to help design of airdrop system. especially the selection of extraction parachute and cargo deployment...|$|E
3000|$|Reassuringly, Fig. 7 in the Appendix {{shows that}} none of the {{countries}} even comes close to reaching the ± 1 threshold for any of the coefficients. In a few cases, DFBETA exceeds the more conservative cutoff of ± 0.47. Concerning external differentiation, which showed the most consistent relationship with internal homogeneity in Table 3, Fig. 7 indicates that both the UK and the German case exert a relatively strong influence on the results. Yet with DFBETA statistics of, respectively, 0.71 and - 0.66 their effects work in opposite directions and should largely neutralize each other. For standardization of input, all DFBETA values fall within the ± 0.47 threshold, so the unexpected negative coefficient of this variable cannot be attributed to a single influential observation. With respect to between-school resource inequality, the Italian case <b>pulls</b> the <b>coefficient</b> estimate upwards, away from the hypothesized direction (DFBETA = 0.59). This underscores the overall interpretation that there is some, albeit no fully conclusive evidence, for the expected negative effect of between-school inequalities on internal homogeneity. For the remaining two predictors, vocational orientation and standardization of output, Fig. 7 indicates that the null results in the main analysis are not due to individual influential cases suppressing an association. 16 Finally, {{it is worth noting that}} Korea—where the group of less-educated adults is very small with a population share of only about 3 [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} tractor {{configuration}} is of primary importance in tillage {{operations for the}} optimisation of traction performance, i. e. for limiting slip which involves energy loss. To a great extent, this aspect affects the fuel consumption and the time required for soil tillage. Tyre inflation pressure and wheel load are both easily managed parameters which {{play a significant role}} in controlling the traction performance of a tractor. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of tyre inflation pressure and wheel load on the traction performance of a mechanical front wheel drive MFWD tractor (65 kW engine power) on an agricultural clay (C) Vertic Cambisol on the basis of results of traction tests and simulations with a semi-empirical soil-tyre interaction model adapted for MFWD vehicles. The traction tests were carried out using four tractor configurations with two tractor weights (40. 8 kN and 50. 2 kN) and two tyre inflation pressures (60 kPa and 160 kPa). Traction performance was considered in terms of drawbar <b>pull,</b> traction <b>coefficient,</b> tractive efficiency, power delivery efficiency and specific fuel consumption in relation to wheel slip. A decrease in tyre pressure and an increase in wheel load resulted in higher drawbar pull however, only the former produced improvements in terms of coefficient of traction, tractive efficiency, power delivery efficiency and specific fuel consumption, while the only significant benefit resulting from the latter was a reduction in specific fuel consumption at a tyre pressure of 160 kPa and a slip of under 15 %. </p...|$|R
40|$|An INFN-LNF/UCLA/SAPIENZA {{collaboration}} {{is developing a}} hybrid photoinjector in X-band. A hybrid photoinjector is a novel high brightness electron source that couples a standing wave cell cavity (acting as an RF gun) directly to a multi-cell travelling-wave structure. This configuration offers a number of advantages over the split standing wave/travelling-wave system. Most notably the reflected RF transient is almost completely suppressed, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a circulator and the bunch lengthening effect that occurs in the drift section of the split system. These properties allow scaling of the device to higher field and frequencies, which should dramatically improve beam brightness. The RF coupling between the standing and the traveling wave sections is accomplished in the fourth cell encountered by the beam, with the SW section electrically coupled to it on-axis. This mode of coupling is particularly advantageous, as it is accompanied by a 900 phase shift in the accelerating field, resulting in strong velocity bunching effects on the beam that reverse the usual bunch lengthening induced after the gun exit in standard 1. 6 cell photoinjectors. In this scenario, from the beam dynamics point of view, it is seen that device may produce ten's of femtosecond beams at similar to 3. 5 MeV and the emittance compensation dynamics remains manageable even in the presence of strong compression. We present here a survey of the device characteristics. In particular we show the results of the electromagnetic simulations, a beam dynamics analysis related to the temperature tuning of the SW and TW section, and a RF characterization using bead <b>pull</b> and scattering <b>coefficient</b> measurements of a device prototype.

40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} in the design, construction and utilization of rubber tracks for agriculture and earth moving machinery has increased considerably. The development of such types of tracks was initiated by the efforts to invent a more environmentally friendly vehicle-terrain system. These tracks are also {{the result of the}} continuous effort to develop more cost-effective traction systems. A rubber-surfaced and friction-based prototype track was developed and mounted on the patented modification of a new Allis Chalmers four wheel drive tractor. The track is propelled by smooth pneumatic tyres by means of rubber-rubber friction and the tractive effort of the track is mainly generated by soil-rubber friction between the rubber surface of the track elements and terrain. The experimental track layer tractor, based on an Allis Chalmers 8070 tractor (141 kW) was tested on concrete and on cultivated sandy loam soil at 7. 8 %; 13 % and 21 % soil water content. The contact pressure and the tangential force on an instrumented track element, as well as the total torque input to one track, was simultaneously recorded during the drawbar pull-slip tests. Soil characteristics for pressure-sinkage and friction-displacement were obtained from the field tests by using an instrumented linear shear and soil sinkage device. By applying the approach based on the classical bevameter technique, analytical methods were implemented for modelling the traction performance of the prototype track system. Different possible pressure distribution profiles under the tracks were considered and compared to the recorded data. Two possible traction models were proposed, one constant pressure model, for minimal inward track deflection and the other a flexible track model with inward deflection and a higher contact pressure at both the front free-wheeling and rear driving tyres. For both models, the traction force was mainly generated by rubber-soil friction and adhesion with limited influence by soil shear. For individual track elements, close agreement between the measured and predicted contact pressure and traction force was observed based on the flexible track model. The recorded and calculated values of the coefficient of traction based on the summation of the traction force for the series of track elements were comparable to the values predicted from modelling. However, the measured values of drawbar <b>pull</b> <b>coefficient</b> were considerably lower than the predicted values, largely caused by internal track friction in addition to energy dissipated by soil compaction. The tractive efficiency for soft surface was also unacceptably low, probably due to the high internal track friction and the low travel speeds applied for the tests. The research undertaken identified and confirmed a model to be used to predict contact pressure and tangential stresses for a single track element. It was capable of predicting the tractive performance for different possible contact pressure values. Thesis (PhD (Argricultural Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.
