5|$|Like many Catholic {{universities}} in the United States, Seton Hall arose out of the <b>Plenary</b> <b>Council</b> of American Bishops, held in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1844, {{with the goal of}} bringing Catholicism to higher education in order to help propagate the faith. The Diocese of Newark had been established by Pope Pius IX in 1853, just three years before the founding of the college, and it necessitated an institution for higher learning. Seton Hall College was formally founded on September 1, 1856, by Newark Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley, a cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt. Bishop Bayley named the institution after his aunt, Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton, who was later named the first American-born Catholic saint.|$|E

[...] As a suffragan diocese to Adelaide, the Pope established the rural Diocese of Port Pirie, naming O'Reilly as its inaugural bishop. [...] Upon his appointment, O'Reilly travelled to Adelaide, where {{he met with the}} Archbishop of Adelaide Christopher Reynolds and the Cardinal of Sydney Patrick Moran to discuss the formation of the new diocese. [...] The poor financial state of the Archdiocese made the discussions contentious, with O'Reilly concerned about the amount of debt Port Augusta would inherit from Adelaide. To ensure a sufficiently large population for the new diocese, Moran suggested that its boundaries be altered from those drawn up by the Pope, but Reynolds opposed this plan. [...] Dissatisfied with the outcome of the discussions, O'Reilly decided to travel to Sydney to deliberate further with the Cardinal, prompting Reynolds to write to Moran: ...|$|E

Later usage has restricted the term <b>plenary</b> to those <b>councils</b> which are presided over by a delegate of the Apostolic See, who has received special power for that purpose, and which are attended by all the metropolitans and bishops of some commonwealth, empire, or kingdom, or by their duly accredited representatives. Such plenary synods are frequently called national councils.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the early}} history of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States all of the dioceses were part of one ecclesiastical {{province}} under the Archbishop of Baltimore. [...] This being the case, governance of the American church was carried out by provincial councils held in Baltimore.

2500|$|The Vicariate was {{elevated}} to the Diocese of Natchez on 28 July 1837, {{at the same}} time that the area of north Louisiana was made a separate diocese; the Diocese of New Orleans was not, however, {{elevated to}} an archdiocese until 1850. Although the Diocese of Natchez encompassed the entire state of Mississippi, a large geographic region, nearly three years passed before John Mary Joseph Chanche, S.S. (1795–1852), a native of Baltimore, was appointed as its first bishop on 15 December 1840. [...] (Since 1840, however, a new bishop has regularly been appointed within a few months of the end of the previous bishop's tenure.) Bishop Chanche, like his predecessor, was of French lineage, having been born to parents who had fled to Baltimore from the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), presumably during the Haitian revolution (which itself occurred at about the same time as the French Revolution). At his arrival, he found one priest in the diocese, a Father Brogard, who was there only temporarily. Chanche set to work building a diocesan infrastructure, and became reasonably well known in the church hierarchy in North America. The First <b>Plenary</b> <b>Council</b> of 1852, held in Baltimore, Maryland, records him as the [...] "chief promoter." [...] By the time he died later that year, he had built 11 churches, with a team of 11 priests and 13 attendant missions.|$|E
50|$|Still further narrowed down to {{our present}} idea of <b>plenary</b> <b>councils</b> are the synods convoked in the Frankish and West-Gothic kingdoms {{from the end of}} the sixth century, and {{designated}} national councils. The bishops in these synods were not gathered together because they belonged to certain ecclesiastical provinces, but because they were under the same civil government, and consequently had common interests which concerned the kingdom in which they lived or the people over whom they ruled.|$|R
5000|$|The Archdiocese of Baltimore is {{the oldest}} diocese in the United States whose see city was within the nation's {{boundaries}} when the United States declared its independence in 1776.

50|$|In 1840, Gregory XVI {{placed the}} society in the rank of Universal Catholic institutions, and on 25 March 1904, {{in the first year}} of his pontificate, Pius X {{recommended}} it to the charity of all the faithful, praising its work, confirming its privileges, and raising the feast of its patron, St. Francis Xavier, to a higher rite. A large number of provincial and national councils (especially the third of the <b>Plenary</b> <b>Councils</b> of Baltimore, 1884), as well as thousands of bishops from all parts of the world, have likewise enacted decrees and published letters in favour of its development. It receives contributions from all parts of the Christian world.|$|R
