40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{believed that the}} fracture toughness of a brittle material can be characterized by a single parameter such as the stress intensity factor. In this study, it was demonstrated that when the crack is highly constrained, the first nonsingular opening stress term at the crack tip, {{in addition to the}} K-field (the singular stress term), is necessary to predict fracture. Fracture experiments were conducted using plexiglass specimens with a center crack. Relatively rigid metallic <b>end</b> <b>tabs</b> were used to generate boundary constraints on the specimen. The level of constraint was varied by varying the gage length between the <b>end</b> <b>tabs.</b> For a given crack length, the fracture load increases as the gage length decreases. If the stress intensity factor is used to determine the corresponding fracture toughness of plexiglass, the experimental data would indicate that the fracture toughness decreases as the gage length decreases. This is equivalent to saying that the fracture toughness of a brittle material can be affected by boundary conditions. It was shown that this behavior {{is the result of a}} diminishing size of the K-dominance zone and that the stress intensity factor alone cannot fully capture the fracture force. A new constant parameter was introduced to account for the effect of the near-tip nonsingular stress field on fracture. 1...|$|R

40|$|A new {{specimen}} {{design for}} determining the compression strength of thick unidirectional laminate composites has been developed using finite element simulations and validated by experimental testing. The computational models included parts of the testing fixture. The materials used for experiments were carbon fibre/epoxy T 300 / 914 from Hexcel Composites and IM 7 / 8552. An understanding has been developed to explain why, using the standard, parallel sided design, for testing specimens in compression and using the ICSTM fixture, specimens using a laminate thicker than 2 mm do not fail in an acceptable way. Initially, simulation and experimental parametric {{studies were carried out}} to investigate the effects of loading and design conditions on the fixture and specimen in order to change the stress distribution in the 2 mm thick, parallel sided, 10 mm x 10 mm gauge section specimen. In addition, in order to optimise the specimen itself, different adhesives for bonding <b>end</b> <b>tabs</b> to the laminate were investigated, as were the <b>end</b> <b>tab</b> design and material used in their manufacture. Subsequent simulations showed that the use of an extended and waisted gauge length of either circular or s-shaped profile both caused thick laminate specimens to fail close to the centre of the gauge length. The predicted strength being similar to that measured for a 2 mm thick, parallel sided specimen using the optimised design. Experimental compression strength data from thick laminate specimens with the circular and s-shaped profiles machined into the gauge section validated the finite element results; the strengths achieved being almost identical to those for the 2 mm thick laminates. Results from the analysis of the standard design and some preliminary work on the waisted design were presented at a conference [52]. Results for further work on the waisted design and experimental details have been reported in [51] and [75]. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{theoretical and}} experimental investigation {{was conducted to}} assess the suitability of the 10 deg off-axis tensile test specimen for the intralaminar shear characterization of unidirectional composites.

Strain gages were used to measure the strain variation across the specimen width at specimen midlength and near the <b>end</b> <b>tabs.</b> Specimens from Mod-I/epoxy, T- 300 /epoxy, and S-glass/epoxy were used in the experimental program. It was found that the 10 deg off-axis tensile test specimen is suitable for intralaminar shear characterization and it is recommended that it should be considered as a possible standard test specimen for such a characterization...|$|R

40|$|The work {{compares the}} {{abrasive}} wear resistance {{of cast iron}} containing vermicular graphite, measured in the as-cast state and after austempering carried out at 290 °C, 340 °C, or 390 °C.

Specimens used for examinations were taken from the <b>end</b> <b>tabs</b> of the tensile specimens, these being cut out of the test walls of the double-leg keel block test castings. Examinations proved that the austempering process increases the abrasive wear resistance of vermicular cast iron by several times as compared with the as-cast material. A tendency for a slight decrease in abrasive wear with an increase in austempering temperature can be stated. The coefficient of friction took a little higher values for cast iron after thermal treatment than for the as-cast material.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an initial investigation into effects of <b>end</b> <b>tabs</b> and gripping force on specimens for fatigue testing of structural composites. Live measurement of specimen compliance comparing extensometer measurements with grip displacement showed the impact of gripping on the dynamic behavior of the specimen. Use of thermal imaging enabled assessment of how load is introduced and carried along the specimen. The effect of grip pressure and comparative merits of popular solutions are examined {{in the context of}} fatigue testing of composites. Although for static tests these potential issues have been investigated extensively throughout the history of composites research, interest has only recently fallen upon their effects on dynamic loading. Data collected show that the gripping pressure at the ends of the specimen can affect results more significantly than may be anticipated. These early results suggest that solutions which are well established for quasi-static testing may cause problems in cyclic tests...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor {{performing}} uni-axial {{fatigue tests}} on composite materials, ASTM D 3479 /D 3479 M Standard Test Method for Tension–Tension Fatigue of Polymer Matrix Composite Materials is often considered. This standard prescribes a rectangular shaped specimen with <b>end</b> <b>tabs.</b> However, in part I {{of this study}} {{it became clear that}} for some materials, such as the carbon PPS under study, the proposed geometry is not ideal for fatigue tests. In this manuscript, a dumbbell (dogbone) shape is assessed to see whether it performs better under fatigue loading conditions, primarily meaning that failure does not occur in the tabbed section. The shape is first optimised using finite element modelling, after which fatigue experiments are performed. It may be concluded, for the material under study, that the dumbbell shape is preferable to rectangular since failure never occurred under or near the tabbed section, and fatigue life is highly underestimated when using the rectangular specimen...|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} is a lightweight, universal connector that joins stringers {{at various}} angles. The connectors 10 are fabricated from fiber-epoxy resin strips that wrap around stringers 30 and have <b>ends,</b> <b>tabs</b> 16 and 18, which extend in one general direction. The inside {{surface of the}} first tab 16 lies on a plane defined by the stringers being joined, and the second tab 18 is separated from the first tab 16 by a distance equal to their thickness. Stringers 30 of different shapes and sizes are joined by alternately bonding the first tab 16 of one connector between the first 16 and second 18 tabs of another connector. Tee-joints are formed by using web elements 41 and 42 which each partially wrap around a stringer 3010 and have tabs 411 and 421 which are offset, and are bonded between tabs 16 and 18 of universal connectors 109 and 1010 bonded to another stringer 309. Sharp corners are trimmed from the tabs so that a gusset area remains between the stringers for support. Acute angle through obtuse angle joints are formed by trimming those edges of the tabs which lie against the stringers. A specific application of the invention is a Walker 60, utilized by handicapped individuals, fabricated from composite materials that is 40 % lighter than similar metallic structures...|$|R
