The growth inhibition of C. pelliculosa depended on SAEC concentrations, and L-lysine and L-a-aminoadipate r stored growth. L-Arginine and L-ornithine also recovered the inhibition, though less effectively. SAEC-Resistant mutants were induced from the wild-type strain of C. pelliculosa by ultraviolet irradiation and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine treatment. Almost all the resistant mutants excreted L-lysine into the medium. Lysine excretion increased by repeated mutations. The mutant strain SR-V- 1263 extracellularly produced about 2 mg/m 1 of L-lysine when cultured for 96 hr with shaking. The effect of various factors on lysine production was investigated with the mutant strain. The pH optimum for the production was at 7. 0 - 8. 0, and the optimum temper-ature was 33 °C. Glucose was the preferable carbon source, and ammonium sulfate and urea served as good nitrogen sources. The lysine accumulation was markedly stimulated by addition of <b>potassium</b> phosphate, <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>organic</b> nitrogen sources.

The later was differentiated from the former by no acid production from maltose, ribose, mannitol, arabinose, inositol, trehlose, negative arginine hydrolysis test, no growth either in 4 % w/v NaCl or at 40 °C and pH 9. 2. Commercially available and locally isolated strains of Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were propagated in combination of 95 : 5 to prepare the mother cultures. These mother cultures were employed in standardized buffalo and cow’s milks to manufacture Cheddar cheese and ripened at 4 °C and 12 °C for 120 days. During ripening, cheese was evaluated for physico-chemical composition and sensory quality. Buffalo milk cheese contained significantly higher fat, protein, ash, lactose, sodium, calcium, <b>potassium</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> contents; particularly lactic, citric and butyric acid contents as compared to cow. Cheddar cheese prepared from indigenous cultures had significantly lower lactose and pH and higher acidity than commercial cultures. The concentrations of all the <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> produced by indigenous cultures were distinctly higher than commercial cultures. During ripening, lactose and pH decreased while acidity increased significantly. The concentrations of all the <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> increased highly significantly during ripening and elevated temperature considerably accelerated the production of all <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> except pyruvic acid.

40|$|Background: Malate {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in many fruits and its concentration plays a critical role in organoleptic properties. Several studies suggest that malate accumulation in fruit cells is controlled at the level of vacuolar storage. However, the regulation of vacuolar malate storage throughout fruit development, and the origins of the phenotypic variability of the malate concentration within fruit species remain to be clarified. In the present study, we adapted the mechanistic model of vacuolar storage proposed by Lobit et al. in order to study the accumulation of malate in pre and postharvest fruits. The main adaptation concerned the variation of the free energy of ATP hydrolysis during fruit development. Banana fruit was taken as a reference because it has the particularity of having separate growth and post-harvest ripening stages, during which malate concentration undergoes substantial changes. Moreover, the concentration of malate in banana pulp varies greatly among cultivars which make possible to use the model as a tool to analyze the genotypic variability. The model was calibrated and validated using data sets from three cultivars with contrasting malate accumulation, grown under different fruit loads and potassium supplies, and harvested at different stages. Results: The model predicted the pre and post-harvest dynamics of malate concentration with fairly good accuracy for the three cultivars (mean RRMSE = 0. 25 - 0. 42). The sensitivity of the model to parameters and input variables was analyzed. According to the model, vacuolar composition, in particular <b>potassium</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations, had an important effect on malate accumulation. The model suggested that rising temperatures depressed malate accumulation. The model also helped distinguish differences in malate concentration among the three cultivars and between the pre and post-harvest stages by highlighting the probable importance of proton pump activity and particularly of the free energy of ATP hydrolysis and vacuolar pH. Conclusions: This model appears to be an interesting tool to study malate accumulation in pre and postharvest fruits and to get insights into the ecophysiological determinants of fruit acidity, and thus may be useful for fruit quality improvement.

Puff number showed ca. 23 % increase with malate, 13 % with citrate and almost unchanged for tartrate. Evidence of melting and coating by potassium malate was discovered in cigarette ash by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This contributed to a noticeable change in ash morphology: small ash particles appeared to be coated and more tightly bonded together by the melt.

During the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials with dilute acid, however, various kinds of inhibitors, especially large amounts of <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> will be produced, which substantially decrease the fermentability of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. To overcome the inhibitory effects of <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> it is critical to understand their impact on the growth and lipid accumulation of oleaginous microorganisms. Results In our present work, we investigated {{for the first time the}} effect of ten representative <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in lignocellulosic hydrolysates on the growth and lipid accumulation of oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans cells. In contrast to previous reports, we found that the toxicity of the <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> to the cells was not directly related to their hydrophobicity. It is worth noting that most <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> tested were less toxic than aldehydes to the cells, and some could even stimulate the growth and lipid accumulation at a low concentration. Unlike aldehydes, most binary combinations of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> exerted no synergistic inhibitory effects on lipid production. The presence of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> decelerated the consumption of glucose, whereas it influenced the utilization of xylose in a different and complicated way. In addition, all the <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> tested, except furoic acid, inhibited the malic activity of T. fermentans. Furthermore, the inhibition of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> on cell growth was dependent more on inoculum size, temperature and initial pH than on lipid content.

Formic and acetic acids {{were the most}} abundant comprising approximately 75 % of the total molar quantity of <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> The annual volume-weighted concentrations of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in order of decreasing abundance in rainwater was formic (9. 9 μM), acetic (7. 3 μM), oxalic (1. 8 μM), lactic (1. 3 μM), succinic (1. 0 μM), malonic (0. 7 μM), pyruvic (0. 3 μM), and maleic (0. 1 μM), with methanesulfonic and glyoxylic acids usually below their detection limit. Growing season back-trajectory data provided strong evidence that terrestrial <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> sources dominated over marine sources. Air mass back-trajectory analysis indicated that {{during the growing season}} air mass origin had a consistent impact on concentrations of rainwater <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> Rain with continental back-trajectories coming from the west had the highest concentrations of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> while two predominately marine back-trajectories had the lowest concentrations. Concentrations of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in non-growing season rain did not display a consistent pattern indicating variability in sources. Seasonality of individual <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> for specific back-trajectories was most pronounced in terrestrial back-trajectories and least in the marine back-trajectories indicating that seasonality in rainwater <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations is driven by variations in terrestrial sources. Formic to acetic acid ratios (F:A), previously an indicator of terrestrial versus marine sources of these <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> were similar for all back-trajectories reflecting anthropogenic impacts on F:A locally and regionally. The ratios of malonic to succinic acids (M:S), also an indicator of sources for these acids, indicated direct anthropogenic sources for terrestrial back-trajectories and secondary processes for marine back-trajectories. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{total of}} 120 {{finishing}} pigs ([Yorkshire×Landrace]×Duroc) {{with an average}} body weight (BW) of 49. 72 ± 1. 72 kg were used in 12 -wk trial to evaluate the effects of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal micro flora, meat quality and fecal gas emission. Pigs were randomly allotted {{to one of three}} dietary treatments (10 replication pens with 4 pigs per pen) in a randomly complete block design based on their initial BW. Each dietary treatment consisted of: Control (CON/basal diet), OA 1 (basal diet+ 0. 1 % <b>organic</b> <b>acids)</b> and OA 2 (basal diet+ 0. 2 % <b>organic</b> <b>acids).</b> Dietary treatment with protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends linearly improved (p< 0. 001) average daily gain during 0 to 6 week, 6 to 12 week as well as overall with the increase in their inclusion level in the diet. The dry matter, N, and energy digestibility was higher (linear effect, p< 0. 001) with the increase in the dose of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends during 12 week. During week 6, a decrease (linear effect, p = 0. 01) in fecal ammonia contents was observed with the increase in the level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends on d 3 and d 5 of fermentation. Moreover, acetic acid emission decreased linearly (p = 0. 02) on d 7 of fermentation with the increase in the level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends. During 12 weeks, linear decrease (p< 0. 001) in fecal ammonia on d 3 and d 5 and acetic acid content on d 5 of fermentation was observed with the increase in the level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends. Supplementation of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends linearly increased the longissimus muscle area with the increasing concentration of <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> Moreover, color of meat increased (linear effect, quadratic effect, p< 0. 001, p< 0. 002 respectively) and firmness of meat showed quadratic effect (p = 0. 003) with the inclusion of increasing level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> in the diet. During the 6 week, increment in the level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends decreased (linear effect, p = 0. 01) Escherichia coli (E. coli) counts and increased (linear effect, p = 0. 004) Lactobacillus counts. During 12 -wk of experimental trial, feces from pigs fed diet supplemented with <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends showed linear reduction (p< 0. 001) of E. coli counts and the tendency of linear increase (p = 0. 06) in Lactobacillus count with the increase in the level of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends. In conclusion, 0. 2 % protected <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> blends positively affected growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal gas emission and meat quality in finishing pigs without any adverse effects on blood parameters...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Potassium is an {{essential}} element for plant growth and exists as four forms in soils: soluble, exchangeable, non-exchangeable, and mineral. Soluble and exchangeable K are considered as readily available and non-exchangeable K as slowly available. <b>Organic</b> matters and <b>acids</b> {{play an important role}} in increasing the bioavailability of nutrients especially potassium in the soils. <b>Organic</b> <b>acids</b> are low-molecular weight CHO containing compounds which are found in all organisms and which are characterized by the possession of one or more carboxyl groups. Depending on the dissociation properties and number of these carboxylic groups, <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> can carry varying negative charge, thereby allowing the complexation of metal cations in solution and the displacement of anions from the soil matrix. The ability of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to release K from soils depends on some factors such as: diffusion rate of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> in soil, the diffusion capability of organic acid-element complexes, the contact time of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> on a mineral surface, the ionization of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid,</b> the functional group of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> and its position, and the chemical affinity between the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> and the mineral elements. This study was conducted in order to evaluate the effect of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> and vermicompost on transformation of K in some selected soils of Fars Province, southern Iran. Materials and Methods: In this study, nine soils with enough diversity were selected from different parts of Fars Province. The experiment was done as a completely randomized design with three replications, consisting of three incubation times (5, 15 and 60 days) and four organic compounds (including 2...|$|R

40|$|Weak <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> are {{frequently}} {{used as an}} inexpensive and effective intervention to reduce number and prevalence of bacterial pathogens on food products. Of all <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> evaluated in the literature, acetic and lactic acid {{are found to be}} the most acceptable. Mechanism of Inactivation The mechanism of inactivation by weak <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> lays down in the ability of undissociated form of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to penetrate through the cell membrane, and to dissociate inside the cell, resulting in decreased intracellular pH value, which is essential for the control of ATP synthesis, RNA and protein synthesis, DNA replication and cell growth (Booth, 1985). Beside the decrease in intracellular pH, the perturbation of the membrane functions by <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> molecule might be also responsible for the microbial inactivation. The high concentration of anions (due to dissociation) inside the cells might result in an increased osmolarity and consequently to the metabolic perturbation (Hirshfield et al., 2003). As for other non-thermal inactivation treatments, the microbial sub-lethal injury might occur when the decontamination with <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is applied (Lee et al., 2002; Liao et al., 2003). Alexandrou et al. (1995) reported that weak <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> such as acetic and lactic acid showed greater ability to inflict the subpopulation of sub-lethal injured cells than stronger hydrochloric acid Factors affecting The efficiency of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions also increased with the decrease of pH in the solution (Van Netten et al., 1994).

30|$|Application of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> as {{preservative}} {{agents and}} disinfectants {{is a common}} practice in drug, cosmetic and food industries (Rico et al. 2007). Moreover, particular interest for different <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is continuously increasing worldwide creating thereby a necessity for production of huge quantities of these chemicals. From economical point of view, {{it is more important}} to produce concentrated as opposed to diluted acids because of the direct impact on the handling and transportation costs. However, handling and transportation of concentrated <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is extremely hazardous and special security means must be taken to avoid any poisoning risk and injuries. Moreover, the receiving industry must have special storage and adequate managing conditions for these chemicals. In this context, handling and managing of salts of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is suitable and easier because of the high level of safety and facility of storage and handling (Yoo et al. 2010; Luttrell 2012). Although the reactivity of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is higher than that of the conjugated salt, it is possible to convert a salt of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to the acid form so as to obtain the desired reactivity. In this context, electrochemical activation (or simply “electro-activation”) of salt of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> allows its conversion to the acid form under safe conditions.|$|R
