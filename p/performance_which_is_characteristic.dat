It {{can be done with}} our project called DPLASMA (Distributed PLASMA) that uses a novel generic distributed Direct Acyclic Graph Engine (DAGuE). The engine has been designed for high performance computing and thus it enables scaling of tile algorithms, originating in PLASMA, on large distributed memory systems. The underlying DAGuE framework has many appealing features when considering distributed-memory platforms with heterogeneous multicore nodes: DAG representation that is independent of the problem-size, automatic extraction of the communication from the dependencies, overlapping of communication and computation, task prioritization, and architecture-aware scheduling and management of tasks. The originality of this engine lies in its capacity to translate a sequential code with nested-loops into a concise and synthetic format which can then be interpreted and executed in a distributed environment. We present three common dense linear algebra algorithms from PLASMA (Parallel Linear Algebra for Scalable Multi-core Architectures), namely: Cholesky, LU, and QR factorizations, to investigate their data driven expression and execution in a distributed system. We demonstrate through experimental results on the Cray XT 5 Kraken system that our DAG-based approach has the potential to achieve sizable fraction of peak <b>performance</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the state-of-the-art distributed numerical software on current and emerging architectures.

40|$|Abstract — The {{combination}} of learning by intrinsic moti-vation and social learning {{has been shown}} to improve the learner’s performance and gain precision over a wider range of motor skills, with for instance the SGIM-D learning algorithm [1]. Nevertheless, this bootstrapping a-priori depends on the demonstrations made by the teacher. We propose in this paper to examine this dependence: to what extend the quality of the demonstrations can influence the learning <b>performance,</b> and <b>which</b> <b>are</b> the <b>characteristics</b> of a good demonstrator. Results on a fishing experiment highlights the importance of the difficulty of the demonstrated tasks, as well as the structure of the actions demonstrated. I...|$|R
40|$|Sport Psychology: The Basics {{provides}} an accessible {{introduction to the}} fundamental ideas {{at the heart of}} Sport Psychology today. It examines the links between sport participants’ behaviours, their personality and their environment to identify the factors <b>which</b> affect <b>performance.</b> Exploring theory and practice, it uses case studies to illustrate how key areas of theory are applied within a sport psychologist’s practice, answering such questions as: What is sport psychology and what do sport psychologists do? What factors affect sporting <b>performance?</b> <b>Which</b> psychological <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> associated with achievement in sport? How can performance be improved by using theory? With a glossary of key terms, suggestions for further study and ideas for improving performance, Sport Psychology: The Basics is an ideal introduction for students of sport and coaches who would like to know more about how sport psychologists address questions about human behaviour in sport.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the use of}} animal-assisted therapy with students identified with a learning disability and limited reading success. Initially, reading progress {{was defined as the}} participants 2 ̆ 7 comprehension rate obtained from an oral Informal Reading Inventory (IRI) passage. The nature of the Informal Reading Inventory requires the introduction of more difficult reading passages as the student 2 ̆ 7 s comprehension rate increases, potentially masking the overall effect of the intervention. Due to this factor and erratic student <b>performance,</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> a common <b>characteristic</b> of students with learning disabilities, obtaining consistent comprehension rates was difficult. Therefore, progress was defined only as total amount of time the student was engaged in reading under each condition. A reversal replication, single case design was implemented {{to determine the effects of}} reading to the therapy dog on the students 2 ̆ 7 reading progress as measured by total amount of time read. The analysis indicated a statistically significant increase in the total amount of reading time as determined by the participants in the presence of the therapy dog. Positive student feedback about their experience reading with the therapy dog supported the effect of the intervention on reading progress...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Perioperative {{prediction}} {{models can}} help to improve personalized patient care by providing individual risk predictions to both patients and providers. However, the scientific literature on prediction model development and validation can be quite technical and challenging to understand. This article aims to provide the necessary insight for clinicians to assess {{the value of a}} prediction model that they intend to use in their clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent developments in prediction model research include the continuous development of new performance characteristics for prediction models, increasing insight into the limitations of old characteristics, as well as an improved understanding of the generalizability of prediction models to new populations and practices. SUMMARY: Clinicians can assess the value of a prediction model for their practice by first identifying what the usage of the model will be. Second, they can recognize <b>which</b> <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> relevant to their assessment of the model. Finally, they need to decide whether the available scientific evidence sufficiently matches their clinical practice to proceed with implementation...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or {{substances}} used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the compatibility of microbial feed additive Bacillus subtilis PB 6 with the coccidiostats maduramycin ammonium, monensin sodium, narasin and robenidine hydrochloride. The in vivo compatibility of the coccidiostats with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 was assessed {{as part of a}} larger trial in <b>which</b> <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> measured. A negative control group was included, while the other groups received the recommended dose of Bacillus subtilis PB 6 in the presence or absence of the tested coccidiostats at their maximum authorised levels. Intestinal samples from six birds per treatment group were analysed for aerobic spore formers. Heat treatment of the samples was included to distinguish spores from vegetative cells. No significant differences in numbers of bacilli were observed between the coccidiostat-treated groups and the group treated with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 alone. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Bacillus subtilis PB 6 is compatible with maduramycin ammonium, monensin sodium, narasin and robenidine hydrochloride when added to diets for chickens for fattening...|$|R
40|$|Advances in imaging {{technology}} have {{to a large}} extent shaped scientific progress in the last 200 years. While progress in {{imaging technology}} originated in, and forced the development of, the field of optics, the design paradigm for optical instruments has always placed the human observer at the center of its efforts. With the advent of electronic computation {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century, optical design could be elevated to a new level by exploiting computer-aided design and automated optimization procedures. However, only in recent years have computers become so powerful, and at the same time so small and inexpensive, that imaging technology, storage and transmission have become completely digitized. This move has not yet reached its full potential since the human observer is still considered the target of optimization, whereas in fact, today's primary observers are computers. It is this insight that enables an entirely new approach to optics and measurement instrumentation. Images no longer have to mimic what the human brain is accustomed to interpret as an image of the world, i. e. integrals over ray bundles of a restricted subset of the electro-magnetic spectrum. Instead, sensing mechanisms can be designed that re-distribute directional, spatial, temporal and wavelength information to essentially agnostic sensor elements serving as simple photon collectors. The questions of how such redistribution can <b>be</b> arranged for, <b>which</b> <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> to be expected of such devices, and how these novel sensing means can be used for measurement purposes form the basis and contents of this thesis. In particular examples, investigations into these larger questions are explored in detail. Through these studies we arrive at a larger picture of the current state of affairs: We have glimpsed at the exciting possibilities of computational optical imaging, however, we have seen a mountain of formidable size and difficulty, the ascend of which will require significant effort. This is how the subtitle of this thesis is to be understood...|$|R
