40|$|Wood {{products}} all require {{treatment to}} mitigate phytosanitary risk prior to exportation. The most common <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>treatment</b> applied to Pinus radiata logs is Methyl Bromide (MeBr). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2010 stated that MeBr {{must not be}} release into the atmosphere past 2020. This poses a problem for New Zealand log exports. Radiation {{has been identified as}} a possible alternative <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>treatment</b> for export wood products. This study aimed to quantify the effective dose of radiation necessary to sterilise two forest pest species; Arhopalus ferus and Hylurgus ligniperda. These species are representative of two different types of forestry pests; bark beetles (H. ligniperda) and wood borers (A. ferus). All applicable life stages for both species were tested. Arhopalus ferus adults were the most susceptible life stage identified with an LD 99 of 30. 2 Gy ± 13. 5 Gy (95 % confidence interval). Arhopalus ferus eggs were less susceptible with a LD 99 of 750 Gy ± 776 Gy observed; however there is low confidence in this result due to a methodological issue in one treatment replicate. Hylurgus ligniperda eggs were observed to be less susceptible than A. ferus eggs with a LD 99 of 289 Gy ± 92 Gy. Results for the other life stages were inconclusive due to poor control survival, however the information gained was used to develop improved methods for further experimentation, which is on-going and showing positive results so far. The results of this experiment have indicated that radiation can be an effective method of sterilising forestry pests. To date radiation has not been used as phytosanitary risk mitigation for wood exports; however it is widely used for risk mitigation in agricultural products. Currently there remains a large amount of unknown information regarding, the effectiveness for irradiation of logs, the effective dose require for sterilisation of the most tolerant forestry pest and public acceptability of irradiation as a <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>treatment.</b> These knowledge gaps and an economic assessment must be completed before irradiation {{can be used as a}} phytosanitary risk mitigation technique for forestry products...|$|E

All adult H. ligniperda were sterile following irradiation at 175  Gy. Lower doses cannot be considered as acceptable on the basis of our trials as single non-sterile individuals were observed at 100, 125, and 150  Gy even though all adult H. ligniperda tested at 75  Gy were sterile. H. ligniperda adults were more tolerant to irradiation than A. ferus adults that had a LD 99 of 44.1  Gy (±[*] 15.3, 95 % CI). However, the effective limit to sterilise H. ligniperda and A. ferus is likely to be far less than the current generic acceptable dose of 400  Gy for horticultural commodities. A dose of 400  Gy, and a series of doses as low as 75  Gy, should be used in an economic assessment to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of irradiation as an alternative <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>treatment</b> for bulk export wood commodities.

Development of a new <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>treatment</b> to augment the existing toolbox requires confirmation of treatment efficacy for relevant life stages of quarantine pests, identified by a formal pest risk assessment process. To circumvent the laborious and expensive process of testing each target species to accumulate complete mortality data, initial screening tests are done to identify the species and life stage that is most tolerant to the treatment, followed by more detailed studies of those that are most tolerant. To begin our study of relative tolerance to irradiation, we chose two species, Hylurgus ligniperda (F.) and Arhopalus ferus (Mulsant), that are potentially found on or beneath the bark of P. radiata logs after harvest in New Zealand (Pawson et al. 2014).

40|$|An {{assessment}} test of <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>treatments</b> on 7 wheat species {{was carried out}} in Auvergne (France) through a global method - the thesigraphy. This analysis consists of making and decoding images of dendritic crystallization called biothesigrams.

It is interpreted on the basis of three image parameters: texture, central figures and signs that inform about the level of de-naturation and pollution of the substance under study. Those three parameters were evaluated according to eight leaf samples {{at the end of the}} vegetative cycle in wheat cultures. The count of thesigraphical spots is considered as an indicator of the intracellular occurrence of xenobiotic products. The morphology of the texture and central figures allows for the calculation of a semi-global thesigraphical index, indicating the plant vitality. The exponential increase of the spots within the 29 days after spreading pesticides expresses the gradual accumulation in the wheat leaves.

Diseases affecting vine health or grape quality cause significant economic losses for wineries, specially in the case of old and unique vineyards. In a precision viticulture context, the use of rational <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>treatments</b> and the application of adequate agronomical practices {{is the only way to}} maintain the biodiversity required by the fields to keep their stability and resilience. In this context, we have developed WineSeqⓇ ([URL] as the first online portal created to support the management of vine health and yield and to prevent or to diagnose vine diseases. The portal ([URL] shows filtered and interpreted results of the global microbial population analyzed by metagenomics (DNA Next Generation Sequencing) from soil, wood, grapes or fermentation samples. WineSeqⓇ technology is based on machine learning and cloud computing to integrate microbiome information with climatic, edaphic and agronomical information of interest. Thus, we make easier and understandable the analysis of the microbial variable for vinegrowers and winemakers...|$|R
40|$|In Sardinia (Italy) {{gypsy moth}} {{population}} density has been regularly evaluated through a monitoring network {{over thirty years}} based on egg masses counting at permanent sites. This activity allows to identify annually areas with the highest infestation density in order to define sites {{to be subjected to}} <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>treatments.</b> To give an indication on the potential use of different microbiological products two years of efficacy trials with different Bacillus thuringiensis serovar kurstaki formulations were carried out in period 2012 - 2013. Tested formulations proved to be as effective as the reference products Foray 48 B and Delfin in controlling L. dispar populations. Historical series data on gypsy moth over-year-density were analyzed following two different study approaches. The first was based on a generalized linear model adopted to evaluate the statistical significance of the relationship between percentage of occupied sites and presence of damage. The results confirmed the validity of this method for an easier identification of forest areas exposed to damage in progradiation phase. In the second case, the use of incidence function model and other statistical approaches were investigated. Although the complexity in modelling L. dispar dynamics, results were promising for their use in defining the specific metapopulation dynamics pattern at forest district level. ...|$|R
40|$|Mostly {{determinants}} of environmental innovations are studied from a general point of view. Yet evolutionist literature {{shows that the}} sector is an important variable, particularly studying determinants. This paper works on the {{determinants of}} the diffusion of environmental innovation in grape growing as {{there are not many}} farms producing grapes with environment-friendly practices. Our main hypothesis is that the features of this agricultural activity (permanent crop, non-point source pollution and agricultural policy) make that theoretical determinants have to be studied in this particular case in order to better understand the diffusion of environmental innovations in grape growing. Then grape growing is often pointed out as using a lot of pesticides compared with other crops. Crop protection is however a critical topic {{for the protection of the}} environment. A survey of an innovative way to reduce <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>treatments</b> and also pesticides use in Bordeaux area shows that some determinants have to be discussed. Even if the source of cost savings is real and rather known, it is not enough to adopt this innovation. There are too much organizational pressure and competence needs in adopting such environmental processes and consequently environmental policy does not seem to be strong enough to be a determinant at the moment. Keys words: environmental innovation, determinants, diffusion, pesticides reduction, grape growing JEL: Q – O 3...|$|R
