40|$|The Three Gorges <b>Power</b> <b>Market</b> (TGPM) will be {{the first}} cross-region <b>power</b> <b>market</b> in China.

There are basically three alternatives, i. e., the state-province (or city) two-layer structure, the state-region two-layer structure and the state-region-province (or city) three-layer structure. It is suggested that the state-region-province (or city) three-layer structure be adopted at the initial stage of the restructuring.

The {{growth in}} power trading {{is due to}} the ongoing deregulation policy of the electric power industry. Most of deregulation scenarios indicate a further separation of power production from transmission and retailing. The power production is opened to more competition. Unfortunately, the power trading mechanism is not clearly investigated in the level that we can predict a price change in the US wholesale <b>power</b> <b>market.</b> Such a price change in the US wholesale <b>power</b> <b>market</b> is explored from a simulation system with learning capabilities.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that power system {{operations}} are often constrained by transmission congestions which reflect the physical restrictions intrinsic to the power system itself. The <b>power</b> <b>market</b> running on top of the system is also constrained by factors such as primary energy, emissions, technical support, as well as multi-player gaming among market participants including regulators. In this paper, we propose a new concept of generalized congestions to describe those factors affecting both the competition level and the efficiency of <b>power</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Market</b> <b>power</b> is a <b>market</b> participant's capability in influencing market efficiency with the aid of generalized congestions; generalized <b>market</b> <b>power</b> reflects its capability to influence the social welfare.
