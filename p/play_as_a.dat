5|$|Following the season, Evra was {{recruited}} by Nice's Derby de la Côte d'Azur rivals Monaco. Despite wanting to <b>play</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> left winger again, Evra was advised by manager Didier Deschamps {{he would only}} <b>play</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> left back. Evra has since credited Deschamps for allowing {{him to become a}} better defender after initially describing the role as being not fun. Evra was inserted into a back four that consisted of centre-backs Rafael Márquez and Sébastien Squillaci and right-back Franck Jurietti. Evra was assigned the number 3 shirt and made his debut for the club in the opening match of the 2002–03 season against Troyes. He played the entire match in a 4–0 win. On 28 September, Evra scored his first goal for the club, scoring the match-winner in a 2–1 victory against Rennes. On 22 March 2003, he scored his second goal of the season in a 3–0 away win over Le Havre. The victory allowed Monaco to maintain its position {{at the top of the}} table, as the club was in a three-way battle with Lyon and Marseille. Monaco climatically conceded first place to Lyon in May, which resulted in Lyon being declared champions for the second time in its history. Monaco finished the campaign in second place, which merited the club an appearance in the UEFA Champions League. The club was also rewarded domestically for its performance in the Coupe de la Ligue where it reached the final. Evra featured in the team's 4–1 win over Sochaux in the match. The league cup title gave Evra the first major honour of his career.|$|E
