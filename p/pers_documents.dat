40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed to}} compare the impact of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, {{spending}} on Research and Development (R&D), number of universities, and Indexed Scientific Journals on total number of research <b>documents</b> (papers), citations <b>per</b> <b>document</b> and Hirsch index (H-index) in various science and social science subjects among Asian countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 40 Asian countries were included. The information regarding Asian countries, their GDP per capita, spending on R&D, total number of universities and indexed scientific journals were collected. We recorded the bibliometric indicators, including total number of research <b>documents,</b> citations <b>per</b> <b>document</b> and H-index in various science and social sciences subjects during the period 1996 - 2011. The main sources for information were World Bank, SCI-mago/Scopus and Web of Science; Thomson Reuters. RESULTS: The mean per capita GDP for all the Asian countries is 14448. 31 ± 2854. 40 US$, yearly per capita spending on R&D 0. 64 ± 0. 16 US$, number of universities 72. 37 ± 18. 32 and mean number of ISI indexed journal per country is 17. 97 ± 7. 35. The mean of research documents published in various science and social science subjects among all the Asian countries during the period 1996 - 2011 is 158086. 92 ± 69204. 09; citations <b>per</b> <b>document</b> 8. 67 ± 0. 48; and H-index 122. 8 ± 19. 21. Spending on R&D, number of universities and indexed journals have a positive correlation with number of published <b>documents,</b> citations <b>per</b> <b>document</b> and H-index in various science and social science subjects. However, there was no association between the per capita GDP and research outcomes. CONCLUSION: The Asian countries who spend more on R&D have {{a large number of}} universities and scientific indexed journals produced more in research outcomes including total number of research publication, citations <b>per</b> <b>documents</b> and H-index in various science and social science subjects...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the medical specialities that had a positive relative contribution to scientific productivity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) over the last two decades and to determine the influence of their contribution on KSA worldwide ranking in these specialities. Methods: SCImago Journal and Country Rank was used to determine KSA's ranking in 46 medical specialities during 1996 - 2014 based on four productivity indices. Relative Specialisation Index (RSI) was calculated for each speciality. Specialities with RSI > 0 were defined as the positive relative contribution specialities in KSA. They were compared with the remaining specialities using a number of parameters that were examined statistically. Results: The median KSA ranking in 46 specialities was 42 for total documents, 43 for total cites, 79 for citations <b>per</b> <b>document</b> and 44 for h-index. Fourteen (30 %) specialities were designated as the positive relative contribution specialities in KSA. These were ophthalmology, medicine (miscellaneous), paediatrics, complementary medicine, clinical genetics, clinical biochemistry, transplantation, surgery, infectious disease, nephrology, pulmonology, epidemiology, otolaryngology and anaesthesiology. Being a positive relative contribution speciality in KSA was not influenced by the nature of speciality or by having its own Saudi journal; however, it was associated with a significantly higher KSA ranking based on total documents, total cites and h-index but not based on citations <b>per</b> <b>document.</b> Conclusions: Medical speciality contribution to research productivity in KSA was not influenced by the speciality having a Saudi journal. Positive relative contribution specialities had a significant impact on KSA ranking in three out of the four indices. KSA's medical specialities were ranked relatively low based on citations <b>per</b> <b>document.</b> KSA researchers of all medical disciplines should be encouraged to publish quality research in local and international journals...|$|R
40|$|Publication productivity, as {{measured}} by the number of papers, has been {{regarded as one of the}} main indicators of reputation of countries and institutions. Nevertheless, the relationship among research publications, economic growth and World Wide Web in ASEAN countries is still unclear. The main intention of this study was to identify publication productivity among ASEAN and the world’s top ten countries in the last 16 years (1996 - 2011). This study also aimed at finding the relationship among publication, gross domestic product (GDP) and internet usage. Furthermore, the publication trend in the 10 first Malaysian universities was evaluated for the same periods. Scopus database was used to find the overall documents, overall citations, citations <b>per</b> <b>document</b> and international collaboration from 1996 to 2011 for each country. The World Bank database (World Data Bank) was used to collect the data for GDP and the number of internet users. Moreover, to evaluate 10 top Malaysian universities, the number of published articles, conferences, reviews, and letters for the same periods was collected. The results of this study showed significant differences among ASEAN and top 10 countries regarding publication productivity. Moreover, a positive and significant relationship was observed between indices, GDP and internet usage for these countries. Surprisingly, international collaboration had a significant and negative relationship with economic growth. Malaysia had fewer citations <b>per</b> <b>document</b> (7. 64) and international collaboration (36. 9 %) among ASEAN countries. In conclusion, international collaboration between academic institutes and researchers is influenced by economic growth and access to internet in the countries. Furthermore, publication trends in ASEAN countries are promising. However, policy makers and science managers should try to find different ways to increase the quality of the research publication and to raise citation <b>per</b> <b>document...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} acquiring relevance judgements for in-formation retrieval (IR) test collections through crowdsourcing when no true relevance labels are available. We collect multiple, possibly noisy relevance la-bels <b>per</b> <b>document</b> from workers of unknown labelling accuracy. We use these labels to infer the document relevance based on two methods. The first method is the commonly used majority voting (MV) which determines the document relevance based on the label that received the most votes, treating all the work-ers equally. The second is a probabilistic model that concurrently estimates the document relevance and the workers accuracy using expectation maximization (EM). We run simulations and conduct experiments with crowdsourced rele-vance labels from the INEX 2010 Book Search track to investigate the accuracy and robustness of the relevance assessments to the noisy labels. We observe {{the effect of the}} derived relevance judgments on the ranking of the search systems. Our experimental results show that the EM method outperforms the MV method in the accuracy of relevance assessments and IR systems ranking. The performance improvements are especially noticeable when the number of labels <b>per</b> <b>document</b> is small and the labels are of varied quality. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{readership}} counts {{provided by}} the social reference manager Mendeley {{as a source for}} usage statistics for scientific papers, based on a sample of 1. 2 million documents published in journals from the four disciplines Biomedical Research, Clinical Medicine, Health and Psychology. It is shown that the percentage of papers with at least one user on Mendeley (65. 9 %) as well as the average number of readers <b>per</b> <b>document</b> (9. 6) is quite high compared to the uptake and average activity on other social media platforms. The majority of users are PhD and postgraduate students as well as postdocs. Correlations with citations are overall positive, with reading patterns of PhD students and postdocs being in general more similar to citation patterns than that of other professionals and librarians, which reflects expected usage behavior. Important differences concerning these results can be observed between particular research fields, reflecting the particular usage patterns of certain user groups as well as the general uptake of Mendeley in these fields. Most importantly it is shown that differences between usage behavior of user types cannot be accurately determined, as Mendeley only provides only the top 3 user types <b>per</b> <b>document...</b>|$|R
