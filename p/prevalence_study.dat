40|$|Every year {{dozens of}} {{cross-sectional}} studies {{are carried out}} that estimate the prevalence of risk factors for chronic noncommunicable diseases. Given that, there is potentially {{a large amount of}} information that could be extremely useful for risk factor surveillance. However, there are good reasons to question the methodological rigor and the reliability of the results coming from many of these studies. The potential benefits of the data are curtailed by the studies' shortcomings, in part often because there is no clear and explicit methodological information providing the details needed to assess the procedures that were actually used, as well as a failure to apply a uniform methodology that would allow comparisons over time or across studies. This paper is intended to be both a didactic and practical tool. It describes the construction of an instrument for assessing the usefulness of <b>prevalence</b> <b>studies</b> done within the context of surveillance activities, using the example of hypertension. The paper discusses and illustrates the most common pitfalls found with <b>prevalence</b> <b>studies,</b> and it also offers methodological standards that can guide future <b>prevalence</b> <b>studies</b> as well as stimulate future research efforts in this area...|$|R

Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycINFO were searched in April 2013 for cross-sectional point or period <b>prevalence</b> <b>studies</b> explicitly stating the prevalence of VS/UWS due to acute causes within the general population. We additionally checked bibliographies and consulted {{experts in the field}} to obtain ‘grey data’ like government reports. Relevant publications underwent quality assessment and data-extraction.
