25|$|The cgs <b>physical</b> <b>unit</b> for dynamic viscosity, the poise (P), is {{also named}} after Jean Poiseuille. It is more {{commonly}} expressed, particularly in ASTM standards, as centipoise (cP) since {{the latter is}} equal to the SI multiple millipascal seconds (mPa·s).

2500|$|A {{physical}} quantity {{can be expressed}} {{as the product of}} a number and a <b>physical</b> <b>unit.</b> [...] A formula expresses a relationship between [...] physical quantities. A necessary condition for a formula to be valid is that all terms have the same dimension, meaning every term in the formula could be potentially converted to contain the identical unit (or product of identical units).|$|E
2500|$|Both the <b>physical</b> <b>unit</b> {{of dynamic}} {{viscosity}} in SI units, the poiseuille (Pl), and cgs units, the poise (P), are named after Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille. The poiseuille, which is rarely used, {{is equivalent to}} the pascal second (Pa·s), or (N·s)/m2, or kg/(m·s). If a fluid is placed between two plates with distance one meter, and one plate is pushed sideways with a shear stress of one pascal, and it moves at [...] meters per second, then it has viscosity of [...] pascal seconds. For example, water at 20°C has a viscosity of 1.002mPa·s, while a typical motor oil could have a viscosity of about 250mPa·s. The units used in practice are either Pa·s and its submultiples or the cgs poise referred to below, and its submultiples.|$|E
2500|$|Text and {{conversation}} {{is a theory}} {{in the field of}} organizational communication illustrating how communication makes up an organization. In the theory's simplest explanation, an organization is created and defined by communication. Communication [...] "is" [...] the organization and the organization exists because communication takes place. [...] The theory is built on the notion, an organization is not seen as a <b>physical</b> <b>unit</b> holding communication. [...] Text {{and conversation}} theory puts communication processes at the heart of organizational communication and postulates, an organization doesn’t contain communication as a [...] "causal influence," [...] but is formed by the communication within. This theory is not intended for direct application, but rather to explain how communication exists. The theory provides a framework for better understanding organizational communication.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{source of}} allophonic {{variation}} is borrowed words, especially proper names, when non-Esperantized {{remnants of the}} source-language orthography remain, or when novel sequences are created {{in order to avoid}} duplicating existing roots. For example, it is doubtful that many people fully pronounce the g in Vaŝingtono ('Washington') as either [...] or , or pronounce the [...] in Budho ('Buddha'). Such situations are unstable, and in many cases dictionaries recognize that certain spellings (and therefore pronunciations) are inadvisable. For example, the <b>physical</b> <b>unit</b> [...] "Watt" [...] was first borrowed as ŭato, to distinguish it from vato ('cotton-wool'), and this is the only form found in dictionaries in 1930. However, initial [...] violates Esperanto phonotactics, and by 1970 there was an alternate spelling, vatto. This was also unsatisfactory, however, because of the geminate , and by 2000 the effort had been given up, with [...] now the advised spelling for both [...] "Watt" [...] and [...] "cotton-wool". Some recent dictionaries, such as the , no longer even list initial [...] in their index. Likewise, several dictionaries now list a newer spelling [...] for Washington.|$|E
2500|$|Partly {{following}} a heuristic {{method of calculation}} pioneered by Boltzmann for gas molecules, Planck considered the possible ways of distributing electromagnetic energy over the different modes of his hypothetical charged material oscillators. This acceptance of the probabilistic approach, following Boltzmann, for Planck was a radical change from his former position, which till then had deliberately opposed such thinking proposed by Boltzmann. Heuristically, Boltzmann had distributed the energy in arbitrary merely mathematical quanta [...] , which he had proceeded to make tend to zero in magnitude, because the finite magnitude [...] had served only to allow definite counting {{for the sake of}} mathematical calculation of probabilities, and had no physical significance. Referring to a new universal constant of nature, , Planck supposed that, in the several oscillators of each of the finitely many characteristic frequencies, the total energy was distributed to each in an integer multiple of a definite <b>physical</b> <b>unit</b> of energy, , not arbitrary as in Boltzmann's method, but now for Planck, in a new departure, characteristic of the respective characteristic frequency. His new universal constant of nature, , is now known as Planck's constant.|$|E
