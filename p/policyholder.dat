40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} outcomes when each party of an insurance contract simultaneously has superior information. I assume that <b>policyholders</b> have superior information about specific risks while insurers have superior information about general risks. I find that low-general-risk <b>policyholders</b> purchase insurance, while high-general-risk <b>policyholders</b> are self-insured. Among the low-general-risk <b>policyholders,</b> high-specific-risk <b>policyholders</b> purchase full insurance, while low-specific-risk <b>policyholders</b> purchase partial insurance. When insurers can strategically publicize their information, efficiency is improved because high-general-risk <b>policyholders</b> purchase actuarially fair insurance. The market segmentation is also found based on the general-risk type and the publicizing of information. Copyright (c) The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2009. ...|$|R

25|$|Many of Equitable's with-profits {{policies}} {{were designed to}} provide a pension for the <b>policyholder</b> on retirement, and the lump sum available to buy an annuity depended on the sum assured, the reversionary bonuses and the larger terminal bonus. Both types of bonus were allocated at the discretion of the directors in accordance with Article 65 of the Articles of Association, the total being intended to reflect the investment return earned over the lifetime of the policy, subject to smoothing.|$|E
25|$|Disability {{insurance}} policies provide financial {{support in the}} event of the <b>policyholder</b> becoming unable to work because of disabling illness or injury. It provides monthly support to help pay such obligations as mortgage loans and credit cards. Short-term and long-term disability policies are available to individuals, but considering the expense, long-term policies are generally obtained only by those with at least six-figure incomes, such as doctors, lawyers, etc. Short-term disability insurance covers a person for a period typically up to six months, paying a stipend each month to cover medical bills and other necessities.|$|E
25|$|When insured parties {{experience}} {{a loss for}} a specified peril, the coverage entitles the <b>policyholder</b> to make a claim against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium. Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims – in theory for a relatively few claimants – and for overhead costs. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer's profit.|$|E

50|$|A mutual {{insurance}} company is an insurance company owned entirely by its <b>policyholders.</b> Any profits earned by a {{mutual insurance}} company are either retained within the company or rebated to <b>policyholders</b> {{in the form of}} dividend distributions or reduced future premiums. In contrast, a stock insurance company is owned by investors who have purchased company stock; any profits generated by a stock insurance company are distributed to the investors without necessarily benefiting the <b>policyholders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Future {{income for}} the insurer {{consists}} of premiums paid by <b>policyholders</b> whilst future outgoings comprise claims paid to <b>policyholders</b> as well as various expenses. The difference, combined with income on and release of statutory reserves, represents future profit.|$|R
25|$|Insurance {{may also}} be {{purchased}} through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the <b>policyholder</b> buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). Just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.|$|E
25|$|The act, as {{currently}} structured, does not cut present Medicare benefits. It reduces projected future increases in Medicare spending such as inpatient hospital service payments and ambulatory care payments {{that would otherwise}} undergo annual re-adjustments. These changes would save $196 billion from Medicare over 10 years and removing wasteful subsidies to insurers for Medicare Advantage plan would save a further $156 billion according to the CBO. Gail Wilensky, a deputy assistant to President Bush Snr advising him on health and welfare issues from 1992–1993 and previously a director of Medicare and Medicaid has expressed concern that this might affect seniors {{access to health care}} if the changes are made too quickly, while other activists such as Stuart Guterman of the Commonwealth Fund argue that Medicare Advantage plans cost the taxpayer $1,000 per <b>policyholder</b> more than if the person had been insured through traditional fee for services.|$|E
25|$|Liability {{insurance}} {{is a very}} broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured {{in the event of}} a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense {{in the event of a}} lawsuit commenced against the <b>policyholder</b> and indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.|$|E

40|$|We analyze, from {{theoretical}} and empirical standpoints, how insurance distribution channels may a§ect fraud when <b>policyholders</b> and service providers collude. The empirical analysis focuses on the Taiwan automobile insurance market. Striking forms of claims manipulation exist in this market: opportunistic <b>policyholders</b> tend to manipulate claim dates to reduce the burden of deductibles and {{to take advantage of}} the bonus-malusmechanism. We focus our attention on the role of dealer-owned agents (DOAs), since they have informational and bargaining advantages when faced with insurers and may be tempted to encourage collusion between their car repairers and <b>policyholders.</b> We develop an optimal contract model with claim auditing, where contracts are sold either through DOAs or through standard independent agents, and where <b>policyholders</b> and car repairers may collude to manipulate claims. We also use a database from the largest Taiwanese insurance company to test for the relevance of theoretical predictions. In particular, we verify that fraud occurs through the postponing of claims to the end of the policy year, possibly by Öling one single claim for several events, and we show that the fraud rate is larger among <b>policyholders</b> who purchase insurance through the DOA channel than among other <b>policyholders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary: Medigap {{supplemental}} {{coverage has}} long helped Medicare beneficiaries fill in gaps in their benefits. While policymakers focus on implementing the new Medicare drug benefit, recently released {{data from the}} 2002 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey serve {{as a reminder of}} the critical role played by Medigap coverage. Medigap is particularly important to low- and moderate-income beneficiaries, especially those living in rural areas. Here are some highlights from the survey: • Thirty-two percent of Medigap <b>policyholders</b> resided in a rural area in 2002; by comparison, only 24 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries resided in a rural area. • More than half (53 percent) of rural Medigap <b>policyholders</b> had incomes under $ 20, 000 in 2002, and 45 percent of all Medigap <b>policyholders</b> (living in rural or metropolitan areas) had incomes under $ 20, 000. Three-quarters of rural Medigap <b>policyholders</b> and over two-thirds of all Medigap <b>policyholders</b> had incomes below $ 30, 000. • Overall, 33 percent of Medigap <b>policyholders</b> had incomes ranging from $ 10, 000 to $ 20, 000, the highest proportion of all income ranges. In rural areas, 38 percent of Medigap <b>policyholders</b> were in this income bracket. • Medigap <b>policyholders</b> reported similar rates of particular chronic diseases [...] diabetes, arthritis, and chronic lung disease [...] as beneficiaries with Medicare Advantage plans, employer-based supplemental coverage, or Medicare alone. • Medicare beneficiaries with some form of private coverage [...] including Medigap, Medicare Advantage, or employer-based plans [...] reported better health status and received more preventive care than those with Medicare alone. In general, the statistics in this report are calculated from records on non-institutionalized (aged and disabled) Medicare beneficiaries.

2500|$|Social {{insurance}} can be {{many things}} to many people in many countries. But a summary of its essence {{is that it is}} a collection of insurance coverages (including components of life insurance, disability income insurance, unemployment insurance, health insurance, and others), plus retirement savings, that requires participation by all citizens. By forcing everyone in society to be a <b>policyholder</b> and pay premiums, it ensures that everyone can become a claimant when or if he/she needs to.

2500|$|Insurers {{have the}} right to cancel {{individually}} purchased insurance if the insurer finds that the applicant provided incomplete or inaccurate information on the application, thereby affecting the medical underwriting process. The practice, called rescission, protects insurers from intentional fraud and affects only about 1% of individual policyholders but appears to be on the increase. Rescission practices by several large insurers have attracted media attention, class-action lawsuits, and regulatory attention in several states. In 2007, California passed legislation to tighten the rules governing rescissions.
