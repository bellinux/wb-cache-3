5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome some reasons for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{unanimously}} {{decided that}} {{since there was}} no warrant, the search was illegal. Therefore, the papers found should have been excluded because of the Fourth Amendment.

25|$|In {{the case}} of Shahed Ali who was {{registered}} at two different addresses within the ward he was successfully elected in, both registrations were used {{to vote in the}} election for Lutfur Rahman. If both registrations were used by Ali, then he had committed an offence of voting more than once under section 61(2) of the 1983 Act. Where one of the registration was used by another person, that <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> guilty of personation.|$|E
25|$|While a firstborn to both parents, or a firstborn to {{only the}} mother, must fast {{according}} to all authorities, there is a dispute among the early halakhic authorities regarding {{the status of a}} firstborn to only the father. The Shulchan Aruch (OC 470:1) codifies that a firstborn to only the father is obligated to fast, while most printings of the Arba'ah Turim (ibid.) indicate that such a <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> exempt. Common practice follows the Shulchan Aruch.|$|E

25|$|Humans {{experience}} {{their own}} body weight {{as a result}} of this supporting force, which results in a normal force applied to a person by the surface of a supporting object, on which the person is standing or sitting. In the absence of this force, a <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in free-fall, and would experience weightlessness. It is the transmission of this reaction force through the human body, and the resultant compression and tension of the body's tissues, that results in the sensation of weight.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{may have}} {{encountered}} {{the idea of}} the Eternal Recurrence in the works of Heinrich Heine, who speculated that one day a <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> born with the same thought-processes as himself, and that the same applied to every other individual. Nietzsche expanded on this thought to form his theory, which he put forth in The Gay Science and developed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Schopenhauer directly influenced this theory. Schopenhauer postulated that a person who unconditionally affirms life would do so even if everything that has happened were to happen again repeatedly.|$|E
25|$|The Feasts of Merit {{reflected}} the splendor and celebration of Naga life. Only married men could give such Feasts, {{and his wife}} took a prominent and honoured place during the ritual which emphasised male-female co-operation and interdependence. His wife brewed the beer which he offered to the guests. The event displayed ceremonies and festivities organised by the sponsor. The Feast given by a wealthier tribes <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more extravagant. He would typically invite everyone from the tribe. This event bestowed honour to the couple from the tribe. After the Feast, the tribe would give the couple rights to ornaments equally.|$|E

Of course, the Race in which these <b>persons</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> absorbed is the dominant race, before which, in cringing self-surrender and ignoble self-suppression they lie in prostrate admiration.|$|R
25|$|There {{were also}} {{concerns}} that the earlier drafts of the bill phrased clause 8, which listed the unacceptable conduct which could {{be subject to a}} restraining order, in broad and subjective terms. One of the phrases in question was causing feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility in clause 8(1)(a) of the earlier draft of the bill. The view was taken that this was drafted in a subjective manner, suggesting that if any person felt offended this would be a sufficient ground upon which a restraining order might be issued. It was suggested that this clause should be phrased to suggest that the objective view of a reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the standard adopted.|$|E
25|$|Thomas L. Thompson (born 1939), Professor {{emeritus of}} {{theology}} at the University of Copenhagen, is a leading biblical minimalist of the Old Testament. In his 2007 book The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David, Thompson argues that the biblical accounts of both King David and Jesus of Nazareth are mythical in nature and based on Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Babylonian and Greek and Roman literature. For example, {{he argues that the}} resurrection of Jesus is taken directly from the story of the dying and rising god, Dionysus. However, Thompson does not draw a final conclusion on the historicity or ahistoricity of Jesus, but argued that any historical <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very different from the Christ (or Messiah) identified in the Gospel of Mark.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Curtiss {{argued that}} Genie proved only {{linguistic}} stimulation could cause the lateralization of language functions, {{pointing out that}} Genie's language center had not developed in her left hemisphere despite experiencing enough environmental stimulation to commence lateralization of other brain functions. Without this stimulation, a <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> rendered incapable of processing language from the left hemisphere {{of the brain and}} would be forced to only use the right hemisphere. The contrast between Genie's vocabulary and grammar acquisition also supported the existing hypothesis that these two processes underwent separate development during language acquisition. Genie's inability to master language despite clear progress in her cognitive development in other areas also suggested that language acquisition and cognition were separate, a new concept at the time.|$|E

In addition, slave traders operating away from the coast were sometimes panyarred before they could reach the port cities and all the slaves they were bringing to the ports <b>would</b> <b>be</b> seized and quickly sold.|$|R

25|$|In these decisions, President Narayanan {{set a new}} {{precedent}} {{concerning the}} appointment of a Prime minister – if no party or pre-election coalition had a majority, then a <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> appointed Prime minister only if he was able to convince the President (through letters of support from allied parties) of his ability to secure the confidence of the house. In doing so, he diverged from the actions of his predecessors who had been faced with the task of appointing a Prime minister from a hung parliament, Presidents N. Sanjiva Reddy, R. Venkataraman, and Shankar Dayal Sharma: the latter two had followed the practice of inviting the leader of the single largest party or pre-election coalition to form the government without investigating their ability to secure the confidence of the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of relayed VHF stations proved {{the reliability of}} unmanned stations, and the Telecommunications Administration started a process to unman the least trafficked coast radio stations. Proposals of remote controlling stations often resulted in a heated local debate, in part caused by the press claiming that the stations would be closed instead of simply moving the employees. One {{of the advantages of}} remote controlling was that instead of having one person on duty, there would be two, of which one <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a dedicated emergency transmission listener and one would handle other correspondence. In smaller stations there was only one employee for both tasks. An often-used argument against unmanning was that the operators had local knowledge. Operators were often {{from other parts of the}} country and typically did not have sufficient local knowledge for their section of the coastline for it to make a difference. Search and rescue operations would always be coordinated by the police and not the coast station.|$|E
25|$|The {{extrinsic}} grounds {{were said}} to be in the fact of the implicit approval of the Holy See given to the constant practice of unconditionally ordaining former Anglican priests who desired to be priests in the Roman Catholic Church and, also, in the explicit declarations of the Holy See as to the invalidity of Anglican orders on every occasion when its decision was given. According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, to attempt to confer orders a second time on the same <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a sacrilege. Rome, by knowingly allowing the practice of ordaining former Anglican priests, supposed that their orders were invalid. The bull points out that orders received in the Church of England, according to the change introduced into the Ritual under King Edward VI, were thought to be invalid by the Roman Catholic Church. This was not through a custom grown up gradually, but from the date of that change in the ritual.|$|E
