25|$|It {{was water}} hammer {{that caused the}} {{physical}} damage to the reactor, the deaths of personnel who stood atop and nearby, {{and the release of}} radioactive isotopes to the environment. One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure. The extra water is also a very effective radiation shield for those who are directly above the vessel. Written procedures at SL-1 had included a directive to <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> the level of water in the reactor prior to the maintenance procedure that destroyed it.|$|E

50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|E

40|$|For {{particle}} free vacuum systems, as e. g. systems containing superconducting cavities to {{be operated}} at high gradients, special care {{needs to be taken}} during <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> and venting. Neither should be particles introduced into the vacuum system, nor should particles already present within the system be moved. A series of measurements to study the movement of particles in long tubes during <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> and venting using an in-situ vacuum particle counter has been performed. Based on these measurements a set-up using flow controllers, diffuser and pressure gauges has been developed to avoid introducing particles into the vacuum system as well as moving existing particles during <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> and venting. This set-up can be operated manually as well as via a control unit. The electronics unit is an in-house development at DESY. It is usually connected to an oil free pump station. This set-up allows automated pump-down and venting of critical vacuum systems in a reliable and reproducible way, being faster than the procedures used so far...|$|E

25|$|This valve allows fluids {{to pass up}} or be <b>pumped</b> <b>down</b> the {{production}} tubing.

It is placed as far below the surface as is deemed safe from any possible surface disturbance including cratering caused by the wipeout of the platform. Where hydrates are likely to form (most production is at risk of this), the depth of the SCSSV (surface-controlled, sub-surface safety valve) below the seabed may be as much as 1km: this will allow for the geothermal temperature to be high enough to prevent hydrates from blocking the valve.|$|R
40|$|The PETRA {{storage ring}} at DESY will be {{upgraded}} {{to a third}} generation synchrotron radiation source with 15 beamlines in the PETRA III project [1]. Mobile pumping stations will be needed for the initial <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> of the beamlines and beamline components to a hydrocarbon-free and particle-free ultra-high vacuum [2]. They will be placed at the disposal for users to <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> and bake their experimental chambers and for leak detection. Since the old HASYLAB pumping station design used at DORIS does not fulfil the resulting requirements, a new pumping station was developed (see Fig. 1). Figure 1 : The new mobile dry pumping station for PETRA III beamlines. The outer dimensions of the station are adapted to the tight space in the PETRA tunnel. For mobility reasons {{it has a very}} narrow and rigid framework with rotatable wheels and four crane eyes on top. No part sticks out of the framework except the angle valve, for easy access. The electrical part of the pumping station is completely covered for safety. Twenty of these stations will be manufactured for PETRA III. In contrast to its predecessor it has a dry pumping system and features a bypass of the turbomolecular pump for fast <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> of the attached vacuum chamber to rough vacuum (se...|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{thermodynamic}} modeling of the evacuation process of a vacuum system that consists of a vacuum pump and a chamber. I prepared the thermodynamic model of the transient <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> process for isothermal and general case as well.

The calculated evacuation time results in isothermal and in general cases based on the model {{are close to the}} real, so the measured values. It makes sense to extend the researches to the case, when a long pipe is also connected to the chamber to be evacuated. We assume, that the evacuation process of a volume, the shape of which greatly differs from that of a chamber cannot be approached with a model of concentrated parameters, that assumes the unity of pressure, density and temperature at a time in the whole volume of the vacuum system. If measurements justify the assumption, further research is needed, in which the base of approach is a model of divided parameters that assumes not only time, but location dependency as well of the above mentioned...|$|E

40|$|The SES (Space Environmental Simulator), {{largest of}} the Thermal Vacuum Facilities at The Goddard Space Flight Center, {{recently}} was converted from an oil diffusion pumped chamber to a Cryopumped chamber. This modification was driven by requirements of flight projects. The basic requirement was to retain or enhance the operational parameters of the chamber such as pumping speed, ultimate vacuum, <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> time, and thermal system performance. To accomplish this task, seventeen diffusion pumps were removed and replaced with eight 1. 2 meter (48 inch) diameter cryopumps and one 0. 5 meter (20 inch) turbomolecular pump. The conversion was accomplished {{with a combination of}} subcontracting and in-house efforts to maximize the efficiency of implementation...|$|E

40|$|The many {{facets of}} {{exploding}} wire restrikes are studied. They {{are related to}} the cylindrical shock wave which <b>pumps</b> <b>down</b> the density of the center region of a line energy source or around the surface of the heated wire continuously to a lower density. When the density of any region is <b>pumped</b> <b>down</b> to lower than Paschen's electric breakdown criteria, restrike occurs. The cylindrical shocks occurring in exploding wires are, in general, divided into two types. In the first type the shock is generated by the wire explosion and in the second type the shock is generated by the heat conduction of the wire to the surrounding gas. Application of this mechanism to exploding tubes will enable us to create arc channels in arbitrary gaseous atmospheres with controllable plasma density with the contamination excluded. Neutral density shielded plasma experiments, therefore, can be conducted in a controllable environment...|$|R
