5000|$|Payment <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> is {{a payment}} made after a {{service has been}} provided, as {{distinct}} from in advance, which are payments made {{at the start of}} a period. For instance, rent is usually paid in advance, but mortgages <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> (the interest for the period is due at the end of the period). Employees' salaries are usually paid <b>in</b> <b>arrear.</b> Payment at the end of a period is referred to by the singular arrear, to distinguish from past due payments. For example, a housing tenant who is obliged to pay rent at the end of each month, is said to pay rent <b>in</b> <b>arrear,</b> while a tenant who has not paid rental due for 30 days is said to be one month in arrears. Precise usage may differ slightly (e.g. [...] "in arrear" [...] or [...] "in arrears" [...] for the same situation) in different English-speaking countries.|$|R

50|$|When {{ephemeris}} time was first adopted, time scales were still based on astronomical observation, {{as they always}} had been. The accuracy was limited by the accuracy of optical observation, and corrections of clocks and time signals were published <b>in</b> <b>arrear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The new Lord Power {{was made}} {{governor}} of the county and city of Waterford, and had also a company of foot; but the pay was often <b>in</b> <b>arrear.</b> <b>In</b> June 1666 it was falsely reported that Edmund Ludlow was going to attack Limerick {{at the head of}} a French army. Ormonde took precautions, and Orrery, as lord president of Munster, ordered Lord Power to have his militia in readiness.|$|R

60|$|During {{this period}} {{she saw her}} {{sister-in-law}} once or twice, who on those occasions came down to Arundel Street. She herself would not go to Gower Street, {{because of the presence}} of Miss Colza. Miss Colza still continued to live there, and still continued very much <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> <b>in</b> her contributions to the household fund. Mrs Mackenzie did not turn her out, because she would,--so she said,--in such case get nothing. Mrs Tom was by this time quite convinced that the property would, either justly or unjustly, go into the hands of John Ball, and she was therefore less anxious to make any sacrifice to please her sister-in-law.|$|R

6000|$|When {{the canoe}} {{returned}} to the city, {{with the news that}} a commissioner had arrived to make inquisition into the late troubles, there was a great stir and agitation throughout the community. Knots of whisperers gathered at every corner; those who were conscious of malpractices were filled with consternation; while those who had grievances, real or imaginary, to complain of, especially those whose pay was <b>in</b> <b>arrear,</b> appeared with joyful countenances.

60|$|September 23.--Worked in the morning; {{then drove}} over to Huntly Burn, chiefly {{to get from}} the good-humoured Colonel the {{accurate}} spelling of certain Hindu words which I have been using under his instructions. By the way, the sketches he gave me of Indian manners are highly picturesque. I have made up my Journal, which was three days <b>in</b> <b>arrear.</b> Also I wrought a little, so that the second volume of Grandfather's Tales is nearly half finished.|$|R
60|$|January 2.--Cæcæ mentes hominum.--My last entry records my {{punctuality}} {{in keeping}} up my diary hitherto; my present labour, commenced notwithstanding the date, upon the 9th January, {{is to make}} up my little record betwixt the second and that latter date. In a word, I have been several days <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> without rhyme or reason,--days too when there was so little to write down that the least jotting would have done it.

Having fallen <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> of the time, these generally refer to unknown words he has encountered in the newspapers. His three last (he always reads them with tremendous difficulty through an enormous magnifying-glass) were as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|It is bitter to muse on {{vanished}} youth; it is bitter to lose {{an election}} or a suit. Bitter are rage suppressed, vengeance unwreaked, and prize-money kept back. Bitter are a failing crop, a glutted market, and a shattering spec. Bitter are rents <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> and tithes <b>in</b> kind. Bitter are salaries reduced and perquisites destroyed. Bitter is a tax, particularly if misapplied; a rate, particularly if embezzled. Bitter is a trade too full, and bitterer still a trade that has worn out. Bitter is a bore! ...|$|R

"I am {{very glad}} to hear you speak so, Miss de la Molle," [...] {{answered}} the lawyer, [...] "because I {{was trying to make}} up my mind to broach the subject, which is a painful one to me. Frankly, then--forgive me for saying it, your father is absolutely ruined.

60|$|This {{completed}} {{the terror of}} Anandraz. Du Rocher had caused reports to be circulated {{that he intended to}} march against that chief's territories, and the news of the approach of the nizam, who was his suzerain lord, completed his dismay. He refused to advance another penny. Colonel Forde had already expended the prize money gained by the troops, his own private funds, and those of his officers, in buying food for his troops; and the men were several months <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> of their pay.|$|R
60|$|About one fourth, that is, about 220,000l., of {{the loan}} of 1767 remains unpaid. How much {{interest}} is <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> I could never discover: seven or eight years' at least, which would make the whole of that debt about 396,000l. This stock, which the ministers in their instructions to the Governor of Madras state as the least exceptionable, they have thought proper to distinguish by a marked severity, leaving it {{the only one on}} which the interest is not added to the principal to beget a new interest.|$|R
60|$|I am tremendously <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> with my letters,--except to----, {{and to her}} my {{thoughts}} overpower me:--my words never compass them. To Lady Melbourne I write with most pleasure--and her answers, so sensible, so tactique--I never met with half her talent. If {{she had been a}} few years younger, what a fool she would have made of me, had she thought it worth her while,--and I should have lost a valuable and most agreeable friend. Mem. a mistress never is nor can be a friend. While you agree, you are lovers; and, when it is over, any thing but friends.|$|R
60|$|XXXII. That {{the said}} Hastings, {{in order to}} add to the confusion, perplexity, and {{distress}} of the Nabob's affairs, did send to his court (in which he had already a Resident and Assistant Resident) two secret agents, Major Palmer and Major Davy, and did instruct Major Palmer to make a variety of new claims, one of a loan to the Company of 600,000l. sterling, although he well knew the Nabob was himself heavily <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> to the Company, and was utterly unable to discharge the same, as well as <b>in</b> <b>arrear</b> to his own troops, and to many individuals, and that he borrowed (when he could at all borrow) at an interest of near thirty per cent. To this demand was added a new bribe, or unlawful present, to himself, to the amount of 100,000l. sterling, which he did not refuse as unlawful and of evil example, but as indelicate in the Nabob's present situation,--and did, as if the same was his own property, presume to dispose of it, and to desire the transfer of it, as of his own bounty, to the Company, his masters. To this second demand he, the said Hastings, added a third demand of 120,000l. sterling, for four additional regiments on the Nabob's list, after he had solemnly engaged to take off the ten with which it had been burdened: the whole of the claims through his private agent aforesaid making the sum of 820,000l. sterling.|$|R

[...] "The rents" [...] he says, [...] "continue to be collected by one Donald Murchison, a servant of the late Earl's, who annually remits or carries the same to his master in France.

An honest man feels that he must pay Heaven for every hour of happiness with a good spell of hard, unselfish work to make others happy.

You did {{perfectly}} right in sending for me, for, in faith, I would not trust this treasure out of my sight on any consideration, until I handed it over to the Chilian government, after taking care to deduct the fleet’s share of the prize-money. It will be welcome, I can tell you, for the pay of the fleet is terribly <b>in</b> <b>arrear.</b> The treasury is empty, and there are no means of refilling it. Properly speaking, the whole of the fleet’s share of the money should go to you, but the rules of the service are arbitrary.” ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform a {{literature}} study {{to assess whether}} large long-term investors can benefit from liquidity <b>premiums</b> <b>in</b> different asset classes. We both describe the theoretical predictions on liquidity premiums and portfolio choice with illiquidity, as well as empirical evidence on liquidity premiums. We document that expected liquidity <b>premiums</b> <b>in</b> stocks have diminished {{in recent years and}} are hard to capture for large investors. In corporate and government bond markets there are more opportunities to exploit liquidity premiums. The evidence on liquidity <b>premiums</b> <b>in</b> alternative investment classes is scarce...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{nature of}} risk <b>premiums</b> <b>in</b> foreign currency futures markets is derived and studied empirically. Estimation problems encountered in using futures data are discussed. Since forward rates and futures prices are demonstrated to be approximately equal, and because risk <b>premiums</b> <b>in</b> forward markets are highly variable, {{consistency of the}} data requires time variation <b>in</b> daily risk <b>premiums</b> <b>in</b> the futures market. Unbiasedness of daily futures prices as predictors of the following day's futures price is rejected for all currencies. Reconciliation of daily and monthly data requires positive serial correlation <b>in</b> daily risk <b>premiums...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} empirical {{assessments of}} one of the leading explanations for the increase <b>in</b> skill <b>premium</b> <b>in</b> Mexico and Argentina during the 1990 s: trade liberalisation. We present evidence showing that imports increase skill <b>premium</b> <b>in</b> Mexico, while exports reduce it. In Argentina, trade increased skill <b>premium</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990 s (the beginning of trade reforms), although it reduced it later in the decade. These results are helpful for a comparison between South-South integration, FTAA or bilateral FTAs with Northern economies as alternative trade policy options for Latin American countries.
