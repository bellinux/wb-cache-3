These effects were mediated specifically by IGF-II/M 6 P receptors, as shown by studies using IGF-II analogues that are specific ago-nists for either IGF-I or IGF-II receptors. The SCM treatment also induced dose-dependent increases in rRNA levels, and M 6 P competition showed that this response required interaction with IGF-II/M 6 P receptors.

25|$|Resistance is a {{major cause}} of {{treatment}} failure in chemotherapeutic drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as <b>p-glycoprotein,</b> in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on <b>p-glycoprotein</b> and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of <b>p-glycoprotein</b> are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult. Another mechanism of resistance is gene amplification, a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out DNA repair. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as tubulin, can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress, which can kill a cancer cell; however, under certain conditions, cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs.|$|E

Cdr 1 p was subjected to site-directed mutational analysis. Among many mutant variants of Cdr 1 p, the phenotypes of F 774 A and ΔF 774 were particularly interesting.

The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of <b>P-glycoprotein,</b> similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E

40|$|Summary We have {{associated}} pharmacological {{studies to}} a semi-quantitative evaluation of <b>P-glycoprotein(s)</b> expression, to establish if classical multidrug resistance (MDR) {{could account for}} the complete resistance phenotype exhibited by progressively doxorubicin-resistant rat glioblastoma cells. Three resistant variants (C 6 0. 001, C 6 0. 1 and C 6 0. 5) of the C 6 glioblastoma cell line (C 6 S) were selected by long-term culture in the presence of three concentrations of doxorubicin (0. 001, 0. 1 and 0. 5 psg. ml- respectively). The degree of doxorubicin resistance was respectively 7, 33 and 400, and all the cell variants were cross-resistant to m-AMSA, etoposide and vincristine. Doxorubicin incorporation was reduced similarly in all resistant cells, irrespective of the level of resistance. When exposed to their respective doxorubicin IC 50, the 7 -fold resistant cells had the same intracellular drug incorporation as the sensitive cells, whereas the 33 -fold and 400 -fold resistant cells could incorporate respectively 3. 7 and 17 times more drug. The ratio of doxorubicin exposures required for 50 % DNA synthesis inhibition and 50 % growth inhibition was dependent on the degree of resistance; this ratio was 12. 8 in C 6 S, 11. 6 in C 6 0. 001, 6. 3 in C 6 0. 1 and 1. 8 in C 6 0. 5. <b>P-glycoprotein(s)</b> overexpression was of the same magnitude as the resistance factor in variants C 6 0. 001 and C 6 0. 1, but was lower than resistance factor in variant C 6 0. 5.

25|$|<b>P-glycoprotein</b> is a well-studied protein {{associated}} with multi-drug resistance. It {{belongs to the}} human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family and {{is also known as}} ABCB1 or MDR1 Pgp. MDR1 consists of a functional monomer with two transmembrane domains (TMD) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD). This protein can transport mainly cationic or electrically neutral substrates as well as a broad spectrum of amphiphilic substrates. The structure of the full-size ABCB1 monomer was obtained in the presence and absence of nucleotide using electron cryo crystallography. Without the nucleotide, the TMDs are approximately parallel and form a barrel surrounding a central pore, with the opening facing towards the extracellular side of the membrane and closed at the intracellular face. In the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, the TMDs have a substantial reorganization with three clearly segregated domains. A central pore, which is enclosed between the TMDs, is slightly open towards the intracellular face with a gap between two domains allowing access of substrate from the lipid phase. Substantial repacking and possible rotation of the TM helices upon nucleotide binding suggests a helix rotation model for the transport mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Human ABC {{transporters}} {{are involved}} in several diseases that arise from polymorphisms in ABC genes and rarely due to complete loss of function of single ABC proteins. Such diseases include Mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, Tangier disease, immune deficiencies, progressive familial intraheptic cholestasis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia, X-linked sideroblastosis and anemia, age-related macular degeneration, familial hypoapoproteinemia, Retinitis pigmentosum, cone rod dystrophy, and others. The human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family is responsible for multiple drug resistance (MDR) against a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. ABCB1 or MDR1 <b>P-glycoprotein</b> is also involved in other biological processes for which lipid transport is the main function. It is found to mediate the secretion of the steroid aldosterone by the adrenals, and its inhibition blocked the migration of dendritic immune cells, possibly related to the outward transport of the lipid platelet activating factor (PAF). It has also been reported that ABCB1 mediates transport of cortisol and dexamethasone, but not of progesterone in ABCB1 transfected cells. MDR1 can also transport cholesterol, short-chain and long-chain analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), sphingomyelin (SM), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Multispecific transport of diverse endogenous lipids through the MDR1 transporter can possibly affect the transbilayer distribution of lipids, in particular of species normally predominant on the inner plasma membrane leaflet such as PS and PE.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that {{bevirimat}} does not inhibit the cytochrome P450 system or interact with the human <b>P-glycoprotein.</b> Unformulated bevirimat is not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood. Some of the less desirable properties of unformulated bevirimat and its salts include: inadequate bioavailability, poor solubility of the pharmaceutical composition in gastric fluid, insufficient dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, below standard long term safety profile for oral dosage forms, below standard long term chemical and physical stability of the final dosage form, tendency for conversion to metastable forms, lengthy dissolution times for oral dosage forms, and precipitation in gastric or intestinal fluids. Some pharmaceutical compositions of formulated bevirimat have shown to have better properties over unformulated bevirimat. Some of these properties include: improved bioavailability, improved solubility of the composition in gastric fluid, improved dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, improved safety for oral dosage forms, improved chemical and physical stability of the oral dosage form, decreased conversion to metastable forms, and decreased rate of precipitation in gastric fluid. Bevirimat was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with detectable concentrations present in the plasma within 15 minutes after administration and peak plasma concentrations were achieved approximately one to three hours after administration. The plasma had a mean plasma elimination half-life ranging from 58 to 80 hours. This long half-life of bevirimat supports once-daily dosing. Elimination of bevirimat is primarily via hepatobiliary routes, with renal elimination counting for less than 1% of the dose.|$|E

Recent {{findings that}} class I <b>P-glycoproteins</b> {{are able to}} transport several short-chain phospholipid analogues {{raises questions about the}} role of these Pgps in physiological lipid transport. We investigated the biliary secretion of C 6 - 7 -nitro- 2, 1, 3 -benzoxadiazol- 4 -yl (NBD) -labeled ceramide and its metabolites in Mdr 1 a/b and Mdr 2 knockout mice compared to control mice. Biliary secretion of these NBD-lipids was unaffected in Mdr 1 a/b -/- mice. Thus neither Mdr 1 a nor Mdr 1 b Pgp mediates biliary secretion of these lipids. In contrast, secretion of all three NBD-labeled short-chain phospholipids was significantly reduced in Mdr 2 -/- mice. As in vitro studies revealed that Mdr 2 Pgp is not able to translocate these lipid analogues, we hypothesized that Mdr 2 -/- mice had a reduced PC content of the exoplasmic canalicular membrane leaflet so that extraction of the short-chain lipid probes from this membrane by canalicular bile salts was impaired. To investigate this possibility we studied the bile salt-mediated extraction of natural sphingomyelin (SM) and NBD-labeled short-chain SM from small unilamellar vesicles of different lipid composition. Natural SM could be extracted by the bile salt tauroursodeoxycholate from vesicles containing PC, cholesterol (CHOL), and SM (1 : 2 : 2) but not from vesicles containing only SM and CHOL (3 : 2). NBD-labeled short-chain SM could be extracted from vesicles containing PC while its extraction from pure SM:CHOL vesicles was reduced by 65 %. These data confirm that the efficiency of NBD-SM extraction depends on the lipid composition and suggest that the canalicular membrane outer leaflet of Mdr 2 -/- mice has a reduced PC conten...|$|R
