50|$|Combustion instabilities are {{typically}} violent <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillations</b> in a combustion chamber. These <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{can be as}} high as 180 dB, and long term exposure to these cyclic pressure and thermal loads reduces the life of engine components.

This problem was solved by re-designing the fuel injector. In liquid jet engines the droplet size and distribution can be used to attenuate the instabilities. Combustion instabilities are a major concern in ground-based gas turbine engines because of NOx emissions. The tendency is to run lean, an equivalence ratio less than 1, to reduce the combustion temperature and thus reduce the NOx emissions; however, running the combustion lean makes it very susceptible to combustion instability.|$|E

When the external force pushing the air into the cavity is removed, the higher-pressure air inside will flow out. Due to the inertia of the moving air the cavity will be left at a pressure slightly lower than the outside, causing air to be drawn back in.
