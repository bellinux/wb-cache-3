5000|$|... Iran has 3,200 gas {{stations}} for 15 million automobiles. Demand {{is supported by}} the fixing of fuel prices well below market levels. There are two pricing schemes for petrol, one subsidized the other not. Each month, qualified vehicle owners are allocated a specific number of subsidized liters of petrol (taxi's have a significantly higher allocation). The cost of regular unsubsidized petrol in Iran is IR7,000/liter (approximately 37 US cents/liter) and <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> IR8,000/liter, whereas the subsidized equivalents go for IR4,000/liter and IR5,000/liter, respectively. The nation's abundant oil reserves have enabled the government to keep prices low (Iran is the second-largest exporter in OPEC). However, low prices have encouraged wasteful consumption and the smuggling of petrol into neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Some 1.8 billion liters of oil products worth 10 trillion rials ($1 billion) are smuggled out of Iran per annum.|$|E
5000|$|LPG is {{prepared}} by refining petroleum or [...] "wet" [...] natural gas, and {{is almost entirely}} derived from fossil fuel sources, being manufactured during the refining of petroleum (crude oil), or extracted from petroleum or natural gas streams as they emerge from the ground. It was first produced in 1910 by Dr. Walter Snelling, and the first commercial products appeared in 1912. It currently provides about 3% of all energy consumed, and burns relatively cleanly with no soot and very few sulfur emissions. As it is a gas, it does not pose ground or water pollution hazards, but it can cause air pollution. LPG has a typical specific calorific value of 46.1 MJ/kg compared with 42.5 MJ/kg for fuel oil and 43.5 MJ/kg for <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline). However, its energy density per volume unit of 26 MJ/L is lower than either that of petrol or fuel oil, as its relative density is lower (about 0.5-0.58 kg/L, compared to 0.71-0.77 kg/L for gasoline).|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Victor, {{launched on}} 28 February 1957, was coded the F series {{and saw a}} production run of more than 390,000 units. The car was of unitary construction and featured a large glass area with heavily curved windscreen and rear window. Following then current American styling trends, the windscreen pillars sloped backwards. In fact, the body style was derived directly from the classic 57 Chevrolet Bel Air, though this was not obvious unless the two cars were viewed side by side. Bench seats were fitted front and rear trimmed in Rayon and [...] "Elastofab", and two-colour interior trim was standard. The Super model had extra chrome trim, notably around the windows; remnants of the signature Vauxhall bonnet flutes ran along the front flanks and the exhaust pipe exited through the rear bumper. The car was equipped with arm rests on the doors, door-operated courtesy lights, a two-spoke steering wheel, and twin sun visors. An estate variant was launched in 1958. When re-styled, as the Series 2, the car lost all its '57 Chevy styling detail and the teardrop shaped Vauxhall flutes were replaced by a single chrome side-stripe running nose to tail. The sculpted [...] "porthole" [...] rear bumper tips, which rusted badly due to exhaust residue, were replaced by plain, straight ones. The old bumper ends continued {{to be used for}} many years on a variety of motor coaches and ice-cream vans.Although the engine was of similar size to that of the outgoing Wyvern it was in critical respects new. Fitted with a single Zenith carburettor it had an output of [...] at 4200 rpm and gained a reputation of giving a long trouble free life. This was also the year when Vauxhall standardized on [...] "premium" [...] grade petrol/gasoline, permitting an increase in the compression ratio from the Wyvern's 6.8:1 to 7.8:1. <b>Premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> had become available in the UK at the end of 1953, following an end to post-war fuel rationing, and at that time offered average octane level of 93, but in the ensuing four years this had crept up to 95 (RON).|$|E

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} {{trends in the}} deposition of lead, zinc, copper, cadmium and manganese in Canterbury, New Zealand, have been studied. The two main aspects {{of this study were}} an atmospheric deposition monitoring programme set up over the study area to assess present-day spatial trends; and an assessment of the ability of kahikatea tree ring wood to record historical trends in levels of heavy metals in the Christchurch atmosphere. The main instrumental technique used was atomic absorption spectrophotometry, with both flame and graphite furnace atomisation. To study the dispersal of the metal-enriched aerosol from Christchurch, a network of deposition collectors was established over part of the Canterbury Plains. The main conclusions were that the rates of deposition of lead, zinc, copper and cadmium, but not manganese, showed an approximately exponential decay with distance away from Christchurch, and that the dispersion pattern was dependent upon the prevailing wind direction. It was also found that while rural deposition rates of zinc, copper and cadmium were lower than in other developed countries, the rates of lead deposition were similar to or higher than their overseas counterparts. Considerable seasonal variations in metal deposition rates tended to obscure an expected reduction in lead deposition fluxes following a reduction in the lead content of New Zealand <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> in July 1986. Concentrations of lead, zinc, copper, manganese and cadmium were determined in the topsoils at the deposition collection sites, to assess the influence of atmospheric deposition on topsoil composition. Substantial differences, overriding the natural variability in soil composition, were found to exist between urban and rural soils. However, in rural sites, variations in metal deposition rates did not produce effects visible above natural variations, {{with the possible exception of}} lead. To gain an historical perspective on the metal pollution history of Christchurch, the annual rings of kahikatea trees in Riccarton Bush, Christchurch, were analysed for lead, zinc, copper, manganese and cadmium. It was found that kahikatea trees appeared sensitive to environmental levels of these metals, showing accumulations of lead, zinc, copper and cadmium which appeared related to known historical emission trends. However, manganese concentrations in the ring wood appeared to be controlled by soil factors. A background stand of kahikatea trees showed no trends of increasing metal concentrations. The use of peat deposits for historical monitoring purposes was also investigated. It was concluded that the only metals which appeared relatively immobile within the peat profile, hence indicating potential for recording historical trends in deposition fluxes, were copper and cadmium. The other metals appeared to have been mobilised by the severely anaerobic conditions in the bogs, as they were depleted below the permanent water table. However, deposition rates calculated in the surface peat were similar to fluxes measured by a conventional deposition collector at a similar site...|$|E

50|$|Infrared {{spectrophotometry}} {{is used as}} one of {{the methods}} for measuring the quality of the grown crystals. The wavenumbers 3585, 3500, and 3410 cm−1 are commonly used. The measured value is based on the absorption bands of the OH radical and the infrared Q value is calculated. The electronic grade crystals, grade C, have Q of 1.8 million or above; the <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> B crystals have Q of 2.2 million, and special <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> A crystals have Q of 3.0 million. The Q value is calculated only for the z region; crystals containing other regions can be adversely affected. Another quality indicator is the etch channel density; when the crystal is etched, tubular channels are created along linear defects. For processing involving etching, e.g. the wristwatch tuning fork crystals, low etch channel density is desirable. The etch channel density for swept quartz is about 10-100 and significantly more for unswept quartz. Presence of etch channels and etch pits degrades the resonator's Q and introduces nonlinearities.|$|R
