5|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of COPD are sputum production, shortness of breath, and a <b>productive</b> <b>cough.</b> These symptoms are present for {{a prolonged period}} of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist. While previously divided into emphysema and chronic bronchitis, emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself, and chronic bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms {{that may or may not}} occur with COPD.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{bronchitis}} {{is defined}} as a <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. Most people with chronic bronchitis have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Protracted bacterial bronchitis {{is defined as}} a chronic <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> with a positive bronchoalveolar lavage that resolves with antibiotics. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis may include wheezing and shortness of breath, especially upon exertion and low oxygen saturations.

25|$|Asthma is {{the most}} common reason for {{presenting}} to the emergency room with shortness of breath.

25|$|People {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), most commonly emphysema or chronic bronchitis, frequently have chronic {{shortness of breath}} and a chronic <b>productive</b> <b>cough.</b> An acute exacerbation presents with increased shortness of breath and sputum production. COPD is a risk factor for pneumonia; thus this condition should be ruled out. In an acute exacerbation treatment is with a combination of anticholinergics, beta2-adrenoceptor agonists, steroids and possibly positive pressure ventilation.|$|E

Up to 30 % of patients who present with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary thromboembolism present with this condition. This is a case report of a 36 -year-old man who experienced one episode of DVT within the previous year and was admitted to our hospital due to <b>productive</b> <b>coughs</b> and hemoptysis. Paraclinical studies demonstrated a right ventricular thrombus. Additional investigation was done to find the underlying cause. Laboratory tests were positive for Factor V Leiden mutation. Other factors for hypercoagulability states were normal. Given that Factor V Leiden mutation is a life-threatening condition with a relatively high prevalence and considering its thrombogenesis, screening tests are necessary in young patients without obvious reasons for recurrent thrombus formation. It seems that medical noninvasive treatments can be an alternative therapy to surgery when a ventricular thrombus is suspected in these patients. </p...|$|R
25|$|Chronic {{bronchitis}} {{is defined}} as a <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. Most people with chronic bronchitis have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Tobacco smoking is the most common cause, with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. Treatments include quitting smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation.|$|E
500|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a type}} of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term breathing problems and poor airflow.

We present an interesting case of a 35 -year-old woman who presented for evaluation of a chronic <b>cough</b> <b>productive</b> of voluminous secretions. Clinical and radiological examination confirmed a total left lung atelectasis without any pathological mediastinal node. Flexible bronchoscopy demonstrated tenacious, thick, and sticky whitish secretions blocking the left stem bronchus.

Two days after bronchoscopy, the patient rejected more bronchial casts, and dyspnea improved. Control of chest x-ray revealed complete left lung aeration and the diagnosis of idiopathic plastic bronchitis was obtained.

40|$|Objective: Examine the {{prevalence}} and clinical/epidemiological aspects {{of patients with}} nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) isolated from sputum provided by an outpatient clinic specializing {{in the treatment of}} multiresistant tuberculosis (MRTB) in Bahia, Brazil. Methods: All patients followed at the MRTB outpatient clinic of the Octávio Mangabeira Specialized Hospital (HEOM) were evaluated retrospectively from July 1998 to July 2003. All patients underwent direct examinations and cultures to identify the mycobacteria species found during initial and subsequent evaluations. The following variables were recorded: age, gender, clinical symptoms and signs, pre-existing lung disease, prior TB treatment, HIV serology, and NTM species. Categorical and quantitative variables were respectively characterized using proportions and measures ± SD. Results: NTM were isolated in 19 of 231 patients (8. 2 %; 95 %CI: 5. 2 %- 12. 3 %), with the following species distribution: 58 % (11 / 19) M. chelonae/abscessus; 16 % (3 / 19) M. avium-intracellular complex; 16 % (3 / 19) M. kansasii; and 11 % (2 / 19) M. fortuitum.

40|$|Background. Primary pneumonic plague (PPP) {{caused by}} Yersinia pestis {{is the most}} {{threatening}} clinical form of plague. An outbreak was reported in July 2009 in Qinghai Province, China. Methods. This outbreak was investigated by clinical, epidemiological, bacteriological, and immunological methods. Multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) was used to track {{the source of the}} outbreak. Results. The index case, a patient with PPP, contaminated 11 close contacts. All the 12 cases, including the index patient, experienced sudden onset of fever, headache, and <b>productive</b> <b>coughing</b> with bloody sputum. Three of them died. Nevertheless, another 61 direct and 256 indirect contacts were not infected during the 2 -week quarantine. Antibodies to F 1 antigen were detected in 9 survival cases, with a 4 -fold increase in titers in serum samples collected at different periods. Seven strains of Y. pestis were isolated from dogs and patients. Field investigation and MLVA of the isolated strains revealed that this outbreak was started by a deceased dog. Conclusion. Dogs are believed to be an indicator animal for plague surveillance, but their association with PPP is rare. Our results provide evidence for this possibility, which suggests the public health significance of dogs as a source of plague. Plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, was classified as a reemerging infectious disease by the World Healt...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Pulmonary {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{is caused}} by the bacteria Mycobacterium tubercu-losis (MT). Rare cases of pulmonary thromboembolism along pulmonary or extra pulmonary TB were reported during the first weeks of anti-tuberculosis therapy. Case Report: A 28 -year-old woman was admitted with complaints of ankles pain, fever, noc-turnal sweating, dyspnea and <b>productive</b> <b>coughs.</b> Patchy consolidations were seen on her chest x-ray and three sputum positive acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smears were reported in her investigations. The patient underwent anti-tuberculosis drugs and her clinical condition was improving while at the eight day of the treatment, the patient conditions suddenly deterio-rated and suffered from severe dyspnea, chest pain and haemoptysis. Moreover, sinus tachy-cardia with T waves inversion in precordial leads (V 1 -V 3) were seen on the electrocardio-gram. Diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism was confirmed on computed tomography contrast angiography. In addition, echocardiography and color Doppler sonography of the lower extremities were normal. There was no evidence for hypercoagolopathy impairments in the patient. The patient was treated with warfarin and anti-tuberculosis drugs for six months, and she was completely cured and became smear negative {{at the end of the}} therapy. Conclusion: As a result, although pulmonary thromboembolism is a rare complication of TB it should be considered in the patient with TB particularly during the first weeks of anti-TB treatment when respiratory symptoms exacerbations occur.
