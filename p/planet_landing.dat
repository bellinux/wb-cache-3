50|$|The {{comic strip}} follows {{the adventures of}} Flash Gordon, a {{handsome}} polo player and Yale University graduate, and his companions Dale Arden and Dr. Hans Zarkov. The story begins with Earth threatened by a collision with the planet Mongo. Dr. Zarkov invents a rocket ship to fly into space {{in an attempt to}} stop the disaster. Half mad, he kidnaps Flash and Dale and they travel to the <b>planet.</b> <b>Landing</b> on the planet, and halting the collision, they come into conflict with Ming the Merciless, Mongo's evil ruler.|$|E
50|$|As they {{approach}} the planet, they determine it has a chlorine-gas atmosphere {{and that it is}} surrounded by several moons that form a near-perfect circle around the <b>planet.</b> <b>Landing</b> on the nearest moon, they discover no evidence of life via the sensors, but do discover a collection of ballon-shaped buildings, the source of an unnaturally high level of energy. Koenig suits up to attempt to enter one of the buildings, and soon finds himself in an elevator that deposits him in a rock-walled cavern housing several globes perched atop stands. The globes and stands resemble the exterior buildings on the moons surface. Koenig is knocked unconscious by some sort of energy ray when he approaches one of the globes.|$|E
40|$|Following an ESA {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} possible areas of European participation in the future international exploration of Mars and an ESA call for ideas of new missions, MARSNET, a network of small surface stations, was selected for further in-depth scientific and technical assessment studies as a potential European contribution to such exploration. Subsequently, the MARSNET phase A studies started {{in the autumn of}} 1991. The industrial kickoff took place in early January 1992, following the tender evaluation and the decision to select the Aerospatiale-led consortium including Dornier, Alcatel, Laben, and Etca to perform the industrial studies. The phase A studies ended in early 1993. However, critical items such as an instrument deployment device continue to be studied in the framework of ESA's Technology Research Program. The MARSNET mission consists of a network of three semihard landers to be placed on the Martian surface, several thousand kilometers apart, thus defining a regional/global seismological and meteorological network in the Tharsis region. The small stations would be targeted for landing at scientifically interesting sites in this region of Mars, which is the most likely area to still show tectonic activity; this would allow the seismometers to acquire data for the determination of the internal structure of the <b>planet.</b> <b>Landing</b> site geology and geochemistry will also be studied...|$|E

40|$|Two {{habitable}} planetary {{states are}} proposed: an aqua planet like the Earth and a <b>land</b> <b>planet</b> {{that has a}} small amount of water. <b>Land</b> <b>planets</b> keep liquid water under larger solar radiation compared to aqua planets. Water loss may change an aqua <b>planet</b> into a <b>land</b> <b>planet,</b> and the planet can remain habitable for a longer time than had it stayed an aqua planet. We calculate planetary evolution with hydrogen escape for different initial water inventories and different distances from the central star. We find that there are two conditions to evolve an aqua <b>planet</b> into a <b>land</b> planet: the critical amount of water on the surface M_ml consistent with a <b>planet</b> being a <b>land</b> <b>planet,</b> and the critical amount of water vapor in the atmosphere M_cv that defines the onset of the runaway greenhouse state. We find that Earth-size aqua planets with initial oceans < 10 % of the Earth's can evolve into <b>land</b> <b>planets</b> if M_cv = 3 m in precipitable water and M_ml = 5 % of the Earth's ocean mass. Such planets can keep liquid water on their surface for another 2 Gyrs. The initial amount of water and M_cv are shown to be important dividing parameters of the planetary evolution path. Our results indicate that massive hydrogen escape could give a fresh start as another kind of habitable planet rather than the end of its habitability.
