40|$|Summary. The {{use of the}} pH-pill {{has allowed}} {{continuous}} monitoring of vaginal pH during human coitus. In {{the case of a}} couple of normal fertility, there was an immediate buffering by seminal plasma so that the vaginal pH changed in 8 sec from pH 4 =. to pH 7 = [...] In the case of a couple of low (male) fertility, the immediate effect of the arrival of semen in the vagina was a change from pH 3 =. to pH 5 = [...] A similarly small change in pH occurred when the seminal volume of a fertile male subject had been depleted, by repeated ejaculation, to 1 =. ml. At this pH(5 =.),spermatozoa are generally immobilized. It has been possible to alter normal fertility, as judged by <b>postcoital</b> <b>tests</b> for sperm motility, by the introduction of a pH 3 =. buffer solution into the vagina before coitus. In this latter experiment, the vaginal pH immediately after ejaculation was 5 =. and, after 2 hr, had reached pH 5 = [...] These results in vivo suggest that the vagina is not the hostile environ-ment hitherto imagined, since the normal ejaculate readily overcomes the vaginal acidity by its powerful buffering action. Low seminal volume, with or without a concomitantly low sperm count, and artificial changes in vaginal environment by buffer solutions may affect fertility...|$|R

40|$|Background. Cytokines are {{involved}} in {{almost every aspect of}} reproduction and recent studies suggested a relationship between cytokines and male/female infertility. In the present study, the levels of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) were determined in the cervical mucus of fertile and infertile women. Methods. Groups of patients were formed according to the results of the standard procedure for infertility investigation, including <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> and the presence of antispermatozoid antibodies in the sera of both partners and in seminal plasma, by mixed antiglobulin reaction (MAR) test and Kibrick agglutination test. IL- 8 and IL- 1 Ra levels were determined in solubilized (ultrasonographic sonicaton) cervical mucus sampled in the midcycle by commercial ELISA kits and expressed as pg/mg proteins. Results. The groups were designated as fertile (n= 20) and infertile (n= 48). The latter was divided into two subgroups, one consisting of infertile women with positive <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> and without antispermatozoid antibodies (n= 30), and the other designated as infertile women with negative <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> (n= 18). This subgroup was composed of women with negative <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> and without antibodies (n= 10) and the women with negative <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> with antibodies (n= 8). Similar levels of IL- 8 and IL- 1 Ra were noted in the cervical mucus of in fertile women and women with positive <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> and without antispermatozoid antibodies. A tendency of decrease (p= 0, 052) and significant decrease in IL- 8 levels (p< 0. 05) was noted in negative <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> group and negative <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> group without antibodies respectively, compared to the levels in the fertile examinees. A significant rise in IL- 1 Ra levels (p< 0, 05) was detected in the mucus of negative <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> group with further increase in negative <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> group with antibodies (p< 0. 02). Conclusion. Changes in IL- 8 and IL- 1 Ra levels in the cervical mucus of infertile patients with negative <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> suggested the existence of the relatinship between cervical cytokines and infertility in these women...|$|E
40|$|There {{is still}} {{a great deal of}} {{controversy}} on the value of the <b>postcoital</b> <b>test.</b> Some consider it to be a valuable method for the general practitioner to evaluate the interaction in vivo between spermatozoa and cervical mucus, in spite of the poor predictive value of the test. The <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> is in fact only an indirect method for the detection of the production of moving sperms. As a negative <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> is frequently due to bad timing of the test, multiple mandatory intercourse is often necessary, which may lead to frustration and sexual dysfunction. Moreover, there are no indications that the <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> with its poor discriminatory power may be better in general practice than the fertility evaluations by a specialist as standardisation and reproducibility problems are equal in both settings.

Prospective cohort study was performed between December 2009 and September 2012 for all women who started ovulation induction with CC in one university clinic and two teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. A PCT was performed in one of the first three ovulatory cycles. Ovulation induction with CC was continued for at least six cycles. The PCT was judged to be positive if at least one progressive motile spermatozo was seen in one of five high power fields at 400 × magnification. The primary outcome was time to ongoing pregnancy, within six ovulatory cycles. In 152 women the PCT was performed. 135 women had a reliable, well-timed PCT. The ongoing pregnancy rate was 44 / 107 (41 %) for a positive and 10 / 28 (36 %) for a negative PCT. The hazard rate for ongoing pregnancy was 1. 3 (95 % CI 0. 64 - 2. 5) for a positive versus a negative PCT.

Diagnosis is based on the <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> and on various laboratory tests to assess sperm-cervical mucous compatibility and to detect antispermatozoal antibodies. In women the strongest relation between results of laboratory tests and infertility is between the presence of serum antispermatozoal antibodies and infertility of more than 3 years' duration. In men there is a relation between high levels of these antibodies in the semen and infertility. Various treatments have been proposed, but further prospective studies are needed.

30|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} but not evidence-based agreement that basic tests of infertility work-up should include normal semen analysis, ovulation detection test, tubal patency testing, and hormonal profile. Some authors add <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> [5]. Non-universal agreement on the steps and stratification of diagnostic tools {{can be attributed to}} wide variations of the infertile population regarding age, duration of marriage, primary or secondary infertility, psychologic status of the couple, and the interest of the infertility team. It has been noticed that some centers interested in ART push patients to try IUI or IVF/ICSI without prior laparoscopy or even HSG. Many subsequent failures can be attributed to abnormal uterine cavity or distended hydrosalpingeal tubes which are unfortunately diagnosed too late in many cases. These alarming data call for more strict infertility work-up that should be supported by big infertility societies.|$|E
40|$|Motility is {{the feature}} that allows {{spermatozoa}} to actively reach and penetrate the female gamete during fertilization. When this function is altered, and especially decreased, troubles in conceiving may occur. In this study, we demonstrated that treating fertile women with myo-inositol (MI) vaginal suppositories ameliorated their partners’ sperm motility and also positively affected their conceiving capacity, without changes in cervical mucus structural and biochemical characteristics. Indeed, {{by means of}} the <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> on female cervical mucus, a significant improvement especially in progressive sperm motility was recorded after MI suppository use. Concomitantly, after MI treatment, a reduction of immotile spermatozoa percentage was observed. Importantly, MI vaginal supplementation positively correlated with a pregnancy for 5 of the 50 couples enrolled in the study, leading us to speculate that this substance may substantially contribute to create in the cervical mucus an ideal milieu that makes spermatozoa more motile and functionally able to fertilize. Even though the detailed mechanism is still unclear, these results should encourage MI vaginal use for the clinical improvement of male infertility, through their partners...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in intrauterine insemination (IUI) for subfertile couples with an abnormal <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> and a poor prognosis. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Twenty-four fertility centers in the Netherlands. PATIENT(S) : Subfertile couples with a well-timed nonprogressive PCT and additional factors that reduce fertility. INTERVENTION(S) : Couples were randomly allocated to three cycles of IUI with COH or three cycles of IUI without COH. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Ongoing pregnancy within three IUI cycles. RESULT(S) : We randomly allocated 132 couples to IUI with COH, and 133, to IUI without COH. We observed 33 pregnancies (25 %) in the couples allocated to IUI with COH, of which 28 were ongoing (21 %), vs. 28 pregnancies (21 %) in the couples allocated to IUI without COH, of which 23 were ongoing (17 %; relative risk of an ongoing pregnancy, 1. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 75 to 2. 0). Two multiple pregnancies occurred in the IUI with COH group, and one, in the IUI without COH group. CONCLUSION(S) : In couples with an abnormal PCT and a poor prognosis, IUI with COH leads to pregnancy rates comparable to those for IUI without COH. We propose to perform IUI without COH in couples with an abnormal PC...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Coeliac {{women may}} suffer from gynaecological and obstetric complications. It is {{possible}} that these complications are the first symptom of coeliac disease. AIMS: To investigate the occurrence of subclinical coeliac disease in patients with infertility or recurrent miscarriages. SUBJECTS: Women of reproductive age who were attending the hospital because of either primary or secondary infertility, or two or more miscarriages. Women undergoing sterilisation served as control subjects. METHODS: The diagnostic investigation for infertility included the endocrine status, diagnostic laparoscopy, investigation of tubal patency, <b>postcoital</b> <b>test,</b> and semen analysis of the partner. Circulating antibodies against IgA class reticulin and gliadin were used in screening for coeliac disease. In positive cases, the diagnosis was confirmed by small bowel biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Four (2. 7 %) of 150 women in the infertility group, {{and none of the}} 150 control subjects were found to have coeliac disease (p = 0. 06). All four women with coeliac disease suffered from infertility of unexplained origin. Altogether 98 women had no discoverable reason for infertility. Thus, in this subgroup the frequency of coeliac disease was 4. 1 % (four of 98), the difference from the control group being statistically significant (p = 0. 02). None of the coeliac women had extensive malabsorption, but two had iron deficiency anaemia. One women with coeliac disease has had a normal delivery. None of the 50 women with miscarriage had coeliac disease. CONCLUSION: Patients having fertility problems may have subclinical coeliac disease, which can be detected by serological screening tests. Silent coeliac disease should be considered in the case of women with unexplained infertility...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} {{the use of}} {{clinical}} prediction models improves concordance between gynaecologists with respect to treatment decisions in reproductive medicine. DESIGN: We constructed 16 vignettes of subfertile couples by varying fertility history, <b>postcoital</b> <b>test,</b> sperm motility, follicle-stimulating hormone level and Chlamydia antibody titre. SETTING: Thirty-five gynaecologists estimated three probabilities, i. e. the 1 -year probability of spontaneous pregnancy, the pregnancy chance after intrauterine insemination (IUI) and the pregnancy chance after in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Subsequently they proposed therapeutic regimens for these 16 fictional couples, i. e. expectant management, IUI or IVF. Three months later, the participant gynaecologists again had to propose therapeutic regimes for the same 16 fictional cases but this time accompanied by pregnancy chances obtained from prediction models: predictions on spontaneous pregnancy, IUI and IVF. POPULATION: Thirty-five gynaecologists working in academic and nonacademic hospitals in the Netherlands. METHODS: Setting section. Main outcome measures The concordance between gynaecologists of probability estimates, expressed as interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the concordance between gynaecologists of treatment decisions, analysed by calculating Cohen's kappa (kappa). RESULTS: The gynaecologists differed widely in estimating pregnancy chances (ICC: 0. 34). Furthermore, {{there was a huge}} variation in the proposed therapeutic regimens (kappa: 0. 21). The treatment decisions made by gynaecologists were consistent with the ranking of their probability estimates. When prediction models were used, the concordance (kappa) for treatment decisions increased from 0. 21 to 0. 38. The number of gynaecologists counselling for expectant management increased from 39 to 51 %, whereas counselling for IVF dropped from 23 to 14 %. CONCLUSION: Gynaecologists differed widely in their estimation of prognosis in 16 fictional cases of subfertile couples. Their therapeutic regimens showed likewise huge variation. After confrontation with prediction models in the same 16 fictional cases, the proposed therapeutic regimens showed only slightly better concordance. Therefore a simple introduction of validated prediction models is insufficient to introduce concordant management between doctor...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the capacity of}} the <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> (PCT) to predict spontaneous pregnancy in a large cohort study of subfertile couples. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Department of reproductive medicine of 38 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patient(s) : Between January 2002 and February 2004, we prospectively included consecutive subfertile couples who had not been evaluated previously for subfertility. Intervention(s) : We estimated the contribution of the PCT result to the existing prediction model for spontaneous pregnancy by calculating the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of an abnormal PCT result. We constructed a second prediction model (PCT model) based on the reference model including the PCT. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Primary endpoint in this study was ongoing pregnancy. We evaluated the performance of the PCT model in comparison with the reference model by calculating goodness of fit, discrimination, calibration, and the "net reclassification improvement''. Result(s) : We included 3, 021 couples of whom 537 (18 %) had a spontaneous pregnancy and 55 (1. 8 %) a nonsuccessful pregnancy; 1, 316 (44 %) started treatment within 12 months, 824 (27 %) neither started treatment nor became pregnant, and 289 (10 %) became lost to follow-up within 12 months. The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCTwas 0. 76 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 62 to 0. 94). The adjustedHRfor an abnormal PCTwas 0. 63 (95 % CI: 0. 47 to 0. 84) in case of no spermatozoa, 0. 81 (95 % CI: 0. 57 to 1. 2) in case of nonmotile spermatozoa, and 1. 2 (95 % CI: 0. 8 to 1. 8) in case of motile, nonprogressive spermatozoa. Adding the PCT result to the reference model did not improve goodness of fit. Discrimination was equally poor for the PCT model and the reference model. The calibration plots of both models showed comparably good calibration. The net reclassification improvement of the predictions of the PCT model compared with the reference model was - 1. 1 %. Conclusion(s) : This study demonstrated that the PCT has prognostic value but does not add substantially to a prognostic model for spontaneous pregnancy. (Fertil Steril (R) 2011; 95 : 2050 - 5.

40|$|Background: The <b>postcoital</b> <b>test</b> (PCT) {{is used in}} the {{fertility}} work-up in subfertile couples. It is the method of choice for diagnosing a ‘cervical factor’ in infertility. Although the many studies in the ovulatory subfertile population, the value of the PCT in predicting fertility is still controversial. Whether this test has a predicting value of fertility in the anovulatory subfertile population can be questioned. The aim of present prospective follow up study was to assess the prognostic value for pregnancy of the PCT in WHO II anovulatory women, ovulatory with clomiphene citrate (CC). Methods: In three centres, we prospectively studied a cohort of women with WHO II anovulation who started ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate. Follow up started immediately after starting ovulation induction and ended at six ovulatory cycles. A PCT was performed in one of the first three ovulatory cycles. The primary outcome measure was ongoing pregnancy rate, defined as a vital intrauterine pregnancy, at least twelve weeks of gestation. Time to pregnancy was censored at the day of the last ovulatory cycle or at start of any other treatment. Kaplan-Meier curves for the occurrence of intra-uterine pregnancy were constructed for women with a positive result of the PCT and for women with a negative result. Log rank tests expressed the associations between PCT and the occurrence of an ongoing pregnancy. Results: We included 251 women and 152 women underwent a PCT. Of these, 135 women had a reliable result of the PCT. A conception within six months after the first ovulatory cycle occurred in 131 (52 %) women and in 74 (49 %) women after PCT. At the PCT, 107 (79 %) showed a positive result and 28 (21 %) showed a negative result. In the PCT group with a positive result we registered 55 clinical pregnancies and 45 ongoing pregnancies (82 %). In the PCT group with a negative result we registered 11 clinical pregnancies and 10 ongoing pregnancies (91 %). Within 6 cycles after the PCT 45 of 107 women (42 %) with a positive PCT and 10 of 45 women (22 %) with a negative PCT reached an ongoing pregnancy (RR 1. 29, 95 %CI 0. 707 – 2. 342). For women with a negative result of the PCT the cumulative pregnancy rate was not statistically significant different with a log rank of 0. 19 compared to women with a positive test. Total, for 99 women the PCT was not performed. Of these women 41 became pregnant before performing the PCT which is 17. 1 % of all women who became ovulatory. The mean total cycles in the positive group was 4. 4 and the mean total cycles in the negative group was 5. 1. With the independent sample t-test no significant difference was found in total cycles between these two groups. Conclusion: Analysis showed no significant difference in chance on clinical and ongoing pregnancy between women with a positive PCT result and a negative PCT result. Even so, {{there was no significant difference}} in time to pregnancy between both groups. Performing a PCT would lead to additional burden to women and additional unnecessary costs. We recommend to not implement the PCT in the general fertility work-up for WHO II anovulatory women. ...|$|E
40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Does the prewash total motile sperm count (TMSC) have {{a better}} {{predictive}} value for spontaneous ongoing pregnancy (SOP) than the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system? SUMMARY ANSWER: The prewash TMSC shows a better correlation with the spontaneous ongoing pregnancy rate (SOPR) than the WHO 2010 classification system. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: According to the WHO classification system, an abnormal semen analysis can be diagnosed as oligozoospermia, astenozoospermia, teratozoospermia or combinations of these and azoospermia. This classification {{is based on the}} fifth percentile cut-off values of a cohort of 1953 men with proven fertility. Although this classification suggests accuracy, the relevance for the prognosis of an infertile couple and the choice of treatment is questionable. The TMSC is obtained by multiplying the sample volume by the density and the percentage of A and B motility spermatozoa. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We analyzed data from a longitudinal cohort study among unselected infertile couples who were referred to three Dutch hospitals between January 2002 and December 2006. Of the total cohort of 2476 infertile couples, only the couples with either male infertility as a single diagnosis or unexplained infertility were included (n = 1177) with a follow-up period of 3 years. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In all couples a semen analysis was performed. Based on the best semen analysis if more tests were performed, couples were grouped according to the WHO classification system and the TMSC range, as described in the Dutch national guidelines for male infertility. The primary outcome measure was the SOPR, which occurred before, during or after treatments, including expectant management, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. After adjustment for the confounding factors (female and male age, duration and type of infertility and result of the <b>postcoital</b> <b>test)</b> the odd ratios (ORs) for risk of SOP for each WHO and TMSC group were calculated. The couples with unexplained infertility were used as reference. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 514 couples did and 663 couples did not achieve a SOP. All WHO groups have a lower SOPR compared with the unexplained group (ORs varying from 0. 136 to 0. 397). Comparing the couples within the abnormal WHO groups, there are no significant differences in SOPR, except when oligoasthenoteratozoospermia is compared with asthenozoospermia [OR 0. 501 (95 % CI 0. 311 - 0. 809) ] and teratozoospermia [OR 0. 499 (95 % CI: 0. 252 - 0. 988) ], and oligoasthenozoospermia is compared with asthenozoospermia [OR 0. 572 (95 % CI: 0. 373 - 0. 877) ]. All TMSC groups have a significantly lower SOPR compared with the unexplained group (ORs varying from 0. 171 to 0. 461). Couples with a TMSC of < 1 x 10 (6) and 1 - 5 x 10 (6) have significantly lower SOPR compared with couples with a TMSC of 5 - 10 x 10 (6) [respectively, OR 0. 371 (95 % CI: 0. 215 - 0. 64) and OR 0. 505 (95 % CI: 0. 307 - 0. 832) ]. LIMITATIONS, REASON FOR CAUTION: To include all SOPs during the follow-up period of 3 years, couples were not censured at the start of treatment. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Roughly, three prognostic groups can be discerned: couples with a TMSC < 5, couples with a TMSC between 5 and 20 and couples with a TMSC of more than 20 x 10 (6) spermatozoa. We suggest using TMSC as the method of choice to express severity of male infertility. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: None...|$|E
