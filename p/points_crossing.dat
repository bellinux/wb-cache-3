2500|$|Routes {{to climb}} to the summit start {{from all of the}} main dales that radiate out from central Lakeland. From Wasdale the {{south-west}} ridge up Gavel Neese provides the obvious, and consequently steep and rough, line to take. This can be finished either via Little Hell Gate, a well named and atrocious scree gully, or more sedately via Beck Head. The walk up Ennerdale is long, except for walkers staying at Black Sail Youth Hostel, and again Beck Head gives access to the summit area. Ascents from Borrowdale or Wasdale can also make use of Sty Head pass, before slogging up the south-east ridge, or the scree-filled Aaron Slack. Finally Gatesgarth (near Buttermere), or the summit of the Honister Pass road can be used as starting <b>points,</b> <b>crossing</b> the high hinterland of Grey Knotts and Brandreth to arrive at Windy Gap or Beck Head.|$|E

50|$|Downstream {{from the}} mill was a sawmill fed from a lade which took its {{water from a}} dam built on a natural dyke across the Annick. These dykes, bands of {{especially}} hard rock, are found at several <b>points</b> <b>crossing</b> the river and many were exploited {{as the basis for}} dams, such as also occurred at Dalgarven Mill on the River Garnock. The course and position of most of these dykes is well known as they were a major consideration in the exploitation of coal. Nothing remains of the sawmill other than a vague indication of the lade and the exit onto the river. It had a right-angle turn on its lade, which is a very unusual feature. The point at which the lade changes direction may have been the site of the old mill marked on the 1832 map, but not afterwards, and the lade was then later reused for the sawmill.|$|E
50|$|In {{the time}} under the {{leadership}} of Zürich, Winterthur's economic freedom was restricted. It lost many of their market rights and the right to trade in some goods. This ended in 1798, when Napoleonic troops liberated the town. On 27 May 1799, it was the site of the Battle of Winterthur between elements of the French Army of the Danube and the elements of the Habsburg army, commanded by Friedrich, Baron von Hotze during the War of the Second Coalition, in the French Revolutionary Wars.

50|$|The {{southern}} route or Karakoram route {{was mainly}} a single route running from China through the Karakoram mountains, where it persists {{in modern times}} as the international paved road connecting Pakistan and China as the Karakoram Highway. It then set off westwards, but with southward spurs enabling the journey {{to be completed by}} sea from various <b>points.</b> <b>Crossing</b> the high mountains, it passed through northern Pakistan, over the Hindu Kush mountains, and into Afghanistan, rejoining the northern route near Merv, Turkmenistan. From Merv, it followed a nearly straight line west through mountainous northern Iran, Mesopotamia, and the northern tip of the Syrian Desert to the Levant, where Mediterranean trading ships plied regular routes to Italy, while land routes went either north through Anatolia or south to North Africa. Another branch road travelled from Herat through Susa to Charax Spasinu {{at the head of the}} Persian Gulf and across to Petra and on to Alexandria and other eastern Mediterranean ports from where ships carried the cargoes to Rome.|$|E

5000|$|The Innerbelt {{portion of}} State Route 59 in Akron {{is not well}} utilized. Designed after almost all other highway {{projects}} in Akron were completed, the Innerbelt was envisioned as a 21.5 mi stretch; however the only portion that was ever built was a 2.24 mi stretch near Akron’s downtown. The freeway is designed with 6 lanes (with right of way for eight). It includes two collector streets along the entire corridor which, combined, are at some points {{as wide as the}} freeway itself. The interchages are long, at some <b>points</b> <b>crossing</b> each other, so that additional overpasses are required for the ramps [...] The ramps connecting it to Interstate 76/Interstate 77, opened October 8, 1986, more than a decade after {{most of the rest of}} the highway opened, only turn to the west, so traffic can only enter the Innerbelt if traveling east on the interstate and from the Innerbelt, vehicles can only exit west onto the interstate. While the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is currently evaluating changing this design, for now drivers need to take regular roads to make the connection. This was a financial concession when the southernmost part of the Innerbelt was built. The connection to the Northern Freeway (State Route 8) was never made, and a temporary link with Martin Luther King Blvd./Perkins St. became permanent.|$|E

40|$|Multiple line nodes in energy-band gaps {{are found}} in semimetals {{preserving}} mirror-reflection symmetry. We classify possible configurations of multiple line nodes with crossing <b>points</b> (<b>crossing</b> line nodes) under point-group symmetry. Taking the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) into account, we also classify topological phase transitions from crossing-line-node Dirac semimetals to other topological phases, e. g., topological insulators and point-node semimetals. This study enables one to find crossing-line-node semimetal materials and their behavior {{in the presence of}} SOI from the band structure in the absence of SOI without detailed calculations. As an example, the theory applies to hexagonal rare-earth trihydrides with the HoD 3 structure and clarifies that it is a crossing-line-node Dirac semimetal hosting three line nodes.

40|$|Numerical {{tools for}} the {{analysis}} of complex 3 -D mixing devices were developed Calculations are based on the finite-element method. The flow calculation is combined with that of pathlines for a fairly large number of material points; along these pathlines, relevant kinematic variables, which are then subjected to a statistical treatment, are evaluated. These numerical techniques are applied to the analysis of a Kenics mixer. It is assumed that the geometry is periodic in the axial direction, that is, that the miter contains an infinite number of blades; the finite-element analysis may then be completed on a single wavelength of the geometry. To test the accuracy of the three-dimensional calculation, a Kenics device was mounted in order to mit clays of different colors, and photographs of experimental cross-sections were compared with numerical results showing concentration maps.
