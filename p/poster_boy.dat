500|$|With {{much of the}} {{criticism}} placed on the club during his first year, the scrutiny turned to Watts {{during the next few}} seasons as it was deemed that he was not living up to his potential or the public's expectations. This was partly due to Watts displaying a lack of urgency and work-rate on the field according to former players Wayne Carey, Garry Lyon and coach Mick Malthouse. He played the early parts of his career in different positions, which Garry Lyon wrote led to an instability in his game and was a reason for why he, at times, lacked confidence and self-belief in his abilities. He was often very quickly scrutinised when he played poorly, and was the first to player to be blamed when the team played a bad match, which led to Paul Roos questioning why the public had such a fixation with Watts' form. He was also plagued with being known as the [...] "great white hope" [...] {{as soon as he was}} drafted and due to the club trailing near the bottom of the ladder from 2009 to 2015 and experiencing failed rebuilds, Watts was symbolically seen as a <b>poster</b> <b>boy</b> for Melbourne's failures during this period.|$|E

500|$|Hans Namuth was not {{initially}} {{interested in the}} work of Jackson Pollock, but was convinced by his teacher Alexey Brodovitch that Pollock was an important painter. [...] In July 1950, Namuth approached Pollock and asked to photograph the artist working in his studio. [...] Pollock agreed, encouraged by his wife, Lee Krasner, who was {{aware of the importance of}} media coverage. [...] The resulting images helped to demystify Pollock's famous [...] "drip" [...] technique of painting, revealing it to be a deliberative process rather than a random splashing of paint.

[...] Not satisfied with black and white stills, Namuth wanted to create a color film that managed to focus on Pollock and his painting at the same time, partially because he found more interest in Pollock's image than in his art. [...] His solution was to have Pollock paint on a large sheet of glass as Namuth filmed from underneath the work. [...] As Namuth could not afford professional lighting, the film was shot outside Pollock's Long Island home. [...] This documentary (co-produced with Paul Falkenberg) is considered one of the most influential for artists.|$|E
