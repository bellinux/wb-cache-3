40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{different}} directives regulating {{the protection of}} pregnancy and maternity of workers, {{as well as the}} abundant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in that effect, in order to reveal not only the degree of harmonisation achieved but also the possible failings of the current protection system. Directive 76 / 207 /EEC on equal treatment for men and women at work bans discrimination on the grounds of sex as regards access to employment, working conditions and conditions governing dismissal. This Directive makes it clear that measures concerning the protection of pregnancy and maternity, whose paradigmatic case is the maternity leave, do not infringe on the principle of equal treatment. Having established this, the Directive has been fundamental in that, based on it, the CJEU has been punishing discriminatory behaviours regarding pregnancy and maternity leave, considering them as directly discriminatory on the grounds of sex, given that they can only affect women. Directive 92 / 85 /EEC concerning the safety and health of pregnant workers is, in itself, a <b>permitted</b> <b>exception</b> to the principle of equal treatment. This Directive establishes a 14 weeks’ maternity leave for employed women with the following guarantees: maintenance of income and other rights inherent to the work contract, the prohibition on dismissal from the beginning of pregnancy {{to the end of the}} maternity leave. In addition, the new Directive 2010 / 41 /EU on equal treatment of the self-employed establishes a 14 -weeks maternity benefit for female self-employed workers and female spouses and life partners. Lastly, this paper critically analyses the maternity leave within the European Union, both in relation to its legal basis used and objectives, as well as with regards to the perpetuation of the role of women as newborns carers. status: publishe...|$|E

5000|$|Appreciating the {{difficulties}} encountered by legal expert systems developers in adequately representing legal knowledge {{can assist in}} appreciating the shortcomings of digital rights management technologies. [...] Some academics believe future digital rights management systems may become sophisticated enough to <b>permit</b> <b>exceptions</b> to copyright law. [...] To this end SHYSTER's attempt to model “authorization sic” in the Copyright Act {{can be viewed as}} pioneering work in this field. The term “authorization sic” is undefined in the Copyright Act. Consequently, a number of cases have been before the courts seeking answers as to what conduct amounts to authorisation. The main contexts in which the issue has arisen are analogous to <b>permitted</b> <b>exceptions</b> to copyright currently prevented by most digital rights management technologies: “home taping of recorded materials, photocopying in educational institutions and performing works in public”. [...] When applied to one case concerning compact cassettes, SHYSTER successfully agreed that Amstrad did not authorise the infringement.|$|R
