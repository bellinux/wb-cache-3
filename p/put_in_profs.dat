50|$|Václav Turek {{studied at}} the National Graphic School under professors J. Vodrážka and K. Müller and {{afterwards}} at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague (AVU) <b>in</b> <b>prof.</b> Vlastimil Rada's studio (1945-1950). His generational colleagues were Oldřich Oplt, Josef Jíra, Ladislav Čepelák, Vladimír Tesař, Bohdan Kopecký and others. In the years of 1962-1965 he got an internal research fellowship at AVU, worked as an assistant <b>in</b> <b>prof.</b> V. Rada's studio and eventually <b>in</b> <b>prof.</b> Karel Souček's atelier. From {{the beginning of the}} 70s until his death in 1988 he led a separate figure drawing class (the so-called “Evening Nude”) at AVU. Hundreds of students went through his hands, which not only gained the basics of this fundamental discipline from his resourceful and intensely run classes but also an important life lesson. His abilities to pin down substance, point out a mistake, adjust a lost aspect with one stroke of charcoal and encourage a fight {{at the beginning of a}} struggle were proverbial and admirable. He never joined the communist party, which together with his sister's emigration made any kind of a career promotion impossible. He spent the whole of his pedagogical path as a senior assistant, perhaps the only and longest serving one in the history of the Fine Art Academy in Prague.|$|R
