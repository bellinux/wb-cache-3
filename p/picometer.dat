5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as <b>picometer</b> knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{picotechnology}} is a portmanteau of <b>picometer</b> and technology, {{intended to}} parallel the term nanotechnology.|$|E
50|$|The {{atomic radius}} is the {{distance}} from the atomic nucleus to the outermost stable electron orbital in an atom that is at equilibrium. The atomic radii tend to decrease across a period from left to right. The atomic radius usually increases while going down a group due to the addition of a new energy level (shell). However, atomic radii tend to increase diagonally, since the number of electrons has a larger effect than the sizeable nucleus. For example, lithium (145 <b>picometer)</b> has a smaller atomic radius than magnesium (150 <b>picometer).</b>|$|E
50|$|The atomic radii of {{the carbon}} group {{elements}} tend to increase with increasing atomic number. Carbon's atomic radius is 77 <b>picometers,</b> silicon's is 118 <b>picometers,</b> germanium's is 123 <b>picometers,</b> tin's is 141 <b>picometers,</b> and lead's is 175 <b>picometers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{radius of}} atoms range from 25 <b>picometers</b> (hydrogen) to 260 <b>picometers</b> (caesium). One picolight-year is about nine {{kilometers}} (six miles).|$|R
50|$|The selenium-sulfur {{bond length}} is about 220 <b>picometers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Near-field {{microscopy}} refers {{more generally}} to any technique using the near-field (see below) to achieve nanoscale, subwavelength resolution. For example, dual polarization interferometry has <b>picometer</b> {{resolution in the}} vertical plane above the waveguide surface.|$|E
5000|$|In {{one study}} [...] a disilene is {{prepared}} by an intramolecular coupling of a 1,1-dibromosilane with potassium graphite. The silicon double bond in the resulting compound has a bond length of 227 <b>picometer</b> (second largest ever found) with trans-bent angles 33° and 31° (by X-ray diffraction).|$|E
5000|$|The picometre (International {{spelling}} as {{used by the}} International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: pm) or <b>picometer</b> (American spelling) is a unit {{of length}} in the metric system, equal to , or one trillionth (...) of a metre, which is the SI base unit of length.|$|E
50|$|Barium oxide (BaO), for instance, {{which has}} the NaCl {{structure}} and therefore the same Madelung constant, has a bond radius of 275 <b>picometers</b> and a lattice energy of -3054 kJ/mol, while sodium chloride (NaCl) has a bond radius of 283 <b>picometers</b> and a lattice energy of -786 kJ/mol.|$|R

5000|$|The boron atom {{in these}} barrelene {{compounds}} is pyramidalized (the {{sum of the}} C-B-C angles is 311° not 327°) leading to even greater Lewis acid strength. This {{is evident from the}} unusual small B-N bond length of 158 <b>picometer</b> compared to 165pm for ordinary B-N bonds in borane-pyridine adducts.|$|E
50|$|The novel MEMS {{cantilever}} approach detects pressure {{changes in}} a photoacoustic cell. High sensitivity is achieved by using a cantilever pressure sensor that is over hundred times more sensitive compared to a membrane, which is conventionally used in photoacoustic spectroscopy. A laser-based readout interferometer is able to accurately measure displacement from well under a <b>picometer</b> up to millimeters.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, trioxidane was {{observed}} experimentally by microwave spectroscopy in a supersonic jet. The molecule {{exists in a}} skewed structure, with an oxygen-oxygen-oxygen-hydrogen dihedral angle of 81.8°. The oxygen-oxygen bond lengths of 142.8 <b>picometer</b> are slightly shorter than the 146.4 pm oxygen-oxygen bonds in hydrogen peroxide. Various dimeric and trimeric forms also seem to exist. It is slightly more acidic than hydrogen peroxide, dissociating into H+ and OOOH−.|$|E
50|$|Thiols and {{alcohols}} {{have similar}} connectivity. Because sulfur {{is a larger}} element than oxygen, the C-S bond lengths, typically around 180 <b>picometers</b> in length, is about 40 <b>picometers</b> longer than a typical C-O bond. The C-S-H angles approach 90° whereas the angle for the C-O-H group are more open. In the solid or liquids, the hydrogen-bonding between individual thiol groups is weak, the main cohesive force being van der Waals interactions between the highly polarizable divalent sulfur centers.|$|R
50|$|A stable {{compound}} with a BO {{triple bond}} is trans-(PCy3)2PtBr(BO) with platinum coordinated to the BO unit. In this compound the BO bond length is 120 <b>picometers.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{the gap is}} formed, its width {{can often}} be {{controlled}} by bending the substrate that the metal contacts lie on. The gap can be controlled to a precision of <b>picometers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2012, a single-atom {{transistor}} was fabricated using a phosphorus atom {{bound to}} a silicon surface (between two significantly larger electrodes). This transistor {{could be said}} to be a 360 <b>picometer</b> transistor, twice the van der Waals radius of a phosphorus atom; though its covalent radius bound to silicon is likely smaller. Making transistors smaller than this will require either using elements with smaller atomic radii, or using subatomic particles—like electrons or protons—as functional transistors.|$|E
50|$|Millipore's {{cellulose}} ester filters were used widely in early experiments to regenerate transected nerves in the peripheral nervous system, especially in experiments of sciatic nerve transection in rodents. Today, the Millipore filters consist of nitrocellulose or polycarbonate membrane nucleopore filters ranging from pore size of 0.2 μm (micrometer) up to 20 µm. The smallest {{of these are}} sometimes also measured in pore width of 200 nm (nanometer). Some specialty applications are even measured in the <b>picometer</b> range (pm) of pore-size.|$|E
5000|$|Unit cell {{parameters}} (a,b,c,α,β,γ) can be {{computed from}} the final relaxed positions of the ions. [...] In a NaCl calculation, the final position of the Na ion might be (0,0,0) in <b>picometer</b> Cartesian coordinates and the final position of the Cl ion might be (282,282,282). From this, {{we see that the}} lattice constant would be 584 pm. For non-orthorhombic systems, the determination of cell parameters might be more complicated, but many ab-initio numerical packages have utilities to make this calculation simpler.|$|E

25|$|In {{graphite}} perchlorate, planar {{layers of}} carbon atoms are 794 <b>picometers</b> apart, separated by ClO4− ions. Cathodic reduction of graphite perchlorate {{is analogous to}} heating KC8, {{which leads to a}} sequential elimination of HClO4.|$|R
40|$|The charge {{distribution}} in atoms with closed electron shells is spherically symmetric, whereas atoms with partially filled shells can form covalent bonds with pointed lobes of increased charge density. Covalent bonding in the bulk can also affect surface atoms, leading to four tiny humps spaced {{by less than}} 100 <b>picometers</b> in the charge density of adatoms on a (001) tungsten surface. We imaged these {{charge distribution}}s by means of atomic force microscopy {{with the use of}} a light-atom probe (a graphite atom), which directly measured high-order force derivatives of its interaction with a tungsten tip. This process revealed features with a lateral distance of only 77 <b>picometers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Groundbreaking {{for the new}} {{improved}} BESSY II synchrotron {{source in}} Adlershof took place on 4 July 1994, and the facility was inaugurated on 4 September 1998. The project cost was an equivalent of approximately 100 million Euros. The successor of BESSY I has a circumference of 240 m, providing 46 beam lines, and offers a multi-faceted mixture of experimental opportunities (undulator, wiggler and dipole sources) with excellent energy resolution. The combination of brightness and time resolution enables both femtosecond time and <b>picometer</b> spatial resolutions.|$|E
50|$|Kenji Ohmori {{has succeeded}} in {{designing}} and visualizing spatiotemporal images given by the interference of matter waves of atoms in a molecule with <b>picometer</b> and femtosecond resolution 1,2. The precision of this processing is the highest to date, {{higher than that of}} the current nanotechnology by three orders of magnitudes. This ultrahigh-precision processing has been implemented with the temporal oscillations of laser electric fields engineered with attosecond precision and imprinted on the matter waves of atoms and electrons in a molecule. He has utilized this technique to develop a molecular computer in which a single 0.3-nanometer-size molecule can calculate 1000 times faster than the current fastest supercomputer 3,4.|$|E
50|$|Picoscience is a {{term used}} by some futurists to refer to {{structuring}} of matter on a true <b>picometer</b> scale. Picotechnology was described as involving the alteration of the structure and chemical properties of individual atoms, typically through the manipulation of energy states of electrons within an atom to produce metastable (or otherwise stabilized) states with unusual properties, producing some form of exotic atom. Analogous transformations known {{to exist in the}} real world are redox chemistry, which can manipulate the oxidation states of atoms; excitation of electrons to metastable excited states as with lasers and some forms of saturable absorption; and the manipulation of the states of excited electrons in Rydberg atoms to encode information. However, none of these processes produces the types of exotic atoms described by futurists.|$|E

50|$|It {{is a small}} carbon cluster first spectroscopically {{observed}} in the beginning 20th century in {{the tail of a}} comet by William Huggins and subsequently identified in stellar atmospheres. Tricarbon can be found in interstellar space and can be produced in the laboratory by a process called laser ablation. Small carbon clusters like tricarbon and dicarbon are regarded as soot precursors and are implicated in the formation of certain industrial diamonds and in the formation of fullerenes. The ground state molecular geometry of tricarbon has been identified as linear via its characteristic symmetric and antisymmetric stretching and bending vibrational modes and bears bond lengths of 129 to 130 <b>picometer</b> corresponding to those of alkenes. The ionization potential is determined experimentally at 11 to 13.5 electronvolts. In contrast to the linear tricarbon molecule the C3+ cation is bent.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a basic Michelson laser interferometer experiment for the undergraduate teaching laboratory that achieves <b>picometer</b> sensitivity in a hands-on, table-top instrument. In {{addition to providing}} an introduction to interferometer physics and optical hardware, the experiment also focuses on precision measurement techniques including servo control, signal modulation, phase-sensitive detection, and different types of signal averaging. Students examine these techniques {{in a series of}} steps that take them from micron-scale sensitivity using direct fringe counting to <b>picometer</b> sensitivity using a modulated signal and phase-sensitive signal averaging. After students assemble, align, and characterize the interferometer, they then use it to measure nanoscale motions of a simple harmonic oscillator system as a substantive example of how laser interferometry can be used as an effective tool in experimental science...|$|E

40|$|The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) {{requires}} fringe measurements to {{the level}} of <b>picometers</b> in order to produce astrometric data at the micro-arc-second level. To be more specific, it is necessary to measure both the position of the starlight central fringe and the change in the internal optical path of the interferometer to a few hundreds of <b>picometers.</b> The internal path is measured with a small heterodyne metrology beam, whereas the starlight fringe position is estimated with a CCD sampling a large concentric annular beam. One major challenge for SIM is to align the metrology beam with the starlight beam to keep the consistency between these two sensors at the system level while articulating the instrument optics over the field of view...|$|R
