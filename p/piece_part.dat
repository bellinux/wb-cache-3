In this sense, the Behistun inscription is not only a significant architectural work, but also a significant linguistic tool, as important to the old world understanding of ancient Persia and its languages, as Rosetta Stone is to understanding ancient Egypt and its languages.|$|E
50|$|For <b>piece</b> <b>part</b> FMECA, {{failure mode}} data may be {{obtained}} from databases such as RAC FMD - 91 or RAC FMD - 97. These databases provide not only the failure modes, but also the failure mode ratios. For example: Each function or <b>piece</b> <b>part</b> is then listed in matrix form with one row for each failure mode. Because FMECA usually involves very large data sets, a unique identifier must be assigned to each item (function or <b>piece</b> <b>part),</b> and to each failure mode of each item.|$|E
50|$|FMECA may be {{performed}} at the functional or <b>piece</b> <b>part</b> level. Functional FMECA considers the effects of failure at the functional block level, such as a power supply or an amplifier. <b>Piece</b> <b>part</b> FMECA considers the effects of individual component failures, such as resistors, transistors, microcircuits, or valves. A <b>piece</b> <b>part</b> FMECA requires far more effort, but provides the benefit of better estimates of probabilities of occurrence. However, Functional FMEAs can {{be performed}} much earlier, may help to better structure the complete risk assessment and provide other type of insight in mitigation options. The analyses are complementary.|$|E

50|$|Electronic {{packages}} are sometimes made by machining solid blocks of metal, usually aluminum, into complex shapes.

5000|$|Pure, logic-only gate-array {{design is}} rarely {{implemented}} by circuit designers today, having been replaced {{almost entirely by}} field-programmable devices, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which can be programmed by the user and thus offer minimal tooling charges non-recurring engineering, only marginally increased <b>piece</b> <b>part</b> cost, and comparable performance. Today, gate arrays are evolving into structured ASICs that consist of a large IP core like a CPU, DSP unit, peripherals, standard interfaces, integrated memories SRAM, and a block of reconfigurable, uncommited logic. This shift is largely because ASIC devices are capable of integrating such large blocks of system functionality and [...] "system-on-a-chip" [...] requires far more than just logic blocks.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{is a study}} of an alternative acquisition program for <b>piece</b> <b>parts</b> that support readiness degrader aviation components. Components with outstanding <b>piece</b> <b>parts</b> with an acquisition lead times of greater than 45 days migrate to an awaiting parts status termed a supply condition code G. The U. S. Navy currently has more than 500 million dollars worth of components in C condition with more than 76 million dollars worth of <b>piece</b> <b>parts</b> outstanding. The current average time components at the Naval Aviation Depot North Island (NADEP-M), California spends in C condition is 190 days. The major focus of the thesis {{is the development of}} an alternative acquisition system to investigate the effect of reduced acquisition lead times on repair cycle times and component inventory levels. The alternative acquisition system would reduce the acquisition lead time on all <b>piece</b> <b>parts</b> that are directly attributable to more than 20 % of the applicable C condition components from an average of 199 days to only 60 days. This proposed change would reduce Logistics Delay Time (LDT) for the steady state components an average 32. 4 %, the average Repair Turnaround Time (RTAT) would be reduced an average 14. 5 % and the inventory levels would be reduced by 53 units or 4. 42 million dollars. The comparison of the costs of the priority purchase system to the benefits indicates that for every one dollar invested in priority purchasing would result in 28 dollars in savings through reduced inventory levels.

5000|$|In a {{bottom-up}} approach, {{the individual}} base {{elements of the}} system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a [...] "seed" [...] model, by which the beginnings are small, but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses [...] "objects" [...] to design applications and computer programs. In mechanical engineering with software programs such as Pro/ENGINEER, Solidworks, and Autodesk Inventor users can design products as pieces {{not part of the}} whole and later add those pieces together to form assemblies like building with LEGO.

50|$|In this step, {{the major}} {{system to be}} {{analyzed}} is defined and partitioned into an indentured hierarchy such as systems, subsystems or equipment, units or subassemblies, and <b>piece</b> <b>parts.</b> Functional descriptions are created for the systems and allocated to the subsystems, covering all operational modes and mission phases.|$|R

50|$|The {{analysis}} may {{be performed}} at the functional level until the design has matured sufficiently to identify specific hardware that will perform the functions; then the analysis should be extended to the hardware level. When performing the hardware level FMECA, interfacing hardware {{is considered to be}} operating within specification. In addition, each part failure postulated is considered to be the only failure in the system (i.e., it is a single failure analysis). In addition to the FMEAs done on systems to evaluate the impact lower level failures have on system operation, several other FMEAs are done. Special attention is paid to interfaces between systems and in fact at all functional interfaces. The purpose of these FMEAs is to assure that irreversible physical and/or functional damage is not propagated across the interface as a result of failures in one of the interfacing units. These analyses are done to the <b>piece</b> <b>part</b> level for the circuits that directly interface with the other units. The FMEA can be accomplished without a CA, but a CA requires that the FMEA has previously identified system level critical failures. When both steps are done, the total process is called a FMECA.|$|E
50|$|The New York Times (Oct. 7, 1955) reported:"First rescuers {{to reach}} the scene said they had found about 50 bodies strewn along a 300-foot course down {{the face of the}} mountain. Only a tail <b>piece,</b> <b>part</b> of the {{fuselage}} and a wing of the plane had been located at mid-afternoon by rescuers who fought snowdrifts and a howling wind on the 12,005-foot Medicine Bow Peak. The mountain is about 40 miles west of here in the Snowy Range. The front part of the split plane was believed to have fallen down {{the other side of the}} peak. Another rescue group went up the north face of the mountain from Rawlins. The operation was suspended this evening because of a snowstorm and darkness.The scene was marked by two huge patches of oil where the plane's engines apparently struck about 50-75 feet from the peak. The wreckage then slid down the steep incline in two ravines, much of it coming to rest 300 feet down on a small glacier. I don't see how there would be a chance of anyone surviving, said Capt. Conine, Wyoming Air National Guard jet pilot, who was one of the first to spot the wreckage.A C-47 was sent from Cheyenne, Wyo., to circle the peak, particularly the northwest side, to search for the front portion of the plane. The Civil Aeronautics Administration said planes were unable to fly near the mountain because of the weather conditions.|$|E

A <b>piece</b> <b>part</b> design approach being one where individual pieces are developed to their finished state having to meet certain interface and human engineering requirements without much consideration to the final product as a whole. A holistic design approach being one where the final product is evaluated early and frequently during the design process, and individual parts are developed with consideration to how they interact a whole,and how they interact with the user and environment.
