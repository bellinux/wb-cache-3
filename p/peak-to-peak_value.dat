40|$|The main {{dynamic loads}} on a tidal turbine {{are due to}} the tidal current variation, turbulence, wave-current {{interaction}} and wake from the tower and upstream turbines. The design of the turbine is highly dependent on the dynamic loads acting on the turbine's blades and its structure. Cyclic loading and unloading of any material {{over a period of}} time will lead to fatigue and structural damage. In this work dimensioning loads for NTNU's 1 MW reference tidal turbine are calculated due to the vertical no-slip current velocity profile, wave-current interaction, the horizontal and vertical velocity component due to the waves, turbulence and the tidal wave. Based on mathematical models the dimensioning loads for the turbine are calculated with a Matlab code written for this work. The influence of each of the components causing a dynamic load on the tidal turbine blades is evaluated and analyzed with the rainflow counting algorithm, which can be used for fatigue analysis. Results from Matlab calculations are compared to experimental results in order to validate the Matlab code. In the comparison the trends are the same for calculation and experimental results, oscillating curves with the same period. It is noticed that in large waves the Matlab code predicts very well the dynamic loads in terms of mean and <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>values.</b> For the thrust force and the shaft torque the horizontal component of the velocity due to the waves has the largest influence on the <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>values</b> and the turbulence induces a high number of cycles. For the pitch moment as well the horizontal component due to the waves has the largest influence on the <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>values,</b> but also the vertical component has a certain influence. For the pitch moment the consistently main oscillations inducing cyclic loading are due to the vertical no-slip current velocity profile. This is also the case for the yaw moment, but here the vertical wave component has the largest influence on the <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>values.</b> For calculation with the tidal wave it is noticed that higher velocities gives higher maximum values. The Matlab code is a reliable and fast tool. Despite the simplifications done in the calculations, it calculates the dimensioning loads for a tidal turbine with a good accuracy. </p...|$|R

Consider a tire supporting a 1,000 pound load running on a perfectly smooth roadway. It would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. A variation between 995 pounds and 1003 pounds would be characterized as an 8-pound radial force variation, or RFV.

50|$|The <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>value</b> is used, for example, when {{choosing}} rectifiers for power supplies, or when estimating the maximum voltage that insulation must withstand. Some common voltmeters are calibrated for RMS amplitude, but {{respond to the}} average value of a rectified waveform. Many digital voltmeters and all moving coil meters are in this category. The RMS calibration is only correct for a sine wave input since the ratio between peak, average and RMS values is dependent on waveform. If the wave shape being measured is greatly different from a sine wave, the relationship between RMS and average value changes. True RMS-responding meters were used in radio frequency measurements, where instruments measured the heating effect in a resistor to measure current. The advent of microprocessor controlled meters capable of calculating RMS by sampling the waveform has made true RMS measurement commonplace.|$|E
50|$|Insofar as {{the lateral}} force {{is the one}} acting {{side-to-side}} along the tire axle, lateral force variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load.

As the tire rotates it may exert a lateral force {{on the order of}} 25 pounds, causing steering pull in one direction. It would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. A variation between 22 pounds and 26 pounds would be characterized as a 4-pound lateral force variation, or LFV. LFV can be expressed as a <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>value,</b> which is the maximum minus minimum value, or any harmonic value as described above.

We measured following diastolic heart dimensions: thickness of interventricular septum (IVSd,) left ventricular (LV) posterior wall (LVPWd), and LV internal diameter (LVIDd) on the group of 31 hypertensive patients with and without LV hypertrophy (age 52 ± 12 y, 12 women). We calculated relative wall thickness (RWT), LV mass (LVM) and LVM index (LVMI). The 24 – lead system after Barr was used to record and construct mean IIM QRS as well as IIM of QRS divided into thirds of equal length (QRS 1 / 3, QRS 2 / 3, QRS 3 / 3). We used regression analysis to compare maximum, minimum and <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>values</b> of all IIMs with ECHO parameters. Only 14 of 72 regression analyses were significant (p < 0. 05) with correlation coefficients 0. 365 < |r | < 0. 667.

Internal masses generate internal reaction forces that constitute an internal mechanical stimulus that {{may contribute to}} cause segmental displacements, i. e. body sway. Thus, gaining knowledge about the amplitude and direction of these reaction forces would contribute to gain insights into the mechanisms that influence the maintenance of balance and into its control. The 3 -D force vector that acts on the body centre of mass (COM) and {{is associated with the}} transient blood movement at each cardiac cycle was assessed in a population sample of 20 young adults during the maintenance of a quiet up-right pasture. Typical patterns of the three components of this force vector were identified. Relevant parameters were selected and submitted to sample statistics. For a number of them, linear correlation with subject-specific parameters was found. The antero-posterior force component was characterised by a triphasic major wave, the peaks of which had values up to 0. 40 N. The vertical component showed a repeatable triphasic wave with <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>values</b> in the range 1. 3 - 3. 0 N.

Using numerical simulations, King and Watson (2010) showed that even time-constant multipath effects can result in time-correlated multipath-induced errors under time-variable GPS geometry, as seen in reality. It is also probable that time-variable surface reflectivity changes due to soil moisture (Larson et al., 2010) or vegetation growth (Small et al., 2010) cause temporal changes in the multipath effects and hence result in time-correlated multipath-induced errors.

This expresses the transmission error theoretically from a quasi-infinite elastic model, which is composed of springs with stiffness specific to the gears.

The first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles were investigated at contraction levels of 2 % and 5 % of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force. A third contraction was performed by selective activation of a single MU with surface MU action potential visual feedback provided to the subject. At 5 % MVC, the mean (+/-standard error) single MU MMG <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>value</b> was 11. 0 +/- 1. 8 mm s(- 2) (N= 17) and 32. 3 +/- 6. 5 mm s(- 2) (N= 20) for the FDI and ADM muscles, respectively. The peak of the twitch force was, at the same contraction level, 7. 41 +/- 1. 34 mN and 14. 42 +/- 2. 92 mN, for the FDI and ADM muscles, respectively.

40|$|Jitter is a {{phenomenon}} troubling many designers of highspeed interfaces. It reduces available timing margin, limits transmission distance between a transmitter and a receiver, and increases system cost by demanding better performing and more expensive interconnects. LVDS interfaces are not spared from these ill effects as they now operate at bit rates exceeding the 3 Gbps mark. National Semiconductor has developed a family of LVDS signal conditioners that mitigates transmission line losses, reduces data-dependent jitter and maximizes noise margin.
