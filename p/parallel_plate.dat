Thus, suspended cement and graphene particles start to settle down and provide great hindrance against the deformation of cement paste. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sedimentation or creaming will be a key factor in indicating the higher plastic viscosities for <b>parallel</b> <b>plates</b> (Nehdi and Rahman 2004; Barnes 2000).|$|R

30|$|It {{was found}} from the {{experimental}} results that concentric cylinders exhibit high yield stress {{as compared with}} <b>parallel</b> <b>plates.</b> In case of <b>parallel</b> <b>plates</b> due to less gap and more spread diameter, flocculation structures break quickly which resulted in lower yield stress. Ferraris (1999) computed the gap in concrete by using mathematical model developed by Garboczi and Bentz (1997) and found the average value of gap is between 0.16 and 0.22  mm. However, concentric cylinders, normally estimate the rheological properties at large gap i.e. seven times of estimated gap, therefore, it leads to measurement of the bulk values of cement paste and is not the correct values in accordance to concrete rheology (Ferraris 1999). Hung et al. (2015) performed experimental work on asphalt rubber binder and measured its rheology with both concentric cylinder and <b>parallel</b> <b>plates.</b> They found {{no significant difference between}} two geometries. It was noticed that the authors used very large gap i.e. 2  mm in <b>parallel</b> <b>plates,</b> due to which, the difference with concentric cylinders vanishes. Therefore, it can be concluded that <b>parallel</b> <b>plates</b> are suitable for cement paste as it measures the rheological properties with the realistic approach (Ferraris 1999).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we are giving}} a {{quantitative}} description of two different configurations for noncontact gears. We consider the solutions from a perturbative calculation for two semitransparent <b>parallel</b> <b>plates</b> and concentric cylinders both with corrugations on the inner surfaces. In the case of corrugated <b>parallel</b> <b>plates</b> we discuss results from first- and second-order perturbation calculation in the corrugation amplitudes and we will concentrate on the first-order perturbation for {{the case of the}} corrugated concentric cylinders (the second order calculation is under study), both for the weak and strong couplings. We compare the perturbative results with the results from the PFA and an exact weak coupling calculation. 1. Introduction. When two <b>parallel</b> <b>plates</b> with corrugations are situated close to each other, besides the usual Casimir attraction that takes place between them [1], there exists another contribution to the attraction that depends on the corrugations of the surface of the plates and therefore, on the non-normal coordinates (in the case of the <b>parallel</b> <b>plates</b> this coordinate is along the paralle...|$|R

30|$|Standard error {{values were}} {{calculated}} using Eq. (7) {{for the various}} rheological models. These values are given in Appendix Table  16 for an in-depth analysis of reader. A higher value predicted by the mathematical model represents that flow curve and mathematical model curve {{are not in the}} match. It was observed that HB and Modified Bingham models showed the lower standard error, whereas, the Bingham and Casson models displayed higher values. M 0 c, M 0 a, GM 10, GM 5 - 60, GM 10 c, GM 10 - 0, GM 10 - 30 and GM 10 - 60 mixes show the maximum standard error values for all mathematical models in <b>parallel</b> <b>plates.</b> However, in concentric cylinders, M 0 S and M 0 - 60 estimated the highest values for the standard error for all rheological models. Generally, the standard error values predicted by rheological models were found lower for the concentric cylinders compared to the <b>parallel</b> <b>plates.</b> According to Hung et al. (2015) due to same diameter of upper and lower <b>parallel</b> <b>plates,</b> results will be linear. In <b>parallel</b> <b>plates,</b> linear mathematical models i.e. modified Bingham and Bingham model estimated the lower standard error values in comparison to the Herschel–Bulkley and Casson models. As modified Bingham model have the characteristics of both Bingham and Herschel–Bulkley model (Feys et al. 2013) therefore, for <b>parallel</b> <b>plates</b> it predicted the flow behaviour more accurately. In concentric cylinders, nonlinearity is prominent due to the geometry of the apparatus. Hence HB model and Casson model estimated the lower standard error values. It can be concluded that for <b>parallel</b> <b>plates</b> Modified Bingham, and for concentric cylinders, HB, is the more appropriate model to predict the flow behaviour of the graphene based cement pastes.|$|R
