40|$|Objective To {{review the}} {{technique}} and outcome of <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy</b> or urethral perineostomy {{and to identify}} factors related to the procedure failure. Material and methods We studied 17 patients who underwent <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy</b> between 2009 - 2013 in a single hospital. Success was defined as no need for additional surgical treatment or urethral dilatation. We reviewed the clinical data related to age, weight, previous urethral surgery, diabetes, hypertension, ischemic cardiopathy, lichen sclerosus and other causes and studied their association with the procedure failure (univariate analysis). We completed the analysis with a multivariate test based on binary regression. Results The average follow-up was 39. 41 months. From all the causes, we found Lichen Sclerosus in 35 %, idiopathic etiology in 29 % and prior hypospadia repair in 18 %. Postoperative failure occurred in 3 patients, with a final success of 82. 4 %. The binary regression model showed as independent risk factors ischemic cardiopathy (OR: 2. 34), {{and the presence of}} Lichen Sclerosis (OR: 3. 21). Conclusions The success rate with the <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy</b> technique shows it to be a valid option above all when we preserve the urethral blood supply and plate. Lichen sclerosus and ischemic vascular problems are risk factors to re-stenosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the clinical usefulness, in terms of analgesic efficacy and safety, of ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve block performed with bupivacaine in cats undergoing <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy.</b> Eighteen client-owned male cats scheduled for <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy</b> were enrolled in the study and assigned to one of two treatment groups. The pudendal nerve block was performed under general anaesthesia as described elsewhere, with 0. 3 ml/kg of either saline (group C) or 0. 5 % bupivacaine (group B) - the total injection volume being split equally on the two sites of injection (left and right). Intra-operatively, assessment of nociception was based on the rescue analgesics requirement, as well as on the evaluation of changes in physiological parameters in comparison with the baseline values. Post-operative pain assessment was performed using three different pain scales at recovery and then 1, 2 and 3 h after recovery. Cats in group B showed lower heart rates and required fewer analgesics during surgery than group C. Post-operatively, group B had lower pain scores and needed less rescue buprenorphine than group C. Iatrogenic block-related complications were not observed. In conclusion, the ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve block can be considered clinically useful in feline medicine as it provides reliable analgesia in cats undergoing <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background. Adult {{patients}} with urethral stricture after childhood hypospadias surgeries are infrequently {{discussed in the}} literature. We report our experience in treating such patients. Materials and Methods. A retrospective chart review was performed. From 2002 through 2007, nine consecutive adult patients who had current urethral stricture and had undergone childhood hypospadias surgeries were included. All adult urethral strictures were managed by a single surgeon. Results. Mean patient age was 38. 9 years old. The lag time of urethral stricture presentation ranged from 25 to 57 years after primary hypospadias surgery, {{with an average of}} 36 years. Stricture length ranged from 1 to 17 [*]cm (mean: 10. 3 [*]cm). Open graft-based urethroplasties were performed in 4 / 9 cases. Salvage <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy</b> was performed in 2 / 9 cases. Another 3 cases chose to undergo repeat urethrotomy or dilatations—none of these patients was cured by such treatment. Complications included one urethrostomy stenosis and one urinary tract infection. Conclusion. Urethral stricture may occur decades after initial hypospadias surgery. It can be the most severe form of anterior urethral stricture, and may eventually require salvage treatment such as a <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy.</b> Patients undergoing hypospadias surgery should receive lifelong follow-up protocol to detect latent urethral strictures...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} diagnosis, ultrasonographic findings, surgical management, outcome, {{and survival}} rate of perineal or prescrotal urethral dilatation in 12 male calves are described. All calves were crossbred and intact males. The most noticeable clinical presentations were perineal (n= 10) or prescrotal (n= 2) swellings and micturition problems. The main ultrasonographic findings were oval shaped dilatation of the urethra in all animals with dimensions of 40 - 75 X 30 - 62 mm. The calves with perineal urethral dilatation were treated by <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy</b> (n= 4) and partial penile transection including the dilated urethra and urethral fistulation (n= 6). Prescrotal urethral dilatations were treated by penile transection proximal to the dilatation site (n= 2).

40|$|Abstract: Penile {{urethral}} obstruction in cats is {{a commonly}} seen clinical case in veterinary medicine practice. In cases {{where there is}} no response to catheterisation or medical intervention, surgery is needed to enable urination and correct uraemia and hyperkalaemia. Several surgical techniques of urethrostomy have been described for this aim. In performing standard prepucial urethrostomy great care must be taken to minimise leakage in the anastomosis site and promote healing when performing the pelvic urethra and prepucial mucosa anastomosis. To achieve this, the line of anastomosis has been reinforced by covering the anastomosis with the bilateral bulbourethral tissue, m. ischiourethralis and m. ischiocavernosus using simple mattress sutures. This modification, which varies from the technique performed by Yeh and Şaroğlu, has been termed the coating technique. Advantages of this new technique over standard <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy</b> are discussed. This technique was used in the treatment of 55 cats with penile urethra obstruction presented to our clinic. Among them 52 cats showed uncomplicated recovery. Following anastomosis, a male dog urethral catheter with an outer diameter of 2. 6 mm was placed in each patient. In order to avoid infection, the catheter was removed after 2 days.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Delusional {{parasitosis}} {{is a rare}} psychiatric disorder {{which often}} presents with dermatological problems. Delusional parasitosis, which involves urethral self-instrumentation and foreign body insertion, is exceptionally rare. This is the first case report to date that provides a detailed presentation of the urological manifestation of delusional parasitosis with complications associated with repeated self-instrumentation and foreign body insertion, resulting in stricture formation and requiring <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy.</b> Case presentation A 45 -year-old Irish man was electively admitted for <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy</b> with chronic symptoms of dysuria, haematuria, urethral discharge, and intermittent urinary retention. He reported a 4 -year history of intermittent pain, pin-prick biting sensations, and burrowing sensations, and held the belief that his urethra was infested with ticks. He also reported a 2 -year history of daily self-instrumentation, mainly injecting an antiseptic using a syringe {{in an attempt to}} eliminate the ticks. He was found to have urethral strictures secondary to repeated self-instrumentation. A foreign body was found in his urethra and was removed via cystoscopy. On psychiatric assessment, he displayed a fixed delusion of tick infestation and threatened to surgically remove the tick himself if no intervention was performed. The surgery was postponed due his mental state and he was started on risperidone; he was later transferred to an acute in-patient psychiatric unit. Following a 3 -week admission, he reported improvement in his thoughts and distress. Conclusions Delusional parasitosis is a rare psychiatric disorder. Self-inflicted urethral foreign bodies in males are rare and have high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders; hence, these patients have a low threshold for referral for psychiatric assessment. The mainstay treatment for delusional parasitosis is second-generation antipsychotic drugs...|$|E

40|$|In {{patients}} with devastated bulbous urethra, that is, bulbar necrosis, failed fasciocutaneous repairs and “watering can perineum” repair options {{are limited by}} paucity of reliable local tissue suitable for reconstruction. In this case report we demonstrate a novel variation of a two-stage technique for reconstruction of a devastated bulbous urethra in a 57 -year-old male who suffered penetrating trauma to his previously reconstructed urethra. Because of extensive loss of local tissue from the prior reconstruction and subsequent trauma and infection a 2 -stage technique with use of gracilis was employed. This technique involved creation of two independently vascularized urethral hemi-plates prelaminated with buccal mucosa graft (BMG). In the first stage the dorsal plate was created by quilting buccal graft onto corpora cavernosa to create a temporary augmented <b>perineal</b> <b>urethrostomy.</b> In the same stage the future ventral neourethral plate was created by grafting another BMG onto the exposed distal gracilis muscle.
