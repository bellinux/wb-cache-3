5000|$|In 1990, Cadillac {{offered a}} lower-priced ($53,050) {{companion}} {{model with a}} cloth convertible roof and without the removable aluminum hardtop, and a model including the hardtop at $58,638. By midyear, prices were dropped to $57,813 for the hardtop/convertible and $51,500 for the convertible, which included a $650 Gas Guzzler Tax along with $550 destination charge. The fully integrated cellular telephone, which was equipped from the factory on just 36 cars this year, was available for an additional $1,195. Allanté's bumper-to-bumper new car warranty, seven years and 100000 mi, was three years longer than other Cadillacs, and an additional 50000 mi of coverage. Allanté owners also received a special toll-free number to call for service or concerns. Headlamp washers and dual 10-way Recaro seating remained standard, among other niceties. A driver's side airbag {{was added to the}} leather-wrapped steering wheel, eliminating the telescoping steering wheel [...] - [...] which retained its tilt feature. The analog instrument cluster - introduced the previous year - was standard on the convertible (available at no extra cost on the hardtop/convertible), however, only 358 cars were equipped with the analog cluster. The <b>power</b> <b>mirror</b> control moved from the right of the steering column on the instrument panel to a new location on {{the upper end of the}} driver's door armrest, while the power seat switches (previously mounted on the face of the seat base) were relocated to the lower side trim of the seat base facing the door panels. The 3-channel garage door opener base mounted on the header panel above the windshield was eliminated when a revamped sun visor design was introduced this year. Technological news was the addition of traction control - the first front-wheel drive automobile with a V8 in the world to be equipped as such. The elaborate system was able to cut fuel to up to four cylinders to reduce power and optimize traction. The electronically controlled shock absorbers were retuned to remain in [...] "soft" [...] mode for up to 40 mph. Previously, they entered [...] "normal" [...] mode after just 25 mph. A revised audio system allowed a CD player to be added as standard equipment, along with the cassette player. Of the 2,523 built for 1990, only five were exported - four to Canada and one to Germany. Allanté was available in eight colors this year, the most popular was Euro Red, found on 1,012 cars, while the least chosen was Gray Metallic, with only 28 made. Interior color choices (and production figures) were Charcoal Gray (1,343), Natural Beige (767), and Maroon (413).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Approximate {{computing}} has {{in recent}} years emerged as an important approach for energy saving mechanisms. Approximate computing involves {{reducing the number of}} transistors in a circuit to reduce delay and increase power savings. The power savings are at the cost of reduced accuracy. In most Signal Processing cases it is not necessary for the digital circuit to produce a precise output, the field of approximate computing takes advantage of the reduced accuracy requirements to improve speed and power consumption. This paper reviews methods used to approximate circuits and their performance in real-life applications. We also look at the effects of Process Variation on Approximate circuits where we analyze the effect of Variability on the signal delay of the critical path in approximate circuits.

40|$|Abstract- The {{sustained}} massive {{growth of}} the mobile appliance market is pushing the demand for power-efficient Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits. Most of the VLSI circuits use adders as the base element for arithmetic functions. Mirror adder (MA) is popularly used to implement full adder and subtractor that provide {{a good opportunity to}} design approximate versions which can be applied to error tolerant applications. The imprecise versions of adders and subtractors are simulated using Cadence tool and various parameters are analyzed. Based on the analysis the suitable adders and subtractors have been selected to design multibit adders. Using multibit adders a novel 8 -point multiplierless Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) has been designed. The proposed DCT consumes low power, area and delay and can be used for transform coding in digital video appliances. Index Terms—Approximate computing, low <b>power,</b> <b>mirror</b> adder, multiplierless 8 point DCT architecture. I...|$|E

40|$|The DC {{servo motor}} has {{applications}} in automotive market in applications ranging from heating and ventilation to <b>power</b> <b>mirror</b> positioning. It {{is also in}} use in Industrial and Consumer Markets for entertainment equipment, HVAC ventilation control and myriad number of other applications. In all these applications, either speed or position control of the DC servo motor is used. In this project, we have achieved MATLAB based real-time speed control implementation of DC servo motor using PCI- 1716. For a more efficient speed control, closed loop control system of the servo motor is realized {{with the help of}} a tuned PID controller. Further, progress has also been made in remote control of DC servo motor. For this, a communication has been established between the local and the remote PC; and PID controlled closed loop system, with the controller at the remote PC was successfully achieved and checked for optimal performance. However, due to delays introduced in the communication system, the remote control using PID was not found to be as efficient as the local control and the speed output was found to lag behind the reference signal. To compensate for this delay, a Smith Predictor incorporated model has been made. ...|$|E
