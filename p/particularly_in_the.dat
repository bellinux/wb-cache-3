5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, average {{temperatures}} began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting {{the extent of}} arable agriculture, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Highlands. The introduction of new monastic orders such as the Cistercians in this period also brought innovations in agriculture. Their monasteries became major landholders, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Borders. They were sheep farmers and producers of wool for the markets in Flanders. By the late Middle Ages, Melrose Abbey and the Earl of Douglas had about 15,000 sheep apiece, making them among the largest sheep farmers in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Insular art is {{the name}} given to the common style that {{developed}} in Britain and Ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental Europe {{and contributed to the}} development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved high crosses found <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created at the monastic centre of Iona.|$|E

5|$|A {{common theme}} in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce {{protection}} {{of what he}} regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, {{at the height of}} the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.|$|E
50|$|During development, the {{majority}} of the heart muscle is a sponge-like meshwork of interwoven myocardial fibers. As normal development progresses, these trabeculated structures undergo significant compaction that transforms them from spongy to solid. This process is <b>particularly</b> apparent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventricles, and <b>particularly</b> so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left ventricle. Noncompaction cardiomyopathy results when there is failure of this process of compaction. Because the consequence of non-compaction is <b>particularly</b> evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left ventricle, the condition is also called left ventricular noncompaction. Other hypotheses and models have been proposed, none of which is as widely accepted as the noncompaction model.|$|R

5|$|Aimed at older {{children}} and teenagers, the programme {{was based on}} the activities of a children's newspaper, the Junior Gazette, produced by pupils from the local comprehensive school. In later series it was depicted as a commercial venture. The show interspersed comedic elements with the dramatic.

5|$|Although {{the role}} of the camel is {{diminishing}} with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas.

Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.|$|E
5|$|Although use of {{the local}} Ocosito-style {{ceramics}} continued, there was a marked intrusion of K'iche' ceramics from the highlands in the Postclassic period, concentrated <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{northern part of the}} site but extending to cover the whole. The indigenous accounts of the K'iche' themselves claim that they conquered this region of the Pacific coast, suggesting that the presence of their ceramics is associated with their conquest of Takalik Abaj.|$|E
