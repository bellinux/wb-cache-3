40|$|Tunable {{precipitation}} {{strategy to}} control the shape of nanoparticles of a three-component system is presented. The strategy is devised from understanding the effects of precursor addition sequences on the morphology of resultant precipitates. LiFePO 4, {{one of the most}} potential candidate as a cathode material of lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles, was used as a representative model of the three (Li, Fe, and PO 4) -component system. According to the precursor addition sequence, three different precipitation methods were adopted: coprecipitation (Copr) and two different types of sequential precipitations (Seq 1 and Seq 2). Solubility product (K-sp) of intermediate precipitates (Li 3 PO 4 and Fe- 3 (PO 4) (2)) is the key parameter to help the precipitation processes understood. In Copr, the intermediate precipitates are formed simultaneously under K-sp-governed competition. In Seql and Seq 2, Li 3 PO 4 precipitates prior to Fe- 3 (PO 4) (2). When Fe 2 + is introduced into the suspension of Li 3 PO 4, the <b>preformed</b> <b>precipitate</b> is sacrificed to supply PO 43 - for Fe- 3 (PO 4) (2) precipitation due to the stronger tendency (smaller value of K-sp) of precipitation of Fe- 3 (PO 4) (2). Also, the interaction between a cationic surfactant and PO 43 - makes the difference between Seq 1 and Seq 2. As a conclusion of the effects of precursor sequence, the shape of particles spans from spherical nanoparticles through a hollow sphere secondary structure of the same nanoparticles to nanoplates. Each own morphology developed by different precipitation methods leads to different intercalation/deintercalation behavior of lithium ions in conventional rechargeable battery cells. close 141...|$|E
40|$|The {{macroscopic}} phase {{behavior and}} other physicochemical properties of dilute aqueous mixtures of DNA and the cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammounium bromide (CTAB), DNA and the polyamine spermine, or DNA, CTAB, and (2 -hydroxypropyl) -β-cyclodextrin (2 HPβCD) were investigated. When DNA {{is mixed with}} CTAB we found, with increasing surfactant concentration, (1) free DNA coexisting with surfactant unimers, (2) free DNA coexisting with aggregates of condensed DNA and CTAB, (3) a miscibility gap where macroscopic phase separation is observed, and (4) positively overcharged aggregates of condensed DNA and CTAB. The presence of a clear solution beyond the miscibility gap cannot be ascribed to self-screening by the charges from the DNA and/or the surfactant; instead, hydrophobic interactions among the surfactants are instrumental for the observed behavior. It is difficult to judge whether the overcharged mixed aggregates represent an equilibrium situation or not. If the excess surfactant was not initially present, but added to a <b>preformed</b> <b>precipitate,</b> redissolution was, in consistency with previous reports, not observed; thus, kinetic effects have major influence on the behavior. Mixtures of DNA and spermine also displayed a miscibility gap; however, positively overcharged aggregates were not identified, and redissolution with excess spermine {{can be explained by}} electrostatics. When 2 HPβCD was added to a DNA-CTAB precipitate, redissolution was observed, and when it was added to the overcharged aggregates, the behavior was essentially a reversal of that of the DNA-CTAB system. This is attributed to an effectively quantitative formation of 1 : 1 2 HPβCD-surfactant inclusion complexes, which results in a gradual decrease in the concentration of effectively available surfactant with increasing 2 HPβCD concentration...|$|E
40|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in this study}} indicate that serum protease is not activated by either a rabbit or guinea pig antiovalbumin-ovalbumin system, in vitro. A precipitin reaction occurring {{in the presence of a}} serum protease precursor of three species (human, rabbit, and guinea pig) failed to activate the protease precursor. Furthermore, particulate material as <b>preformed</b> <b>precipitates</b> could not be shown to activate the protease of either human or rabbit serum or their euglobulin fractions. The material presented seems to be further evidence against the postulated role of serum protease in immunologic systems...|$|R
40|$|The uptake of {{haemolytic}} fowl C′ by fowl anti-BSA and BSA {{has been}} detected and measured with sheep red cells sensitized with fowl haemolysin. It was, however, very small {{compared with the}} amount of guinea-pig C′ taken up by similar amounts of rabbit anti-BSA, and not directly related to the amount of precipitating antibody in any particular antiserum; nor did it occur when <b>preformed</b> resuspended specific <b>precipitates</b> were added to the C′ solution. Fixation of guinea-pig C′ by fowl anti-BSA could not be demonstrated, either with fresh antiserum, or with heated antiserum in the presence of normal fresh fowl serum...|$|R
40|$|Solubilization of {{an immune}} {{precipitate}} by serum is a complement function {{mediated by the}} alternative pathway and enhanced by the classical pathway [...] it therefore provides {{the basis of a}} simple quantitative assessment of the integrity of complement function. Using a <b>preformed</b> radiolabelled <b>precipitate</b> of BSA-alpha BSA Ab, the solubilization capacity of serial sera from 75 patients with various immune complex diseases or diseases associated with hypocomplementaemia was investigated to correlate this assay of complement function prospectively with disease activity and with measurements of circulating immune complexes (CIC). Reduction in solubilization, defined by more than 25 % of values in a given patient being below the normal range, was found in 11 of 12 patients with active SLE, two of 19 patients with active systemic vasculitis, three of three patients with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and in three of six patients with nephrotic syndrome due to other types of nephritis. In serial studies, solubilization correlated with disease activity in patients with SLE (P less than 0. 005), systemic vasculitis (P less than 0. 05) and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (P less than 0. 05). CIC were found more frequently than abnormalities in solubilization; however, the solubilization assay identified a population of patients with CIC more likely to have active disease. This simple assay of complement function provides data on an aspect of immune complex disease not readily apparent from standard estimations of circulating immune complexes, and appears to be a better measure of their potential phlogistic effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of tannate concentration (tannic acid/Al molar ratio [R] of 0. 010. 1), pH (5. 0 and 8. 0), order of aluminum, hydroxyl, and tannate addition, and prolonged ageing at different temperatures (10 months at 50 ºC and 5 y at room temperature and further ageing for 315 days at 140 ºC) on the nature and crystallinity of synthetic boehmite. Tannate facilitated the formation of boehmite relative to Al(OH) 3 polymorphs when coprecipitated with Al and also when added to Al(OH) x phases already formed at pH 4. 5 or 8. 0. However, the organic ligand was more effective in preventing or perturbing {{the growth of the}} crystals of boehmite when coprecipitated with Al than when added to soluble Al(OH) x species or <b>preformed</b> Al <b>precipitates.</b> Boehmite aged at temperatures 450 ºC typically showed a fibrous morphology. Crystals with a rhombic habit were observed in some treatments after ageing at 140 ºC. Significant amounts (1530 % C) of tannate were present in the precipitates after prolonged ageing. This tannate was only partly (< 50 %) oxidized by repeated treatments with H 2 O 2. With further ageing at 140 ºC, the crystallite size of selected samples increased only slightly, suggesting that much of the remaining tannate was present in the internal structure of these samples and not simply adsorbed to their surfaces. Atomic force microscopy observation showed the presence of globular nanoparticles (probably Al tannate precipitates) attached to the elongated crystals of boehmite. Take...|$|R
40|$|Interactions of silica {{microspheres}} {{were examined}} by light scattering in presence of alum and polyaluminum chloride (PACl) with various OH/Al ratios. The coagulation behaviors were investigated using different coagulant dosages at constant pH (6. 5) and salt concentration (0. 01 mol/L). Based on {{the measurement of}} size distribution and zeta potential, charge neutralization was proposed {{to be the primary}} coagulation step for all the coagulants while other distinct coagulation steps were also involved depending on in situ formed or <b>preformed</b> hydrolyzing products. <b>Precipitate</b> coverage and sweep flocculation were induced for alum, contrasted to polycation patch and bridge aggregation for PACl. Based on simplified DLVO theory, particle aggregation was explained in terms of interaction forces. It was demonstrated that PACl outperformed alum in particle agglomeration at lower concentration (1 - 2 mu mol/L), owing mainly to the considerable energy barrier reduction and deeper secondary minimum at longer distance induced by high positive polycations. The role of secondary minimum was found to be significant when secondary depth exceeded 12 kT. The interaction energy calculations coincided well with coagulation result for PACI, especially PACl 22 with high content Al(13). However, other interaction forces prevailed over the electrical repulsion for alum and PACl containing other aluminum species. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
