A kobold expects to be fed in the same {{place at the same time}} each day, or in the case of the Hütchen, once a week and on holidays. One tradition says that their favourite food is grits or water-gruel. Tales tell of kobolds with their own rooms; the kobold Heinzelmann had his own chamber at the castle, complete with furnishings. and King Goldemar was said to sleep in the same bed with Neveling von Hardenberg. He demanded a <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and a stall for his horses. Keightley relates that maids who leave the employ of a certain household must warn their successor to treat the house kobold well.|$|E

In the {{invitation}} for Ullrennet {{and the subsequent}} banquet in 1897, the members were asked to take their <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> [...] "according to rank, estate, age, dignity and skiing profess". SK Ull also became the second in Norway to raise its own skiing cabin, [...] "Ydale" [...] at Voksenkollen in 1893. This was named after Ýdalir, the mythological dwelling of the deity Ullr. Some of Ull's rival clubs were Christiania SK, Skuld, Fram and Ondur. Christiania, Skuld and Fram owned skiing cabins {{similar to that of}} Ull—they were collectively referred to as [...] "cabin skiing clubs".|$|E

2500|$|Although he has {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a conservative, Bawer has often protested that such labels are misleading or meaningless. He has explained his views as follows: [...] "Read A <b>Place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> and Stealing Jesus and While Europe Slept and Surrender one after the other and you will see that all four books are motivated by a dedication to individual identity and individual freedom and an opposition to groupthink, oppression, tyranny.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1999 article, “A Book that Made a Difference,” {{author and}} {{attorney}} Dale Carpenter {{noted that in}} the 1990s, the defining gay political causes were not revolutionary in nature but instead “sought to weave gays into the larger fabric of American life” and that “No author better crystallized this deep and widespread yearning than Bruce Bawer in... A <b>Place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table,</b> the decade's most important book on the gay movement.” The book, claimed Carpenter, “articulated better than any book before or since gays' rightful place in our culture” and “fueled a self-conscious movement of gay moderates and conservatives that is still redirecting gay politics.” Largely {{as a result of}} Bawer's book, a “new generation” of gays entered politics and “insisted that gay organizations put issues like marriage {{at the top of the}} agenda.” To be sure, “A <b>Place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> wasn't solely responsible for all of this... But the book brought it together, nurtured it, and sent it on its way. Bawer's world, to a very large extent, is now our world; his methods, our methods; his goals, our goals. He wrote the book of the decade and changed gay politics forever.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 October 1896, {{just after}} the end of the 1896 season, {{represent}}atives from six clubs held a meeting at Buxton's Art Gallery in Collins Street, at which it was decided to form the VFL Victorian Football League, which would represent the stronger clubs and begin playing in the 1897 football season. The clubs with delegtates at that meeting were: Collingwood; Essendon; Fitzroy; Geelong; Melbourne; South Melbourne. Although Geelong had finished 11th in a 13 team competition, they had consistently been calling for change. [...] Their record as a top team in past years would have also ensured their <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Harrison was indisputably {{known for}} his sense of humor. Even detractor John Adams conceded in his diary that [...] "Harrison's {{contributions}} and many pleasantries steadied rough sessions." [...] Indeed, while preparing to sign the Declaration, the rather rotund Harrison famously quipped to Elbridge Gerry, who had taken his <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to sign: [...] "I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are all hung for what we are now doing. From the size and weight of my body I shall die {{in a few minutes}} and be with the angels, but from the lightness of your body you will dance in the air an hour or two before you are dead." ...|$|E

Jane, according to my sight and belief, possessed neither.|$|R

2500|$|Among the book's admirers were James P. Pinkerton, who, {{writing in}} Newsday, praised Bawer's “live and let live” message. [...] Describing {{the book as}} “a {{conservative}} manifesto declaring what the silent majority of gays wants and why,” John Fink of the Chicago Tribune wrote: “If there is one book about homosexuality and gay rights that everyone should read, it is probably this one.” In Reason, David Link wrote that “Bawer is not a champion of any cause except good sense... A <b>Place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> is ultimately a defense of self-determination, and a much-needed one.” Lee Dembart described it in the Los Angeles Times as “a remarkable, gutsy, even brilliant book” and “the most interesting, provocative and original discussion of gay themes that I can recall.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{an episode}} of the Charlie Rose Show marking the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Bawer {{took part in a}} {{discussion}} with fellow gay moderate Andrew Sullivan and gay-left writers Tony Kushner and Donna Minkowitz. Minkowitz underlined the conflict between {{the two sides of the}} gay-rights movement by saying: “We don't want a <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table!</b> We want to turn the table over!” A New York Public Library lecture by Bawer, also marking the 25th anniversary of Stonewall, appeared in abbreviated form as a cover story in the New Republic. [...] A Washington Post article about the 25th anniversary of Stonewall quoted Bawer on gay pride marches: “It's hard to make straight people understand how serious an issue gay rights is when they look and see a kind of Mardi Gras atmosphere... It doesn't communicate the idea that these are serious issues.” In a letter to The New York Times, Bawer criticized an editorial that ran on the morning of the Stonewall 25 gay-pride march. The editors chided “gay moderates and conservatives” for seeking “to assure the country that the vast majority of gay people are 'regular' people just like the folks next door.” Bawer retorted, in part: “Well, most gays do live next door to straight people... we're not putting down cross-dressers or leathermen or anyone else; we're simply refuting an extremely misleading stereotype.” After the publication of A <b>Place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table,</b> Bawer wrote widely about gay life, culture, and politics. From 1994 to 1999, he was a regular columnist for The Advocate, the gay newsmagazine. His Advocate columns and other articles by Bawer on gay issues were later collected in an e-book, The Marrying Kind.|$|E
2500|$|Gary Bauer, {{head of the}} {{socially}} conservative Family Research Council, predicted the issue would be [...] "a major battleground in the 1990s". In 1991, Georgia Attorney General Michael J. Bowers withdrew a job offer to a lesbian who planned to marry another woman in a Jewish wedding ceremony. In 1993, a committee of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America released a report asking Lutherans to consider blessing same-sex marriages and stating that lifelong abstinence was harmful to same-sex couples. The Conference of Bishops responded, [...] "There is basis neither in Scripture nor tradition {{for the establishment of}} an official ceremony by this church for the blessing of a homosexual relationship." [...] In a critique of radicalism in the gay liberation movement, Bruce Bawer's A <b>Place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> (1993) advocated the legalization of same-sex marriage.|$|E

2500|$|As a Republican congresswoman {{representing}} {{an affluent}} Democratic district {{in an increasingly}} Democratic state, Morella faced a succession of increasingly strong Democratic challengers. [...] While she managed to fend them all off (even in the big Democratic years of 1992, 1996, and 1998), the low popularity of the Republican-controlled Congress gradually undermined her. She tried to portray herself as giving her district a <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> but over time, Morella's Democratic opponents claimed that a vote for Morella was a vote to keep Tom DeLay and other Republicans unpopular to district voters in power. It was virtually taken for granted that Morella would be succeeded by a Democrat if she retired. It was also taken for granted that if Morella retired or was defeated in an election, {{it would be a}} long time before another Republican won the seat.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1997 book Stealing Jesus: How Fundamentalism Betrays Christianity, Bawer stated, in {{the words}} of Publishers Weekly, “that {{fundamentalist}} Christianity... has been preaching a message of wrath and judgment” that “is incompatible with Jesus' message of love.” While criticizing “Bawer's sometimes strident tone,” Publishers Weekly said that his “graceful prose and lucid insights make this a must-read book for anyone concerned with the relationship of Christianity to contemporary American culture.” Walter Kendrick, in The New York Times, noted that like A <b>Place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table,</b> Stealing Jesus was an “alarm bell,” in this case about Christian fundamentalism. Although Kendrick complained that, Bawer's hopes to the contrary, there was “no hope of converting the fundamentalists,” he concluded that the book might “prove of value simply for its clear exposition of what today's American 'fundamentalists' believe and want to do.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing Prophets and Professors, Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley {{described}} Bawer as “one of the appallingly few American literary journalists {{whose work}} repays the reading” and “an intelligent, independent, tough-minded critic and a clear-eyed observer of literary affairs.” In The New York Times Book Review, Andrea Barnet described {{the book as}} “immensely readable... provocative and entertaining,” saying that Bawer was “thoughtful, sharply opinionated, high-minded and unafraid to slash at sacred cows,” Leslie Schenk of World Literature Today opined that Bawer “has the uncanny knack of writing good sense precisely in those fields where good sense {{seems to have been}} taboo... As though with the scalpel of a surgeon removing tumors, he deftly, coolly, cuts through the ephemeral malarkey that hitherto obscured his subjects. His book A <b>Place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table,</b> for example, stands as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar in the seas of mush that otherwise surround the subject of homosexuality.” In Prophets and Professors, “Bawer performs a similar operation on American academia's pet fetish, modern poetry,” resulting in “the most important book on poetry since Dana Gioia's Can Poetry Matter?” ...|$|E
