The preferential model allows each agent to have strict partial orders over possible worlds.

The so-called qualitative possibilistic influence diagrams extend standard influence diagrams {{in order to avoid}} difficulties attached to the specification of both probability distributions relative to chance nodes and utilities relative to value nodes. In fact, generally, it is easier for experts to quantify dependencies between chance nodes qualitatively via possibility distributions and to provide a <b>preferential</b> <b>relation</b> between different consequences. In such a case, the possibility theory offers a suitable modeling framework. Different combinations of the quantification between chance and utility nodes offer several kinds of possibilistic influence diagrams.

The proposed approach is implemented via a possibilistic influence diagram toolbox (PIDT). Decision theory Influence diagrams Possibility theory Ordinal utilities Binary qualitative utilities...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn 234 copulations, {{male and}} female {{behavioural}} patterns were collected, especially the vocal pattern for the female. Moreover quantitative structural analysis was performed on 38 of these female copulatory vocalizations. A multifactorial analysis, ANAFAC, was performed to seek relations between (1) utterance of female copulatory call and {{male and female}} copulatory behaviour and (2) these patterns and the great variability of female calls. Utterance of female copulatory vocalizations is essentially due to the female’s own copulatory behaviour in periods of intense sexual activity. Long female calls are related to male ejaculation, and those “rich” in harmonics are related to visual and tactile communicatory signals exchanged by the male and the female during a mount. This analysis strongly confirms the tied bond between quality of a call and internal state of the emitter. Long calls, rich in harmonics, may serve as signals maintaining or strengthening the possibly temporary <b>preferential</b> <b>relation</b> between male and sexually receptive female...|$|E

Every <b>preferential</b> <b>relation</b> j¸ is of the form j¸ M for some preferential model M ([4]). If j¸ is rational then the model can be found ranked ([5]). Disjunctive relations were studied in [3] and shown to be those relations represented by filtered models.

The contribution {{of this paper is to}} give simpler proofs of representation theorems for a large classe of relations. In particular, the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{technical}} problem {{addressed in}} this paper is, given two rule systems for consequence relations X and Y, how to construct Y-approximations of a given X-relation. While an upper Y- approximation can be easily constructed if all Y- rules are Horn, the construction of lower Y- approximations is less straightforward. We address the problem by defining the notion of coclosure under co-Horn rules, {{that can be used}} to remedy violation of certain rules by removing arguments. In particular, we show how the coclosure under Monotonicity can be used to construct the monotonic restriction of a <b>preferential</b> <b>relation.</b> Unlike the more usual closure under the rules of M, this co-closure operator supports the intuition that preferential reasoning is more liberal than monotonic reasoning. The approach is embedded in a general framework for comparing rule systems for consequence relations. A salient feature of this framework is that it is also possible to compare rule systems that are not related by metalevel entailment...|$|E

As a particular case, we study the family of disjunctive relations, that is relations where a conclusion drawn from a disjunction of premisses can be drawn from one at least of those premisses taken alone. We show that for this type of relation, the associated model is injective and filtered: if two worlds m and n satisfy a proposition α and are not minimal for that property, then there exists a world p less than both of them that satisfies α. As we prove, conversely, that any filtered model defines a disjunctive inference relation, we obtain a representation theorem for these relations. Applying finally these results to the family of rational relations, we get a new proof of the representation of these relations by means of ranked injective models...|$|R

40|$|Belief fusion, {{instead of}} AGM belief revision, was first {{proposed}} {{to solve the}} problem of inconsistency, that arised from repetitive application of the operation when agents' knowledge were amalgamated. In the preceding work of Maynard-Reid II and Shoham, the fusion operator is applied to belief states, which is total preorders over possible worlds which is based on the semantics of belief revision. Moreover, they introduced the pedigreed belief state, which represented multiple sources of belief states, ordered by a credibility ranking. However in the theory, all the sources must be totally ordered and thus applicable area is quite restrictive. In this paper, we realize the fusion operator of multiple agents for partially ordered sources. When we consider such a partial ranking over sources, there is no need to restrict that each agent has total preorders over possible worlds. The preferential model, based on the semantics on nonmonotonic reasoning, allows each agent to have strict partial orders over possible worlds. Especially, such an order is called a <b>preferential</b> <b>relation,</b> that prescribes a world is more plausible than the other. Therefore, we introduce an operation which combines multiple preferential relations of agents. In addition, we show that our operation can properly include the ordinary belief fusion...|$|E
