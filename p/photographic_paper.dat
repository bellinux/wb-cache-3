25|$|Digital {{printing}} is {{the reproduction}} of digital images on a physical surface, such as common or <b>photographic</b> <b>paper</b> or paperboard-cover stock, film, cloth, plastic, vinyl, magnets, labels etc.|$|E
25|$|As {{the film}} {{business}} expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films. To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints {{of them on}} long strips of <b>photographic</b> <b>paper</b> with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of digital photography, <b>photographic</b> <b>papers</b> are still sold commercially. <b>Photographic</b> <b>papers</b> are manufactured in numerous standard sizes, paper weights and surface finishes. A range of emulsions are also available that differ in their light sensitivity, colour response and {{the warmth of the}} final image. Color papers are also available for making colour images.|$|R

25|$|Besides the camera, {{other methods}} of forming images with light are available. For instance, a {{photocopy}} or xerography machine forms permanent images but uses {{the transfer of}} static electrical charges rather than photographic medium, hence the term electrophotography. Photograms are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the <b>photographic</b> <b>paper,</b> {{without the use of}} a camera. Objects can also be placed directly on the glass of an image scanner to produce digital pictures.|$|E
25|$|Digital imaging uses an {{electronic}} image sensor {{to record the}} image {{as a set of}} electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film. An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical photography resists photo manipulation because it involves film and <b>photographic</b> <b>paper,</b> while digital imaging is a highly manipulative medium. This difference allows for a degree of image post-processing that is comparatively difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.|$|E
25|$|Alice {{apparently}} took university classes, {{including two}} years of law and three years of medicine. She was interested in chemistry, and became a skilled photographer, doing her own developing and platemaking. By 1890 she was publishing articles on the technique of photography in major photography magazines such as Wilson's Photographic Magazine and The International Annual of Anthony's Photographic Bulletin, as A. Lee Snelling and Alice Lee Snelling. These interests were shared by her son Walter, a chemist who later developed a light-sensitive coating for <b>photographic</b> <b>paper</b> using TNT.|$|E

Bridges became intrigued by the calotype process and persuaded Talbot to support him with <b>photographic</b> <b>paper</b> for a major project. Moreover Talbot allowed Bridges to be instructed in its use even though an American patent was some years away.|$|E
25|$|Photo CD is {{a system}} {{designed}} by Kodak for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the Beige Book and conform to the CD-ROM XA and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with the suitable software irrespective of the operating system. The images can also be printed out on <b>photographic</b> <b>paper</b> with a special Kodak machine. This format {{is not to be}} confused with Kodak Picture CD, which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.|$|E

2500|$|Baekeland {{was already}} wealthy, {{due to his}} {{invention}} of Velox <b>photographic</b> <b>paper,</b> {{when he began to}} investigate the reactions of phenol and formaldehyde in his home laboratory. Chemists had begun to recognize that many natural resins and fibres were polymers. [...] Baekeland's initial intent was to find a replacement for shellac, a material that was in limited supply because it was made naturally from the excretion of lac insects (specifically Kerria lacca). Baekeland produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called [...] "Novolak", {{but it was not a}} market success.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{problem is}} to produce a {{sensitometer}} to expose <b>photographic</b> color <b>paper</b> {{to be used as}} control strips in a <b>photographic</b> color <b>paper</b> process. This problem involves designing, constructing, and verifying the sensitometer. Designing the sensitometer is done by looking at different methods of exposing each dye layer of a <b>photographic</b> color <b>paper.</b> These methods include: fiber optics or light guides, light integrating devices, and projection systems. The method which was chosen for this experiment is the projection system. After the method had been decided upon, a lamp model will be calculated using the spectral sensitivity curve of a <b>photographic</b> color <b>paper.</b> The rest of the components will then be designed as needed to complete the sensitometer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTexture {{characterization}} of <b>photographic</b> <b>papers</b> {{is likely to}} provide scholars with valuable information regarding artistic practices. Currently, texture assessment remains mostly based on visual and manual inspections, implying long repetitive tasks prone to inter- and even intra-observer variability. Automated texture characterization and classification procedures are thus important tasks in historical studies of large databases of <b>photographic</b> <b>papers,</b> likely to provide quantitative and reproducible assessments of texture matches. Such procedures may, for instance, produce vital information on photographic prints of uncertain origins. The hyperbolic wavelet transform, because it relies {{on the use of}} different dilation factor along the horizontal and vertical axes, permits to construct robust and meaningful multiscale and anisotropic representation of textures. In the present contribution, we explore how unsupervised clustering strategies can be complemented both to assess the significance of extracted clusters and the strength of the contribution of each texture to its associated cluster. Graph based filterbank strategies are notably investigated with the aim to produce small size significant clusters. These tools are illustrated at work on a large database of about 2500 exposed and non exposed <b>photographic</b> <b>papers</b> carefully assembled and documented by the MoMA and P. Messier's foundation. Results are commented and interpreted...|$|R

2500|$|Early seismometers had an {{arrangement}} of levers on jeweled bearings, to scratch smoked glass or paper. [...] Later, mirrors reflected a light beam to a direct-recording plate or roll of <b>photographic</b> <b>paper.</b> [...] Briefly, some designs returned to mechanical movements to save money. [...] In mid-twentieth-century systems, the light was reflected {{to a pair of}} differential electronic photosensors called a photomultiplier. [...] The voltage generated in the photomultiplier was used to drive galvanometers which had a small mirror mounted on the axis. [...] The moving reflected light beam would strike the surface of the turning drum, which was covered with photo-sensitive paper. [...] The expense of developing photo sensitive paper caused many seismic observatories to switch to ink or thermal-sensitive paper.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{availability}} of digital processing of seismic data in the late 1970s, the records were done in a few different forms on different types of media. A [...] "Helicorder" [...] drum was a device used to record data into <b>photographic</b> <b>paper</b> or {{in the form of}} paper and ink. A [...] "Develocorder" [...] was a machine that record data from up to 20 channels into a 16-mm film. The recorded film can be viewed by a machine. The reading and measuring from these types of media can be done by hand. After the digital processing has been used, the archives of the seismic data were recorded in magnetic tapes. Due to the deterioration of older magnetic tape medias, large number of waveforms from the archives are not recoverable.|$|E

2500|$|Early seismometers used optical levers or {{mechanical}} linkages {{to amplify}} the small motions involved, recording on soot-covered paper or <b>photographic</b> <b>paper.</b> Modern instruments use electronics. [...] In some systems, the mass is held nearly motionless {{relative to the}} frame by an electronic negative feedback loop. [...] The motion of the mass relative to the frame is measured, and the feedback loop applies a magnetic or electrostatic force to keep the mass nearly motionless. The voltage needed to produce this force is {{the output of the}} seismometer, which is recorded digitally. In other systems the weight is allowed to move, and its motion produces a voltage in a coil attached to the mass and moving through the magnetic field of a magnet attached to the frame. This design is often used in the geophones used in seismic surveys for oil and gas.|$|E
2500|$|The valley used to {{be known}} for its bobbin mills and for Waterfoot factory which dredged the bottom of the Kentmere Tarn in the 1950s searching for diatomite. A water mill was {{established}} by the first Lord of the Manor in 1272. The records state that he had [...] "Liberty granted to erect a mill {{on the banks of the}} River Kent at Ulthwaite, upstream of Croft Head" [...] they also stated that the mill was used to cut the sleepers for the Kendal and Windermere Railway in 1860. The mill was restored in the 1970s and is now a pottery studio producing handmade ceramics. Also, at the Staveley end of the valley, is a <b>photographic</b> <b>paper</b> manufactory known as Kentmere Ltd. A fishery is situated beside the reservoir and every year trout and salmon are released into the River Kent for the benefit of anglers because the river's native population has been diminished.|$|E
60|$|And {{there is}} no doubt but that these are among the very best {{feathered}} friends we have. Those hens are liberal with their eggs, and those little chickens that are running around like two-legged puff-balls, are so willing to grow up and be broiled and roasted and stewed, that it would now be almost impossible for us to do without them. Eggs seem to come into use on so many occasions that, if there was to be an egg-famine, it would make itself felt in every family in the land. Not only would we miss them when boiled, fried, and cooked in omelets for breakfast; not only without them would ham seem lonely, puddings and sponge-cakes go into decline, and pound-cake utterly die, but the arts and manufactures of the whole country would feel the deprivation. Merely in the photographic business hundreds of thousands of eggs are needed every year, from which to procure the albumen used in the preparation of <b>photographic</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The term baryta {{derives from}} {{the name of a}} common barium sulfate-containing mineral, barite. However, the {{substance}} used to coat <b>photographic</b> <b>papers</b> is usually not pure barium sulfate, but a mixture of barium and strontium sulfates. The ratio of strontium to barium differs among commercial <b>photographic</b> <b>papers,</b> so chemical analysis can be used to identify the maker of the paper used to make a print and sometimes when the paper was made. [...] The baryta layer has two functions 1) to brighten the image and 2) to prevent chemicals adsorbed on the fibers from infiltrating the gelatin layer. The brightening occurs because barium sulfate {{is in the form of}} a fine precipitate that scatters light back through the silver image layer. In the early days of photography, before baryta layers were used, impurities from the paper fibers could gradually diffuse into the silver layer and cause an uneven loss of sensitivity (before development) or mottle (unevenly discoluor) the silver image (after development).|$|R
