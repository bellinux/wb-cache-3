25|$|Silicones may be {{considered}} analogous to mineral silicates, in which the methyl groups of the silicones correspond to the isoelectronic O− of the silicates.

For example, (Me3Si)2O is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of molybdenum and tungsten oxyhalides, converting a tungsten hexachloride suspension in dichloroethane solution quantitatively to WOCl4 in under an hour at room temperature, and then to yellow WO2Cl2 at 100°C in light petroleum at a yield of 95% overnight.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whilst {{carbon dioxide}} is the gas {{generally}} used for insufflation during laparoscopy, several studies have reported adverse effects specifically associated with its use. These effects may be attributable to chemical, metabolic, or immunologic effects specific to CO 2. Because helium is chemically, <b>physiologically,</b> and pharmacologically <b>inert,</b> {{it has been suggested}} as a possible substitute insufflation gas. However, there has been concern about the potential implications of venous gas embolism during helium insufflation. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the physiological effect of the intravenous injection of He and CO 2 in an experimental model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven domestic white pigs were randomly allocated to receive multiple intravenous injections of increasing volumes of either CO 2 or He gas. Cardiorespiratory function was measured, and the intravenous volumes of gas that resulted in cardiac arrest were determined. RESULT: Cardiorespiratory functional measures returned to normal quicker after CO 2 than after He injection. Helium injection quickly overwhelmed the animal's ability to compensate and resulted in death at a lower volume than did CO 2 injection. CONCLUSIONS: Gas embolism during He insufflation is more likely to be lethal than is CO 2 embolism. This scenario is most likely following Veress needle insertion into a large vein. Therefore, if He is to be used for insufflation during clinical laparoscopy, the possibility of venous injection should be minimized by avoiding Veress needle use. Further investigation of the safety of He insufflation is warranted before a role during clinical laparoscopy can be recommended...|$|R
40|$|Medical devices, {{implants}} or patient-care {{equipment that}} will come into intimate contact with a patient must be effectively decontaminated to prevent infection or disease transmission. Non-sterile devices have significant ramifications for patient morbidity and mortality and two processes must be undertaken {{in order to make}} an item acceptable for use or implantation: cleaning and disinfection (or sterilization) [1]. Sterilization is the destruction of living organisms, and must be done without damaging the material surface and without compromising the bulk material strength or biocompatibility of implantable device. Common sterilization processes include steam autoclaving, gamma irradiation, and chemical treatments with ethylene oxide or hydrogen peroxide plasma. Parameters such as temperature, pressure, energy intensity, sterilizing agent concentration, and cycle time can change widely and the process chemistry and conditions determine its applicability for a given material or device [2]. New sterilization processes continue to be investigated, with emphases on reducing the process temperature and minimizing contamination. An alternative “green” method to classical processes is based on supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) technology that is attractive because it’s a non-flammable, non-toxic, <b>physiologically</b> safe, chemically <b>inert</b> and readily available solvent. When heated and compressed above its critical point (7. 38 MPa and 304. 2 K) CO 2 exhibits a liquid-like density but gas-like diffusivity and viscosity and these properties allow to penetrate porous structures easily [3]; the bactericidal effect is caused by specific interactions between the living cells and the fluid such as cell wall rupture/perforation, inactivation of some key-enzymes, intracellular electrolyte balance perturbation, pH intra/extra cellular variation [4]. We have studied the sterilization of porous PLLA scaffolds for tissue engineering applications in a supercritical fluid extractor. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the sterilization method, the PLLA scaffolds were contaminated with the gram-negative bacteria E. coli. The amount of viable bacteria in each scaffold was estimated by colony-forming unit (CFU). The contaminated scaffolds were treated or not, as control, with carbon dioxide technology. The efficiency of the sterilization treatment was investigated at different value of pressure of CO 2, temperature or time. We obtained the total sterilization after just 15 minutes of treatment at the temperature of 37 °C and pressure of 150 bar. Differential scanning calorimetry analyses of the so-treated samples did not show significant differences with respect to not-treated samples. As a matter of fact, almost similar melting and crystallization temperatures and enthalpies were measured, thus demonstrating that the crystallinity of the scaffolds was not modified during the treatment. Furthermore, the PLLA scaffolds maintain their biocompatible characteristic after scCO 2 sterilization method. In fact the SK-Hep- 1 tumor cells grew both on the outer and on the internal surface of the scaffold as demonstrated by a cell viability assay Alamar Blue. [1] N. R. Cholvin, N. R.

5000|$|Inert gas {{asphyxiation}} {{is a form}} of asphyxiation {{which results}} from breathing a <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> gas in the absence of oxygen, or a low amount of oxygen, rather than atmospheric air (which is largely composed of nitrogen and oxygen). Examples of <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> gases, which have caused accidental or deliberate death by this mechanism, are: argon, helium, nitrogen and methane. The term [...] "physiologically inert" [...] is used to indicate a gas which has no toxic or anesthetic properties and does not act upon the heart or hemoglobin.

50|$|When humans {{breathe in}} an {{asphyxiant}} gas, such as pure nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, sulfur hexafluoride, methane, {{or any other}} <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> gas(es), they exhale carbon dioxide without re-supplying oxygen. <b>Physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> gases (those that have no toxic effect, but merely dilute oxygen) are generally free of odor and taste. As such, the human subject detects little abnormal sensation as the oxygen level falls. This leads to asphyxiation (death from lack of oxygen) without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation (the hypercapnic alarm response, which in humans arises mostly from carbon dioxide levels rising), or {{the side effects of}} poisoning. In scuba diving rebreather accidents, there is often little sensation but euphoria—however, a slow decrease in oxygen breathing gas content has effects which are quite variable. By contrast, suddenly breathing pure inert gas causes oxygen levels in the blood to fall precipitously, and may lead to unconsciousness in only a few breaths, with no symptoms at all.|$|E

Chitin, occurring as the structural analog of cellulose, is mainly found in various living organisms such as outer shells of crustaceans, the cuticles of insects, and the cell walls of some fungi [3, 4]. Isolated chitin has a high crystalline structure consisting of N-acetylanhydroglucosamine and a few anhydroglucosamine units linked by β-(1, 4)-glycoside bonds [5, 6]. Actually, chitins have been reported to be promising materials in many biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, wound dressing, and some biocompatible devices, based upon its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-toxic, <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> and mechanically stable properties [5, 7 – 10].|$|E

Tris buffer (pH 8. 00) was found to increase outer membrane permeability {{on the basis of}} an increased Vo of whole-cell alkaline phosphatase activity and on the basis of sensitivity to lysozyme and altered localization pattern of alkaline phosphatase. The Tris buffer-mediated increase in outer membrane permeability was found to be dependent upon the extent of exposure to and concentration of the Tris buffer. The Tris buffer effects were demonstrated not to be due to allosteric activation of cell-associated alkaline phosphatase and were specific for Tris buffer. Exposure of cells to Tris resulted in the release of a limited amount of cell envelope component.

40|$|Abstract — Chironomids {{belong to}} the group of benthic insects that could reflect aquatic {{environment}} degradation. A 96 -hour toxicity test for Cu, Cd and Pb in chironomids was investigated and the LC 50 obtained were 1. 37 µg/mL for copper, 73. 09 µg/mL for cadmium, and 38. 47 µg/mL for lead. The three metals exhibited an increase in accumulation with increasing concentration of test solution. Among the three metals, Pb yielded the highest concentration in organisms. The result suggests that some Pb may have accumulated in <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> sites in the body of organisms. However, from the LC 50 obtained, it shows that cadmium is the least toxic. The organisms used in this study might have the ability to synthesize metallothionein, a metal-binding protein which could reduce the toxicological capability of Cd. A multiple-metal system was also employed to monitor metal accumulation in chironomids. It was found that there was a reduction in the amount of metals absorbed by the organisms when compared to organisms exposed to a single metal system.

40|$|Nitrite (NO 2 -), {{previously}} {{viewed as}} a <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> metabolite and biomarker of the endogenous vasodilator NO, was recently identified as an important biological NO reservoir in vasculature and tissues, where it contributes to hypoxic signaling, vasodilation, and cytoprotection after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Reduction of nitrite to NO may occur enzymatically at low pH and oxygen tension by deoxyhemoglobin, deoxymyoglobin, xanthine oxidase, mitochondrial complexes, or NO synthase (NOS). We show that nitrite treatment, in sharp contrast with the worsening effect of NOS inhibition, significantly attenuates hypothermia, mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress and dysfunction, tissue infarction, and mortality in a mouse shock model induced by a lethal tumor necrosis factor challenge. Mechanistically, nitrite-dependent protection {{was not associated with}} inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity, as previously demonstrated for ischemia-reperfusion, but was largely abolished in mice deficient for the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) alpha 1 subunit, one of the principal intracellular NO receptors and signal transducers in the cardiovasculature. Nitrite could also provide protection against toxicity induced by Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide, although higher doses were required. In conclusion, we show that nitrite can protect against toxicity in shock via sGC-dependent signaling, which may include hypoxic vasodilation necessary to maintain microcirculation and organ function, and cardioprotection...|$|E

However, when used over longer periods, hydrogel-aluminium electrodes present limitations, which capacitive electrodes may overcome.

It must be <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> and nontoxic, {{so that it}} does not have any disturbing effect upon the body, particu-larly upon the kidney. It must not be metabolized to any appreciable degree. It must not dissociate in solution to any great extent, so that the probability of its penetration into the various cells of the body is extremely slight. It must not be adsorbed on or combined with the proteins of the blood. It must be filtered by the glomerular membrane alone and must not be eliminated or reabsorbed by the renal tubule. It must be recovered rapidly and quantitatively in the urine after intravenous injection. Such a substance is inulin, and it is used, therefore, to estimate the extent of glomerular ifitration (1). In addi-tion, it is utilized also to determine extracellular water and extra-cellular space (2 - 7). Inulin is a nonreducing polysaccharide composed of fructose units, although recent studies indicate that at least a portion of the molecule contains a glucopyranose moiety in sucrose configuration (8). The methods available for the quantitative determination of inulin fall into two categories.

40|$|In {{addition}} to its definitive pathological characteristics, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) brain exhibits regionally variable neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction {{that are likely to}} underlie the symptomatic memory loss and language abnormalities. A number of mechanisms that could give rise to this localized damage have been proposed, amongst which excitotoxicity figures prominently. This is the process, well attested in experimental systems, whereby brain cells are excited to death by the pathophysiological action of the brain 2 ̆ 7 s most-abundant excitatory transmitter, glutamate. Glutamate transmission is mediated by a range of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors which, when activated, can lead to depolarization and increased intracellular Ca 2 + ion concentration in the cells on which they are located. The action of glutamate is terminated by its removal from these receptor sites by transport into nearby cells, most commonly perisynaptic astrocytes. There it is converted to <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> glutamine and shuttled back to excitatory nerve terminals. Malfunctions in components of the glutamate-glutamine cycle could result in a self-perpetuating neuronal death cascade mediated by glutamate. The approval by the FDA of an ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist to treat late-stage AD has led to renewed interest in the contribution of altered glutamatergic neurotransmission to disease pathogenesis.

Although nitrate is known to affect ecosystems at high levels through eutrophication, hypoxia and loss of biodiversity, it is considered to be <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> to the individual aquatic organism. To test the physiological effects of nitrate on aquatic life, we exposed gill tissue of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, to nitrate and characterized changes in protein expression, using a gel-based proteomics approach. Of the 642 protein spots detected, we found that 24 proteins (15 identified) changed expression in response to a 6 -hour exposure to nitrate concentrations ranging from 0 - 73 mg/L, values that characterize highly contaminated surface and ground waters. Proteins changing expression included the oxidative stress proteins thioredoxin and cavortin (a member of the superoxide dismutase family) as well as proteins that are involved in G-protein signaling (Rho-GDI, ADP-ribosylation factor, G-protein ß-subunit), protein homeostasis (heat shock protein 70, prohibitin, calreticulin, and proteasome 2 ̆ 6 #;-type 4 subunit), glycolysis (enolase), transport of hydrophobic molecules (lipocalin) and cytoskeletal arrangements (intermediate filaments and a gelsolin-like adseverin). The most parsimonious explanation for these changes in protein expression assumes that C. gigas reduces nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide, which reacts with superoxide anions to form the very reactive peroxynitrite.

The forest is characterized by extremely low levels of base cations in both canopy vegetation and in the soils.

The rate of H+ retention in the canopy {{was close to the}} rate of base cation leaching, suggest-ing that cation leaching is neutralizing acid precipitation. The subtropical forest studied leached cations from the can-opy throughout the year, unlike temperate deciduous forests, which are <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> in the winter. The forest canopy of the subtropical forest we studied is impacted by acid deposition and fog throughout the winter because of frequent rainfall and high relative humidity. This continuous exposure to acid precipitation could cause more intense negative effects on the canopy of subtropical forests as compared with temperate forests exposed to similar pollution loads. We suggest that the low base status of subtropical forests growing on low base status soils may make them very vulnerable to the negative effects of air pollution.

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} the current knowledge {{on the role}} of mitochondria in the context of hypoxic cell biology, while providing evidence of how these mechanisms are modulated by methane (CH 4). Recent studies have unambiguously confirmed CH 4 bioactivity in various in vitro and in vivo experimental models and established the possibility that CH 4 can affect many aspects of mitochondrial physiology. To date, no specific binding of CH 4 to any enzymes or receptors have been reported, and it is probable that many of its effects are related to physico-chemical properties of the non-polar molecule. (i) Mitochondria themselves can be sources of endogenous CH 4 generation under oxido-reductive stress conditions; chemical inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain with site-specific inhibitors leads to increased formation of CH 4 in eukaryote cells, in plants, and in animals. (ii) Conventionally believed as <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert,</b> studies cited in this review demonstrate that exogenous CH 4 modulates key events of inflammation. The anti-apoptotic effects of exogenously administered CH 4 are also recognized, and these properties also suggest that CH 4 -mediated intracellular signaling is closely associated with mitochondria. (iii) Mitochondrial substrate oxidation is coupled with the reduction of molecular oxygen, thus providing energy for cellular metabolism. Interestingly, recent in vivo studies have shown improved basal respiration and modulated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by exogenous CH 4. Overall, these data suggest that CH 4 liberation and effectiveness in eukaryotes are both linked to hypoxic events and redox regulation and support the notion that CH 4 has therapeutic roles in mammalian pathophysiologies...|$|E

The ideal excipient {{is one that is}} <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert,</b> non-toxic, chemically stable, and non-reactive [28]. This relatively fast decay is expected since placebo products are mixtures of various excipients, which in many cases remain in the lumen of the compartment and are eliminated by natural discharge. In some samples, we could detect placebo product through excipient-based assays at much later time points not always decaying to zero, particularly sorbitol and HEC assays. Since sorbitol is found in vaginal fluid, the detection observed in swabs from the much later time points could reflect woman to woman variations in these endogenous levels that were higher than the range of levels observed in baseline swabs. The Quatro Study referenced above will provide more samples to better determine the cutoff sorbitol level for determining product use. HEC was detected by a recombinant probe based on a protein sequence common to a family of carbohydrates conferring its ability to detect other types [26]. Therefore, it is possible that other carbohydrates present in the vaginal fluid or vaginal products could be occasionally detected. This may also be the reason for the baseline detection of HEC in 10 % of the total swabs. Overall, the CONRAD 135 study results presented in this report confirm that women can swab themselves within 12 – 24  h of placebo product administration with or without sex in their home for successful detection of use.|$|E

Safety data was not considered in the review, additionally the levels of evidence for acupuncture against other recommended therapies was not compared. Consequently, we argue that this NICE guideline has limitations that lead to several potential biases in its evaluation of acupuncture, which were not addressed correctly: (i) NICE's prior scoping process limited their review (ii) NICE introduced the method of developing recommendations based on the consideration of which interventions make ’minimal important differences’ (MID) of an effect size of 0. 5 or greater, rather than the statistical significance of the effect of an intervention when compared to an appropriate comparison. (iii) Evidence that sham acupuncture is not <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert,</b> and has some level of beneficial effect, hence artificially reducing the magnitude of the effect size in comparison to sham; (iv) The low adverse effects profile of acupuncture; (v) Evidence from trials comparing acupuncture to usual or standard care was not considered, nor was cost-effectiveness data.

If the same criteria and methods that have been applied to acupuncture were applied to other NICE recommended therapies for knee osteoarthritis, including patient centeredness, patient education, self-management and weight loss, NSAIDs and COX- 2 inhibitors, these too would no longer be recommended and opiates would become the first line of drug prescription.

Our observations fully support the pathoadaptive nature of speG inactivation in Shigella and reveal that the accumulation of spermidine is a key determinant in the pathogenicity strategy adopted by this microrganism...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{studies have}} shown that tissue {{resistivity}} may be useful in determining areas of chronically infarcted myocardiurn However, to date, no formal studies have been performed to examine the dielectric properties of chronic infarct. In this study, we measure and report the dielectric properties of healthy tissue and chronic infarct. This is done by measuring the complex admittance in vitro and in vivo using the capacitor cell and four-electrode techniques. We then determine how structural differences between healthy myocardium and chronic infarct affect the dielectric measurements of the two substrates. This is done by assessing the gross histology of healthy myocardium, chronic infarct, and of the transitional region in between. ^ Our results show that the dielectric properties of healthy myocardium and chronic infarct are substantially different at low frequencies. The β-dispersion is prominent in healthy myocardium, but is small for chronically infarcted tissue. This observation is explained by the absence of cellular membranes in the fibrous matrix of infarcted tissue. Our results also show a gradual transition in the resistivity across the visible border between healthy and chronically infarcted tissue, starting 4 mm in healthy myocardium and progressing to 2 mm in the densely infarcted myocardium. This gradual change in tissue resistivity corresponds to a gradual change in tissue substrate and is highly correlated with the myocyte, and collagen content of cells. ^ Although the data shows significant differences between the measured resistivity of healthy myocardium in vivo and in vitro, these differences were not seen in chronic infarct. We believe that the high collagen content of dense infarct renders it <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> and therefore insensitive to the tissue preparation. We demonstrate this hypothesis by analyzing our data using well-established mixture models. The results of this analysis indicate {{that the majority of the}} current resides in the extracellular space when making dielectric measurements on chronically infarcted tissue. ...|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{factors of}} female wasps that are {{injected}} into hosts with their eggs at oviposition {{play a major}} role in strategies used by insect parasitoids to overcome host immunity, and to regulate host physiology during early stages of parasitism. Here, we attempted to precisely determine and compare the protein patterns injected by the endoparasitoid Aphidius ervi into two different host systems. Chitosan beads of aphid size designed as artificial and <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> hosts were used as oviposition medium, to be compared with the natural aphid host as young nymphs of Macrosiphum euphorbiae. Proteins that the A. ervi wasp injects into hosts at oviposition were separated by SDS–PAGE, complemented with pro- teomic techniques. Analyses confirm the identification of A. ervi c-glutamyl transpeptidase (c-GT) as a key component in the venom of the endoparasitoid. Using proteomic techniques, the quantity of c-GT injected by the A. ervi wasp into aphids along with the egg was estimated as approximately 4 ng per ovi- position strike. We suggest that similar quantities suffice to explain natural parasitization success in A. ervi, which do not rely on polydnavirus to establish into hosts. Moreover, an enolase that showed a high level of sequence identity with teratocyte A. ervi enolase was detected both in chitosan beads extracts, and in extracts of mature eggs excised from the A. ervi ovaries, but not in its venom glands extracts. Detecting enolase shortly after oviposition in the artificial inert hosts at a stage of parasitism when the A. ervi egg is still in the primary chorionated undifferentiated stage suggests the enolase as a chorionic protein of the mature egg. The possible functions of this enolase enzyme for the establishment and early development of A. ervi in aphid hosts are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) are challenging to measure, as macromolecular solutes in blood may be metabolized or transported by various cells in the kidney. Urinary solute concentrations generally reflect the cumulative influence of multiple transport processes rather than the intrinsic behavior of the GFB alone. Synthetic tracer molecules which are not secreted, absorbed, or modified by the kidney are useful tools. Ficoll, a globular polymer of epichlorohydrin and sucrose, is round, <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert,</b> and easily labeled, making it a nearly ideal glomerular probe. Fissell et al. reported filtration data suggesting that Ficoll was not as spherical as had been previously suggested (Fissell WH, Manley S, Dubnisheva A, Glass J, Magistrelli J, Eldridge AN, Fleischman AJ, Zydney AL, Roy S. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 293 : F 1209 –F 1213, 2007). More recently, two investigators published comparisons of neutral and anionic Ficoll clearance that suggest Ficoll may undergo conformational changes when chemically derivatized (Asgeirsson D, Venturoli D, Rippe B, Rippe C. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 291 : F 1083 –F 1089, 2006; Guimaraes MAM, Nikolovski J, Pratt LM, Greive K, Comper WD. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 285 : F 1118 –F 1124, 2003). To investigate Ficoll's characteristics further, we examined two commercial preparations, Ficoll 70 and Ficoll 400, by size-exclusion chromatography using a differential refractive index detector combined with light-scattering and viscosity detectors. A slope of 0. 45 {{was obtained from the}} plot of the logarithm of molecular mass against the logarithm of root-mean square radius. The Mark-Houwink exponent values of 0. 34 and 0. 36 were calculated for Ficoll 70 and Ficoll 400, respectively. These results suggest Ficoll's conformation in physiological saline solution is likely intermediate between a solid sphere and a well-solvated linear random coil. The measurements help explain our previous observations and guide interpretation of in vivo experiments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Elastin-like polypeptides are {{synthetic}} biopolymers {{composed of}} a repeating pentapeptide 'VPGXG' sequence that are valuable for the simple non-chromatographic purification of recombinant proteins. In addition, elastin-like polypeptide fusions {{have been shown to}} enhance the accumulation of a range of different recombinant proteins in plants, thus addressing the major limitation of plant-based expression systems, which is a low production yield. This study's main objectives were to determine the general utility of elastin-like polypeptide protein fusions in various intracellular compartments and to elucidate elastin-like polypeptide's mechanism of action for increasing recombinant protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum of plants. Results The effect of elastin-like polypeptide fusions on the accumulation of green fluorescent protein targeted to the cytoplasm, chloroplasts, apoplast, and endoplasmic reticulum was evaluated. The endoplasmic reticulum was the only intracellular compartment in which an elastin-like polypeptide tag was shown to significantly enhance recombinant protein accumulation. Interestingly, endoplasmic reticulum-targeted elastin-like polypeptide fusions induced the formation of a novel type of protein body, which may be responsible for elastin-like polypeptide's positive effect on recombinant protein accumulation by excluding the heterologous protein from normal physiological turnover. Although expressed in the leaves of plants, these novel protein bodies appeared similar in size and morphology to the prolamin-based protein bodies naturally found in plant seeds. The elastin-like polypeptide-induced protein bodies were highly mobile organelles, exhibiting various dynamic patterns of movement throughout the cells, which were dependent on intact actin microfilaments and a functional actomyosin motility system. Conclusion An endoplasmic reticulum-targeted elastin-like polypeptide fusion approach provides an effective strategy for depositing large amounts of concentrated heterologous protein within the limited space of the cell via storage in stable protein bodies. Furthermore, encapsulation of recombinant proteins into <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> organelles can function to insulate the protein from normal cellular mechanisms, thus limiting unnecessary stress to the host cell. Since elastin-like polypeptide is a mammalian-derived protein, this study demonstrates that plant seed-specific factors are not required for the formation of protein bodies in vegetative plant tissues, suggesting that the endoplasmic reticulum possesses an intrinsic ability to form protein body-like accretions in eukaryotic cells when overexpressing particular proteins. </p...|$|E
40|$|Phosphate (H 2 PO 4 -), as {{a source}} of {{phosphorous}} {{is one of the most}} critical macronutrients for plants. However, it is frequently not readily available to plants as it is often found in low concentrations and bound to other components of the soil. Therefore plants have developed strategies to adjust to phosphate starvation with a range of adaptations such as alterations of primary root length, number of lateral roots or secretion of organic acids. Additionally, phosphate-depleted plants increase the expression of genes involved in phosphate acquisition, e. g. phosphate transporters and purple acid phosphatases. Phosphite (H 2 PO 3 -) is a more reduced form of phosphorous than phosphate. Although <b>physiologically</b> <b>inert</b> and not metabolised, phosphite is able to suppress the phosphate starvation response which results in an exacerbated phosphate depletion leading to a inhibition of plant growth. Similarly, phosphite can lead to toxicity at elevated levels, likely through interference with phosphate-dependent reactions or remobilisation. These observations indicate a recognition and uptake capacity of the plant for phosphite similar to that of phosphate. In addition, phosphite is used as a fungicide against plant pathogens, especially oomycetes such as Phytophthora species, which have devastating effects in agriculture and ecosystems (e. g. Phytophthora Dieback). Phytophthora species are a major threat for Australia’s biodiversity with more than 3000 species under threat in the Western Australia alone. So far the only reliable measure to control these pathogens has proven to be phosphite for which the mode of action is yet to be elucidated. To gain a better understanding on the effects of phosphite on plant growth and defence we have started to investigate the natural genetic variation of phosphite-sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana. Findings from this research will improve our knowledge of the mode of action of phosphite on plant defence responses, and might also have implications for the understanding of phosphate signalling or metabolism. Investigations into the genetic background of phosphite-dependent adaptation have been made by observing the phenotypic responses of 19 different Arabidopsis accessions. We will present first results obtained by screening for root phenotypes on media containing a range of phosphite / phosphate ratios...|$|E
