40|$|AbstractThe OMG's Model-Driven Architecture is a <b>strategy</b> <b>towards</b> <b>interoperability</b> across {{heterogeneous}} middleware platforms {{through the}} reuse of platform independent designs {{based on the}} distinction of, and transformation between, platform-independent and platform-specific models. A corresponding strategy for model-driven testing requires a similar structure to facilitate, besides the generation of test cases and oracles, the execution of tests on different target platforms. In this paper, we discuss different aspects of such a strategy in a specific instance: the development of web-based distributed applications. In particular, we will be concerned {{with the problem of}} reusing platform-independent test cases and test oracles and with the generation of oracles from executable models...|$|R
40|$|Research has {{revealed}} the entanglement of e-government strategy and information infrastructure {{and that the}} control of infrastructures often remains an illusion as actual development and implementation is challenged by a constant drift. However, guidelines for public sector CIOs {{how to deal with}} these challenges remain scarce: Are governments well advised using architectures and other conceptualizations as tools in a top-down implementation of an infrastructure based on a preset interoperability strategy? Or should governments rather develop contextual strategies that build on the understanding of the actual drift of infrastructures and employ selected architectures only as facilitators for stakeholder communication during the next phase of interoperability achievement? In view of nowadays available theoretical reflections, the case of Egypt is analyzed to examine the role of service-oriented architecture in the control and drift of the G 2 G infrastructure. Findings reveal that what at first seemed to be an immature vendor-driven “technology-first ” approach with a clear absence of IT governance strategy, in retrospect can be considered as the appropriate choice of architecture because it has successfully impacted agendas of most local stakeholder to move into the direction of e-government interoperability. Attempting to generalize, it is suggested that <b>strategies</b> <b>towards</b> e-government <b>interoperability</b> should select architectures based on reflection of the specific implementation context: to embrac...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{necessity}} of achieving greater interoperability among the European Union (EU) Member States’ public services, the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) was created. This framework provides guidelines to projects <b>towards</b> cross-border <b>interoperability</b> of EU Member States. One of such projects is the e-CODEX. The purpose of this thesis is, therefore, to assess how useful the EIF is, how e-CODEX stands in compliance to the EIF and ultimately answer whether the e-CODEX should fulfill its intended purpose or not. To answer these questions, I divided the research in two distinct sections: the first one compares the EIF against the American initiative <b>towards</b> <b>interoperability,</b> the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA); and the second one assesses {{to what extent the}} e-CODEX follows the EIF and to what extent the EIF covers e-CODEX’s needs {{in the form of a}} questionnaire sent to experts in e-CODEX’s Member States. By the conclusion, I summarize the findings in each section, derive some new findings by combining the previous ones, and finally suggest some recommendations and a topic for future research...|$|R

40|$|Why do some {{mediation}} <b>strategies</b> <b>towards</b> spoilers {{in internal}} conflicts fail, while others succeed? The {{aim of this}} thesis is to examine how the mediation <b>strategies</b> <b>towards</b> spoilers affect the outcome of internal conflicts through {{the analysis of the}} mediator and spoiler behaviour. The analytical point of departure is the explanatory behavioural variables: spoiler type, spoiler locus, mediator impartiality or bias, and mediator leverage through resources. These are analyzed and compared in the case studies of Angola and Mozambique with the purpose of building theoretical developments on internal conflict resolution through mediation <b>strategies</b> <b>towards</b> spoilers. The research has showed that the correct diagnosis of spoiler type and the related mediation strategy is crucial for success. Meanwhile, a change in spoiler locus through changing leadership can influence the spoiler behaviour and the outcome. Furthermore, the cases have shown that mediator impartiality is most likely to lead to an outcome of success. Finally, the issue of mediator leverage depends on their adequate control and possession o...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to examine}} whether <b>strategy</b> <b>towards</b> primary {{stakeholders}} and their salience influence corporate social responsibility towards the corresponding stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through a questionnaire from 150 senior level managers including CEOs. The stakeholder management strategy, salience, and corporate social responsibility were assessed {{in the context of}} employees, customers, investors, community, natural environment, and suppliers. Findings – The favorable <b>strategy</b> <b>towards</b> stakeholders increases the corresponding corporate social responsibility towards them. The salience of all stakeholder groups also enhances the corresponding corporate social responsibility. When salience and strategy are considered, the salience of a particular stakeholder group suppresses the effect of strategy fully or partially on corporate social responsibility. Research limitations/implications – The salience of a stakeholder is a potent antecedent of corporate social responsibility compared with <b>strategy</b> <b>towards</b> that stakeholder. Originality/value – A questionnaire is developed to assess corporate social responsibility in the Indian context, and the link between strategy, salience, and corporate social responsibility is established.
