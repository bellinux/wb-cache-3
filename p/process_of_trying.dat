2500|$|Several critics {{noticed that}} the new album sounds {{different}} from Zola Jesus' earlier works. [...] "I just wanted to try out new ways to produce and different ways to write. And with this new record it's a lot more stripped down and there are way more acoustic elements as opposed to no acoustic elements.

Speaking to Prefix Magazine after her performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival, {{she said she wanted}} the album to be a step forward. [...] "n doing that, there was so, so much trial and error and so much quitting music {{at the end of the}} day", she admitted. Danilova said that the title of the album (meaning [...] "moving forward" [...] in Latin) appeared before the work on it began.

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a person a {{question}} such as [...] "What is your name?", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when someone asks a person a question such as [...] "What {{was the fifth}} dinosaur ever discovered?", the person also automatically knows {{that he or she}} does not know the answer. [...] A person knowing that he or she does not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not know the answer to. In other words, people are {{aware of the fact that}} they do not know certain information and do not have to go through the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to find the answer within their memories, since they know the information in question will never be remembered. One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that he or she knows that the target information is in memory. With regards to knowing that you don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory.|$|E

Teyla, who was held captive by Michael, gives birth to Torren John and escapes with her team, before they are able to cripple Michael. Eventually, he invades Atlantis with a commandeered Puddle Jumper to take Torren and destroy Atlantis but, thanks to the efforts of Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay, Michael is finally killed. The season also {{introduces}} a group of rogue Asgard, who unlike their Ida counterparts, actually experiment on humans to prolong their lives, and steal a device known as [...] "The Attero device" [...] to destroy the Wraith, though the side effect is that any Stargate activated after the device has been turned on will explode. The device is eventually destroyed. With the Attero device, Michael and the Hoffan drug, the Wraith have become weakened, and are no longer the power of the galaxy they once were; this gives the humans of the Pegasus galaxy freedom enough to establish a coalition. McKay falls in love with Keller, who eventually reciprocates his feelings, and they become romantically involved. In the season finale (also the series finale), [...] "Enemy at the Gate", Todd the Wraith alerts Atlantis to the fact that an underling wraith possesses a Hive Ship powered by a ZPM. [...] In the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to retrieve the ZPM and disable the Hive, the Atlantis team is present when the Hive receives a communication sent from an alternate reality giving away Earth's location.
