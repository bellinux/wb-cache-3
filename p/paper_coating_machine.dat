40|$|Moisture depth {{profiling}} {{in paper}} using near-infrared spectroscopy A near-infrared spectroscopic method and measurement system for moisture depth profiling {{is presented in}} this work. The measurement system {{is based on a}} fibre-optic light source and probes, and a hyper-spectral imaging spectrograph. The probes feature six different measure-ment geometries, including a specular reflection measurement, and diffuse reflection and transmission measurements. A theoretical analysis of the depth profiling capabilities of the system is presented, as well as laboratory tests of the system performance. Based on these, the analysis depth of the reflection moisture measurement in a 75 µm thick uncoated paper is estimated to be about 40 µm. The measurement system was installed in a <b>paper</b> <b>coating</b> <b>machine</b> to measure the moisture depth profile, specular reflection intensity and diffuse reflection intensity in seven positions simultaneously.

40|$|Plant {{proteins}} from leguminous {{seeds are}} a highly interesting {{raw material for}} <b>paper</b> <b>coating</b> processes. Due to their high molecular weight and their amphotheric character they can act as binder and co-binder in <b>paper</b> <b>coating</b> formulations for offset or rotogravure papers. At present, plant proteins are used only in small amounts as the runnability on industrially used high-speed <b>coating</b> <b>machines</b> is limited. To overcome this situation, both protein isolates and protein based binders have to be evaluated regarding rheological characteristics under high-shear conditions. Solubility behaviour nd rheological characteristics will be presented. Relults are pointing out, that the solubility can be enhanced when dissociating the globulin protein fraction into sub-units with reduced molecular weight. The rheological behaviour will be discussed using standard binder formulations with varying binder content at different temperatures...|$|R

The obtained particles were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Coating colors were formulated from the prepared unmodified and modified calcium carbonates and examined by creating a thin coating layer on reference paper. The effect of calcium carbonate particle size and surface modification on paper properties, such as coating thickness, coating weight, surface roughness, air permeability, brightness, whiteness, opacity, and hydrophobicity, were investigated and compared with commercial ground (GCC) calcium carbonate-coated papers. The results show that the obtained calcium carbonate nanoparticles are in the calcite phase. The morphology of the prepared calcium carbonate nanoparticles is rhombohedral, and the average particle diameter is less than 100 nm. Compared to commercial GCC, the use of unmodified and CTAB-and oleate-modified calcium carbonate nanoparticles in <b>paper</b> <b>coating</b> improves the properties of paper. The highest measured paper properties were observed for <b>paper</b> <b>coated</b> with oleate-modifed nanoparticles, where an increase in smoothness (decrease in paper roughness) (+ 23 %), brightness (+ 1. 3 %), whiteness (+ 2. 8 %), and opacity (+ 2. 3 %) and a decrease in air permeability (− 26 %) was obtained with 25 % less coat weight.
