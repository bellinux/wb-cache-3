40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies of adoptees {{have the}} {{potential}} to disentangle the contributions of genetic versus family environmental factors in the familiar transmission of coronary heart disease (CHD) because adoptees do not share the same family environment as their biological parents. The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to examine the risk of CHD in adopted men and women with at least one biological <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> CHD and (2) to examine the risk of CHD in adopted men and women with at least one adoptive <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> CHD. METHODS: The Swedish Multigenerational register was used to follow all Swedish-born adoptees (born in or after 1932, n = 80, 214) between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 2008, for CHD. The risk of CHD was estimated in adopted men and women with at least one biological <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> CHD and adopted men and women with at least one adoptive <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> CHD. The control groups consisted of adopted men or women without a biological <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> CHD or adopted men or women without an adoptive <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> CHD. RESULTS: Adopted men and women with at least one biological <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> CHD (n = 749) were 1. 4 to 1. 6 times (statistically significant, 95 % CI) more likely to have CHD than adoptees without a biological <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> CHD. In contrast, men and women with at least one adoptive <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> CHD (n = 1, 009) were not at increased risk of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: These findings (based on validated hospital diagnoses unbiased by recall) suggest that the familiar transmission of CHD from parents to offspring is more related to genetic factors than to family environmental factors...|$|R

Method: A questionnaire survey methodology was used. Variable sets included caregiving context (e. g. additional parental illness, family responsibilities, parental functional impairment, choice in helping), social support (network size, satisfaction), stress appraisal, coping (problem solving, seeking support, acceptance, wishful thinking, denial), and positive (life satisfaction, positive affect, benefits) and negative (distress, health) adjustment outcomes. Results: Caregiving context variables significantly correlated with poorer {{adjustment in}} children of a <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> multiple sclerosis included additional parental illness, higher family responsibilities, parental functional impairment and unpredictability of the parent 2 ̆ 7 s multiple sclerosis, and less choice in helping.

Compared with children of 2 ̆ 7 healthy 2 ̆ 7 parents, children of a <b>parent</b> <b>with</b> multiple sclerosis reported greater family responsibilities, less reliance on problem solving and seeking social support coping, higher somatization and lower life satisfaction and positive affect.
