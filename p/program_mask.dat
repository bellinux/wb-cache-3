For example, the original subroutine call instructions BAL, Branch and Link, and its register-register equivalent, BALR, Branch and Link Register, store certain status information, the instruction length code, the condition code and the <b>program</b> <b>mask,</b> {{in the top}} byte of the return address. A BAS, Branch and Store, instruction was added to allow 31-bit return addresses.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Primary emphasis {{during the period}} {{has been given to}} completing the resource and land use mask overlays for ultimate subsite MSS data extraction and analysis, refining the computer <b>mask</b> <b>program,</b> verifying resultant <b>masks,</b> and evaluating the initial subsite data. Standard deviations for the selected subsites were generally reduced significantly when compared to the values for the overall 7 km x 7 km test site areas. This indicates that the masking technique has been successful in reducing the variability of the ERTS- 1 MSS data for ultimate subsite comparisons with ground data. The techniques used to locate the 7 km x 7 km test site areas and extract masked subsite data apparently limit the ability to reliably locate identical very small subsite areas for temporal comparisons. Current evidence indicates that areas which include less than about four pixel elements in either dimension are probably unreliable...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of English, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} {{will demonstrate}} how normative discourse and neoliberal ideology {{have contributed to}} the construction and maintenance of a prison literacy complex. Justice has been swept out of the prison system in favor of a rhetorical apparatus of hegemony and capitalism, while education, particularly the acquisition of specific literacies, has been positioned as the solution to crime and the means of securing social mobility. I contend that while most writing, literacy, and arts programs do help a handful of current prisoners to better deal with their situations, they do little to challenge the systems of distribution, surveillance, and control that incarcerate millions, and, in some cases, educational programs reinforce these mechanisms. By assuming deficits in the prisoner and positing literacy as remediation or as therapy, these <b>programs</b> <b>mask</b> systemic privilege and stratification as (an exigency of) crime. Teaching prisoners to counter racist exclusion by accepting their plight or changing their behavior perpetuates the neoliberal apparatus of mass incarceration. By rhetorically analyzing two interconnected community literacy programs in the Pacific Northwest, this project will demonstrate how, through an ideological reframing, literacy programs can "queer" their pedagogy to interrupt the ideologies necessary to the maintenance of the prison industrial complex. The counter-hegemonic memories of marginalized communities can reveal inconsistencies and instabilities in popular "truths. " By bringing excluded, silenced voices out from behind bars, critical, community literacy efforts can effect a queer(ed), public pedagogy to inspire the widespread, historicized criticism necessary for sustainable change.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on {{automated}} techniques to enhance the fault-tolerance of a nonmasking fault-tolerant <b>program</b> to <b>masking.</b> A <b>masking</b> <b>program</b> continually satisfies its specification even if faults occur. By contrast, a nonmasking program merely guarantees that after faults stop occurring, the program recovers to states from where it continually satisfies its specification. Until the recovery is complete, however, a nonmasking program can violate its (safety) specification. Thus, the problem of enhancing fault-tolerance from nonmasking to masking requires that safety be added and recovery be preserved. We focus on this enhancement problem for high atomicity programs –where each process can read all variables – and for distributed programs –where restrictions are imposed on what processes can read and write. We present a sound and complete algorithm for high atomicity programs and a sound algorithm for distributed programs. We also argue that our algorithms are simpler than previous algorithms, where masking fault-tolerance is added to a fault-intolerant program. Hence, these algorithms can partially {{reap the benefits of}} automation when the cost of adding masking fault-tolerance to a fault-intolerant program is high. To illustrate these algorithms, we show how the <b>masking</b> fault-tolerant <b>programs</b> for triple modular redundancy and Byzantine agreement can be obtained by enhancing the fault-tolerance of the corresponding nonmasking versions. We also discuss how the derivation of these programs is simplified when we begin with a nonmasking fault-tolerant program...|$|R

There are no clear instructions on tuning Spark to gain the best performance. Our focus here is on anonymization operations only. Different tasks and applications may require different steps of tuning. In MDSBA, our focus is grouping, ungrouping, and masking data. These three main operations should be organized properly to give the best possible performance. Both ungrouping and <b>masking</b> require UDF <b>programs.</b> In <b>masking,</b> the algorithms should consider the least number of iteration and the smallest size of data.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{fabricate}} defect-free mask blanks is a well-recognized challenge in enabling extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) for semiconductor manufacturing. Both the specification and reduction of defects necessitate {{the understanding of}} their printability {{and how they are}} generated and grow during Mo-Si multilayer (ML) deposition. A ML phase defect can be depicted by its topographical profile on the surface as either a bump or pit, which is then characterized by height or depth and width. The complexity of such seemingly simple phase defects lies in the many ways they can be generated and the difficulties of measuring their physical shape/size and optical effects on printability. An effective way to study phase defects is to use a <b>programmed</b> defect <b>mask</b> (PDM) as 'model' test sample where the defects are produced with controlled growth on a ML blank and accurate placement in varying proximity to absorber patterns on the mask.
