40|$|ObjectiveA bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film</b> {{reduces the}} extent and {{severity}} of postoperative adhesions in infants undergoing repeat sternotomy. Resorption of the bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film,</b> however, leaves no barrier between the sternum and the epicardium. A sheet of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene is used by many surgeons to create a physical barrier between the sternum and the cardiac structures. We hypothesized that placing bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film</b> beneath an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene pericardial membrane would both decrease pericardial adhesions and provide a physical barrier. MethodsA novel combination of bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film</b> underneath an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane was tested in an established rabbit model of pericardial adhesion formation. After sternotomy, a portion of pericardium was resected and the epicardium was abraded. Rabbits (n =  36) {{were randomly assigned to}} 4 treatment groups: control group, no bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film</b> or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene; bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film</b> group; expanded polytetrafluoroethylene group; and bioresorbable polymeric film + expanded polytetrafluoroethylene group. At 4 weeks post-sternotomy, pericardial adhesions were scored grossly for area and density of adhesions using an established 4 -point (0 – 3) grading system. ResultsThe bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film</b> group had a significant reduction in mean adhesion score compared with the control group (control =  2. 86 ± 0. 37 vs bioresorbable polymeric film =  0. 57 ± 0. 53, P < . 0001) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene group (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene =  2. 75 ± 0. 46 vs bioresorbable polymeric film =  0. 57 ± 0. 53, P < . 0001). The bioresorbable polymeric film + expanded polytetrafluoroethylene group had a low adhesion profile similar to the bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film</b> group (bioresorbable polymeric film + expanded polytetrafluoroethylene =  1. 0 ± 0, vs bioresorbable polymeric film =  0. 57 ± 0. 53), but a considerably lower mean adhesion score than the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene group (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene =  2. 75 ± 0. 46, vs bioresorbable polymeric film + expanded polytetrafluoroethylene =  1. 0 ± 0, P < . 0001). ConclusionsPlacement of bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film</b> resulted in minimal pericardial adhesions compared with controls. The placement of bioresorbable <b>polymeric</b> <b>film</b> underneath expanded polytetrafluoroethylene at the time of sternal closure provides a novel combination to reduce {{the extent and}} severity of pericardial adhesions while providing a physical barrier between the sternum and the cardiac structures...|$|E

40|$|Flexible <b>polymeric</b> <b>films</b> are {{not only}} widely used in {{conventional}} packaging as substitute for glass and aluminum foil packaging but are also proposed as encapsulation for novel products, like flexible solar cells or organic light-emitting devices. The two essential properties of the polymeric packaging are flexibility and good permeation barrier properties against gases and vapors. This article deals with vacuum web coating as a common way of increasing barrier properties of <b>polymeric</b> <b>films</b> and the problems related to this procedure. Defects caused by particles and surface imperfections are found to dominate the permeation rate for such coated <b>polymeric</b> <b>films.</b> Atomic force microscopy, electron and also optical microscopy was used for analysis of the coating layer.

In most cases the defects can be treated as independent of each other. The gas permeability of vacuum web-coated <b>polymeric</b> <b>films</b> can be quantitatively predicted by a simple formula.
