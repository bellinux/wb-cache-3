5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
