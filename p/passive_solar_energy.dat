40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>Energy</b> {{presents}} {{an introduction to}} all aspects of <b>solar</b> <b>energy,</b> from photovoltaic devices to active and <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> thermal <b>energy</b> conversion, giving both a detailed and broad perspective of the field. It is aimed at the beginner involved in <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> or a related field, or for someone wanting to gain a broader perspective of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> technologies. A chapter considering solar radiation, basic principles applied to <b>solar</b> <b>energy,</b> semiconductor physics, and light absorption brings the reader on equal footing with the technology of either solar generated electrical current or useful heat. Details of how a solar cell works and then production of current from a photovoltaic device is discussed. Characterization of a solar cell is examined, allowing one the ability to interpret the current-voltage relation, followed by discussion of parameter extraction from this relation. This information {{can be used to}} understand what limits the performance of a given solar cell with the potential to optimize its performance. Applications of <b>solar</b> thermal <b>energy</b> are reviewed in detail from passive applications, for example the solar chimney, to active, such as the solar (power) tower, flat plate water heater, and solar thermal electricity generation. Consistency of analysis between the solar thermal applications is used enabling the reader to fully appreciate similarities and dissimilarities between these technologies. Ultimately, the scientist or engineer can understand existing systems, either photovoltaic or solar thermal devices, and design their own technology given the information in this book...|$|R
40|$|Lightweight {{envelopes}} {{are widely}} used in modern buildings but they lack sufficient thermal capacity for <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> utilization. An attractive solution to increase the building thermal capacity is to incorporate phase change material (PCM) into the building envelope. In this paper, a simplified theoretical model is established to optimize an interior PCM for energy storage in a lightweight <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> room. Analytical equations are presented to calculate the optimal phase change temperature and {{the total amount of}} latent heat capacity and to estimate the benefit of the interior PCM for energy storage. Further, as an example, the analytical optimization is applied to the interior PCM panels in a direct-gain room with realistic outdoor climatic conditions of Beijing. The analytical results agree well with the numerical results. The analytical results show that: (1) the optimal phase change temperature depends on the average indoor air temperature and the radiation absorbed by the PCM panels; (2) the interior PCM has little effect on average indoor air temperature; and (3) the amplitude of the indoor air temperature fluctuation depends on the product of surface heat transfer coefficient hin and area A of the PCM panels in a lightweight <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> room. <b>Energy</b> storage Analytical Optimization PCM Lightweight envelope <b>Passive</b> <b>solar</b> room...|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} {{of this technology}} has been developed to be more environmentally friendly, primarily {{through the use of}} <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> and gravity. Brine is streamed down the outside of towers, where it absorbs water from the air. The brine then enters a chamber and subjected to a partial vacuum and heated. The water vapor is collected and condensed, while the renewed brine is recirculated through the system. As the condensed water is removed from the system using gravity, it creates the vacuum which lowers the boiling point of the brine.|$|E
50|$|The goal {{of using}} solar access in urban {{planning}} {{is to create}} well-designed urban districts that assure exposure of buildings' elevations and public spaces to the sun during a desired period of the year. Urban areas that do not consider solar access may cause discomfort inside buildings and on the street, as well as increase energy consumption for lighting and heating, {{due to the lack}} of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>energy.</b> On the other hand, as a result, buildings without solar access may also have less solar heat gain and thus reduced cooling load.|$|E

50|$|One {{historical}} {{example of}} in-hill earth shelters would be Mesa Verde, {{in the southwest}} United States. These building are constructed directly onto the ledges and caves {{on the face of}} the cliffs. The front wall is built up with local stone and earth to enclose the structure. Similarly today, in-hill earth shelter construction utilizes the natural formation of a hillside for two to three of the exterior walls and sometimes the roof of a structure. Alternative builders craft a type of in-hill structure known as an Earthship. In Earthship construction, tires rammed with earth are used as structural materials for three of the walls and generally have a front façade of windows to capture <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
50|$|New {{buildings}} can {{be constructed}} using passive solar building design, low-energy building, or zero-energy building techniques, using renewable heat sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient {{through the use of}} insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly hot water heaters and furnaces), double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows, external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as shallow geothermal and <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees. This saves energy because it cools buildings and reduces the urban heat island effect thus reducing the use of air conditioning.|$|E
