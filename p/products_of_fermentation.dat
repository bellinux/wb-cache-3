In order to get adequate amounts of the vitamin, orally administered pills or fortified foods such as cereals and soy milk, are recommended for vegans.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{fermentation}} of {{sparkling wine}} begins {{like most other}} wines, though winemakers may choose to use specially cultivated sparkling wine yeasts. The wines may go through malolactic fermentation, though producers wishing to make fruitier, simpler wines will usually forgo this step. After fermentation the base wines are then blended to form a cuvee. While there are examples of varietal sparkling wines, such as blanc de blancs (white of whites) made from 100% Chardonnay, most sparkling wines are blends of several grape varieties, vineyards and vintages. Producers with wide access to grapes will use wines from several hundred base wines to create a blend that reflect the [...] "house style" [...] of their non-vintage wine. It is through the initiation of a secondary fermentation that distinguishes sparkling wine production and gives the wine its characteristic [...] "bubbles". One of the by <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> {{is the creation of}} carbon dioxide gas. While this gas is able to be released during the first fermentation, efforts are taken during the second fermentation to retain the gas and have it dissolve into the wine. This creates a high pressure within the wine bottle (on average around 5 atmospheres) and wine producers take care to package the wine in strong glass bottles. When the wine is open and poured into a glass, the gas is released and the wine becomes sparkling.|$|E

6000|$|During {{the same}} time it {{gradually}} became clear that the presence of sugar was essential to the production of alcohol and the evolution of carbonic acid gas, which are the two great and conspicuous <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation.</b> And finally, in 1787, the Italian chemist, Fabroni, made the capital discovery that the yeast ferment, the presence of which is necessary to fermentation, is what he termed a [...] "vegeto-animal" [...] substance--or is a body which gives off ammoniacal salts when it is burned, and is, in other ways, similar to the gluten of plants and the albumen and casein of animals.|$|E
60|$|But, without presuming {{to discuss}} a {{question}} which leads us into the very arcana of chemistry, {{the present state of}} speculation upon the modus operandi of the yeast plant in producing fermentation is represented, on the one hand, by the Stahlian doctrine, supported by Liebig, according to which the atoms of the sugar are shaken into new combinations either directly by the Toruloe, or indirectly, by some substance formed by them; and, on the other hand, by the Thénardian doctrine, supported by Pasteur, according to which the yeast plant assimilates part of the sugar, and, in so doing, disturbs the rest, and determines its resolution into the <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Perhaps the two views are not so much opposed as they seem at first sight to be.|$|E
60|$|Thus Lavoisier {{thought he}} had {{demonstrated}} that the carbonic acid and the alcohol which are produced {{by the process of}} fermentation, are equal in weight to the sugar which disappears; but the application of the more refined methods of modern chemistry to the investigation of the <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> by Pasteur, in 1860, proved that this is not exactly true, {{and that there is a}} deficit of from 5 to 7 per cent of the sugar which is not covered by the alcohol and carbonic acid evolved. The greater part of this deficit is accounted for by the discovery of two substances, glycerine and succinic acid, of the existence of which Lavoisier was unaware, in the fermented liquid. But about 1-1/2 per cent. still remains to be made good. According to Pasteur, it has been appropriated by the yeast, but the fact that such appropriation takes place cannot be said to be actually proved.|$|E

50|$|Typically, the fermenting mass of fruit—called {{the motor}} or kicker in prison parlance—is {{retained}} from batch to batch {{to make the}} fermentation start faster. The more sugar that is added, the greater {{the potential for a}} higher alcohol content—to a point. Beyond this point, the waste <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> (mainly alcohol) cause the motor to die or go dormant as the yeasts' environment becomes too poisoned for them to continue fermenting. This also causes the taste of the end product to suffer. Ascorbic acid or Vitamin C powder is sometimes used to stop the fermentation at a certain point, which, combined with the tartness of the added acid, somewhat enhances the taste by reducing the cloyingly sweet flavor associated with pruno.|$|E
50|$|Fermentation is less {{efficient}} at using the energy from glucose: only 2 ATP are produced per glucose, {{compared to the}} 38 ATP per glucose nominally produced by aerobic respiration. This is because the waste <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> still contain chemical potential energy that can be released by oxidation. Ethanol, for example, can be burned in an internal combustion engine like gasoline. Glycolytic ATP, however, is created more quickly. For prokaryotes to continue a rapid growth rate when they are shifted from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic environment, they must increase {{the rate of the}} glycolytic reactions. For multicellular organisms, during short bursts of strenuous activity, muscle cells use fermentation to supplement the ATP production from the slower aerobic respiration, so fermentation may be used by a cell even before the oxygen levels are depleted, {{as is the case in}} sports that do not require athletes to pace themselves, such as sprinting.|$|E
