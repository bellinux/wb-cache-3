His easygoing authoritarian regime, where political prisoners were almost nonexistent, was well accepted by the population.

According to the World Bank, the population living below the <b>poverty</b> <b>threshold</b> went from 11% in 1985 to 31% by 1993. Despite the implementation of certain measures, such as the reduction of the number of young French workers (who worked abroad while serving in the military) from 3,000 to 2,000 in 1986, allowing many jobs to go to young Ivorian graduates, the government failed to control the rising rates of unemployment and bankruptcy in many companies.|$|E

25|$|The Syrian {{crisis has}} {{significantly}} affected Lebanese {{economic and financial}} situation.

The financial constraints were also felt: the poverty rate increased with 170.000 Lebanese falling under the <b>poverty</b> <b>threshold.</b> In the period between 2012 and 2014, the public spending increased by $1 billion and losses amounted to $7.5 billion.

25|$|Rises in {{the costs}} of living make poor people less able to afford items. Poor people spend a greater portion of their budgets on food than wealthy people.

For example, in late 2007 increases {{in the price of}} grains led to food riots in some countries. The World Bank warned that 100 million people were at risk of sinking deeper into poverty. Threats to the supply of food may also be caused by drought and the water crisis. Intensive farming often leads to a vicious cycle of exhaustion of soil fertility and decline of agricultural yields. Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. In Africa, if current trends of soil degradation continue, the continent might be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to United Nations University's Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa.
