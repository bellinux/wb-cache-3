5000|$|Hypophosphatemia is an {{electrolyte}} {{disturbance in}} which there is an abnormally low level of phosphate in the blood. The condition has many causes, but is most commonly seen when malnourished patients (especially chronic alcoholics) are given large amounts of carbohydrates, which creates a high phosphorus demand by cells, removing phosphate from the blood (refeeding syndrome). Because a decrease in phosphate in the blood is sometimes associated with an increase in phosphate in the urine, the terms hypophosphatemia and [...] "phosphaturia" [...] are occasionally used interchangeably; however, this is improper since there exist many causes of hypophosphatemia besides overexcretion and <b>phosphaturia,</b> and in fact the most common causes of hypophosphatemia are not associated with <b>phosphaturia.</b>|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in normal dogs to {{characterize}} the mechanisms by which sodium bicarbonate administration results in increased excretion of phosphate. Infusion of sodium bicarbonate alone increased fractional phosphate excretion from 0. 8 to 29. 3 %. During bicarbonate administration, ionized calcium fell and mean parathyroid hormone values increased from 59. 6 to 230. 4 muleq/ml. In {{the same group of}} dogs, administration of sodium bicarbonate plus calcium prevented the fall in ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels remained unchanged. In these dogs fractional phosphate excretion increased from 2. 4 to only 4. 9 %. Similar results were obtained in thyroparathyroidectomized dogs receiving sodium bicarbonate. In these dogs fractional excretion of phosphate increased from 0. 6 to 4. 5 %. Under all three experimental conditions no differences were observed in sodium or bicarbonate excretion or in urinary or plasma pH. Administration of hydrochloric acid, after <b>phosphaturia</b> had been induced by the infusion of bicarbonate, resulted in a decrease in plasma bicarbonate and an acid urine; however, the <b>phosphaturia</b> persisted even in the presence of an acid urine pH. In five thyroparathyroidectomized dogs infused with parathyroid hormone throughout, administration of identical amounts of sodium as either NaCl or NaHCO 3 resulted in a similar degree of <b>phosphaturia</b> despite significant differences in urine pH. These experiments suggest that a rise in parathyroid hormone levels, resulting from a fall in ionized calcium, is the major mechanism by which bicarbonate administration produces <b>phosphaturia.</b> An increased natriuresis per nephron, as a consequence of extracellular fluid volume expansion, contributes to the <b>phosphaturia.</b> On the other hand, alkalinization of the urine does not {{play a significant role in}} the <b>phosphaturia</b> seen after bicarbonate administration...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To present {{experimental}} {{evidence in support}} of a proposed common cause for absorptive hypercalciuria, renal hypercalciuria, renal phosphate leak and enhancement of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 -vitamin D concentrations in patients presenting with renal stone disease; and to suggest further investigation with a view to new management. METHODS: An oral calcium loading test was administered to 15 patients with renal stones and 10 normal controls in the fasting state: urine and blood were collected hourly. After the second urine sample, 400 mg calcium dissolved in water was administered orally. Serum calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and phosphate were measured together with urine calcium clearance and urinary phosphate from which the TmPO 4 /glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ratio was calculated. Serum 1, 25 -(OH) 2 -vitamin D was measured in the first serum sample. In addition, 24 hour urine calcium results were collected retrospectively from the patients' case notes over the previous 18 months. RESULTS: In the basal state, renal stone patients had an overall greater <b>phosphaturia</b> (lower TmPO 4 /GFR: median 1. 72 compared with 2. 10 in controls) and increased calcium clearance. Serum corrected calcium and PTH concentrations did not differ between the groups. After calcium loading, serum calcium and urine calcium clearance rose in both groups, with patients with renal stones experiencing a greater percentage fall in <b>phosphaturia.</b> In both groups TmPO 4 /GFR fell (greater <b>phosphaturia)</b> with increased serum corrected calcium, with the patients showing notably greater <b>phosphaturia</b> for any given calcium concentration. Patients also had notably greater <b>phosphaturia</b> compared with the serum calcium concentration for any given PTH value. Serum 1, 25 -(OH) 2 -vitamin D was higher in patients than controls and for any 1, 25 -(OH) 2 -vitamin D concentration <b>phosphaturia</b> measured against serum calcium was greater in patients than controls. 1, 25 -(OH) 2 -vitamin D did not correlate with <b>phosphaturia</b> relative to serum calcium concentrations within the patient and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria have an "inappropriately' high phosphate excretion for any given serum calcium concentration. Loss of phosphate may induce increased activation of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 -vitamin D. Some of the commonly described causes of stone formation may be manifestations of a single mechanism...|$|E

The aims of this study were to assess whether <b>phosphaturia</b> relates to urinary metabolic abnormalities and recurrent stone formation.

Urine values for <b>phosphaturia</b> that were higher than 95 % of the normal control values were defined as indicating hyperphosphaturia, and the effect of <b>phosphaturia</b> on urinary metabolites and stone recurrence was determined.

We investigated mineral, endocrine, and renal responses during the first 4 hours after intravenous and intragastric Pi loading in rats. Intravenous Pi loading (0. 5 mmol) caused a transient rise in plasma Pi levels and creatinine clearance and an increase in <b>phosphaturia</b> within 10 minutes. Plasma calcium levels fell and PTH levels increased within 10 minutes and remained low or high, respectively. Fibroblast growth factor- 23, 1, 25 -(OH) 2 -vitamin D 3, and insulin concentrations did not respond, but plasma dopamine levels increased by 4 hours. In comparison, gastric Pi loading elicited similar but delayed <b>phosphaturia</b> and endocrine responses but did not affect plasma mineral levels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and examined the endocrine and phosphorus metabolism of 35 {{patients with}} PFD/MAS. We report on the age at which extremity fractures occurred and their location and treatment. The results of endocrine and phosphorus metabolism testing and associations between age of first fractures, number of fractures, fracture rate, and metabolic abnormalities were noted. RESULTS: The average follow-up was 14. 2 years (range, 2 - 39 years), during which 172 fractures occurred. The number and sites of fractures were 103 femoral, 25 tibial, 33 humeral, and 11 forearm. Twenty-seven patients had PFD with one or more endocrinopathies and/or <b>phosphaturia,</b> and eight had PFD alone. The endocrinopathies included precocious puberty (n = 19), hyperthyroidism (n = 9), growth hormone excess (n = 6), and one patient each with Cushing syndrome and primary hyperparathyroidism. Twelve patients had <b>phosphaturia.</b> The peak rate of fractures occurred between 6 and 10 years of age and decreased thereafter. Patients with metabolic abnormalities sustained their first fracture at an earlier age (6. 9 versus 16. 6 years, p < 0. 005) and had a higher lifetime rate of fractures (0. 29 versus 0. 08 fractures/year), relative to patients with PFD alone. <b>Phosphaturia</b> was the single metabolic dysfunction associated with both an earlier age of first fracture (5. 1 versus 16. 6 years, p < 0. 05) and a greater lifetime fracture rate (0. 35 versus 0. 08 fractures/year, p < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>phosphaturia</b> induced by cAMP infusion and the physiological role of extracellular cAMP in modulation of renal phosphate transport were examined. In cultured opossum kidney cells, extracellular cAMP (10 - 1, 000 microM) inhibited Na-dependent phosphate uptake in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The effect of cAMP was reproduced by ATP, AMP, and adenosine, and was blunted by phosphodiesterase inhibitors or by dipyridamole which inhibits adenosine uptake. [3 H]cAMP was degraded extracellularly into AMP and adenosine, and radioactivity accumulated in the cells as labeled adenosine and, subsequently, as adenine nucleotides including cAMP. Radioactivity accumulation was decreased by dipyridamole and by inhibitors of phosphodiesterases and ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase, assessing {{the existence of}} stepwise hydrolysis of extracellular cAMP and intracellular processing of taken up adenosine. In vivo, dipyridamole abolished the <b>phosphaturia</b> induced by exogenous cAMP infusion in acutely parathyroidectomized (APTX) rats, decreased phosphate excretion in intact rats, and blunted <b>phosphaturia</b> induced by PTH infusion in APTX rats.

40|$|FAMILIAL VITAMIN D-resistant rickets with hy-pophosphatemia {{presents}} {{the challenge of}} apparently simple genetics but multi-organ sites of expression of the disorder.

How, then, does one account in a unifying way for the findings of [1] de-creased net renal tubular reabsorption of phos-phate (which presumably is the explanation for the hypophosphatemia), [2] decreased intestinal reabsorption of calcium, [3] the bony abnor-malities consisting not only of rickets or osteo-malacia but also of other histological changes and bony overgrowth, and [4] the response of calcium absorption and rickets, but not the <b>phosphaturia,</b> to large doses of vitamin D? Among possible pathogenetic concepts, most interest has centered around two opposing views. First, the primary disorder may be a renal tubu-lar defect in reabsorption of phosphate, the other changes being secondary phenomena (al-though the way hypophosphatemia might pro-duce defective calcium absorption is particu-larly speculative). Or, second, the primary dis-order may be in calcium absorption, and the <b>phosphaturia</b> is then due to secondary hyper-parathyroidism. In support of the latter view is the report in this issue by Falls, Carter, Rector, and Seldin (1), in which they provide further evidence that prolonged, large infusions of cal-cium will decrease the <b>phosphaturia</b> in patients with this disorder in whom response to usual calcium infusions is absent or minimal. This evidence suggests a sluggishness of response of parathyroids consistent with chronic secondary hyperparathyroidism. That <b>phosphaturia</b> was ultimately reduced to low levels would argue against, but not conclusively exclude, a primary tubular defect (that is, net phosphate reabsorp-tion might still have been subnormal if hypo-phosphatemia was still present).

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which phosphorus homeostasis is preserved in mammals are not completely understood. We demonstrate {{the presence of a}} mechanism by which the intestine detects the presence of increased dietary phosphate and rapidly increases renal phosphate excretion. The mechanism is of physiological relevance because it maintains plasma phosphate concentrations in the normal range after ingestion of a phosphate-containing meal. When inorganic phosphate is infused into the duodenum, there is a rapid increase in the renal fractional excretion of phosphate (FE Pi). The phosphaturic effect of intestinal phosphate is specific for phosphate because administration of sodium chloride does not elicit a similar response. <b>Phosphaturia</b> after intestinal phosphate administration occurs in thyro-parathyroidectomized rats, demonstrating that parathyroid hormone is not essential for this effect. The increase in renal FE Pi in response to the intestinal administration of phosphate occurs without changes in plasma concentrations of phosphate (filtered load), parathyroid hormone, FGF- 23, or secreted frizzled related protein- 4. Denervation of the kidney does not attenuate <b>phosphaturia</b> elicited after intestinal phosphate administration. <b>Phosphaturia</b> is not elicited when phosphate is instilled {{in other parts of the}} gastrointestinal tract such as the stomach. Infusion of homogenates of the duodenal mucosa increases FE Pi, which demonstrates the presence of one or more substances within the intestinal mucosa that directly modulate renal phosphate reabsorption.

40|$|Evidence for a PTH-independent humoral {{mechanism}} in post-transplant hypophosphatemia and <b>phosphaturia.</b> BackgroundPatients undergoing successful kidney transplantation often manifest overt hypophosphatemia associated with exaggerated <b>phosphaturia</b> {{during the early}} post-transplant period (2 weeks to 3 months). The mechanism for this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that a circulating serum factor [non-parathyroid hormone (non-PTH) ], which operates during chronic renal failure (CRF) to maintain phosphate (Pi) homeostasis, can increase fractional excretion of Pi (FEPO 4) in normal functioning kidney grafts during the early post-transplant period, thereby causing <b>phosphaturia</b> and hypophosphatemia. MethodsFive groups of patients were studied: control subjects (group 1, N = 16), “early” (2 weeks to 1 month) post-transplant patients (group 2, N = 22), “late” (9 to 12 months) post-transplant patients (group 3, N = 14), patients with advanced CRF (glomerular filtration rate = 30 to 40 mL/min; group 4, N = 8), and patients who suffered from end-stage renal failure and were treated by chronic hemodialysis (group 5, N = 14). Group 2 manifested significant hypophosphatemia and <b>phosphaturia</b> when compared with groups 1 and 3 (Pi = 0. 9 ± 0. 003 mg/dL, FEPO 4 = 68 ± 5 %, P < 0. 0005 vs. groups 1 and 3). Sera were taken {{from each of the}} five subject groups and applied to the proximal tubular opossum kidney (OK) cells. The activity of Na/Pi-type 4 (that is, OK-specific type II transporter) was evaluated by measuring Na+-dependent 32 Pi flux. The expression of Na/Pi type II mRNA and the abundance of Na/Pi protein were determined by Northern and Western blot assays, respectively. ResultsWhen compared with sera from groups 1 and 3, 10 % sera taken from groups 2, 4, and 5 (incubated overnight with OK cells) inhibited 32 Pi flux by 25 to 30 % (P < 0. 0003). Both Na/Pi mRNA and the expression of Na/Pi protein were markedly augmented under the same conditions (P < 0. 05 groups 2, 4, and 5 vs. groups 1 and 3). Time-course analysis revealed that the up-regulation of Na/Pi protein by sera from groups 2, 4, and 5 was observed as early as four hours of incubation, whereas augmented abundance of Na/Pi mRNA was only seen after eight hours of incubation. The addition of PTH (1 - 34) to sera from groups 2, 4, and 5 abolished the augmented expression of NaPi protein. We labeled OK cell surface membrane proteins with N-hydroxysuccinimide bound to biotin (NHS-SS-biotin). Biotinylated transporters incubated with the different sera were precipitated by strepavidin and identified by Western blot analysis. Cells incubated in sera from group 2 showed increased membrane bound transporter when compared with control sera, whereas the intracellular pool of the transporter was comparable between the two groups.

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular calcifi cation (CVC) is a {{frequent}} complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Abnormalities in vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation and hyperphosphoremia are all supposed to contribute to CVC. Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF- 23) is a phosphaturic glycoprotein, linked to phosphate and vitamin D metabolism as well as poor outcome in CKD. We investigated association between FGF- 23 and cardiac valvular calcifi cation in moderate CKD. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 (60 men; mean age of 51 ± 4. 6 years) CKD stage IIIB-IV patients were enrolled and underwent laboratory (25 -OH Vitamin D, Klotho, FGF- 23, CRP, serum calcium and phosphorus, iPTH, <b>phosphaturia)</b> and echocardiography testing to assess mineral metabolism such as mitral and aortic valve calcifi cation. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used. Finally, Receiving Operating Curve (ROC) {{was used to test}} the model performance. Results: Overall mean serum calcium (9, 2 ± 0, 4 mg/dl), phosphorus (4, 3 ± 0, 2 mg/dl) 25 OH vitamin D (34, 8 ± 13, 5 ng/ml) and iPTH (59, 11 ± 8, 6 pg/ml) were within the reference ranges. Serum FGF- 23 and Klotho mean values were 10, 4 ± 1, 7 pg/ml and 887, 8 ± 110, 3 pg/ml, respectively. <b>Phosphaturia</b> was 1, 043 ± 258 g/day. At univariable and multivariable adjusted analyses, aortic but not mitral valve calcifi cation was associated with FGF- 23 levels. Notably, Klotho, iPTH, 25 OH Vitamin D, serum phosphorous, <b>phosphaturia</b> and CRP were not associated with either valvular calcifi cation. Conclusions: Our data suggests that FGF- 23 but not Klotho is strongly and independently associated with aortic valvular calcifi cation. Future studies should test whether therapeutic strategies aimed at lowering FGF 23 (diet, phosphate binders, calcimimetics) can affect calcifi cation progression and cardiovascular damage...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 9 -year-old child with lysinuric protein {{intolerance}} and Fanconi syndrome. She was referred to our hospital with a persistent metabolic acidosis and polyuria. Renal investiga-tions revealed all laboratory signs of Fanconi syndrome, with glucosuria, generalized aminoacidur-ia, <b>phosphaturia</b> and severe hypercalciuria. The diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome was confirmed by a renal biopsy that showed extensive lesions of proximal tubular epithelial cells with vacuolation of these cells and a sloughing of the brush border...|$|E
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of glomerular filtrated phosphate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Posttransplant <b>phosphaturia</b> is common and aggravated by sirolimus immunosuppression. The cause of sirolimus induced <b>phosphaturia</b> however remains elusive. Male Wistar rats received sirolimus or vehicle for 2 or 7 days (1. 5 mg/kg). The urine phosphate/creatinine ratio was higher and serum phosphate was lower in sirolimus treated rats, fractional excretion of phosphate was elevated and renal tubular phosphate reabsorption was reduced suggesting a renal cause for hypophosphatemia. PTH was lower in sirolimus treated rats. FGF 23 levels were unchanged at day 2 but lower in sirolimus treated rats after 7 days. Brush border membrane vesicle phosphate uptake was not altered in sirolimus treated groups or by direct incubation with sirolimus. mRNA, protein abundance, and subcellular transporter distribution of NaPi-IIa, Pit- 2 and NHE 3 were not different between groups but NaPi-IIc mRNA expression was lower at day 7. Transcriptome analyses revealed candidate genes that could {{be involved in the}} phosphaturic response. Sirolimus caused a selective renal phosphate leakage, which was not mediated by NaPi-IIa or NaPi-IIc regulation or localization. We hypothesize that another mechanism such as a basolateral phosphate transporter may b...|$|E
40|$|Hypophosphatemia is {{a genetically}} {{heterogeneous}} disease. Here, we mapped an autosomal recessive form (designated ARHP) to chromosome 4 q 21 and identified homozygous mutations in DMP 1 (dentin matrix protein 1), which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes. Intact plasma {{levels of the}} phosphaturic protein FGF 23 were clearly elevated in two of four affected individuals, providing a {{possible explanation for the}} <b>phosphaturia</b> and inappropriately normal 1, 25 (OH) 2 D levels and suggesting that DMP 1 may regulate FGF 23 expression...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of multisystem pathologic conditions and epidermal nevi, {{known as the}} epidermal nevus syndrome, includes disorders of bone, central nervous system, eye, kidney, vasculature and skin. Rarely, congenital nevomelanocytic nevus also known as hairy nevus has also been reported in association with hypophosphatemic rickets. Studies suggest that <b>phosphaturia,</b> caused by circulating factors, called "phosphatonins" may be secreted by an epidermal or hairy nevus. We report here, a rare case of hypophosphatemic rickets associated with a giant hairy nevus in a 10 -year-old boy...|$|E
40|$|Postmenopausal women {{consistently}} {{have higher}} phosphorus levels than similarly aged men. As {{it is known}} that estradiol induces <b>phosphaturia</b> in rodents, we evaluated the cross-sectional association of sex hormones with serum phosphorus in 1346 community-living older men (mean age 76) of which 18 % had moderate (stage 3) kidney disease. Using linear regression with serum phosphorus levels as the dependent variable, we found that for each 10 pg/ml higher total estradiol level there was a statistically significant 0. 05 mg/dl lower serum phosphorus when adjusted for age, ethnicity, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, calcium, estimated glomerular filtration rate, intact parathyroid hormone, 25 (OH) vitamin D, bone mineral density, and alkaline phosphatase. These results were similar in individuals with or without chronic kidney disease. Serum testosterone concentrations were also statistically significantly associated with lower serum phosphorus levels. We confirmed these results in an independent sample of 2555 older men, wherein these associations were not attenuated when adjusted for fibroblast growth factor- 23 levels. Hence, our study of community-living older men suggests that estradiol may directly or indirectly induce <b>phosphaturia</b> in humans. The mechanism responsible for the association of testosterone with serum phosphorus remains to be determined.

40|$|Soft-tissue {{calcification}} is {{a prominent}} feature in both {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) and experimental Klotho deficiency, but whether Klotho deficiency {{is responsible for the}} calcification in CKD is unknown. Here, wild-type mice with CKD had very low renal, plasma, and urinary levels of Klotho. In humans, we observed a graded reduction in urinary Klotho starting at an early stage of CKD and progressing with loss of renal function. Despite induction of CKD, transgenic mice that overexpressed Klotho had preserved levels of Klotho, enhanced <b>phosphaturia,</b> better renal function, and much less calcification compared with wild-type mice with CKD. Conversely, Klotho-haploinsufficient mice with CKD had undetectable levels of Klotho, worse renal function, and severe calcification. The beneficial effect of Klotho on vascular calcification was a result of more than its effect on renal function and phosphatemia, suggesting a direct effect of Klotho on the vasculature. In vitro, Klotho suppressed Na+-dependent uptake of phosphate and mineralization induced by high phosphate and preserved differentiation in vascular smooth muscle cells. In summary, Klotho is an early biomarker for CKD, and Klotho deficiency contributes to soft-tissue calcification in CKD. Klotho ameliorates vascular calcification by enhancing <b>phosphaturia,</b> preserving glomerular filtration, and directly inhibiting phosphate uptake by vascular smooth muscle. Replacement of Klotho may have therapeutic potential for CKD...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to evaluate the effects of dietary available phosphorus (aP) and PTH infusion rates on avian urinary inorganic phosphate (Pi) excretion. In experiment I, female domestic fowl were fed diets containing low (0 - 45 %) or high (0 - 83 %) aP for 2 - 4 weeks prior to renal function studies. Pi excretion was significantly higher for birds fed the high-aP diet than for birds fed the low-aP diet. PTH was infused (60 - 240 units kg body mass &quot; 1 h &quot; 1) unilaterally into the renal portal system. Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), included in the unilateral infusate as a marker for effective renal portal perfusion, indicated that PTH. must have been delivered to the peritubular surfaces of the infused kidney. However, bilateral but not unilateral <b>phosphaturia</b> occurred, {{and there were no}} significant differences in the phosphaturic responses to PTH when low- and highaP diet treatment groups were compared. In experiment II, PTH was infused at rates of l-Sunitsh &quot; 1. Infusing PTH at 5 unitsh- 1 caused a unilateral increase in urine flow but the phosphaturic response was still bilateral. It appears unlikely that unilateral renal portal PTH infusions can be used to trigger unilateral <b>phosphaturia</b> in domestic fowl...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanisms of}} cadmium (Cd) nephrotoxicity are poorly understood. In {{this study we}} investigated the cellular causes of the Cd-induced <b>phosphaturia</b> in the rat. Compared to controls, Cd-treated rats (2 mg Cd/kg body weight, s. c. for 14 days) showed a marked polyuria, proteinuria and <b>phosphaturia.</b> As studied by the rapid filtration technique in isolated cortical brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV), Na+-gradient-driven uptake of phosphate ([32 Pi]) and of [3 H] glucose were markedly decreased in Cd-treated rats, whereas uptake of sulphate ([35 S]) remained unchanged. By Western blotting of BBMV proteins and by indirect immunocytochemistry in 4 -micron thick frozen fixed kidney sections, using an antibody against the type II Na/Pi-cotransporter (NaPi- 2), we found a diminished expression of this protein in the brush-border membrane from Cd-treated rats. How ever, {{the expression of the}} water channel aquaporin 1, estimated from the specific antibody staining in brush-border membranes, remained unchanged by Cd. Northern blot analysis showed a strong reduction of 2. 7 kb NaPi- 2 -related mRNA in Cd-affected kidneys. Our data indicate that: (1) Cd may reduce reabsorption of Pi in proximal tubules by affecting the expression of the functional Na/Pi-cotransporters in the luminal membrane, and (2) Cd effects on brush-border transporters are selective...|$|E
40|$|The {{injection}} of sodium maleate (200 - 400 mg/kg) into rats produces aminoaciduria along with glycosuria and <b>phosphaturia,</b> resembling the Fanconi syndrome. This experimental model was studied {{by means of}} microinjections into proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney, stop-flow diuresis, and microperfusion of single nephrons. Our results show that, in maleate-treated rats, competition between amino acids or related structures (L-proline, L-OH-proline, and glycine) possesses the same characteristics, and net influx of amino acids appear normal at the proximal nephron. Data obtained by classical stop-flow techniques and single nephron microperfusions also indicate a normal entry of labeled amino acids (L-lysine, glycine, L-valine, L-proline, L-cystine), and 3 - 0 -methyl-D-[3 H]glucose and [32 P]phosphate from the luminal side of the proximal tubule cell. However, the efflux of molecules from the cell appears enhanced throughout the proximal and distal tubule; molecules that exit at this site are excreted directly into the urine. Our {{results suggest that the}} <b>phosphaturia,</b> aminoaciduria, and glycosuria of the experimental Fanconi syndrome can be explained by a modification of the cell membrane permeability (increased efflux) at distal sites of the nephron rather than by a modification of the membrane transport (decreased influx) at the proximal sites, as is currently accepted. Our data also stress the importance of efflux phenomena in membrane transport...|$|E
