40|$|AbstractThe desired {{lifetime}} for CO 2 injection for sequestration {{is several}} decades {{at a high}} injection rate (up to 10 bbl/min or 2, 400 tons/day per injector). Government regulations and geomechanical design constraints may impose a limit on the injection rate such that, for example, the bottomhole pressure remains less than 90 % of the hydraulic fracture pressure. Despite injecting below the critical fracture pressure, fractures can nevertheless initiate and propagate due to a thermoelastic stress reduction caused by cool CO 2 encountering hot reservoir rock. Here we develop a numerical model to calculate whether mechanical and thermal equilibrium between the injected CO 2 and the reservoir evolves, such that fracture growth ceases. When such a condition exists, the model predicts the corresponding fracture geometry and time to reach that state. The critical pressure for fracture propagation depends on the thermoelastic stress, a function of rock properties and the temperature difference between the injected fluid and the reservoir (ΔT). Fractures will propagate {{as long as the}} thermoelastic stress and the fluid pressure at the fracture tip exceed a threshold; we calculate the extent of a fracture such that the tip pressure falls below the thermoelastically modified fracture <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure.</b> Fracture growth is strongly dependent upon the formation permeability, the level of injection pressure above fracture <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure,</b> and ΔT...|$|E

The calculation is confirmed by the well test data, suggesting that fracture <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure</b> is around 1910  psi.

The injection interval is slightly under-pressured. Pore pressure, suggested by drilling experience at about 2400  psi, is further confirmed by injection tests. The tests also show that interval breakdown pressure is about 5088  psi (2385  psi surface pressure), while fracture <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure</b> is close to 4613  psi (1910  psi surface pressure).

40|$|The recent {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico (2010) and the {{resulting}} environmental vandalism and massive economical loss, highlight the engineering challenges in deep subsea operations. In Australia, 80 % of hydrocarbon reserve is located in frontier deep subsea regions. Safe and economical realisation of these resources requires innovative engineering solutions suitable for platform-free operations. Long and deep subsea pipelines can experience a number of structural instabilities such as lateral and upheaval buckling, spanning and buckle propagation. Among these, buckle propagation result in a catastrophic failure of {{a long stretch of}} the pipeline. A local buckle, ovalization, dent or corrosion in the pipe wall can quickly transform the pipe cross-section into a dumb-bell shape that travels along the pipeline as long as the external pressure is high enough to sustain propagation. The lowest pressure that maintains propagation is the <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure</b> which is {{only a small fraction of}} the elastic collapse pressure of the intact pipe. This results in a substantial increase in material and installation cost of the pipeline, since design is therefore governed by <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure.</b> A number of solutions to mitigate buckle propagation (and the necessary increase in wall-thickness were proposed such as buckle arrestors, pipe-in-pipe system, sandwich pipe system and ring-stiffened pipelines. This thesis investigates buckle propagation in deep subsea pipelines. An experimental work is conducted to determine buckle initiation and buckle propagation pressures in hyperbaric chamber test using aluminium and steel sample pipes with various diameter-to-thickness ratios (D/t). Intact and dented pipes are used in these tests to determine imperfection sensitivity of buckle propagation. Based on experimental observations, a modification to the available analytical solution of buckle propagation is proposed that accounts for circumferential bending as well as circumferential membrane actions. Nonlinear finite element (FE) modelling of the hyperbaric chamber tests was conducted and the predicted FE results of initiation and propagation pressures were verified against the experimental results. In order to increase the buckle propagation capacity and alleviate the inherent imperfection sensitivity, two issues that are relevant to deep subsea pipelines, a novel form of pipeline is proposed. The new form is a textured pipeline which is cylindrical in the global sense with local textured rather than smooth wall. Nonlinear FE analysis is used to evaluate the performance of textured pipeline. Based on obtained results, the textured pipeline offer superior performance in comparison to a conventional cylindrical pipe made of the same material and the same D/t ratio...|$|E
40|$|External {{pressure}} loadings in sub-sea pipelines {{can generate}} catastrophic structural instabilities such as propagation buckling. This failure mode is typified by a pipe collapse (snap-through phenomenon) that occurs at an initiation pressure PI and a subsequent propagation {{of the collapse}} to pipe ends that occurs at a <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure</b> PP. Recent {{studies have shown that}} pipelines with a textured geometry, corresponding to the post-buckled shape of a thin-walled cylindrical pipe under axial compression, are able to substantially increase PI, PP, and thus resistance to propagation buckling, compared to conventional smooth pipelines. This study investigates the performance of alternative post-buckled shapes observed in thin-walled pipelines under hydrostatic loading. These shapes correspond closely to a geometric family known as curved-crease origami and so a geometric definition is developed to map geometric parameters from origami to pipelines. A numerical analysis is then conducted on two curved-crease forms and comparative smooth and textured forms. Textured and smooth numerical models show good correspondence with previously reported post-buckling behaviour. One curved crease form is shown to have an increase in PP that is 10. 8 % greater than the textured pipeline and 131. 8 % greater than smooth...|$|E

In the Tournemire case an attempt was made to include in the model the main features of the site (natural fractures, fault core, tunnel).

This problem shares the same features as a family of other problems such as propagating buckles in long metal tubes under external pressure, propagating necks in some polymeric materials when pulled in tension, phase transition, and kink band formation and propa-gation in layered structures and fibre-reinforced composites. Whereas {{the determination of the}} <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure</b> through the equal-area rule is now universally accepted, there is still some uncertainty concern-ing the determination of the pressure (the initiation pressure) at which bulging first occurs. Kyriakides and Chang (1990) took this pressure to be the limiting pressure corresponding to the first turning point in the pressure-volume diagram for uniform inflation, but this value was found to be slightly higher than what had been observed in the experiments. Existing instability and bifurcation results were discussed by Kyriakides and Chang (1990, 1991) but were found not to be relevant to the determination of the initiation pressure. This is probably because neither the bifurcation nor the stability analysis that has been conducted so far is able to describe correctly the bifurcation mode having zero wave number and it is in fact this mode that is relevant to the determination of the initiation pressure. This special mode is not sinusoidal — its correct variation can only be found from a near-critical nonlinear analysis...|$|E
40|$|Pore {{pressure}} {{and its relationship}} with fracture net pressure has been reported qualitatively from both field and experimental observations. From a modeling perspective, the ubiquitously used pseudo 3 D (P 3 D) models {{that are based on}} linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) do not include the effect of reservoir depletion (or overpressure). Models that utilize effective stress as propagation criteria with a cohesive zone description, introduce the pore pressure directly into the simulation and hence can potentially capture the effect of pore pressure on fracture propagation. This work investigates the effect of pore pressure on hydraulic fracturing net {{pressure and}} geometry using empirical and numerical simulation approaches. We carried out an analysis of more than 400 datafrac injections spanning a wide range of geological ages and depositional environments in order to investigate the relationship between observed net pressure and reservoir pore pressure. The net fracture <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure</b> from the fracture treatment analysis was seen to be correlated with the effective stress in the reservoir. Fracture propagation simulations were performed using a coupled finite element – finite difference fracture simulator. The code uses a cohesive zone model (CZM) to describe fracture propagation. Four different effective stress scenarios were used to study the effect of effective stress on net pressure. The simulation results closely match the empirical relation between net pressure and effective stress as obtained from the analysis of actual frac treatment data. It is observed from the simulations that the magnitude of the effective stress also has an effect on the fracture geometry with a high effective stress leading to wider, shorter and more radial fractures. The derived empirical correlation is hence useful as a fracture design parameter. The datafrac net pressure diagnostics workflow in the pseudo 3 D models can incorporate local tip pore pressure as a new pressure matching parameter. The pore pressure effect can thus explain high net pressures routinely observed in frac operations and also as a containment mechanism. </p...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. February 2010. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Emmanuel Detournay. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 198 pages, appendices A-C. This research deals with {{an analysis of}} the problem of a fluid-driven fracture propagating through a poroelastic medium. Formulation of such model of an hydraulic fracture is at the cross-road of four classical disciplines of engineering mechanics: lubrication theory, filtration theory, fracture mechanics, and poroelasticity, which includes both elasticity and diffusion. The resulting mathematical model consists of a set of non-linear integro-differential history-dependent equations with singular behaviour at the moving fracture front. The main contribution of this research is a detailed study of the large-scale 3 D diffusion around the fracture and its associated poroelastic effects on fracture propagation. The study hinges on scaling and asymptotic analyses. To understand the behavior of the solution in the tip region, we study a semi-infinite fracture propagating at a constant velocity. We show that, in contrast to the classical case of the Carter's leak-off model (1 D diffusion), the tip region of a finite fracture cannot, in general, be modeled by a semi-infinite fracture when 3 D diffusion takes place. Moreover, 3 D diffusion does not permit separation of the problem into two regions: the tip and the global fracture. We restrict our study of the fracture propagation to an investigation of two limiting cases: zero viscosity and zero toughness. We show that large-scale 3 D diffusion and its associated poroelastic effects can significantly affect the fracture evolution. In particular, we observe a significant increase of the net fracturing fluid pressure compared to the case of 1 D diffusion due to the porous medium dilation. Another consequence of 3 D diffusion is the possibility of fracture arrest. Indeed, the fracture stops propagating at large time, when the fracturing fluid injection rate is balanced by the leak-off rate at pressure below the critical <b>propagation</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|E
