50|$|As in any {{algebraic}} theory, one of {{the main}} problems of the theory of semigroups is the classification of all semigroups and a complete description of their structure. In the case of semigroups, since the binary operation is required to satisfy only the associativity property the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> is considered extremely difficult. Descriptions of structures have been obtained for certain special classes of semigroups. For example, the structure of the sets of idempotents of regular semigroups is completely known. Structure descriptions are presented in terms of better known types of semigroups. The best known type of semigroup is the group.|$|E

50|$|Systematic biology (hereafter called simply systematics) is {{the field}} that (a) {{provides}} scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c) preserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations.

50|$|Multicriteria {{classification}} (sorting) {{is one of}} {{the problems}} considered within MCDA and can be stated as follows: given a set of objects evaluated by a set of criteria (attributes with preference-order domains), assign these objects to some pre-defined and preference-ordered decision classes, such that each object is assigned to exactly one class. Due to the preference ordering, improvement of evaluations of an object on the criteria should not worsen its class assignment. The sorting problem is very similar to the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification,</b> however, in the latter, the objects are evaluated by regular attributes and the decision classes are not necessarily preference ordered. The problem of multicriteria classification is also referred to as ordinal classification problem with monotonicity constraints and often appears in real-life application when ordinal and monotone properties follow from the domain knowledge about the problem.|$|E
50|$|Professor Thomas Gram Bell Kelly was {{the first}} library {{historian}} to address the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> and nomenclature of libraries in his book Early public libraries: a history of public libraries in Great Britain before 1850. Leeds Library (founded 1768) a private subscription or proprietary library, is {{also referred to as}} a public library and a circulating library, illustrating the need for a taxonomy that is not confusing. The major classifications, based on ownership are endowed libraries, institutional libraries (the most diverse), public libraries, and subscription libraries. Without tax from the community a library may be created with a gift or endowment, by subscription, or by adding it on to an existing structure or institution which also serves other purposes. Cost is assumed by the donor or donors in an endowed library; it is assumed by the users in a subscription library, and could or could not be assumed by the users depending on the function of the institution, these variations could be combined in some cases. Private libraries are not covered by Kelly due to individual or small group ownership and his focus on the 'public' aspect of these institutions.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> of the nilpotent class 2 finitely generated torsion free groups up to the geometric equivalence. By a very easy technique it is proved that this problem {{is equivalent to the}} <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> of the complete (in the Maltsev sense) nilpotent torsion free finite rank groups up to the isomorphism. This result, allows us to once more comprehend the complication of the problem of the classification of the quasi-varieties of nilpotent class 2 groups. It is well known that the variety of a nilpotent class s (for every s) groups is Noetherian. So the problem of the classification of the quasi-varieties generated even by a single nilpotent class 2 finitely generated torsion free group, is equivalent to the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> of complete (in the Maltsev sense) nilpotent torsion free finite rank groups up to the isomorphism.

40|$|Maximal Abelian {{subgroups of}} Diagonalizable automorphisms of Lie algebra (so called MAD-groups) play {{the crucial role}} for {{construction}} of fine gradings of Lie algebra. Our aim is to give a description of MAD-groups for real forms of classical Lie algebras. We introduce four types of subgroups of matrices in Gl(n,C) called Out-groups, Ad-groups, Out∗-groups and Ad∗-groups. For each type of those subgroups we define a relation of equivalence. The <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> of all non-conjugate MAD-groups on real forms of sl(n,C), o(n,C) or sp(n,C) is transformed to the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> of these equivalence classes, which is presented here. ...|$|E
