5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the <b>purchaser</b> of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the <b>purchaser</b> could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E

40|$|The {{study has}} been done on behalf of and in {{cooperation}} with LRF Konsult. The {{purpose of the study was}} to try to find out how forest estate buyers valuated different parts of the estate at the time of the purchase and to see if it was possible to identify different trends between different kinds of <b>purchasers.</b> The study is delimited to Västerbotten County and all the purchases were made thru LRF Konsult. The background of the study is that the forest estate <b>purchasers</b> are paying more and more for the forest estates. The prices are often much higher than the net present value which means that they are paying for something more than just the timber value. The study is made with a questionnaire mailed to one hundred forest estate <b>purchasers.</b> Answers got returned from 48 of them. The questions in the questionnaire were about to how much and using what measurement the forest estate <b>purchasers</b> had valuated different parts of the estate at the purchasing moment. The results show that the main reason for purchasing the forest estate varies, most between the <b>purchasers</b> that were living in Västerbotten County and the <b>purchasers</b> that didn’t live in Västerbotten County. The <b>purchasers</b> that were living outside Västerbotten County thought that capital investment was the main reason for the purchase while the <b>purchasers</b> that were living in Västerbotten County thought that active use of the land was the main reason. Another result shows that the <b>purchasers</b> outside Västerbotten County valuated the forest lower than the <b>purchasers</b> living in Västerbotten. The buyers outside Västerbotten valuated the forest to 275 Swedish kronor per forest cubic meter while the <b>purchasers</b> from Västerbotten valuated the forest to 313 Swedish kronor per cubic meter...|$|R
