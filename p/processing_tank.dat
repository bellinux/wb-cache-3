40|$|A {{computer-controlled}} apparatus processes {{batches of}} soybeans into {{one or more}} of a variety of food products, under conditions that can be chosen by the user and reproduced from batch to batch. Examples of products include soy milk, tofu, okara (an insoluble protein and fiber byproduct of soy milk), and whey. Most processing steps take place without intervention by the user. This apparatus was developed for use in research on processing of soy. It is also a prototype of other soy-processing apparatuses for research, industrial, and home use. Prior soy-processing equipment includes household devices that automatically produce soy milk but do not automatically produce tofu. The designs of prior soy-processing equipment require users to manually transfer intermediate solid soy products and to press them manually and, hence, under conditions that are not consistent from batch to batch. Prior designs do not afford choices of processing conditions: Users cannot use previously developed soy-processing equipment to investigate the effects of variations of techniques used to produce soy milk (e. g., cold grinding, hot grinding, and pre-cook blanching) and of such process parameters as cooking times and temperatures, grinding times, soaking times and temperatures, rinsing conditions, and sizes of particles generated by grinding. In contrast, the present apparatus is amenable to such investigations. The apparatus (see figure) includes a <b>processing</b> <b>tank</b> and a jacketed holding or coagulation tank. The <b>processing</b> <b>tank</b> can be capped by either of two different heads and can contain either of two different insertable mesh baskets.

40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has a bench-scale {{crossflow}} filter {{installed in}} a shielded hot cell for testing radioactive feeds. During FY 97 experiments were conducted on slurries from radioactive Hanford waste from tanks C- 106, C- 107, B- 110, and U- 110. Each tank was tested at three slurry concentrations (8, 1. 5, and 0. 05 wt% solids). A two-parameter central composite design which tested transmembrane pressure from 5 to 40 psig and axial velocity from 3 to 9 ft/s was used for all feeds. Crossflow filtration was found to remove solids effectively, as judged by filtrate clarity and radiochemical analysis. If the filtrates from these tests were immobilized in a glass matrix, the resulting transuranic and ({sup 90 }Sr) activity would not breach low activity waste glass limits of 100 nCi/g (TRU) and 20 {mu}Ci/ml ({sup 90 }Sr). Two exceptions were the transuranic activity in filtrates from processing 1. 5 and 8 wt% C- 106 tank waste.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes require high amounts of steam. Design {{and operation of}} steam plants are particularly complex when the steam supply is required for short periods and with a varying time schedules. To fulfil the discontinuous needs of steam users, avoiding the steam boiler oversizing to the peak value of the steam request, a thermal energy storage (TES) system can be adopted. The proper sizing of TES systems, which, in this application, is constituted by a steam accumulator vessel installed between the steam generator and the consumer, cannot {{be based on the}} sole initial and final state conditions of the steam storage, since a performance prediction of the process time-evolution is also required. In this paper, a model of steam batch processes for industrial thermal treatments, able to describe unsteady operative conditions, is presented.

50|$|Fine bubble {{diffusers}} {{have largely}} replaced coarse bubble diffusers and mechanical aerators {{in most of}} the developed world and in much of the developing world. The exception would be in secondary treatment phases, such as activated sludge <b>processing</b> <b>tanks,</b> where 85 to 90 percent of any remaining solid materials (floating on the surface) are removed through settling or biological processes. The biological process uses air to encourage bacterial growth that would consume many of these waste materials, such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are dissolved in the wastewater. The larger air release openings of a coarse bubble diffuser helps to facilitate a higher oxygen transfer rate and bacterial growth. One disadvantage of using fine bubble diffusers in activated sludge tanks is the tendency of floc (particle) clogging the small air release holes.|$|R

40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the utilization of}} radioactively contaminated lead shot located at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) for radiation shielding on a radioactive liquid process tank located at Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W). The use of previously contaminated shot precludes the radioactive contamination of clean shot. With limited treatment and disposal options for contaminated lead shot, the reuse of lead for shielding is significant due to the inherent characteristic of becoming a mixed waste when radiologically contaminated. The INEL conducted a lead cleanup campaign in 1990. This was designed to ensure control of potential Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulated waste. Contaminated lead from throughout the INEL, was containerized per the lead Waste Acceptance Criteria at the generator sites. Limited areas at the INEL are designated for mixed waste storage. As a result, some of the lead was stored at the RWMC in the air support weather shield (ASWS). This lead was contaminated with small amounts of fission product contamination. The lead was {{in the form of}} shot, brick, sheet, casks, and other various sized pieces. In 1993, ANL-W identified a need for lead shot to be used as shielding in a radioactive liquid waste storage and <b>processing</b> <b>tank</b> at the Fuel Cycle Facility (FCF).

40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) has 49 {{high level}} waste (HLW) tanks {{that must be}} emptied, cleaned, and closed as {{required}} by the Federal Facilities Agreement. The current method of chemical cleaning uses several hundred thousand gallons per tank of 8 weight percent (wt%) oxalic acid to partially dissolve and suspend residual waste and corrosion products such that the waste can be pumped out of the tank. This adds a significant quantity of sodium oxalate to the tanks and, if multiple tanks are cleaned, renders the waste incompatible with the downstream <b>processing.</b> <b>Tank</b> space is also insufficient to store this stream given the large number of tanks to be cleaned. Therefore, a search for a new cleaning process was initiated utilizing the TRIZ literature search approach, and Chemical Oxidation Reduction Decontamination [...] Ultraviolet (CORD-UV), a mature technology currently used for decontamination and cleaning of commercial nuclear reactor primary cooling water loops, was identified. CORD-UV utilizes oxalic acid for sludge dissolution, but then decomposes the oxalic acid to carbon dioxide and water by UV treatment outside the system being treated. This allows reprecipitation and subsequent deposition of the sludge into a selected container without adding significant volume to that container, and without adding any new chemicals that would impact downstream treatment processes. Bench top and demonstration loop measurements on SRS tank sludge stimulant demonstrated the feasibility of applying CORD-UV for enhanced chemical cleaning of SRS HLW tanks...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies cyclic hoist {{scheduling}} {{problems in}} electroplating lines. Electroplating {{is a necessary}} process in producing printed circuit boards (PCBs). A number of computer controlled hoists mounted on a common track are responsible for transferring PCBs between processing tanks in an electroplating line. Scheduling the movement of these hoists is generally known as the Hoist Scheduling Problem (HSP). This thesis addresses a number of HSPs in cyclic production to minimize the cycle length. We first study the single-hoist problem with processing time windows and two extended features. The first extension is that each PCB can visit a <b>processing</b> <b>tank</b> more than once. The second is {{that more than one}} identical tank may be used for one processing stage. These extensions are common in practical electroplating lines and can increase the processing capacities of lines. We formulate the problem with all these features as a mixed integer programming model. Numerical examples show that the model can be solved to optimum within reasonable time. We then study multi-hoist problems. Problems with multiple hoists involve additional difficulties. One difficulty comes from the new decisions on assigning hoists to tasks. The other comes from the restriction on the relative positions of the hoists to avoid collision between them. We study the no-wait version of the problems in which the processing time and part transfer times are all fixed constants. For the two-hoist problem, we develop a polynomial algorithm to solve it based on comprehensive analysis of the non-collision requirements. For the no-wait multi-hoist scheduling problem with any number of hoists, we identify a group of assignment constraints for any given cycle length. The feasibility of the cycle length is determined by solving this group of constraints. A polynomial algorithm is then developed to search for the optimal cycle length and to construct an optimal schedule. The last problem discussed in the thesis is the multi-hoist problem with processing time windows. The introduction of time windows makes the problem NP-complete. We transform the non-collision requirements to some compact mathematical constraints and develop a mixed integer programming model for this problem. A numerical example shows that the model is solvable for problems with small size. Finally, we briefly discuss the extension of this study to other scheduling problems for further research. Two similar problems in container terminals with non-collision requirements are described...|$|E
50|$|However, {{over the}} past two decades, coarse bubble {{diffusers}} have been used less frequently, primarily due to the ever increasing cost of energy and the availability of more reliable, highly efficient fine bubble diffusers. Manufacturers of diffused aeration systems claim that converting from coarse bubble to fine bubble system should yield a 50 percent energy cost savings. Specifically, in aeration tanks, a system that utilizes coarse bubble diffusers requires 30 to 40 percent more process air than a fine bubble diffused air system to provide the same level of treatment. The exception would be in secondary treatment (or side processing) phases. In these <b>processing</b> <b>tanks,</b> floc particles, sediment and carbonate buildup tend to plug or clog the small air release openings on the fine bubble diffusers. Because of their small air openings, fine bubble diffusers cease to have an advantage. Currently, coarse bubble diffusers are the mainstay solution.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the models employed and analyses performed {{to estimate the}} source terms which would result from deflagrations in waste storage and <b>processing</b> <b>tanks</b> at the Savannah River Site (SRS).

The three main source generation mechanisms associated with waste tank deflagrations are: (1) entrainment from the liquid surface, (2) vaporization from the liquid surface, and (3) solids fire ignited {{as a result of the}} deflagration. The results of this work show that entrainment would be the dominant source term generation mode for cases where the liquid waste solution level is near the vent path. Vaporization would be the dominant mode for cases where the liquid level is lower. The maximum vaporization source term is approximately an order of magnitude less than that maximum entrainment source term. The source term associated with a solids fire would be insignificant in comparison...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{successfully}} {{demonstrated the}} chemistry and process equipment of the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) flowsheet using MaxCalix for the decontamination of high level waste (HLW). The demonstration was completed using a 12 -stage, 2 -cm centrifugal contactor apparatus at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). This represents the first CSSX process {{demonstration of the}} MaxCalix solvent system with Savannah River Site (SRS) HLW. Two tests lasting 24 and 27 hours processed non-radioactive simulated Tank 49 H waste and actual Tank 49 H HLW, respectively. Conclusions from this work include the following. The CSSX process is capable of reducing {sup 137 }Cs in high level radioactive waste {{by a factor of}} more than 40, 000 using five extraction, two scrub, and five strip stages. Tests demonstrated extraction and strip section stage efficiencies of greater than 93 % for the Tank 49 H waste test and greater than 88 % for the simulant waste test. During a test with HLW, researchers processed 39 liters of Tank 49 H solution and the waste raffinate had an average decontamination factor (DF) of 6. 78 E+ 04, with a maximum of 1. 08 E+ 05. A simulant waste solution ({approx} 34. 5 liters) with an initial Cs concentration of 83. 1 mg/L was processed and had an average DF greater than 5. 9 E+ 03, with a maximum DF of greater than 6. 6 E+ 03. The difference may be attributable to differences in contactor stage efficiencies. Test results showed the solvent can be stripped of cesium and recycled for {approx} 25 solvent turnovers without the occurrence of any measurable solvent degradation or negative effects from minor components. Based on the performance of the 12 -stage 2 -cm apparatus with the Tank 49 H HLW, the projected DF for MCU with seven extraction, two scrub, and seven strip stages operating at a nominal efficiency of 90 % is {approx} 388, 000. At 95 % stage efficiency, the DF in MCU would be {approx} 3. 2 million. Carryover of organic solvent in aqueous streams (and aqueous in organic streams) was less than 0. 1 % when <b>processing</b> <b>Tank</b> 49 H HLW. The entrained solvent concentration measured in the decontaminated salt solution (DSS) was as much as {approx} 140 mg/L, although that value may be overstated by as much as 50 % due to modifier solubility in the DSS. The entrained solvent concentration was measured in the strip effluent (SE) and the results are pending. A steady-state concentration factor (CF) of 15. 9 was achieved with Tank 49 H HLW. Cesium distribution ratios [D(Cs) ] were measured with non-radioactive Tank 49 H waste simulant and actual Tank 49 H waste. Below is a comparison of D(Cs) values of ESS and 2 -cm tests. Batch Extraction-Strip-Scrub (ESS) tests yielded D(Cs) values for extraction of {approx} 81 - 88 for tests with Tank 49 H waste and waste simulant. The results from the 2 -cm contactor tests were in agreement with values of 58 - 92 for the Tank 49 H HLW test and 54 - 83 for the simulant waste test. These values are consistent with the reference D(Cs) for extraction of {approx} 60. In tests with Tank 49 H waste and waste simulant, batch ESS tests measured D(Cs) values for the two scrub stages as {approx} 3. 5 - 5. 0 for the first scrub stage and {approx} 1. 0 - 3. 0 for the second scrub stage. In the Tank 49 H test, the D(Cs) values for the 2 -cm test were far from the ESS values. A D(Cs) value of 161 was measured for the first scrub stage and 10. 8 for the second scrub stage. The data suggest that the scrub stage is not operating as effectively as intended. For the simulant test, a D(Cs) value of 1. 9 was measured for the first scrub stage; the sample from the second scrub stage was compromised. Measurements of the pH of all stage samples for the Tank 49 H test showed that the pH for extraction and scrub stages was 14 and the pH for the strip stages was {approx} 7. It is expected that the pH of the second scrub stage would be {approx} 12 - 13. Batch ESS tests measured D(Cs) values for the strip stages to be {approx} 0. 002 - 0. 010. A high value in Strip No. 3 of a test with simulant solution has been attributed to issues associated with the limits of detection for the analytical method. In the 2 -cm contactor tests, the first four strip stages of the Tank 49 H waste test and all five strip stages in the simulant waste test had higher values than the ESS tests. Only the fifth strip stage D(Cs) value of the Tank 49 H waste test matched that of the ESS tests. It is speculated that the less-than-optimal performance of the strip section is caused by inefficiencies in the scrub section. Because strip is sensitive to pH, the elevated pH value in the second scrub stage may be the cause of strip performance. In spite of the D(Cs) values obtained in the scrub and strip sections, testing showed that the solvent system is robust. Average DFs for the process far exceeded targets even though the scrub and strip stages did not function optimally. Correction of the issue in the scrub and strip stages is expected to yield even higher waste DFs...|$|E
