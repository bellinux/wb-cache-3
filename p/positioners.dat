40|$|This {{project had}} two {{distinct}} goals, connected {{through the use}} of a linear <b>positioner.</b> The first goal was functional: to create a suitable environment in which to evaluate ego-motion and SLAM algorithms. This was accomplished first through improvements to the <b>positioner</b> hardware, and second through <b>positioner</b> calibration. The hardware improvements to the <b>positioner</b> included semi-permanent affixation of the limit sensors used in the <b>positioner's</b> homing function to the <b>positioner's</b> base and upgrades to improve the ease of transportation of the <b>positioner.</b> Calibration was accomplished by testing the precision and accuracy of the <b>positioner</b> throughout its full range of motion, creating calibration curves, and storing this information in the back end of the program used to control the <b>positioner.</b> The second major goal of the project was to use the <b>positioner</b> for an extended study in usability and aesthetics. This was implemented in large part through the creation of a Graphical User Interface with which to interact with the <b>positioner,</b> but also took the form of some physical improvements to the <b>positioner's</b> design. Within the Graphical User Interface, a visual representation of the <b>positioner</b> was created to allow the user to visualize the movement of the <b>positioner</b> before committing to its motion. All of these goals were achieved. The <b>positioner</b> is controllable through a full-featured, intuitive Graphical User Interface, and is calibrated to provide accurate positioning. It is now ready to be used to to evaluate ego-motion and SLAM algorithms...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} the {{creation}} of a networked graphical user interface (GUI) for a 3 D <b>positioner</b> with five degrees of freedom. The <b>positioner</b> can place a platform holding a pantilt camera anywhere within a 1 m 3.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new ultracompact planar <b>positioner</b> driven by {{unbalanced}} frictional forces. The {{prototype of the}} designed <b>positioner</b> is 17 mm ×  17 mm ×  9 mm in size, and is simply constructed using lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric elements, neodymium magnetic feet, and junction pieces. Alternating static and kinetic frictional forces are utilized to control {{the motion of the}} <b>positioner.</b> The working principle is illustrated, and the performance of the <b>positioner</b> is evaluated under atmospheric and vacuum conditions. Under atmospheric conditions, the <b>positioner</b> had a minimum step size of approximately 17 nm at 55 V, a maximum step size of approximately 1. 6 μm, and a moving speed of approximately 4 μm/s at 138 V. However, the step size significantly decreased in vacuum. The step size can be controlled by adjusting the frictional forces on the magnetic feet. In addition, the <b>positioner</b> showed instability caused by the wear of the stainless plate. This problem was resolved by using a borosilicate glass that was fixed on the stainless plate, and the position accuracy was obviously improved...|$|R

40|$|The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is an {{instrument}} used {{for studying the}} topography of samples with nanometer resolution. Possible samples include specific materials or biological samples. The AFM is a mechanical microscope, since a three dimensional topography image is constructed by raster scanning a sharp tip and a sample surface {{in close proximity to}} each other and monitoring tip-sample interactions. The tip-sample interaction is controlled in all three dimensions by means of a piezoelectrical scanning unit which consists of a vertical <b>positioner</b> and a lateral <b>positioner.</b> The vertical <b>positioner</b> is controlled via a feedback operation to control the tip-sample distance. The topography image is based on the control signal being sent to the vertical <b>positioner</b> to move it up or down. The vertical <b>positioner</b> consists of a piezo actuator which suffers from nonlinear behavior due to hysteresis and creep. Due to the nonlinearities, the ratio between the control signal and the resulting vertical displacement is not constant over the full positioning range of the piezo actuator. In current dynamic modes of AFM {{a large part of the}} piezo positioning range is used. Therefore, a more direct method to obtain the displacement of the vertical <b>positioner</b> is desired which enables a more accurate estimate for the sample topography. To this end, in this thesis a displacement sensor is added to the vertical <b>positioner</b> of the AFM. The resulting displacement sensor yields a variation in measured step height in the order of 6 %, compared to 35 % for the conventional control signal when imaging a calibration sample. The lateral <b>positioner</b> is controlled via a feedback operation to maintain high positional accuracy in spite of unknown disturbances and model uncertainty. In this feedback operation, the dynamics of the lateral <b>positioner</b> limit the speed of the AFM. Therefore, for the lateral <b>positioner</b> modern control methods can be used to improve the speed of the AFM. The simulation results for the lateral <b>positioner</b> show that with the use of model based control and H-infinity control the scanning speed can be increased with a factor of 5 when compared to the standard PI controlled system. At the same time the control error for the model based controlled system and the H-infinity controlled system becomes smaller with a factor of 4 and 8, respectively. The bandwidth for the PI controlled system is only 50 [Hz], which is much smaller than the bandwidth for the model based controlled system (1900 [Hz]) and the H 1 controlled system (3000 [Hz]). This means a bandwidth improvement with a factor of 38 and 60, respectively. However, further experiments must be carried out to validate the simulation results.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} whether the electrical field created by a cochlear implant electrode is more focussed in a perimodiolar than in a medial position, voltages at non-stimulated electrodes were collected from the Clarion 1. 2 implant before and after insertion of the Clarion Electrode Positioning System. The <b>positioner</b> is inserted lateral to the electrode array and is intended to bring the array close to the medial wall of the scala tympani. These intracochlear electrode voltages (IEVs) were collected in 9 surgeries with the HiFocus I electrode array with <b>positioner.</b> Stapedius reflex thresholds were decreased after insertion of the <b>positioner</b> on 20 out of 22 electrodes. Electrode impedances did not increase significantly. IEVs increased slightly for all stimulated electrodes. However, the <b>positioner</b> did not significantly affect {{the slope of the}} IEVs for any of the stimulated electrodes. Individual differences between patients in the mean IEV amplitude were considerable; 2 patients deafened by otosclerosis showed particularly low amplitudes. Thus, IEVs provided no evidence of a focussing of the electrical field by introducing the <b>positioner.</b> Possible benefits of a perimodiolar position regarding efficiency and channel separation are discussed in terms of a reduced distance between electrodes and neural elements...|$|R
