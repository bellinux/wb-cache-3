In February 2005, she was hired by Rede Globo to replace Angélica of Vídeo Game, presenting the programme [...] Vídeo Show, during pregnancy and maternity leave of the titular host. Soon after, she was invited to act in the Bang Bang, set in a plot of city directly reflecting the old west Brazil, where she was the protagonist Diana Bullock. Without any training or experience in drama, she accepted the role, taking lessons martial arts and hiring a speech therapist. Due to being inexperienced for the lead role, her portrayal of the character received several criticisms from the press, who said she was the cause of the low ratings of the telenovela. In spite of the criticisms, she was invited to <b>play</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> Pé na Jaca by Carlos Lombardi playing the role of Maria Bo. She got better reviews from the viewers. After this, She got other roles in Fantástico, Daqui para Frente, and Por Toda Minha Vida. In August 2009, she began hosting Amor e Sexo, which is aimed at a young audience and talks about the theme of sex and related topics.|$|E

50|$|AIM2 is {{referred}} to as the DNA inflammasome for its ability to detect foreign dsDNA, using a HIN200 (hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear antigens with 200 amino acid repeats) domain (encoded by IFI16) attached to a PYD, which it uses to recruit the adaptor protein ASC during inflammasome formation. AIM2 binds dsDNA with its C-terminal domain.The PYDdomain of AIM2 homotypically interacts by PYD-PYD interactions with ASC. The ASC CARD domain recruits procaspase-1 into the complex. Caspase-1 activates maturation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-18). AIM2 is activated by viral dsDNA, bacterial dsDNA and also aberrant host dsDNA. Activation of the AIM2 is supposed to <b>play</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> autoimmune responses during the autoimmune disease systematic lupus erythematosus.AIM2 inflammasome is also activated by pharmacological disruption of nuclear envelope integrity.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{bacterial}} small non-coding RNAs {{have been}} identified to play regulatory functions. Some can regulate the virulence genes. 63 novel putative sRNA were identified through deep sequencing of the Y. pestis sRNA-ome. Among them was Yersinia-specific (also present in Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica) Ysr141 (Yersinia small RNA 141). Ysr141 sRNA was shown to regulate the synthesis of the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector protein YopJ. The Yop-Ysc T3SS is {{a critical component of}} virulence for Yersinia species. [...] Many novel sRNAs were identified from Y. pestis grown in vitro and in the infected lungs of mice suggesting they <b>play</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> bacterial physiology or pathogenesis. Among them sR035 predicted to pair with SD region and transcription initiation site of a thermo-sensitive regulator ymoA, and sR084 predicted to pair with fur, ferric uptake regulator.|$|E
50|$|The amphipathic helix {{residues}} (46-62) {{within the}} cytoplasmic tail <b>play</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> virus budding and assembly. The influenza virus utilizes these amphipathic helices in M2 to alter membrane curvature at the budding {{neck of the}} virus in a cholesterol dependent manner. The residues 70-77 of cytoplasmic tail are important for binding to M1 and for the efficient production of infectious virus particles. This region also contains a caveolin binding domain (CBD). The C-terminal end of the channel extends into a loop (residues 47-50) that connects the trans membrane domain to the C-terminal amphipathic helix. (46-62). Two different high-resolution structures of truncated forms of M2 have been reported: the crystal structure of a mutated form of the M2 transmembrane region (residues 22-46), {{as well as a}} longer version of the protein (residues 18-60) containing the transmembrane region and a segment of the C-terminal domain as studied by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).|$|E
