50|$|One of the {{potential}} causes for the disaster was a build-up of gases, which eventually met with the naked flame. Due {{to the size of}} the pit, it was seriously lacking ventilation. Therefore when the built up gases hit the naked flame; It ignited the gas causing the explosion in Pit 1. The insufficiency of the ventilation as well as the poor design of the Pit, for example, with not enough air <b>pits(as</b> pictured below), contributed to the increased risk and probability of a gas explosion. The cause of the explosion is known as Fire-damp, as mentioned in the Gethin Colliery Account.|$|E

Methods: After determining a baseline IOP, the fixed combination timolol&ndash;brimonidine was used twice daily for two months, while IOP, ophthalmic signs, and/or symptoms were monitored. Results: The mean IOP value was decreased from 23. 09 mm Hg (&plusmn; 1. 98 SD) to 17. 46 mm Hg (&plusmn; 1. 47 SD) during the 1 st month (paired Student&rsquo;s t test = 9. 88 &kappa;&alpha;&iota; p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 001), and to 17. 51 mm Hg (&plusmn; 1. 43 SD) in the 2 nd month. Between the 1 st and 2 nd month, no statistical difference was observed (paired Student&rsquo;s t test = 0. 02 &nbsp;&kappa;&alpha;&iota; p&nbsp;&lt; 0. 1). In 8 % of the patients during the 1 st month and 10 % of patients in the 2 nd month, some ophthalmic signs were observed, while only mild ophthalmic symptoms were reported in 6 % and 8 % of the patients, respectively. Conclusions: In conclusion, the fixed combination of timolol&ndash;brimonidine has a satisfactory IOP-lowering effect without any serious side effects due to the topical use.
