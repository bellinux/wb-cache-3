50|$|The Swift Folder is also {{designed}} to work with 20 inch 451mm wheels. The linear <b>pull</b> <b>brakes</b> that come standard with the Swift will not work with 451s. The frame is {{designed to work}} with Caliper brakes with the larger wheels.|$|R
50|$|Unlike adult bikes, children's trikes do {{not always}} have {{pneumatic}} tires, having instead wheels of solid rubber or hollow plastic. While this may add to {{the weight of the}} tricycle and reduces the shock-absorbing qualities, it eliminates the possibility of punctures. <b>Pull</b> <b>brakes</b> are rarely fitted to front-drive trikes, but the child can slow the trike down by resisting the forward motion through the pedals.|$|R
5000|$|Mondia {{manufactured}} {{at least}} two other, less common cyclo-cross and criterium frames. One, known as the [...] "Criterium" [...] was available in the early 1970s; the second model, designed for criterium racing and called the [...] "Criterium Prestige" [...] was manufactured {{for about two years}} in the late 1970s. The Prestige appeared to combine selected design and technical features of the Mondia Super and Special. The cyclo-cross model featured the trademark fade paint and cantilever center <b>pull</b> <b>brakes</b> mounted on studs brazed to the stays and fork of a Reynolds 531 frame.|$|R
5000|$|Brake Booster {{leverage}} converter, U.S. patent 5,660,082 issued August 26, 1997. This unique converter allows use of {{road bike}} brake levers with linear <b>pull,</b> “V” <b>brakes.</b> Found on all KHS road tandems.|$|R
50|$|The {{handbrake}} turn is {{not recommended}} for novice racing drivers, as <b>pulling</b> the <b>brake</b> with too little or too much force will not lock the wheels correctly to allow the vehicle to negotiate the corner correctly.|$|R
50|$|Denson said Italian fans {{often made}} a pretence of helping push foreign riders up hills while <b>pulling</b> at their <b>brakes</b> to slow them down.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, {{the revolutionary}} rollerski with disc-brakes {{controlled}} remotely from your pole from RollerSafe.no were released. The patent was first penned by Atle Stubberud and first showed {{in a student}} work on an off-road Rollerskate (1999). SoonDesign.no Most roller skis don't have bona fide brakes, except for a calf-activated brake pioneered by Len Johnson of V2 Jenex with other companies now making similar version, or the rear <b>pull</b> <b>brake</b> designed by Clayton Keim of Pursuit Rollerskis. Speed reducers, available on some models, work by providing different levels of friction against the wheels. Different types of wheels are also available that are slower thus limiting maximum speed. Techniques for slowing down {{without the use of}} speed reducers or brakes including dragging the pole ferrules, [...] "snowplowing" [...] where you do a wide stance applying outward pressure on back wheels, or the inline skater [...] "in-step" [...] method.|$|R
5000|$|... "Servo Wave" [...] - This is {{a system}} Shimano {{introduced}} to brake levers which allowed them to <b>pull</b> more <b>brake</b> cable {{at the start of}} the lever stroke than at the end, giving improved separation between the brake blocks and the rim to allow for mud and lack of trueness in the wheels while still delivering the same braking power as systems which have a constant ratio between lever movement and cable pull and therefore less pad clearance. This was introduced during the mid-1990s. This was implemented initially by mounting the brake cable on a roller that moves towards the lever pivot in a slot in the lever blade as the lever is pulled. A second design <b>pulled</b> the <b>brake</b> cable downwards towards a cam near to the brake lever pivot instead. Servo wave has appeared for the first time on a hydraulic disk brake lever on the 2008 Shimano XT groupset.|$|R
60|$|The {{horses were}} at once <b>pulled</b> in, the <b>brakes</b> {{applied to the}} wheels, and {{with the aid of}} a {{powerful}} lever, operated by three of the menials, the carriage was brought to a standstill.|$|R
25|$|In 1979, {{an episode}} of the long-running UK TV sitcom Last of the Summer Wine was filmed partly along the Worth Valley route, in which the three main {{characters}} Compo, Foggy and Clegg visit and then to attempt to stop a runaway steam train having <b>pulled</b> the <b>brake</b> on purpose (and then only to drive upwards and downwards). The locomotive used was Pannier 5775 in its London Transport guise as L89.|$|R

50|$|On Monday, 30 July 1973 {{the winding}} engine man noticed some sparks under the brake {{cylinder}} {{when he started}} to retard the winding. He immediately increased regenerative <b>braking</b> and simultaneously <b>pulled</b> the <b>brake</b> lever to ON position. As there was no effect, he pressed the emergency stop button. This too had no effect and the cage crashed the bottom wooden landing baulks with enormous force which killed 18 and seriously injured 11 people.|$|R
50|$|Next, whoever <b>pulled</b> the {{emergency}} <b>brake</b> was scrutinized, though {{the person was}} unknown. When a newspaper printed an advertisement asking for the brake-puller to come forward, a young mother came forward. She told investigators that she normally used train 153944's stop at the Le Vert de Maisons station {{to pick up her}} children from school. However, she was unaware that the new summer timetable meant that her train would not stop at Le Vert de Maisons. So not wanting to keep her children waiting, she <b>pulled</b> {{the emergency}} <b>brake</b> and left the train. The investigators concluded that her actions were irresponsible but not suspicious. She was fined 1000F for illegal use of the emergency cord.|$|R
50|$|The attack {{occurred}} at about 1:00 pm April 14, 2017, as a knife-wielding man stabbed a 21 year old British exchange student. An off-duty police officer riding the light rail <b>pulled</b> an emergency <b>brake</b> and tackled the perpetrator, {{who was then}} arrested.|$|R
5000|$|A skilled driver {{can control}} the {{movement}} of the car even while skidding by steering, throttling and <b>pulling</b> the hand <b>brake</b> (given that the hand brake operates the rear wheels as in most cases, with some Citroen and Saab models being notable exceptions).|$|R
50|$|With {{no time to}} spare, they hurry back to {{the crash}} site and assume their {{original}} positions. When time catches up the seatbelt <b>pulls</b> the emergency <b>brake,</b> stopping the truck. Their daughter is safe, the world returns to normal, {{and no one is}} the wiser.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Seinfeld was {{involved}} in a car accident when the brakes on his 1967 Fiat 500 failed and, to avoid an intersection, he <b>pulled</b> the emergency <b>brake</b> while turning sharply, ultimately causing the car to come to a stop on its side. Seinfeld was unhurt.|$|R
50|$|The {{cabinet of}} this game is a {{standard}} upright but with custom controls. The controls consist of a bicycle handlebar (a modified Star Wars yoke) with one button on each side, used to throw papers. The handlebars can be pushed forward to accelerate, and <b>pulled</b> back to <b>brake.</b>|$|R
50|$|Initial {{press reports}} {{led to believe}} that the youths started causing a {{disturbance}} on the bus. When Demoor stood up and tried to calm things down, he was beaten to the ground and kicked repeatedly. The youths then <b>pulled</b> the emergency <b>brake</b> and fled the bus, leaving Demoor to die.|$|R
60|$|We had {{not long}} to wait. The very next train roared from the tunnel as before, but slowed in the open, and then, with a {{creaking}} of <b>brakes,</b> <b>pulled</b> up immediately beneath us. It was not four {{feet from the}} window-ledge {{to the roof of}} the carriages. Holmes softly closed the window.|$|R
50|$|The bogies {{consist of}} the two lateral main beams, and the two cross beams at each end; there is no middle welded cross beam. The {{transfer}} of <b>pulling</b> and <b>braking</b> power from bogie to locomotive takes place via two rods, which connect the locomotive via pivot pin to the bogie. The pivot pins are mounted with a slight slant to enable {{the formation of a}} right angle to the also slightly slanted rods. The rods are spring mounted at about 40 mm to the pivot pin, so that the movement of the bogie could be balanced.|$|R
50|$|The driver on no. 361 was {{the first}} to realize that they were on a {{collision}} course as he saw the lights of Litra D emerging from the tunnel. The driver of Litra D realized the same only a few seconds before impact. Litra D was in a tunnel and the headlight on the incoming train no. 361 was not particularly bright. When the driver of Litra D noticed what was happening, he also <b>pulled</b> the <b>brakes</b> to slow his train down. At 23:57, the two trains collided just after Litra D had emerged from the tunnel.|$|R
50|$|In an {{electromagnetic}} brake, {{the north}} and south pole is created by a coil shell and a wound coil. In a brake, the armature is being <b>pulled</b> against the <b>brake</b> field. (A-3) The frictional contact, which is being controlled by the strength of the magnetic field, is what causes the rotational motion to stop.|$|R
50|$|Against the timetable, train 168 stopped {{just after}} passing Vigerslev station. It was almost 20:50. It later {{turned out that}} an 8-year-old boy opened one of the outer doors of the train and fell out. Another {{passenger}} <b>pulled</b> the emergency <b>brake</b> in response to that. The train now had to drive back {{to search for the}} boy.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s about 700 [...] "Track Marshall" [...] {{tractors}} were {{imported into}} Australia and fitted with dozer blades. These machines were {{powered by a}} 4-cylinder Perkins diesel engine and were considered very reliable in their time. They steered through an unusual wet band brake system through a differential gear system. This {{is known as a}} 'controlled differential'. It is impossible to stop one track, you <b>pull</b> the <b>brake</b> lever, the track slows down, the other track speeds up. This type of steering system absorbs a lot of power when turning. Several are still in use around the Northern Rivers area of NSW, Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power of}} {{electromagnetic}} track brakes comes from electromagnetic attraction between the brake and the track. They {{are intended to}} provide retardation beyond the adhesion limit of the wheels alone, which ultimately {{is limited by the}} weight of the vehicle. Track brakes are fitted on the bogies between each pair of wheels and in line with the running rails. In operation they are first dropped into position on the rails, using air actuators, and then current is applied to strong electromagnet coils within the shoes. This <b>pulls</b> the <b>brake</b> shoes hard against the track with a force that can exceed the vehicle's weight, and strong braking forces result.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, 22-car trains were {{regularly}} moving an estimated 1800 passengers, {{a good number}} of mostly unsupervised and energetic, if not rowdy, Eskimo Ski Club youngsters, to Winter Park. On one trip in 1990, one brazen youngster <b>pulled</b> the emergency <b>brake</b> on a moving train, damaging one coach's coupler and steam line. At some point, the railroad hired three sheriff's deputies to help maintain order.|$|R
50|$|On May 23, 1977, a train {{hijacking}} {{took place}} close to Drentsche Aa river bridge at de Punt (in {{the village of}} Glimmen) on the provincial border between Groningen and Drenthe, northeastern Netherlands. Nine armed Moluccans <b>pulled</b> the emergency <b>brake</b> around 9 AM and took about 50 people hostage. The hijacking lasted for 482 hours (20 days); two hostages and six hijackers were killed.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{variations}} are available: In the more-traditional [...] "cable-pulling" [...] type, {{an electric}} motor simply <b>pulls</b> the emergency <b>brake</b> cable on the push or pull of a button rather than a mechanical handle in the cabin. A more complex unit [...] (first seen on the 2003 Audi A8) uses a computer-controlled motor attached {{to each of the}} two rear brake calipers referred to as the Motor on Caliper(MoC) system.|$|R
40|$|Brake {{system is}} an {{important}} thing of vehicle. Many kinds of brake pads presents by each factory. Brake pads made of asbestos and non asbestos material. Each of them have excess and lack. This research aims to know the performance of each type of brake pads {{so that it can}} show the excess and lack of each type of product. As user, we have to choose a product which will be used in our vehicle cleverly. The research be done by giving variations in load of brake and weight of rider at a constant speed. The load of brake used spring with the variation are 2 kg, 3 kg and 4 kg. While, weight rider are varied with 54 kg and 111 kg. Research result shows that increasing load of <b>pull</b> <b>brake</b> led to increasing the value of worn out and a decline in the braking time, while increasing weight of the rider causes an increase in the value of worn out and braking time at all types of brake pad products. In dry condition, the lowest wear is 1, 37 x 10 - 4 mm/second in non asbestos pads and the highest wear is 3, 088 x 10 - 5 mm/second in asbestos pads. While, the smallest braking time is 28, 79 seconds in asbestos pads and the biggest is 64, 26 seconds in non asbestos pads. In wet condition, the lowest wear is 2, 422 x 10 - 5 mm/second in asbestos pads and the highest wear is 7, 716 x 10 - 5 mm/second in non asbestos pads. While, the smallest braking time is 29, 46 seconds in non asbestos pads and the biggest is 62, 71 seconds in asbestos pads...|$|R
5000|$|Each sled {{accommodates}} {{one or two}} {{passengers and}} is controlled by a hand brake located {{on both sides of}} the car, or a single brake lever in the middle of the car on Brandauer coasters. Riders are advised to place their hands on the brakes at all times for safety reasons. [...] <b>Pulling</b> the hand <b>brake</b> handle causes the cart to stop; pushing or letting go of the handle causes the brakes to release, allowing the cart to accelerate.|$|R
5000|$|Brakes are {{generally}} reserved for big mountain riding where riders need an increased {{ability to control}} their speed over long runs. The brakes are most usually attached to both front wheels of the mountainboard rather than the rear to give greater braking efficiency and reduce the chances of the rear wheels locking up and skidding. They are operated via a hand-held lever which when <b>pulled</b> causes both <b>brake</b> mechanisms to work simultaneously. There are four types of brakes used on mountainboards: ...|$|R
60|$|This startled the fate-fixed, sharp-nosed driver. He {{released}} {{the handle and}} looked round, with dark and glowering eyes. No one in sight. The few glum natives stood round unmoved. Thunder came into the gloomy dark eyes of the Rochester. Absolutely nobody in sight. Click! went his face into a look of almost seraphic peace, as he <b>pulled</b> off the <b>brakes.</b> We were on an incline, and insidiously, oh most subtly the great bus started to lean forwards and steal into motion.|$|R
50|$|A slug {{is used to}} {{increase}} adhesive weight, allowing full power to be applied at a lower speed, thus allowing a higher maximum tractive effort. They are often used in low-speed operations such as switching operations in yards. At low speeds, a diesel-electric locomotive prime mover is capable of producing more electricity than its traction motors can use effectively. Extra power would simply cause the wheels to slip and possibly overheat the traction motors. A slug increases the number of traction motors available to the locomotive, increasing both the <b>pulling</b> and <b>braking</b> power. In addition the load on each traction motor is reduced, which helps prevent overheating from excess current. Slugs typically carry ballast {{to increase}} their weight and improve traction. Large blocks of concrete are frequently used for this purpose, substituting for {{the weight of the}} now-absent prime mover.|$|R
50|$|Ahead of {{the runaway}} freight train the 10 {{carriage}} Rostov-on-Don — Moscow passenger train {{was due to}} stop at Kamenskaya station. The officer on duty at the station attempted to radio the driver to {{tell him not to}} stop but was unable to make contact and at 01:28 as it stopped at the station the driver was immediately ordered to continue. Unfortunately the conductor of the train aware that passengers had not yet alighted, <b>pulled</b> the emergency <b>brake</b> (as demanded by his job description).|$|R
50|$|In modern bobsleighs, the {{steering}} system {{consists of two}} metal rings that actuate a pulley system located in the forward cowling that turns the front runners. For example, to turn left, the pilot would pull the left ring. Only subtle steering adjustments are necessary to guide the sled; at speeds up to 80 mph, anything larger {{would result in a}} crash. The pilot does most of {{the steering}}, and the brakeman stops the sled after crossing the finish by <b>pulling</b> the sled's <b>brake</b> lever.|$|R
