Repetition codes are used to transmit quantization bits of sensor observations to achieve unequal error protection, and a quasi-best linear unbiased estimate is constructed to estimate the source parameter at the fusion center (FC). Based on the adopted distributed estimation scheme (DES), we optimize the <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> among sensors to minimize the L^ 1 -norm of the power vector subject to the desired tolerance, which implies minimizing the total transmission power. Since the optimization problem is not convex, we propose a low-complexity alternative, which minimizes the L^ 2 -norm of the power vector while insuring the desired tolerance. We derive the closed form solution of the L^ 2 -norm <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> scheme. Simulation {{results show that the}} total power consumption of the L^ 2 -norm <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> scheme is close to that of the L^ 1 -norm <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> scheme, while complexity analysis demonstrates that the L^ 2 -norm <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> scheme has very low complexity...|$|R

40|$|High {{performance}} computing (HPC) systems {{are an important}} enabling tool for modern scientific discovery. These large scale computing systems have, since the 1990 s, been increasing built as clusters of commodity computers. The operational energy needs of these clusters has lead the HPC community to focus on energy efficient hardware and programming practices. One of the major side effects of introducing energy efficient hardware is variability in power consumption between components within the cluster. In practice, power variability at scale has resulted in poor power utilization and challenges for energy providers contracted to provide the needed power. Hardware overprovisioned HPC systems have been proposed to improve power utilization however production deployment of such a system would compound the challenge for energy providers. This dissertation presents foundational work on HPC <b>power</b> <b>scheduling,</b> a technique that reduces {{the risks associated with}} operating hardware overprovisioned HPC systems. <b>Power</b> <b>scheduling</b> is formalized using the <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> invariant. Generalized application behavior, for applications running under a power cap, are experimentally studied. Study insights are used to develop a power scheduler and a power capping cluster simulator. Comparative behavior of different <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> strategies as also examined. Utilizing the <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> invariant, the safety of any power scheduler for deployment can be proven through analyzing scheduler's algorithm and mechanism. A general trend exists in power capped application performance that can be related to application progress, the underlying physics of the hardware, and expected runtime dilation. PowSched provides a proof by construction that <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> can be done safely and effectively without application specific models using a simple feedback mechanism. Experimentally, PowSched was shown to produce a 14 % improvement in throughput compared to a fair distribution of power between cluster components. PowSim provides a proof by construction that the generalized effects on runtime can be efficiently simulated at scale, providing critical simulation infrastructure for researchers exploring <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> at scale. Using simulation, <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> strategies are studied and dynamic <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> appears to out perform static and reservation based techniques.

30|$|The key to <b>power</b> <b>schedule</b> under {{uncertainty}} {{is to determine}} the coordination strategies of dispatch and control while satisfying the security constraints. Reference [30] presents a model-based joint economic dispatch and frequency control decision scheme to tackle the variation of intermittent resources, but without the model of uncertainties. In [19], a synergistic economic dispatch concerning the frequency regulation effect is proposed, but the units’ response mechanism to uncertainties is not involved. In [19, 30], the frequency deviation is incorporated explicitly into the economic decision process, which is instructive for the potential economic and technical benefits of accommodating uncertainties. However, the network model is not well considered. It has received hardly any attention simultaneous accounting for the frequency regulation effect and the response mechanism of secondary reserve of AGC units together with network constraints for <b>power</b> <b>schedule</b> problem. Therefore, this paper proposes a frequency aware robust economic dispatch (FARED) to accommodate uncertainties by accounting for both the frequency regulation effect and the unit reserve response mechanism in the robust optimization counterpart of traditional security constrained economic dispatch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} the optimal <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> {{problem for the}} decentralized estimation of a noise-corrupted deterministic signal in an inhomogeneous sensor network. Sensor observations are first quantized into discrete messages, then transmitted to a fusion center where a final estimate is generated. Supposing that the sensors use a universal decentralized quantization/estimation scheme and an uncoded Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) transmission strategy, we determine the optimal quantization and transmit power levels at local sensors so as to minimize the total transmit power, while ensuring a given Mean Squared Error (MSE) performance. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>scheduling</b> scheme suggests that the sensors with bad channels or poor observation qualities should decrease their quantization resolutions or simply become inactive {{in order to save}} power. For the remaining active sensors, their optimal quantization and transmit power levels are determined jointly by individual channel path losses, local observation noise variance, and the targeted MSE performance. Numerical examples show that in inhomogeneous sensing environment, significant energy savings is possible when compared to the uniform quantization strategy.
