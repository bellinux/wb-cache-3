30|$|In this study, {{source and}} target domain data {{refers to the}} same network {{environment}} at a different time. We assumed that attacks in a source domain are already known and labeled, and attacks in a target domain are new and different than the source. We formularized the problem by using source domain data to differentiate new attacks in the target domain. Previously, we developed a transfer learning-enabled detection framework and proposed a feature-based heterogeneous transfer learning, called HeTL [6], to detect unseen variants of attacks. HeTL can find new feature representations for source and target domain by transforming them on a common latent space. Nevertheless, we observed that the performance of HeTL depended on manual <b>pre-settings</b> of a hyper-parameter: relevance between the source and target domain [6].

The full scales of some equipment qualifications are even time dependent as consumables are used up (i.e. filters) or springs stretch out, requiring recalibration, and hence re-certification is necessary when a specified due time lapse. Re-qualification of machinery/equipment should also be conducted when replacement of parts, or coupling with another device, or installing a new application software and restructuring of the computer which affects especially the <b>pre-settings,</b> such as on BIOS, registry, disk drive partition table, dynamically-linked (shared) libraries, or an ini file etc., have been necessary.

30|$|Network {{attacks are}} serious {{concerns}} in today’s increasingly interconnected society. Recent studies have applied conventional machine learning to network attack detection by learning {{the patterns of}} the network behaviors and training a classification model. These models usually require large labeled datasets; however, the rapid pace and unpredictability of cyber attacks make this labeling impossible in real time. To address these problems, we proposed utilizing transfer learning for detecting new and unseen attacks by transferring {{the knowledge of the}} known attacks. In our previous work, we have proposed a transfer learning-enabled framework and approach, called HeTL, which can find the common latent subspace of two different attacks and learn an optimized representation, which was invariant to attack behaviors’ changes. However, HeTL relied on manual <b>pre-settings</b> of hyper-parameters such as relativeness between the source and target attacks. In this paper, we extended this study by proposing a clustering-enhanced transfer learning approach, called CeHTL, which can automatically find the relation between the new attack and known attack. We evaluated these approaches by stimulating scenarios where the testing dataset contains different attack types or subtypes from the training set. We chose several conventional classification models such as decision trees, random forests, KNN, and other novel transfer learning approaches as strong baselines. Results showed that proposed HeTL and CeHTL improved the performance remarkably. CeHTL performed best, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in detecting new network attacks.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the performance of strain elastography in an elasticity phantom and to assess which factors influenced visual scoring, strain histograms and strain ratios. Furthermore this study aimed to evaluate the effect of observer experience on visual scorings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two operators examined 20 targets of various stiffness and size (16. 7 to 2. 5 mm) in an elasticity phantom at a depth of 3. 5 cm with a 5 - 18 MHz transducer. Two <b>pre-settings</b> were used yielding 80 scans. Eight evaluators, four experienced, four inexperienced, performed visual scorings. Cut-offs for semi-quantitative methods were established for prediction of target stiffness. Data was pooled in two categories allowing calculations of sensitivity and specificity. Statistical tests chi-square test and linear regression as relevant. RESULTS: Strain ratios and strain histograms were superior to visual scorings of both experienced and inexperienced observers (p =  0. 025, strain histograms vs. experienced observers, p< 0. 001, strain histograms vs. inexperienced observers, p =  0. 044 strain ratios vs. experienced observers and p =  0. 002 strain ratios vs. inexperienced observers). No significant difference in predicting target stiffness between strain ratios and strain histograms (p =  0. 83) nor between experienced and inexperienced observers (p =  0. 054) was shown when using four categories. When pooling data in two groups (80 kPa/ 45 kPa vs. 14 / 8 kPa) the difference between the observers became significant (p< 0. 001). Target size had a significant influence on strain ratios measurements (p =  0. 017) and on visual scorings (p< 0. 001) but not on the strain histograms(p =  0. 358). Observer experience had significant effect on visual scorings(p =  0. 003). CONCLUSION: Strain ratios and strain histograms are superior to visual scoring in assessing target stiffness in a phantom. Target size had a significant impact on strain ratios and visual scoring, but not on strain histograms. Experience influenced visual scorings but the difference between experienced and inexperienced observers was only significant when looking at two classes of target stiffness...|$|R
30|$|In this article, we {{presented}} the theoretical and methodological {{development of a}} new course design for exploring Triple Helix collaboration in innovation and entrepreneurship education. Action research seems to offer an effective approach for bridging sectoral partner interests around diverse types of innovative projects into forms of Triple Helix collaboration that may expand beyond the classroom context, which confirms previous research suggestions (Blenker 2006). The EARTH-design builds a foundation for exploring innovation and entrepreneurship education that focuses on innovation collaboration and student’s learning via Triple Helix principles (D’Este and Perkmann 2011, Etzkowitz 2014 a, 2014 b). The involvement of different primary and secondary actors in the course create productive conditions for students to acquire entrepreneurial experiences directly or vicariously through social relations and mastery of converting theory into practice (Erikson 2003), which supports the role of student innovation that may have direct encouraging effects upon students’ motivation for initiating innovation collaboration with tertiary actors beyond the <b>pre-settings</b> of the course. This is in accordance with previous calls for entrepreneurial universities that should be “offering a curriculum that is current in knowledge terms; that seeks to assist in students’ engagement with external settings; and that may expand its students’ confidence to live in a changing, complex world” (Shattock 2009 : 51). Comparable to prior research on entrepreneurship education (Collins et al. 2006, Kirkwood et al. 2014), the EARTH design results in a general student experience of ‘real world’ innovation and entrepreneurship, which is supported by substitution of actors where one actor is able to ‘take the role of the other’, and vice versa. In the educational design of integrating Action Research with Triple Helix theory and recruiting primary and secondary actors, teacher-researchers are as representatives of Academia in similar manner to the following description by Ranga and Etzkowitz “providing support and even funding to encourage entrepreneurial ventures, thus enacting some of the traditional role of industry” (Ranga and Etzkowitz 2013 : 246). Reciprocally, these external actors’ participation in teaching and in providing innovation challenges to student teams, partly enact the assertion that “Industry can also take the role of the university in developing proprietary education and training solutions” (ibid).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Minimally-invasive {{measurement}} of continuous inter-vertebral motion in clinical settings {{is difficult to}} achieve. This paper describes the reliability, validity and radiation exposure levels in a new Objective Spinal Motion Imaging Assessment system (OSMIA) based on low-dose fluoroscopy and image processing. Methods Fluoroscopic sequences in coronal and sagittal planes were obtained from 2 calibration models using dry lumbar vertebrae, plus the lumbar spines of 30 asymptomatic volunteers. Calibration model 1 (mobile) was screened upright, in 7 inter-vertebral positions. The volunteers and calibration model 2 (fixed) were screened on a motorised table comprising 2 horizontal sections, one of which moved through 80 degrees. Model 2 was screened during motion 5 times and the L 2 -S 1 levels of the volunteers twice. Images were digitised at 5 fps. Inter-vertebral motion from model 1 was compared to its <b>pre-settings</b> to investigate accuracy. For volunteers and model 2, the first digitised image in each sequence was marked with templates. Vertebrae were tracked throughout the motion using automated frame-to-frame registration. For each frame, vertebral angles were subtracted giving inter-vertebral motion graphs. Volunteer data were acquired twice {{on the same day}} and analysed by two blinded observers. The root-mean-square (RMS) differences between paired data were used as the measure of reliability. Results RMS difference between reference and computed inter-vertebral angles in model 1 was 0. 32 degrees for side-bending and 0. 52 degrees for flexion-extension. For model 2, X-ray positioning contributed more to the variance of range measurement than did automated registration. For volunteer image sequences, RMS inter-observer variation in intervertebral motion range in the coronal plane was 1. 86 degreesand intra-subject biological variation was between 2. 75 degrees and 2. 91 degrees. RMS inter-observer variation in the sagittal plane was 1. 94 degrees. Radiation dosages in each view were below the levels recommended for a plain film. Conclusion OSMIA can measure inter-vertebral angular motion patterns in routine clinical settings if modern image intensifier systems are used. It requires skilful radiography to achieve optimal positioning and dose limitation. Reliability in individual subjects can be judged from the variance of their averaged inter-vertebral angles and by observing automated image registration. </p...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this study the {{influence}} of mechanical stimuli was examined in addition to the "general" rehabilitativen measures by means of oscillatory interventions by the Galileo in 2000 on the femoral musculature after reconstruction of the vorde-ren cruciate ligament of the knee joint. Moreover a Galileogruppe with oscillatory stimulation of a control group was compared with-put without in addition stimulation to the ambulant rehabilitation program. All patients had received an arthroskopisch carried out front cruciate ligament plastic with Semitentinosus-trans-planning which was carried out by two surgeons who assisted themselves mutually in the single operations and have used the same technology. The examined group enclosed a total of 51 patients from whom 36 positioned themselves to the re-examination. The Galileo in 2000 device works as a seesaw with an amplitude of 0 - 5 mms (media after distal) with changeable frequency. To the increase of the muscle achievement a frequency of 25 - 27 hertz which correspond to an average cycle duration of approx. 38. 5 milliseconds has proved itself. This is the time which is required to generate a natural stretch reflex of the agonists and antagonist in a closed chain with On and Abbewegungen in each case. It were carried out praeoperativ as well as 12 weeks post surgically sonographische and isokinetische measurements. In addition it was carried out prae and post surgical score comparison by means of Tenger and Lysholmscore. With the Cybexmessung appeared with the averages of the torque maxima of the corner speeds of 90 ° / see and 120 ° / see post surgically a similar hold in both groups. Significant differences can be recognised with 150 ° / see. While in the Galileogruppe the trend towards the continuous decrease of the maxima will maintain, the trend course falls in the control group clearly from. z In addition, were carried out sonografisch muscle cross sections with 10 cm and 20 cm proximal of the palpateable knee joint gap {{in the area of the}} media, ventralen and latera-len Kompartiments. In comparison to praeoperativ achieved Wer-ten the musculature thickness of the affected extremity decreases post surgically in almost all areas about other 10 % in comparison to the not affected extremity. The weakly significant reduction of the musculature thickness in the controlling group in the media measuring point 10 cm proximal of the knee joint gap in comparison to healthy side is remarkable. The distribution of the sporty activity with the help of the Tenger score in favour of the Galileogruppe shows presurgically as well as post surgically a weakly positive Signi-fikanz in the subjective judgement of the post surgical result by means of Lysholm score the patients are "more contented" in the control group than in the Galileogruppe, even if computationally no significance exists. In the operated knee joint regularisation mechanisms seem to be shifted by changes of the <b>pre-settings</b> specific for muscle and/or neuro-physiological by the Galileoanwendung in a more sensitive direction. In the control group the muscle diameter decreases in the media area in 10 cm proximal of the knee joint as well as the torque maximum significantly. The strength development is influenced like in our experiment said, among the rest, also by reflex mechanisms here by means of mechanically oscillatory Stimulie. It comes in spite of early-functional ill-gymnastic treatment to an Abschwä-chung of the torques of the femoral trail musculature and with it to a-unit deformation of the Strecker/Beuger relation to to the Beugern which are to be understood as agonists of the VKB and also the patella tendons beginning. This change of the muskulären balance should prevent much too big ventralen feed of the tibia and prevent the graft. On this occasion, mechanical Stimulie can perform her contribution to the muscle construction by means of oscillation like with Galileo in 2000. Conclusion: Protective mechanisms are influenced by support of the reflex mechanisms by mechanical stimuli by means of an oscillatory intervention within {{the scope of}} the early-functional activation of the propiozeptiven system on the femoral musculature after reconstruction of the front cruciate ligament of the knee joint...|$|R

This study attempted to reduce makeready time by quantitatively <b>pre-setting</b> ink keys from data obtained from an estimating unit and use of a set of calibration curves. A photoelectric estimating unit was designed and constructed to read integrated densities of copy to be printed. There was one reading for each area of copy corresponding to an ink key on the press. The estimating unit consisted of a series of lenses, a photoelectric tube and a meter movement. The estimating unit yielded readings of the image area for which an ink key is responsible for the supply of ink. The press was a standard off-set type with small paper dials mounted on the face of each ink key. A series of calibration tints were printed. From these tints key settings and their estimated density values curves were generated for use in the <b>pre-setting</b> of the ink keys for any type of copy.
