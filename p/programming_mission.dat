Based on {{a system}} of programme funding provided by the Belgian government, the IUC programme is directed at {{a limited number of}} carefully selected partner universities in the South. Each partnership, covering a period of maximum ten years, consists of a coherent set of interventions geared towards the development of the teaching, research and service provision of the partner university, as well as its institutional management. In 2007 VLIR-UOS launched an open call inviting the Flemish universities to submit proposals for new IUC partnerships. This resulted in the pre-selection of the University of Limpopo (South Africa) and the Universidad Nacional Agraria la Molina (Peru). Among others, the IUC partner university selection process calls for an ex-ante evaluation of the pre-selected partner universities. This evaluation {{takes the form of a}} <b>programming</b> <b>mission</b> that is undertaken by independent experts, and meant to assess whether the pre-selected university indeed meets the VLIR-UOS IUC partne...|$|E
40|$|Project TCP/NEP/ 0152 {{covered a}} Field Review and <b>Programming</b> <b>Mission,</b> which {{reviewed}} past efforts {{and experiences of}} international programmes supporting the agricultural sector, so as to identify development strategies and propose areas of support for international donors {{in the context of}} the Eighth National Development Plan and the Fifth UNDP Country Programme. The Mission examined, as well, the issues of sustainability and effective development within the framework of international support for agriculture, forestry and natural resource utilization, and the social dimension of agricultural policy and development. The Mission outlined priority areas for Government policy, and formulated proposals for major technical assistance and pre-investment projects {{in the context of the}} overall national development plan. It identified an appropriate system of agro-ecological zoning for Nepal on which to base realistic farm typologies and implement programmes. Project TCP/NEP/ 2251 supported the preparation of the Eighth National Development Plan, in the light of the findings of the first project. The mission fielded under this project concluded that the generation and diffusion of technologies had not sufficiently taken into consideration Nepal's agro-ecological conditions, as well as farmers' resulting resource constraints. Too little attention had also been given to the traditional crops of these regions. The mission accordingly recommended that planning teams of the District Agriculture Development Programme (DADP) should be multi-disciplinary, drawn from a number of agencies and work in consultation with the local people. Development projects should be formulated on the basis of an understanding of the agro-ecological zones in question, the districts resources and the farmers' needs. This requires the specification of target groups, on the basis of farm types. It is also recommended that officials involved in the DADP be trained in the identification of farmers' needs, and their resources, and district production potentials. If these components are organized within a coherent, sustainable farming systems programme for the individual agro-ecological regions, the technological packages produced will be more suitable for the target farmer categories, in that they will respect the social, economic and environmental context...|$|E
