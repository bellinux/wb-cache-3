40|$|The {{change control}} is “A process that ensures that changes to materials; methods, {{equipment}} and software are properly documented, validated, approved and traceable”. The process requires eight basic steps: Identification, documentation review, change proposal, change classification, implementation <b>plan,</b> <b>installation,</b> verification, closure. Changes are outlines as Major, Moderate & Minor. A compliance of regulatory group {{within the company}} determines the filing impact and submits it to FDA,-A prior- Approval supplement (PAS) for major changes, A CBE - 30 or CBE- 0 for moderate changes or Annual report for Minor changes. Firms are expected to write adequate SOP for the change control & be in total compliance with proper documentation. Considering the regulatory prospective of change control procedures, {{it is important to}} note that there are many guideline which describe the control of changes in manufacturing few references includes 21 CFR Part 211 : Sec. 211. 100, 21 CFR Part 211. 194 (Laboratory Records), ICH Q 7 A and USFDA Guidance for Industry:  Change to an approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004 - Revison- 1). </p...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAmerican industry expended substantial cost for fire protection, fire prevention programs, first-aid facilities, and industrial safety programs. these expenditures {{grow out of}} proper recognition of the economic necessity to minimize loss caused by disasters such as fire, flood, explosion, etc. There is, however, the general lack of a program which pre-assigns specific responsibilities to employees, upon the occurrence of an emergency situation, which could reduce significantly the extent of damage. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a model industrial disaster control plan which was developed for use at the Overhaul and Repair Facility, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida, and which utilize these techniques heretofore applied primarily by shipboard Damage Control organizations. The industrial manager alone can decide whether a similar application of Damage Control principles within his organization can be beneficial. To facilitate the making of this decision, a cost equation for use in computing plan implementation costs is provided. Further, the paper present a method of approach, Involving Simulation techniques, for individual company assessment of the potential value of <b>plan</b> <b>installation</b> in addition to the benefit derived by reduction of actual physical loss.
