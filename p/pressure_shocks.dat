40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the design of a {{hydraulic}} device on which simulations of <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> can be performed. The hydraulic device was constructed to allow simulations of <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> transferred directly in operating conditions because simulation programs for hydraulic accumulators have only theoretical values while simulation on the designed hydraulic device enables obtaining specific readings directly in operating conditions that can be set. At the first control measurement on the hydraulic device, there occurred <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> generated by the hydraulic device itself, these <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> being undesirable in hydraulic circuits. In order to eliminate <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> in the circuit, a diaphragm accumulator was added to the hydraulic device and was used to verify the function of simulating <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> and eliminating undesirable <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks.</b> During the second control measurement on the hydraulic device, a reduction of unwanted <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> was shown with the help of added diaphragm accumulator, thus the function of the hydraulic device to simulate <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> was confirmed, which may also refect practical application in hydraulic circuits of mobile machines...|$|E

40|$|The {{physics of}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> plays {{a central role}} in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In {{indirect}} drive ICF, x-rays from a gold cavity (hohlraum) are used to ablatively drive a series of high <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> into a spherical target (capsule). These shocks converge at the center, compressing the fuel and forming a hot dense core. The target performance, such as peak fuel density and temperature and neutron yield, depends critically on hock timing, and material compressibility. Accurate predictions of NIF target performance depends critically on shock timing and material compressibility. Current measurement techniques enable us to accurately determine shock timing in planar samples of abator material as a function of laser drive. Although this technique does not separately address uncertainties in material EOS and opacity, it does allow us to tune the laser drive until the desired shock timing is achieved. Experiments to directly address the EOS of D{sub 2 } ice are planned to further increase the margin for ignition in current target designs...|$|E

40|$|A survey covers <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> {{or water}} hammers and {{cavitation}} impacts in piping systems, events that increasingly occur, {{and the reasons}} for their occurrence and their effects on the piping. The application and limits of simplified formulas that under certain conditions make it possible to estimate such possible impacts are presented. Three examples indicate which measures to take to avoid <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> or water hammers and cavitation impacts in piping systems. The discussion includes introduction; reasons and effects for <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> and cavitation; empirical formulas, their use and limits; consideration of the risks and measures to avoid them; and a passive safety system. In cooperation with the Ebro Armaturen company, the Fraunhofer Institut Umsicht has developed and patented the Pressure Control Device (PCD). This is a reliable, easily installed, and passive safety system (no additional auxiliary energy involved). On a standard drive the PCD with force lockin g closure or control fitting contains an inner hydraulic circuit that is placed in motion by a signal from the control element. At the same time the PCD is effectively hydraulically connected to the main line. When the pressure in the main line piping reaches an undue value, such that the hydraulic circulation or cycle in the PCD is stopped, further closing of the fitting is hindered until the pressure in the main pipeline again drops. In every instance the fitting closes - failsafe - through an inner bypass in the PCD with preset time constants. The first example relates to a long pipe carrying liquids in which water hammers and cavitation blows arise form opening and closing the fittings. The second example also relates to a long pipe carrying liquids where water hammers and cavitation blows occur from the startup and shutdown of high performance pumps. The third example relates to a long pipe carrying liquids with a great vertical difference in the neighborhood of the boiling point...|$|E

These processes strip the reserves of HI in galaxies in clusters (Solanes et al. 2001) and affect the subsequent stellar formation, and could be responsible of the important morphological evolution observed in clusters of galaxies (Dressler et al. 1997).

40|$|Oxy-combustion is an {{important}} step towards zero-emission. However, over-adiabatic <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> have been found when igniting oxygen-enriched lean or rich fuel mixtures in non-adiabatic reactors. This phenomenon has been demonstrated to be linked to the Rapid Phase Transition of water produced by the combustion reaction and, thus, it has been named 'combustion-induced Rapid Phase Transition' (cRPT). In this work, we present further results of explosion tests in a non-adiabatic 5 dm 3 cylindrical vessel. In particular, we focused the attention on the role of nucleation sites on the occurrence of cRPT. To this aim, we sprinkled talc (fine powder) over the internal surface of the vessel, thus providing nucleation sites. Results show that cRPT may be prevented if nucleation sites are present at the vessel walls, thus favoring the evaporation kinetics and preventing the water super-heating. �� 2013, AIDIC Servizi S. r. l...|$|E

40|$|The {{cryogenic}} {{shock tube}} {{is used to}} generate a gasdynamic shock which propagates through saturated helium vapor and subsequently reflects from the upper surface of a column of LHeII. Superconducting thin-film detectors, produced by evaporation of aluminum in an oxygen atmosphere, yield highly repeatable arrival time data for the incident gasdynamic shock and the resultant first- and second-sound shocks in the liquid. Accurate x-t diagrams of the shock trajectories have been constructed for initial liquid temperatures of T(0) = 1. 522, 1. 665, 1. 751, 1. 832, 1. 989, 2. 031, and 2. 095 °K. Consistent discrepancies are observed between experimental and theoretical wave trajectories. The detector signals qualitatively verify theoretical predictions that the temperature decreases through the <b>pressure</b> <b>shock</b> and increases through the temperature shock. Amplitude measurements based on static detector calibrations indicate that {{the magnitude of the}} temperature jump across the <b>pressure</b> <b>shock</b> agrees approximately with the theoretical calculation. Temperature jump measurements for the coupled second-sound shock imply shock-induced relative velocities, w =v(n) -v(s), on the order of 2. 5 m/sec. For initial conditions close to the [lambda]-transition (e. g., T(0) = 2. 095 °K), the pressure jump across the first-sound shock is sufficient to cause a change in phase from LHeII to LHeI. This change is experimentally evidenced by detector outputs indicating the absence of the temperature shock {{in the wake of a}} sufficiently strong <b>pressure</b> <b>shock...</b>|$|R

The outstanding stress states, such as the states of stationary deviators, the states of zero plastic volumetric strain rates and the states of zero pore-water pressure production, are defined precisely and characterized, In displacement-controlled tests and for significant portions of the effective stress path the second order plastic work is negative without visible deviations from homogeneous isochoric deformation, It is also shown that in ordinary soil mechanics testing situations no pore-water <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> can develop across shear-band boundaries, and thus locally undrained shear banding at the state of the maximum deviator is impossible...|$|E
