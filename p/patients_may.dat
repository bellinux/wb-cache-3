5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> be more likely to avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E
50|$|But {{a seizure}} can be {{disruptive}} {{to the process}} of normal life. During the seizure, depending on the type, the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> be totally or partially unconscious, and out of commission to perform normal activities. Following the seizure the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> be confused and disoriented for a period of time. The <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> also require rest after the seizure.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of {{a broken}} nose include bruising, swelling, tenderness, pain, deformity, and/or {{bleeding}} of the nose and nasal region of the face. The <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> have difficulty breathing, or excessive nosebleeds (if the nasal mucosa are damaged). The <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> also have bruising around one or both eyes.|$|R

5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as packing of the nasal cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of the fragile vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E
5|$|Final {{outcomes}} {{for people with}} SCSFLS remain poorly studied. Symptoms may resolve {{in as little as}} two weeks, or persist for months. Less commonly, <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> suffer from unremitting symptoms for many years. People with chronic SCSFLS may be disabled and unable to work. Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common.|$|E
5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. <b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} {{will be unable}} to provide care to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior from the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the hospice program. <b>Patients</b> <b>may,</b> after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of nausea, vomiting, a pale appearance, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning.|$|E

5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|Over 50% of MS <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> use {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. <b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis is the {{administration}} of an enzyme (intravenous or directly into the affected vein through a catheter), which acts to enzymatically break up clots. This may {{reduce the risk of}} post-thrombotic syndrome by a third, and possibly reduce the risk of leg ulcers, but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The ACCP currently suggests anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis, but <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> choose thrombolysis if prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over the complexity, bleeding risk, and cost of the procedure. NICE recommends that thrombolysis is considered in those who have had symptoms for less than two weeks, are normally well, have a good life expectancy and a low risk of bleeding.|$|E

40|$|In {{any health}} care crisis, the first {{priority}} {{is to improve the}} patient’s condition.

The compatibility of successful medical treatment and patient’s consent – {{and the extent to which}} medical paternalism can be justified- is one of the great challenges of contemporary medical ethics. It has been recently suggested (Cohen, forthcoming) that we can make progress on this issue by showing that the choice architecture of nudges (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008) is compatible with informed consent, so that we can obtain...|$|R
40|$|Why has {{my patient}} come up {{reactive}} to foods {{claimed to have}} not been eaten? 1) Many foods that a <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> claim to have not eaten are foods which are commonly hidden, such as dairy, additives and preservatives, wheat/ gluten, corn, various sugars, potatoes, soy and eggs. Be sure your patient has not unknowingly eaten them as hidden ingredients in other foods. Most exposures occur in restaurants, friends’ homes, and eating prepared and commercial foods. 2) Your <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> have a cross-reac-tive response to that particular item. For example, there may be immune recogni-tion of an antigen specific to that item {{that is similar to}} another already immu-nologically reactive antigen. This could be a gut pathogen, related food (similar plant or animal species) or chemical. As an example, your <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> be reactive to potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, and eggplant and claim they have never eaten eggplant. These foods are all in the nightshade family of plants and have similar antigens. Therefore, your <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> be responding to the eggplant due to cross reactivity. 3) Your <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> be reacting to a contaminant in the food item such as a pesticide. Contaminant reactions are not common but are increasingly becoming a problem...|$|R
