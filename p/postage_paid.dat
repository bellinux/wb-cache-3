25|$|The MPS also {{supports}} mail delivery for U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas and to deployed personnel in combat zones worldwide. Most USPS extra services, such as Certified Mail, registered mail, delivery confirmation, insured mail, certificate of mailing, return receipt, restricted delivery and return receipt for merchandise {{are available to}} the MPS. Mail sent from one military post office (MPO) to another MPO can be sent for free as inner/intra-theater delivery service (IDS) {{as long as it}} does not transit the United States. Military postage rates are equivalent to U.S. domestic postage rates because the Services pay the second destination transportation (SDT) costs to, from, and between MPOs. The <b>postage</b> <b>paid</b> on mail to/from MPOs only covers the cost of transporting the mail within the U.S. All military mail between the U.S. and overseas locations is subject to customs inspection in the country of destination, and customs declarations must normally be attached to packages and larger mail pieces.|$|E

6000|$|Bagwax {{was a man}} who, in his {{official}} zeal and official capacity, had exercised his intellect far beyond the matters {{to which he was}} bound to apply himself in the mere performance of his duties. Post-marks were his business; and had he given all his mind to postmarks, he would have sufficiently carried out that great doctrine of doing the duty which England expects from every man. But he had travelled beyond postmarks, and had looked into many things. Among other matters he had looked into penny stamps, twopenny stamps, and other stamps. In post-office phraseology there is sometimes a confusion because the affixed effigy of her Majesty's head, which represents the <b>postage</b> <b>paid,</b> is called a stamp, and the postmarks or impressions indicating the names of towns are also called stamps. Those postmarks or impressions had been the work of Bagwax's life; but his zeal, his joy in his office, and the general energy of his disposition, had opened up to him also all the mysteries of the queen's heads. That stamp, that effigy, that twopenny queen's-head, which by its presence {{on the corner of the}} envelope purported to have been the price of conveying the letter from Sydney to Nobble, on 10th May, 1873, had certainly been manufactured and sent out to the colony since that date! ...|$|E

An agreement must be entered into with the Postal Service to conduct volume private carriage through the Chicago Rates and Classification Service Center which has national responsibility for the PES.|$|R

50|$|The Jewish letter-carrier of Breslau, as he neither took any oath {{of office}} nor {{received}} any salary, was not really a government official. His whole income consisted merely of the <b>postage</b> <b>paid</b> by the recipients of the letters. As, however, there were no fixed postal rates, the amount received was so small that the letter-carrier had to pursue in addition some other occupation. That the postal authorities tolerated {{this state of affairs}} is shown by the fact that when the letter-carrier was absent on other business, his wife was allowed to take his place.|$|E
5000|$|The stamp was {{originally}} for use {{only within the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and as such was, in effect, a local stamp. For this reason {{the name of the}} country was not included within the design, a situation which continued by agreement with foreign post offices, provided the sovereign's effigy appeared on the stamp. Envelopes sold with <b>postage</b> <b>paid</b> did not include this, so were marked with the country's name. In 1951, the special commemorative issue for the Festival of Britain included the name [...] "Britain" [...] incidentally. It could therefore be said that the name of the country then appeared {{for the first time on}} a stamp of the UK, although the word [...] "British" [...] had appeared on British Empire Exhibition commemorative stamps of 1924.|$|E
