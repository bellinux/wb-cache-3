Based on {{the index}} of water content, {{the influence of the}} dosage of glutaraldehyde, the mass ratio of polyvinyl alcohol(PVA) and alginate(NaAlg), the concentration of CaCl 2, and the reaction time on PVA-alginate-Ca was discussed.

50|$|In a study {{concerning}} ultracapacitors or supercapacitors, {{researchers at}} the Sungkyunkwan University in the Republic of Korea explored the possibility of increasing the capacitance of electrodes through the addition of fluorine atoms to the walls of carbon nanotubes. As briefly mentioned before, carbon nanotubes are an increasing form of capacitors due to their superb chemical stability, high conductivity, light mass, and their large surface area. These researchers fluorinated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at high temperatures to bind fluorine atoms to the walls. The attached fluorine atoms changed the non-polar nanotubes to become polar molecules. This {{can be attributed to}} the charge transfer from the fluorine. This created dipole-dipole layers along the carbon nanotube walls. Testing of these fluorinated SWCNTs against normal state SWCNTs showed a difference in capacitance. It was determined that the fluorinated SWCNTs are advantageous in fabricating electrodes for capacitors and improve the wettability with aqueous electrolytes, which promotes the overall performance of supercapacitors. While this study brought to knowledge a more efficient example of capacitors, little is known about this new supercapacitor, large scale synthesis is lacking and is necessary for any massive production, and <b>preparation</b> <b>conditions</b> are quite tedious in achieving the final product.|$|E
