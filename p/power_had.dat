5|$|Additional {{studies of}} {{different}} groups in Wilhelmine Germany have all {{contributed to a}} new view of the period. Although the Junkers did, indeed, continue to control the officer corps, they did not dominate social, political, and economic matters {{as much as the}} Sonderweg theorists had hypothesized. Eastern Junker <b>power</b> <b>had</b> a counterweight in the western provinces {{in the form of the}} Grand Bourgeoisie and in the growing professional class of bureaucrats, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh ousted the {{military}} junta led by General Dương Văn Minh from {{the leadership of}} South Vietnam without firing a shot. It came {{less than three months}} after Minh's junta had themselves come to power in a bloody coup against then President Ngô Đình Diệm. The coup was bloodless and took less than a few hours—after <b>power</b> <b>had</b> been seized Minh's aide and bodyguard, Major Nguyễn Văn Nhung was arrested and summarily executed.|$|E

5|$|Both {{operations}} were {{hampered by the}} German need to rely on their Croatian allies {{as well as the}} fact that both forces were ill-equipped for operations in mountainous terrain during extreme winter conditions. The Croatian units had proven not to be a useful addition to the operation, as they possessed {{little in the way of}} fighting <b>power,</b> <b>had</b> little unit cohesion and suffered from serious supply problems.|$|E
5|$|By 1528, Spanish colonial <b>power</b> <b>had</b> been {{established}} in the Chiapas Highlands, and encomienda rights were being issued to individual conquistadores. Spanish dominion extended from the upper drainage of the Grijalva, across Comitán and Teopisca to the Ocosingo valley. This area was incorporated into the Villa de San Cristóbal district, also including Chamula, Chiapan, and Zinacantán. The north and northwest were incorporated into the Villa de Espíritu Santo district, that included Ch'ol Maya territory around Tila, and Zoque territory around Quechula and Tecpatán.|$|E

In addition, Albert T. White, Commanding Officer of the LNG, was 'rusticated' by Tubman to become the Superindendent of Grand Gedeh in 1966, though he was later 'rehabilitated'.|$|E

She developed {{the desire to}} stop living her life under her assumed name and, through therapy that included participation in the mock trial of a soldier charged with killing civilians during the Vietnam War, she began to prepare for her surrender to the authorities. This included her decision to marry Duncan in 1992 and reveal her background to her friends.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her {{surrender}} in 1993, <b>Power</b> <b>had</b> last {{been seen}} in Kentucky in 1974.

Allied air <b>power</b> <b>had</b> been ineffective and disorganised, {{and as a}} result, Stuka losses were mainly due to ground fire.

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory {{concluded}} that the average large photovoltaic plant in the United States occupied 3.1 acres of permanently disturbed area and 3.4 acres of total site area per gigawatt-hour per year.

The concentrating solar footprint was smaller than that of coal power (18 m2/MWhr), but larger than the other sources studied, including ground photovoltaic (7.9 m2/MWhr), natural gas (0.49 m2/MWhr), and wind power (0.26 m2/MWhr).|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>power</b> <b>has</b> {{evolved from}} centuries. Gaining prestige, honor and {{reputation}} {{is one of}} the central motives for gaining power in human nature. Power also relates with empathy gaps because it limits the interpersonal relationship and compares the <b>power</b> differences. <b>Having</b> <b>power</b> or not <b>having</b> <b>power</b> can cause a number of psychological consequences. It leads to strategic versus social responsibilities. Research experiments were done as early as 1968 to explore power conflict.|$|R

5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this <b>power</b> <b>had</b> been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E

Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and were sold in exchange for weapons, supplies, and horses.|$|E
5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country. External <b>power</b> <b>had</b> shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E
