40|$|This study {{examines}} the existence or non-existence of an <b>edge</b> effect <b>on</b> artificial nest predation in a Tropical Peat swamp forest. As {{a result of}} logging, fire and land conversion many of the tropics forested landscapes are now heavily fragmented, {{increasing the amount of}} <b>edge</b> relative <b>to</b> total area. This study investigates the effects of proximity <b>to</b> <b>edge</b> <b>on</b> avian reproductive success. Nest predation is known to be an important factor in the mortality of birds and though many studies have suggested that predation rates increase towards habitat edges, a large proportion of studies carried out in the tropics do not support this trend. This study monitored artificial nests <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> an <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> interior gradient of a selectively logged peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Borneo in order to contribute to the currently, small proportion of studies carried out in the tropics. The forest is highly fragmented by canals, railway lines and logging tracks. However, the edges being investigated were two major edges created by logging and fire...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Reinforced {{concrete}} (R/C) shell structures, {{the free}} edges {{of them are}} not usually continuous depending on the design and the supporting purposes. <b>To</b> strengthen these <b>edges,</b> <b>edge</b> beams are <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> such cutting <b>edges.</b> <b>To</b> obtain the sufficient strength of such shell structures, an appropriate size of edge beams must be applieed. In this paper, the numerical analysis of the R/C cylindrical shell with edge beams by using the nonlinear finite element method. In numerical analysis, the degenerate shell elements with layered approach are adopted. Both shells and beams are modeled by these elements. To represents the nonlinear behavior of R/C shell elements, combineed material and geometric nonlinearities are taken into account. From the numerical analyses, the stiffness of the edge beams plays an important role to show the deformation characteristics annd the ultimate strength of R/C shell structures. Considering the effects of <b>edge</b> beams <b>on</b> these phenomena, the minimum size of the <b>edge</b> beam <b>to</b> represent the maximum ultimate strength of cylindrical R/C shell is represented under several conditions...|$|R
