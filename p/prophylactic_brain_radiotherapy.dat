40|$|BACKGROUND: High-dose {{methotrexate}} is {{the standard}} of care for patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma. The role of whole <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> is controversial because delayed neurotoxicity limits its acceptance as a standard of care. We aimed to investigate whether first-line chemotherapy based on high-dose methotrexate was non-inferior to the same chemotherapy regimen followed by whole <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> for overall survival. METHODS: Immunocompetent patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma were enrolled from 75 centres and treated between May, 2000, and May, 2009. Patients were allocated by computer-generated block randomisation to receive first-line chemotherapy based on high-dose methotrexate with or without subsequent whole <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy,</b> with stratification by age (< 60 vs ≥ 60 years) and institution (Berlin vs Tübingen vs all other sites). The biostatistics centre assigned patients to treatment groups and informed local centres by fax; physicians and patients were not masked to treatment group after assignment. Patients enrolled between May, 2000, and August, 2006, received high-dose methotrexate (4 g/m(2)) on day 1 of six 14 -day cycles; thereafter, patients received high-dose methotrexate plus ifosfamide (1 · 5 g/m(2)) on days 3 - 5 of six 14 -day cycles. In those assigned to receive first-line chemotherapy followed by <b>radiotherapy,</b> whole <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> was given to a total dose of 45 Gy, in 30 fractions of 1 · 5 Gy given daily on weekdays. Patients allocated to first-line chemotherapy without whole <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> who had not achieved complete response were given high-dose cytarabine. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and analysis was per protocol. Our hypothesis was that the omission of whole <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> does not compromise overall survival, with a non-inferiority margin of 0 · 9. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00153530. FINDINGS: 551 patients (median age 63 years, IQR 55 - 69) were enrolled and randomised, of whom 318 were treated per protocol.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy remains {{the standard of}} treatment for brain metastases from {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). The aim {{of this study is to}} determine if the deferral of <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> impacts patient outcomes. Methods Between May 2003 and December 2015, a total of 198 patients with brain metastases from NSCLC who received both <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> and systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) were identified. The rate of grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy had no significant difference between two groups. 127 patients received concurrent <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> and systemic therapy, and 71 patients received deferred <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> after at least two cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Disease specific-graded prognostic assessment was similar in early radiotherapy group and deferred radiotherapy group. Results Median overall survival (OS) was longer in early radiotherapy group compared to deferred radiotherapy group (17. 9 months vs 12. 6 months; P= 0. 038). Progression free survival (PFS) was also improved in patients receiving early radiotherapy compared to those receiving deferred radiotherapy (4. 0 months vs 3. 0 months; P< 0. 01). Receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after the diagnosis of brain metastases as any line therapy improved the OS (20. 0 months vs 10. 7 months; P< 0. 01), whereas receiving TKI as first line therapy did not (17. 9 months vs 15. 2 months; P= 0. 289). Conclusion Our study suggests that the use of deferred <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> may resulted in inferior OS in patients with NSCLC who develop brain metastases.

Several competing modalities capable of delivering HA-WBRT, include: Phil-ips Pinnacle step-and-shoot intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), Varian RapidArc volu-metric modulated arc therapy (RapidArc), and helical TomoTherapy (TomoTherapy). Methods In this study we compared these methods using 10 patient datasets. Anonymized planning CT (computerized tomography) scans and contour data based on fused MRI images were collected.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Brain metastases {{are common in}} non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the prognosis is poor. Erlotinib is a specific inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor-associated tyrosine kinase (EGFRTKI), which has been gradually used in the treatment for advanced NSCLC. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and its relevant factors of erlotinib in NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Methods The clinical data of 30 NSCLC patients with brain metastases were reviewed retrospectively. All of them were treated with erlotinib, given orally 150 mg daily. These patients discontinued administration of erlotinib until disease progression, death or intolerable side effects. Results In terms of intracranial lesions, partial response (PR) was observed in 2 patients (6. 7 %), with stable disease (SD) in 17 patients (56. 7 %), for overall disease control rate (DCR) of 63. 4 %. As for systemic disease, PR was observed in 2 patients (6. 7 %), with SD in 5 patients (16. 7 %), for overall DCR of 23. 4 %. There was no statistical difference in DCR among different subtypes of age, gender, smoking history, histology, PS score, the number of brain metastases, the onset of brain metastases, chemotherapy, <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> and side effects. The median time to disease progression (MTTP) and median survival time (MST) was 2. 4 months and 7. 7 months respectively. The 1 and 2 year survival rate was 38. 4 % and 15. 2 %. The univariate analysis showed that the survival time was related to the patients’ PS score, smoking history, <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> and chemotherapy. The multivariate analysis indicated that <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> was the independent prognostic factor and the relationship between the survival time and smoking history was near to statistical significance. Conclusion The patients receiving <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> may have better survival benefit. Non-smokers have a trend to survive longer than smokers.

The {{aim of this study}} is to explore prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enhanced MRI after whole <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy.</b> Methods TA retrospective review of clinical data from 241 NSCLC patients with brain metastases received whole <b>brain</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> from April 2007 to October 2008 was performed. A number of potential factors that might affect prognosis after irradiation were evaluated. The significance of prognostic variables in the survival resulted from univariate analysis by Kaplan-Meier combining with Log-rank test, and the multivariate analysis was obtained by Cox regression model. Results Median follow-up time for the survivors was 19. 1 months. For all patients, the median survival time (MST) was 8. 7 months. By univariate analysis, female patients with KPS> 70, no symptom when diagnosed with brain metastases, tumor controlled in the chest, and received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy and combined target therapy were the important factors for overall survival. By multivariate analysis, female, tumors controlled in the chest, and combined target therapy were independent prognostic factors for NSCLC patients with brain metastases.

40|$|Brain metastases {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} common distant metastases of cancer and are increasingly being detected with better diagnostic tools. The standard of care for solitary brain metastases with the primary disease under control is surgery followed by radiotherapy.
