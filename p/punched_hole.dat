40|$|Many {{kinds of}} {{recently}} developed materials are {{very hard and}} brittle, {{and it is very}} difficult and expensive to process them. Thus, it is necessary to develop an easier and more economical method to process these materials. As an example, <b>punching</b> <b>holes</b> in sheet glass was studied. Because <b>punching</b> <b>holes</b> in sheet glass by ordinary methods is impossible, we present a method for <b>punching</b> <b>holes</b> in sheet glass under static high pressure. This research confirmed {{that it is possible to}} <b>punch</b> <b>holes</b> in sheet glass, and clarified the conditions needed to obtain good holes without defects...|$|R

5000|$|A pritchel {{is a type}} of punch used in forging, {{particularly}} in making nail holes in horseshoes. The horseshoe is heated and a hole is punched through 90 percent of the steel with a forepunch or drift punch. The pointed end of the tool should be kept sharp and so that the burr is cut out smoothly. The <b>punched</b> <b>hole</b> is lined up over the pritchel hole and the pritchel is driven into the hole, knocking out the remaining metal {{at the bottom of the}} <b>punched</b> <b>hole.</b> [...] The temperature of the pritchel should be always below the red-hot stage as the tool itself will bend and lose the temper. When over-heated it is advised to cool it in water intermediately.|$|E

40|$|A large {{experimental}} study was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of hole making upon the strength, ductility, and fatigue performance of structural steel plates and connections. The variables included steel strength, plate thickness, <b>hole</b> size, <b>punch</b> to die clearance, galvanizing, temperature, and edge distance. Approximately 300 tension and fatigue tests were performed. The study agreed with the results of previous research that plates with <b>punched</b> <b>holes</b> have lower strength and ductility than ones with drilled holes. The fatigue performance of plates with <b>punched</b> <b>holes</b> was also less than ones with drilled holes. Galvanizing further reduced the fatigue strength of plates with <b>punched</b> <b>holes.</b> The effect upon hole making upon the fatigue strength and to some extent the tensile strength reduced when fully pretensioned bolts were used. Empty holes had a lower fatigue strength then holes used in a bolted connection. The practice of increasing the hole diameter by 1 / 16 in. when calculating the net section of a tension member did not account for the reduction in strength when the <b>hole</b> was <b>punched.</b> It is recommended that this increase in hole be eliminated and the tension strength of members with <b>punched</b> <b>holes</b> b...|$|R

50|$|From 1871 to 1881 {{a number}} of {{different}} telegraph stamps were issued for Puerto Rico. From 1882 postage stamps were used for telegraph fees which were usually cancelled with a <b>punched</b> <b>hole.</b> From 1886 to 1889 {{a number of}} stamps were issued for Puerto Rican municipalities marked TELEGRAFOS as part of the extension of the telegraph network to more towns. It is unclear if these were revenue stamps for a tax on telegrams or to pay the fee for sending a telegraphic message but at least twenty different areas are known to have issued the stamps.|$|E
50|$|The {{punched card}} acted as an {{insulator}} and an electrical contact was only {{completed in the}} presence of a <b>punched</b> <b>hole.</b> A control panel controlled what function was to be performed by directing the impulse to a series of ‘wire contact relays’ with the impulses de-coded according to the Hollerith code. (Mark Sense could not provide the current needed to ‘pick’ a wire contact relay and so needed vacuum tubes to amplify the current). After the card was read, a ‘Card Gate’ moved into the card path to stop the card for printing on the correct horizontal line.|$|E
50|$|To {{control the}} {{expansion}} of a bullet, meplat design and materials are engineered. The meplat designs are: flat; round to pointed depending on the ogive; hollow pointed which can be large in diameter and shallow or narrow in diameter and deep and truncated which is a long narrow <b>punched</b> <b>hole</b> {{in the end of}} a monolithic-solid type bullet. The materials used to make bullets are: pure lead; alloyed lead for hardness; gilding metal jacket which is a copper alloy of nickel and zinc to promote higher velocities; pure copper; copper alloy of bronze with tungsten steel alloy inserts to promote weight.|$|E

50|$|A second figurine {{of about}} the same size and shape as the Westray Wife, but made from clay, and missing its head, was {{discovered}} by archaeologists at the same Links of Noltland site during the summer of 2010. This figurine, 3.4 cm in height, has a rectangular panel decorated with triangles on the front of its torso, which may represent a tunic, and a <b>punched</b> <b>hole</b> in the centre of its stomach. A number of small clay balls have also been discovered at the site, and it is possible that these were intended for use as heads for similar figurines. A third figurine was discovered in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Planting also {{requires}} specialized planting equipment. The most common planting equipment is a waterwheel type transplanter. The waterwheel transplanter utilizes a rotating drum or drums with spikes at set intervals. The drum or drums have a water supply that continuously fills the drum with water. The transplanter rolls the spiked drum {{over the bed}} of plastic. As the drum presses a spike into the plastic a hole is punched a water flows into the <b>punched</b> <b>hole.</b> A rider on the transplanter can then place a plant in the hole. These drums can have multiple rows and varied intervals to create the desired spacing for that particular crop.|$|E
5000|$|Several can openers with {{a simple}} and robust design have been {{specifically}} developed for military use. The P-38 and P-51 are small can openers with a cutter hinged to the main body. They were {{also known as a}} [...] "John Wayne" [...] because the actor was shown in a training film opening a can of K-rations. The P-38 can opener is keychain-sized, about 1.5 inches (38 mm) long, and consists of a short metal blade that serves as a handle (and can also be used as a screwdriver), with a small, hinged metal tooth that folds out to pierce the can lid. A notch just under the hinge point keeps the opener hooked around the rim of the can as the device is [...] "walked" [...] around the rim to cut the lid out. A larger version, called P-51, is somewhat easier to operate. P-38 was developed in 1942 and was issued in the canned field rations of the United States Armed Forces from World War II to the 1980s. The P-38 and P-51 are cheaper to manufacture and are smaller and lighter to carry than most other can openers. The device can be easily attached to a keyring or dog tag chain using the small <b>punched</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
