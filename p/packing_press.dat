Items packed included raw cotton, cotton yarn, waste silk, wool, hides, goatskins, and other commodities for which <b>press</b> <b>packing</b> for shipment or storage was suitable. The firm also offered rooms to the public for use in the sorting, grading, and storage of all types of cargo.

25|$|As the hyphae of the Hartig net region {{become more}} densely <b>packed,</b> they <b>press</b> against the cell {{walls of the}} phytobiont’s root cells. Often the fungal and plant cell walls become almost indistinguishable where they meet, thus forming a {{homogenous}} interfacial matrix through which nutrients can easily disperse. The tips of the branched hyphae contain dense cytoplasm with {{a high concentration of}} mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum. This arrangement is stretched in the direction of hyphal growth indicating that the transfer of nutrients between fungus and plant is localized in this area of contact. ATPase activity in both fungal and plant plasma membranes at the Hartig net indicate a cooperatively bidirectional nutrient exchange.|$|R

40|$|Inverters play a {{key role}} in realizing {{reliable}} multi-megawatt power electronic converters used in offshore applications, as their failure leads to production losses and impairs safety. The performance of high power handing semiconductor devices with high speed control capabilities and redundant configurations helps in realizing a fault-tolerant design. This paper describes the reliability modeling done for an industry standard, 3 -level neutral point clamped multi-megawatt inverter, the significance of semiconductor redundancy in reducing inverter failure rates, and proposes methods for achieving static and dynamic redundancy in series connected <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> type insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT). It is identified that, with the multi megawatt inverter having 3 + 2 IGBT in each half leg with dynamic redundancy incorporated, it is possible to reduce the failure rate of the inverter from 53. 8 % to 15 % in 5 years of continuous operation. The simulation results indicate that with dynamic redundancy, it is possible to force an untriggered <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> IGBT to short circuit in < 1 s, when operated with a pulse width modulation frequency of 1 kHz...|$|R

50|$|The {{publication}} of the report was {{seen by many as}} the nadir of the 1990s Conservative governments of the UK. Prior to the report's publication, those ministers who were criticised were given the opportunity to comment and request revisions. The 1,806-page report was published, along with a <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> which included a few relatively positive extracts from the report presented as if representative of the entire report, at 3:30pm. Given a then largely pro-government press, this proved effective at stalling an extensive analysis in the media.|$|R
