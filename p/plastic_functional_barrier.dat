A hybrid model that combines molecular and free volume theory elements is used to interpret the collected experimental data.

40|$|Stimulated by new ecology-driven European and {{national}} regulations, new routes of recycling waste {{appear on the}} market. Since food packages represent {{a large percentage of}} the plastics consumption and since they hare a short lifetime, an important approach consists in making new packages from post-consumer used packages. On the other hand, food-packaging regulations in Europe require that packaging materials must be safe. Therefore, potential mass transfer (migration) of harmful recycling-related substances to the food must be excluded and test methods to ensure the safety-in-use of recycled materials for food packaging are needed. As a consequence of this situation, a European research project FAIR-CT 98 - 4318, with the acronym 'Recyclability', was initiated. The project consists of three sections each focusing on a different class of recycled materials : polyethylene terephthalate (PET), paper and hoard, and <b>plastics</b> covered by <b>functional</b> <b>barriers.</b> The project consortium consists of 28 project members from 11 EU countries. In addition, the project is during its lifetime in discussion with the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) to consider also US FDA regulatory viewpoints and to aim, as a consequence, to harmonizable conclusions and recommendations.

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this work {{was the fact that}} <b>functional</b> <b>barriers</b> are in most cases already in-situ-contaminated due to the thermally extreme coextrusion conditions of the manufacturing process. As a consequence, middle layer contaminants may already have penetrated the <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> of a food package and may provide direct contact with the foodstuff at the time when the package is filled. Nevertheless, depending on the individual food package parameters, the remaining <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> efficiency can still prevent inadmissible migration. To meet this real-life situation and to describe the underlying migration process a theoretical migration model was developed and experimentally verified in this work using artificially contaminated multilayer HIPS sheets with different <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> thickness. An important result of this study was the finding that compared with the interdiffusion between the package's layers in situ during their formation in the coextrusion process, th e interdiffusion at ambient temperature until the filling time point of the package is able to be neglected...|$|R

This investigation includes both, recycled material in direct contact with food and recycled material separated by a virgin polymer layer (<b>functional</b> <b>barrier)</b> from the food.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Ph. D. was to {{investigate}} the possibility to use recycled plastics in food packaging applications. In order to protect the consumer, this can be achieved through their incorporation in <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> structures. Thus, a lag time is introduced in the migration of random contaminants. For this purpose, the efficiency of two polymers, High Density Polyethylene and Isotactic Polypropylene, was studied through the conduction of challenge tests, migration tests and sorption tests. The results showed that the former represents a bad solution as a <b>functional</b> <b>barrier,</b> while the latter is a possible candidate after proper treatment. The migration tests were, on a second level, simulated through a mathematical model of finite differences.

40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>barriers</b> are {{multilayer}} structures {{deemed to}} prevent migration of some chemicals released by food-contact materials into food. In {{the area of}} plastics packaging, different migration behaviours of mono- and multilayer structures are assessed in terms of lag time and of their influence of the solubility of the migrants in food simulants. Whereas barriers to oxygen or to aromas must prevent the diffusion of these compounds under conditions of use, a <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> must also be efficient under processing conditions, to prevent diffusion of substances when the polymer layers are in contact at high (processing) temperatures. Diffusion in melted polymers at high temperatures is much slower for glassy polymers, than in polymers that are rubbery at ambient temperature. To evaluate the behaviour of <b>functional</b> <b>barriers</b> under conditions of use, a set of reference diffusion coefficients in the 40 - 60 °C range were determined for 14 polymers. Conditions for accelerated migration tests are proposed based on worst-case activation energy in the 40 - 60 °C range. For simulation of migration, numerical models are available. The rules derived from the models can be used both by industry (to optimize a material in terms of migration) or by risk assessors.

40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>barriers</b> form {{parts of}} {{multi-layer}} packaging materials, which are deemed {{to protect the}} food from migration of {{a broad range of}} contaminants, e. g. those associated with reused packaging. Often, neither the presence nor the identity of the contaminants is known, so that safety assessment of the materials has to rely on predictive tools. Several complementary freeware described here allow one to model diffusion in multi-layer films. These tools require the input of parameters that are not easy to determine or predict. Previous work has focused on the prediction of diffusion coefficients at storage temperatures of packaging in contact with food. However, many other kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are needed to describe transport properties during the processing of a material at high temperature and during its shelf-life. All parameters needed for the calculations are discussed. In order to propose default values, the approach consists of (1) reviewing the available literature data, (2) running experiments on polypropylene, polyethylene and poly(ethylene vinyl alcohol) in typical conditions (separately diffusion during processing and migration) and (3) simulating numerical sets for typical situations. Several freeware are proposed to simulate migration from multi-layers and <b>functional</b> <b>barriers</b> using the default parameters...|$|R

40|$|A <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> (FB) can be {{generally}} {{defined as a}} package construction that limits the amount of migration compounds from the package to an acceptable degree. Most commonly the package is a multilayer structure and the migrating compounds originate from the package interior encapsulated by plastics barrier layers. The degree of "acceptability" which {{is controlled by the}} toxocological evaluation or the organoleptical impact of the respective compound is either defined by law through individual specific migration limits or a general threshold of regulation or by the quality assurance requirements to a certain product. The FB efficienca - understood as a migration related term - depends on the numerous parameters which are connected with the type of polymer and foodstuff as well as the food packaging application.

Two groups were defined: post-bariatric group included patients who had bariatric surgery (laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding or Mason's vertical gastroplasty) before underwent the plastic or orthopedic surgery, non-bariatric group were all the others patients. Data included anesthetic management were recorded in a computer database. Incidence of pulmonary aspiration was the outcome variable. Results: A total of 208 <b>plastic</b> and <b>functional</b> operations (72 cases and 136 controls) were performed. Pulmonary aspiration is significantly (p< 0. 005) higher in post-bariatric group (5 patients: 6. 9 %) than in non-bariatric group (0 patient).
