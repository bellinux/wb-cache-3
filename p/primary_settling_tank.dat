40|$|Abstract: Design of <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> has {{historically}} been done more empirically than rationally. The main {{reason for this is}} a lack of understanding of what pollutants <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> are capable of removing. Inlets should be designed to dissipate the kinetic energy or velocity head of the mixed liquor. They should be able to distribute the flow equally in vertical and horizontal directions. Inlets should also be designed to prevent short-circuiting. Flow in <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> is simulated by means of computational fluid dynamic (CFD). The fluid is assumed incompressible and non-buoyant. Two-dimensional simulation for one-phase flow has been done. The RNG turbulent model was solved with the Navier-Stockes equations. The flow pattern properties in the settling tank include the velocity profiles, the flow separation area and kinetic energy. In this study, the effect of inlet configurations on these characteristics is considered. Due to this object, rectangular, slope and curved shape of inlet slot are suggested...|$|E

40|$|Circulation regions always {{exist in}} {{settling}} tanks. These regions {{would result in}} short-circuiting enlargement of the dead&# 13; zone and high flow mixing problems and avoid optimal particle sedimentation. Therefore, the main objective of the tank&# 13; design process is to avoid formation of the circulation zone, which is known as dead zone. Experiments show that the tank&# 13; performance can be improved by altering the geometry of the tank {{which leads to a}} different velocity distributions and flow&# 13; patterns. In this paper, the presence of a baffle and its effect on the hydrodynamics of the flow field has been investigated in&# 13; a <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> Hydrodynamics of the flow field in these basins is sophisticated. Therefore a numerical simulation&# 13; has been provided to discover such flow field.

Besides, the RNG turbulence model was used in the numerical&# 13; calculations.

40|$|A new {{perspective}} on the modelling of settling behaviour in water resource recovery facilities is introduced. The {{ultimate goal is to}} describe in a unified way the processes taking place both in <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> (PSTs) and secondary <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> (SSTs) for a more detailed operation and control. First, experimental evidence is provided, pointing out distributed particle properties (such as size, shape, density, porosity, and flocculation state) as an important common source of distributed settling behaviour in different settling unit processes and throughout different settling regimes (discrete, hindered and compression settling). Subsequently, a unified model framework that considers several particle classes is proposed in order to describe distributions in settling behaviour as well as the effect of variations in particle properties on the settling process. The result is a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that are valid from dilute concentrations, where they correspond to discrete settling, to concentrated suspensions, where they correspond to compression settling. Consequently, these PDEs model both PSTs and SSTs...|$|R

The study was conducted in 17 municipal mechanical-biological wastewater treatment plants which, to a slight degree, differed in the technological process of wastewater treatment and the method of hygienisation of sewage sludge. The selected treatment plants, located in seven regions, included five classified as large agglomerations (population equivalent - PE > 100 000), ten as medium-size (PE 15 000 - 100 000), and two as smaller size with PE 10 000 - 5000. The largest number of viable eggs of Ascaris spp., Toxocara spp., and Trichuris spp. was found in the sewage sludge collected from the <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> A slightly lower number of the eggs were found in the samples of excess sludge, which indicates that the sedimentation process in the <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> is not sufficiently long to effectively separate parasites’ eggs from the sewage treated. The number of eggs of Ascaris spp. and Toxocara spp. in the fermented sludge was nearly 3 times lower than that in the raw sludge. The effectiveness of hygienisation of dehydrated sewage sludge by means of quicklime was confirmed in two wastewater treatment plants, with respect to Ascaris spp. eggs, in three plants with respect to Toxocara spp. eggs, and in one plant with respect to Trichuris spp. eggs. The mean reduction of the number of eggs was 65 %, 61 %, and 100 %, respectively. In one wastewater treatment plant, a reduction in the number of viable eggs of Ascaris and Trichuris species was also noted as a result of composting sludge by 85 % and 75 %, respectively.

This system helped to reduce concentrations of nutrients, salts, BOD, COD, SS, heavy metals, and synthetic detergents, before they enter larger watercourses (Matsumoto 1998). This system, named Shimanto-gawa, uses only natural materials and no synthetic chemical for the wastewater treatment.

40|$|The {{suspended}} and {{dissolved solids}} {{generated in the}} wastewater treatment process are called sludges or sewage sludge. Sludge may also be defined as any solid, semisolid or liquid material generated from a wastewater treatment process. This sludge is also commonly known as biosolids. Wastewater treatment operations require careful management of sludge, not only after removal from the treatment process, but also during the treatment process: sludge is a critical biologically active mix of water, organic matter (derived from human wastes, food wastes, etc.), inorganic solids (including trace elements), dead and alive micro-organisms (including pathogens), and trace contaminants (e. g., chemicals). Some sludge is routinely recycled within the treatment facility process to optimize operations. However, as sludge builds up, batches of it are regularly removed from effluent treatment operations.

According to the conclusions of this survey filamentous bulking is a widespread phenomenon in Greek wastewater treatment plants. Almost 70 % of the sludge samples examined exhibited filament indices greater than 4 during the winter period.

This seasonal pattern of biomass composition was followed by a similar seasonal variation of the settling characteristics in terms of Filament Index (FI) and Sludge Volume Index (SVI) values. M. parvicella's proliferation is favored in Carrousel and oxidation ditches systems especially when <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> stage was preceeded, whereas its growth is also highly stimulated in intermittent aeration systems, {{even in the absence of}} <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tanks.</b> Finally there is evidence that Bio-P systems without primary sedimentation inhibit its growth. © Selper Ltd., 2007...|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} sewage sludge {{produced}} {{is proportional to the}} amount and concentration of wastewater treated, and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used. It can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated. The total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> (if {{they are part of the}} process configuration) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step. For example, primary sedimentation produces about 110-170 kg/ML of so-called primary sludge, with a value of 150 kg/ML regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the U.S. or Europe. The sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3. Of the biological treatment processes, the activated sludge process produces about 70-100 kg/ML of waste activated sludge, and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process: 60-100 kg/ML. This means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180-270 kg/ML, being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge.|$|R
