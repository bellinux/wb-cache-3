It was designed by noted architect Charles M. Robinson and built in 1929 in the Late Gothic Revival style. It is constructed of brick, stone, and concrete and has a rectangular plan with a <b>telescoping</b> <b>projection</b> at the rear. During the mid-1980s, new stained glass windows wereinstalled {{as part of a}} renovation project.|$|R
5000|$|Larger aspheres {{are made}} by {{grinding}} and polishing. Lenses produced by these techniques are used in <b>telescopes,</b> <b>projection</b> TVs, missile guidance systems, and scientific research instruments. They {{can be made by}} point-contact contouring to roughly the right form which is then polished to its final shape. In other designs, such as the Schmidt systems, the aspheric corrector plate can be made by using a vacuum to distort an optically parallel plate into a curve which is then polished [...] "flat" [...] on one side. Aspheric surfaces can also be made by polishing with a small tool with a compliant surface that conforms to the optic, although precise control of the surface form and quality is difficult, and the results may change as the tool wears.|$|R
40|$|The premier {{record of}} {{long-term}} solar activity is the sunspot count. After developing a theoretical model of sunspot visibility, {{this model is}} tested against observations, and recommendations are made for improved calculation of sunspot counts. The theoretical model's result is a predicted threshold size for sunspot visibility with the unaided (but filtered) eye, direct vision through a telescope, pinhole camera, and <b>telescope</b> <b>projection.</b> Also reported are over 3250 days of sunspot observations from six observers, 38 yr of daily observations by an experienced observer, 1837 days of observations from a network with over 50 experienced observers, observations from 30 inexperienced observers, as well as summaries of results from 102 AAVSO solar observers. The comparison of the observed thresholds with the predicted thresholds reveals agreement to within the uncertainties, so that the model is validated by observation...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} formulation for {{the optical}} setup {{of a typical}} EARLINET lidar system is given here. The equations describing a lidar system from the emitted laser beam to the <b>projection</b> of the <b>telescope</b> aperture on the final receiving unit (i. e., photomultiplier or photodiode) are presented, based on paraxial approximation and geometric optics approach. The receiving optical setup includes a telescope, a collimating lens, an interference filter and the ensemble objective eyepiece. The set of the derived equations interconnects major parameters of the optical components (e. g., focal lengths, diameters, angles of incidence), revealing their association with the distance of full overlap of the system. These equations may used complementarily with an optical design software, for the preliminary design of a system or {{can be used as}} a quick check up tool of an existing lidar system. The evaluation of the formulation on a real system is performed with ray-tracing simulations, revealing an overall good performance with relative differences of the order of 5  % mainly attributed to the limitations of the thin lens approximation...|$|R
5000|$|Making {{altitude}} (elevation) {{measurements of}} the Sun being simple and direct, requiring the user to aligning {{the image of the}} Sun through the front pinhole (aperture), centered onto the rear back plate which operates more like a mask and not a viewing pass hole for sighting the Sun with the naked eye. Much {{in the same manner as}} performing eyepiece <b>projection</b> with a <b>telescope,</b> one fashioned with a front and rear aperture (font lens and rear eyepiece) along with a projection screen behind the eyepiece, or more rudimentary, the projecting of the Sun’s image upon a small screen plate such as that done with a mariner’s back staff. The rear, or second aperture (pass hole) having the function of working as a blacken attenuator so that any reflecting, annulus shaped sunlight off the metal aperture is not too bright, the Sun’s image (light) passing through the second hole and similar in task though void of a fixed image plane, to that of an iris (diaphragm) in a camera lens to reduce the light intensity. For relative to human physiology, focusing on a bright spot of light such as a pin point image of the Sun for any extended period or repetitively over a short duration of time adversely effects momentarily, a person’s visual acuity, thus making it more challenging to focus one’s eyes to read the angular scale. It being typical to orientate the instrument such that the operator faces looking slightly down upon the scale, the Sun at the users left, with right hand placed in such a way that the rays of sunlight pass through the two, perforated sighting plates, forming a bright illuminated spot on the observer’s finger (see photo), the finger functioning as a projection screen. At the moment an optical alignment with the Sun is established, the angular value of the device is read by the operator at the point where the graduated scale is bisected by the hanging plumb line.|$|R
30|$|The Multi-point Signal Resonator (MSR) {{algorithm}} {{is used in}} the analysis (Narita et al. 2011). Various methods have been proposed to detect wave modes through wave vector analysis: six-component method (Storey and Lefeuvre 1979, 1980), eigenvalue and eigenvector decomposition (Schmidt 1986) and its generalization to the problem to the unknown numbers of signals (Choi et al. 1993), minimum variance projection (Neubauer and Glassmeier 1990; Pinçon and Lefeuvre 1991; Motschmann et al. 1995, 1996; Glassmeier et al. 2001). MSR is unique in that it combines two distinct projection methods from spatial coordinates into wavevectors. The first projection is the wave telescope algorithm which is the maximum likelihood method for a Gaussian likelihood function. The second projection is Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), which is an eigenvector analysis method. The wave telescope method is an application of the minimum variance estimator [also called the least square estimator or the Capon estimator (Capon 1969)] to the four-spacecraft measurements in space. The method is a projection of the vectorial quantity (e.g., magnetic field) sampled at four spatial points from the spatial coordinates onto the three-dimensional wavevector domain (Glassmeier et al. 2001) The method plays a role of the Fourier transform to the wavevector domain. In contrast to the Fourier transform, the wave telescope method estimates the fluctuation amplitudes in the wavevector domain by fitting with a set of plane waves under the constraint of minimizing the isotropic noise in the data. Mathematically, the wave telescope method or the minimum variance estimator is regarded as the maximum likelihood method assuming a Gaussian shape for the likelihood function. The effect of the finite noise is eliminated by employing an extended form of the MUSIC algorithm (Schmidt 1986) and coupling it to the wave <b>telescope</b> <b>projection.</b> The MSR method was developed particularly for studying waves and turbulence using four-point magnetic field data and makes extensive use of the 12 -by- 12 covariance matrix (three components of the magnetic field measured at four spacecraft) by combining the minimum variance projection with the MUSIC algorithm. The MSR technique {{is based on the assumption}} that the measured fluctuations represent a set of plane waves (both coherent and incoherent wave components) and that the fluctuations contain small-amplitude isotropic noise. The energy spectrum is obtained as a function of spacecraft-frame frequencies and wavevectors. The 12 -by- 12 matrix is from the magnetic field measurements. Therefore, electrostatic fluctuations cannot be studied, which is a weakness. However, degeneration due to the multiple waves at one frequency does not apply here because the 12 -by- 12 matrix (which is determined in the frequency domain) is projected onto the 3 -D wavevector domain, which is a strength of the method.|$|R
40|$|After School Astronomy {{clubs are}} an {{important}} method of exposing students to astronomy at the critical middle school age when sparking an interest can inspire a lifelong career or hobby. We know that teachers complain that they can spend little time on astronomy in the classroom since they must teach to the test and the curriculum requirements do not have very extensive astronomy coverage. We also know that space is a very popular subject with students that can motivate them to join an after school club. One {{of the problems with}} after school astronomy clubs is that they don't often have a chance to observe the night sky. We propose to train club mentors on how to do daytime solar observing so students fulfill the IYA goal of looking through a telescope. We propose to provide a half day workshop for elementary and middle school teachers on starting and maintaining After School Astronomy clubs with special emphasis on observing the Sun not only in the visible spectrum but with radio waves {{and other parts of the}} spectrum as well. We will use NASA-oriented or NASA-funded educational materials and websites to bring a variety of ideas to the mentors and a broad knowledge of astronomy to the students. Attendees will be given an overview of the science of the Sun and how it can affect us on the Earth. They will be shown the dynamic nature of the Sun and what to look for to track the events happening there. The educators will be shown simple approaches to directly observing the Sun such as pinhole cameras, use of <b>projection</b> techniques with <b>telescopes</b> or binoculars, etc. They will be acquainted with sunspotter scopes and the advantages and disadvantages (such as expense) they pose for getting students involved. We will also point out the possibilities of using regular telescopes with solar filters and the specialized solar viewing telescopes such as the Coronado. Once the educators are comfortable with the simple approaches to viewing the Sun we will expose them to advanced topics such as remotely viewing the Sun using telescopes available on the web. Resources such as the Sun-Earth Viewer will allow them to study near real-time images of the Sun in multiple wavelengths. They will also be shown how they can monitor the Sun at radio wavelengths via remote telescopes or even how to purchase and build their own radio telescopes for hands-on monitoring of the Sun and other radio sources. We will conduct a brief evaluation of the participants knowledge of the Sun as they come into the workshop. We will also ask them to complete a brief knowledge survey at the end to determine if their knowledge and comfort level with solar science has improved significantly...|$|R
