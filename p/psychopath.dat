40|$|Although {{deficits in}} several {{cortical}} and subcortical structures {{have been found}} in <b>psychopaths,</b> it remains unclear whether the neuropathology differs between subgroups of <b>psychopaths</b> (i. e., unsuccessful and successful). Using both traditional and novel image analyses methods, this study aims to reveal gross and subtle morphological changes in the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala in unsuccessful and successful <b>psychopaths.</b> Volumetric segmentation, cortical pattern matching, and surface-based mesh modeling methods were used to examine prefrontal and amygdala structures in 16 unsuccessful <b>psychopaths,</b> 10 successful <b>psychopaths,</b> and 27 controls. Significant reduced gray matter volume and cortical thickness/ surface shape in the middle frontal, orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala were found in unsuccessful <b>psychopaths</b> but not successful <b>psychopaths,</b> compared with controls. This study provides the first evidence of greater prefrontal and amygdala structural deficits in unsuccessful <b>psychopaths,</b> which may predispose them to poor behavioral control and impaired decision-making, thus making them more prone to convictions...|$|R

40|$|In {{popular culture}} <b>psychopaths</b> are inaccurately portrayed as serial killers or homicidal maniacs. Most {{real-world}} <b>psychopaths</b> are neither killers nor maniacs. Psychologists currently understand psychopathy as an affective disorder {{that leads to}} repeated criminal and antisocial behavior. Counter to this prevailing view, I claim that psychopathy is not necessarily linked with criminal behavior. Successful <b>psychopaths,</b> an intriguing new category of psychopathic agent, support this conception of psychopathy. I then consider reactive attitude theories of moral responsibility. Within this tradition, <b>psychopaths</b> {{are thought to be}} blameless {{as a result of their}} pronounced affective deficits. <b>Psychopaths</b> are considered morally blind because they lack the moral emotions that make us sensitive to moral reasons. I argue that, even if they are morally blind, <b>psychopaths</b> remain open to forms of blame stemming from non-moral reactive attitudes. These reactive attitudes remain appropriate because <b>psychopaths</b> can express hateful, disgusting, or contemptible non-moral values in their judgments...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the construct of}} psychopathy {{and the study of}} <b>psychopaths.</b> It identifies that <b>psychopaths</b> have been studied extensively in their criminal manifestations but that there is a large and recognised gap in the literature and a stated need for the study of successful <b>psychopaths</b> and Corporate <b>Psychopaths.</b> The thesis outlines the research instrument used to identify such people in a 2008 survey of management behaviour among 346 managers in Australia. The robust statistical validity and reliability of the instrument is described, and the high level of face validity of the resultant findings is noted. The research defined Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> as <b>psychopaths</b> who work in corporations. Operationally, Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> were defined as those managers who scored above 12 on a psychopathy measure of their behaviour. It investigated outcomes in terms of the influence of the presence of Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> on organisational constraints, withdrawal from the workplace, workplace conflict and bullying, workload, levels of job satisfaction and perceived levels of corporate social responsibility. Nearly all of the dependent variables deployed in the current research show a significant relationship with Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> in the expected direction. Findings highlight that while Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> comprise only a small minority of employees and managers, they have a significant, negative influence on organisational outcomes. Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> create disorder in the workplace on a scale previously unimagined and unidentified until now. They directly or indirectly account for large amounts of rudeness and bullying and significant amounts of other types of employee-related work difficulties. They also have a strongly negative influence on a whole host of workplace outcomes, including withdrawal from the workplace, workplace constraints and job satisfaction. The presence of Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> in organisations thus costs organisations in lost employee time as they withdraw from the organisational environment and in sub-optimal employee performance as they cope with extra organisational constraints. The presence of Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> in organisations presents unnecessarily difficult working conditions for employees as they cope with a hostile working environment and with myriad negative influences associated with poor levels of job satisfaction. This has practical implications for organisational and human resource management as discussed in the thesis...|$|R

5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker {{is portrayed as}} a {{criminal}} mastermind. Introduced as a <b>psychopath</b> with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E

Specifically, some found an exaggerated asymmetry in the hippocampus volume (right larger than left) (Raine et al., 2004) and a reduced volume of grey matter in the prefrontal cortex (Yang et al., 2005). These results point out that unsuccessful <b>psychopaths</b> can have a poorer capacity to learn aversive conditioning, emotional regulation and decision making.|$|R

We hypothesize that “hidden” college <b>psychopaths</b> are more interpersonally maladjusted than peers, equally successful intellectually, and less impulsive than their incarcerated counterparts. Understanding the differences and similarities between incarcerated and hidden <b>psychopaths</b> may lead to improved recognition and possibly early intervention with these social predators...|$|R

5|$|Renowned as Batman's {{greatest}} enemy, the Joker {{is known}} {{by a number}} of nicknames, including the Clown Prince of Crime, the Jester of Genocide, the Harlequin of Hate, and the Ace of Knaves. During the evolution of the DC Universe, interpretations and versions of the Joker have taken two forms. The original, dominant image is that of an extreme <b>psychopath,</b> with genius-level intelligence and a warped, sadistic sense of humor. The other version, popular in comic books from the late 1940s to the 1960s and in the 1960s television series, is an eccentric, harmless prankster and thief. Like other long-lived characters, the Joker's character and cultural interpretations have changed with time, however unlike other characters who may need to reconcile or ignore previous versions to make sense, more than any other comic book character, the Joker thrives on his mutable and irreconcilable identities. The Joker is typically seen in a purple suit with a long-tailed, padded-shoulder jacket, a string tie, gloves, striped pants and spats on pointed-toe shoes (sometimes with a wide-brimmed hat). This appearance is such a fundamental aspect of the character that when the 2004 animated series The Batman placed the Joker in a straitjacket, it quickly redesigned him in his familiar suit.|$|E

40|$|Psychopathic {{behavior}} is characteristically amoral, but to date research studies have largely failed {{to identify any}} systematic differences in moral judgment capability between <b>psychopaths</b> and non-psychopaths. In this study, we investigate whether significant differences in moral judgment emerge when {{taking into account the}} phenotypic heterogeneity of the disorder through a well-validated distinction between psychopathic subtypes. Three groups of incarcerated participants [low-anxious <b>psychopaths</b> (n 1 ⁄ 4 12), high-anxious <b>psychopaths</b> (n 1 ⁄ 4 12) and non-psychopaths (n 1 ⁄ 4 24) ] completed a moral judgment test involving hypothet- ical dilemmas. The moral dilemmas featured personal (i. e. involving direct physical harm) or impersonal (i. e. involving indirect or remote harm) actions. Compared to non-psychopaths, both groups of <b>psychopaths</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} endorse the impersonal actions. However, only the low-anxious <b>psychopaths</b> were significantly more likely to endorse the personal harms when commission of the harm would maximize aggregate welfare the utilitarian choice. High-anxious <b>psychopaths</b> and non-psychopaths did not significantly differ in their personal moral judgments. These results provide novel laboratory evidence of abnormal moral judgment in <b>psychopaths,</b> as well as additional support for the importance of considering psychopathic subtypes...|$|R
40|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} disorder characterized by emotional deficits and {{a failure to}} inhibit impulsive behavior and is often subdivided into primary and secondary psychopathic subtypes. The maladaptive behavior related to primary psychopathy is thought to reflect constitutional fearlessness, while the problematic behavior related to secondary psychopathy is motivated by other factors. The fearlessness observed in psychopathy has often been interpreted as reflecting a fundamental deficit in amygdala function, and previous studies have provided support for a low-fear model of psychopathy. However, many of these studies fail to use appropriate screening procedures, use liberal inclusion criteria, or have used unconventional approaches to assay amygdala function. We measured brain activity with BOLD imaging in primary and secondary <b>psychopaths</b> and non-psychopathic control subjects during Pavlovian fear conditioning. In contrast to the low-fear model, we observed normal fear expression in primary <b>psychopaths.</b> <b>Psychopaths</b> also displayed greater differential BOLD activity in the amygdala relative to matched controls. Inverse patterns of activity were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for primary versus secondary <b>psychopaths.</b> Primary <b>psychopaths</b> exhibited a pattern of activity in the dorsal and ventral ACC consistent with enhanced fear expression, while secondary <b>psychopaths</b> exhibited a pattern of activity in these regions consistent with fear inhibition. These results contradict the low-fear model of psychopathy and suggest that the low fear observed for <b>psychopaths</b> in previous studies may be specific to secondary <b>psychopaths...</b>|$|R
40|$|This PhD by Public Works {{is based}} on a context {{statement}} and eight, refereed papers published in academic journals. Six papers theoretically examine the possible influence of corporate <b>psychopaths</b> on organizations and society. Additionally the two empirical papers focus on the influence of corporate <b>psychopaths</b> on counterproductive work behaviour, conflict, well-being and organizational decay. Collectively the papers make an empirical, theoretical and methodological contribution to research into corporate <b>psychopaths.</b> Areas of Corporate Psychopathy Theory are developed in all eight papers. The first paper was based on an initial understanding of the possible effects of corporate <b>psychopaths.</b> The second paper, called 'The Dark Side of Management Decisions: Organisational Psychopaths', was published in a British journal and was the further theoretical development of the ideas presented in the first paper. The third paper is an empirical paper which makes a contribution to knowledge in terms of investigating the influence of corporate <b>psychopaths</b> on conflict, well-being and counterproductive work behaviour. The fourth paper: 'Extreme Managers, Extreme Workplaces: Capitalism, Organisations and Corporate Psychopaths' again makes a contribution to knowledge based on exploratory qualitative research conducted in the UK in 2013. The fifth paper is a theoretical paper published in the Journal of Business Ethics. The sixth paper: 'The Impact of Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> on Corporate Reputation and Marketing' was a theoretical paper concerning how <b>psychopaths</b> may influence marketing, thus providing avenues for further research. The seventh paper portrays corporate <b>psychopaths</b> as irresponsible leaders while the eighth paper is an update of the literature on corporate <b>psychopaths</b> within the last ten years and which identifies areas for further research...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of whether <b>psychopaths</b> are morally responsible is a difficult one for philosophers and non-philosophers alike. In comparison to some other forms of mental illness, {{it is difficult to}} locate intuitions concerning what our attitudes to <b>psychopaths</b> should be and how they should be treated. This is because, unlike people with some other forms of mental illness, <b>psychopaths</b> (qua <b>psychopaths)</b> {{do not appear to be}} mistaken about the facts bearing on their choices, but they do appear to lack understanding of the world in an important way. Working within an understanding of moral responsibility as consisting in responsiveness to reasons, I argue that <b>psychopaths</b> lack responsiveness to certain kinds of reasons and are therefore not morally responsible for failing to act on reasons of these kinds. Based on a review of the empirical evidence, I conclude that <b>psychopaths</b> experience deficiencies of emotional engagement and of empathy, which are the result of events that are not under their control. I argue that these deficiencies lead ‘hardcore’ <b>psychopaths</b> (those at the high end of the scale for the deficiencies in question) to fail to develop the capacity to recognise entities other than themselves as sources of value, and thus to recognise that the rights, interests and concerns of others provide reasons which bear on their choices. These <b>psychopaths</b> are therefore not morally responsible for failing to act on such reasons. Nonetheless, I argue that these reasons apply to psychopaths’ choices in a way that they do not apply, for example, to the choices of non-human animals. Implications of these conclusions include 1) that some reactive attitudes, such as resentment or hurt feelings, are inappropriate when directed at <b>psychopaths,</b> and 2) that some justifications for punishment are unavailable in the case of <b>psychopaths...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether employee perceptions of {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) {{were associated with the}} presence of Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> in corporations. The article states that, as <b>psychopaths</b> are 1 % of the population, it is logical to assume that every large corporation has <b>psychopaths</b> working within it. To differentiate these people from the common perception of <b>psychopaths</b> as being criminals, they have been called ‘‘Corporate Psychopaths’’ in this research. The article presents quantitative empirical research into the influence of Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> on four perceptual measures of CSR and three further measures of organizational commitment to employees. The article explains who Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> are and delineates the measures of CSR and organizational commitment to employees that were used. It then outlines the research conducted among 346 corporate employees in Australia in 2008. The reliability of the instrument used is commented on favorably in terms of its statistical reliability and its face and external validity. Results of the research are described showing the highly significant and negative influence of Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> on all of the measures of CSR and of organizational commitment to employees used in the research. When Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> are present in leadership positions within organizations, employees are less likely to agree with views that: the organization does business in a socially desirable manner; does business in an environmentally friendly manner and that the organization does business in a way that benefits the local community. Also, when Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> are present in leadership positions within organizations, employees are significantly less likely to agree that the corporation does business in a way that shows commitment to employees, significantly less likely to feel that they receive due recognition for doing a good job, to feel that their work was appreciated and to feel that their efforts were properly rewarded. The article argues that academics and researchers in the area of CSR cannot ignore the influence of individual managers. This is particularly the case when those managers have dysfunctional personalities, or are actually <b>psychopaths.</b> The article further argues that the existence of Corporate <b>Psychopaths</b> should be of interest to those involved in corporate management and corporate governance because their presence influences the way corporations are run and how corporations affect society and the environment...|$|R

Physiological measures assessed cardiovascular, respiratory, electrodermal, electromyographic responding, as well as skin temperature. Subjective measures assessed bodily sensations and subjective emotional appraisal. The principal physiological difference was a lower blood pressure among <b>psychopaths</b> before and during emotional stimulation. Thus, while psychopaths's autonomic base-line may be generally hyporeactive, they do not seem to have any emotion-specific physiological deficit. Globally, the results suggested no specific psychophysiological deficits among <b>psychopaths</b> in a context using daily emotions.
