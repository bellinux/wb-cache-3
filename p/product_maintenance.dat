50|$|According to {{the overall}} ASD scope, the {{specification}} S4000P must cover all types of products including any complex technical platform, system, equipment or facility (e.g. on air/sea/land, under the sea-/ground-level, in space).The S4000P analysis methodologies allow a structured, traceable and complete determination of PMTR with intervals for a product, which become the basis to elaborate and document a <b>product</b> <b>maintenance</b> program/Operators' Maintenance Program (OMP) prior to starting the product in-service phase.|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{specification}} is to assist all parties, including regulatory authorities, involved in the analysis process developing and releasing initial PMTR and intervals for new products prior entry into service.

5000|$|In {{software}} engineering and hardware engineering, serviceability (also known as supportability,) {{is one of}} the -ilities or aspects (from IBM's RAS(U) (Reliability, Availability, Serviceability, and Usability)). It refers to the ability of technical support personnel to install, configure, and monitor computer products, identify exceptions or faults, debug or isolate faults to root cause analysis, and provide hardware or software maintenance in pursuit of solving a problem and restoring the product into service. Incorporating serviceability facilitating features typically results in more efficient <b>product</b> <b>maintenance</b> and reduces operational costs and maintains business continuity.|$|E
50|$|Scrumban is a {{software}} production model based on Scrum and Kanban. Scrumban is especially suited for <b>product</b> <b>maintenance</b> with frequent and unexpected work items, such as production defects or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the work stages and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's workflow is directed {{in a way that}} allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, {{and on the other hand}} ensures each team member is constantly employed.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary <b>product</b> <b>maintenance</b> (including {{preventive}} services, {{repairs and}} upgrading) {{is becoming increasingly}} complex as products become more versatile and inherently complicated and {{as the number of}} available model variants multiplies. Consequently, maintenance is becoming a bottleneck in many engineering systems. This paper discusses a new online <b>product</b> <b>maintenance</b> approach based on augmented reality. According to this approach, graphical maintenance instruction and animation sequences are pre-coded (in VRML) at the design stage for typical procedures. These sequences are then transmitted upon request and virtually overlaid on the real product at the maintenance site, where and when they are needed. The instructions are conditional and adjust automatically to conditions at the maintenance site, according to input from the machine and updated knowledge at the manufacturer. This approach can alleviate much of the information overload and training required from maintenance personnel. Moreover, it can improve maintenance procedure efficiency by bringing updated expert knowledge to the field. This paper discusses the concept, function and components of the system and reports preliminary results of a nonimmersive implementation.
