5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E

500|$|The {{reasons for}} Hal's {{malfunction}} and subsequent malignant behavior have also elicited much discussion. He {{has been compared}} to Frankenstein's monster. In Clarke's novel, Hal malfunctions because of being ordered to lie to the crew of Discovery and withhold confidential information from them, despite being constructed for [...] "the accurate <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> without distortion or concealment". Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that Hal, as the supposedly perfect computer, actually behaves in the most human fashion of all of the characters.|$|E
25|$|The spinal trigeminal nucleus {{contains}} a pain-temperature sensory {{map of the}} face and mouth. From the spinal trigeminal nucleus, secondary fibers cross the midline and ascend in the trigeminothalamic (quintothalamic) tract to the contralateral thalamus. Pain-temperature fibers are sent to multiple thalamic nuclei. The central <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> pain-temperature <b>information</b> differs from the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> touch-position <b>information.</b>|$|R
40|$|Â© 2014 The Authors. Face recognition, {{holistic}} <b>processing,</b> and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> configural and featural facial {{information are}} known to be influenced by face race, with better performance for own- than other-race faces. However, whether these various other-race effects (OREs) arise from the same underlying mechanisms or from different processes remains unclear. The present study addressed this question by measuring the OREs in a set of face recognition tasks, and testing whether these OREs are correlated with each other. Participants performed different tasks probing (1) face recognition, (2) holistic <b>processing,</b> (3) <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> configural <b>information,</b> and (4) <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> featural <b>information</b> for both own- and other-race faces. Their contact with other-race people was also assessed with a questionnaire. The results show significant OREs in tasks testing face memory and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> configural <b>information,</b> but not in tasks testing either holistic <b>processing</b> or <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> featural <b>information.</b> Importantly, there was no cross-task correlation between any of the measured OREs. Moreover, the level of other-race contact predicted only the OREs obtained in tasks testing face memory and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> configural <b>information.</b> These results indicate that these various cross-race differences originate from different aspects <b>of</b> face <b>processing,</b> in contrary to the view that the ORE in face recognition is due to cross-race differences in terms <b>of</b> holistic <b>processing.</b> Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Is <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> {{conceptual}} <b>information</b> as robust as <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> perceptual <b>information</b> {{early in}} development? Existing empirical {{evidence is insufficient}} to answer this question. To examine this issue, 3 - to 5 -year-old children were presented with a flexible categorization task, in which target items (e. g., an open red umbrella) shared category membership with one test item (e. g., a folded umbrella) and perceptual characteristics with another test item (e. g., a red mushroom). Participants were instructed to either categorize stimuli by the same dimension (i. e., perceptual similarity or category membership) in both phases of the task, or switch from categorizing by one dimension to categorizing by the other dimension. Results pointed to a strong asymmetry in switch costs: conceptual switch costs were higher than perceptual switch costs. These results suggest that <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> perceptual <b>information</b> remains more robust than <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> conceptual <b>information</b> at least until 5 years of age...|$|R
