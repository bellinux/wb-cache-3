2500|$|The drastic remedy of {{liquidation}} was mitigated significantly as the unfair prejudice {{action was}} introduced by the Companies Act 1985. Now under the Companies Act 2006 section 996, a court can grant any remedy, but will often simply require that a minority shareholder's interest is bought out by the majority at a fair value. The cause of action, stated in section 994, is very broad. A shareholder must simply allege they have been prejudiced (i.e. their interests as a member have been harmed) {{in a way that}} is unfair. [...] "Unfairness" [...] is now given a minimum meaning identical to that in Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd. A court must at least have an [...] "equitable consideration" [...] to grant a remedy. Generally this will refer to an agreement between two or more corporators in a small business that is just short of being an enforceable contract, for the lack of legal consideration. A clear assurance, on which a corporator relies, which would be inequitable to go back on, would suffice, unlike the facts of the leading case, O'Neill v Phillips. Here Mr O'Neill had been a prodigy in Mr Phillips' asbestos stripping business, and took on a greater and greater role until economic difficulties struck. Mr O'Neill was then demoted, but claimed that he should be given 50 per cent of the company's shares because negotiations had started for this to happen and Mr Phillips had said one day it might. Lord Hoffmann held that the vague aspiration that it [...] "might" [...] was not enough here: there was no concrete assurance or promise given, and so no unfairness in Mr Phillips' recanting. Unfair prejudice in this sense is an action not well suited to public companies, when the alleged obligations binding the company were potentially undisclosed to public investors in the constitution, since this would undermine the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency.</b> However it is plain that minority shareholders can also bring claims for more serious breaches of obligation, such as breach of directors' duties. Unfair prejudice petitions remain most prevalent in small companies, and are the most numerous form of dispute to enter company courts. But if to hold directors accountable dispersed shareholders do not engage through voting, or through litigation, companies may be ripe for takeover.|$|E

40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{transparency}}</b> in EU law’ explores {{a variety}} of transparency obligations in European law, and offers a comprehensive framework to classify and understand those obligations. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is ubiquitous and multifaceted. The obligations derived from it range from a duty to allow access to documents held by the EU-institutions to a prohibition to change {{the terms of a}} contract concluded after a procurement procedure. But although transparency is a diffuse concept, it has a distinct core: the concept refers to the availability, accessibility and clarity of information. However, the concept of transparency does not in itself determine the target and the timing of transparency obligations, nor does it tell us much about the acceptability of exceptions, and whether information should be provided pro-actively or on request. The author provides a method to determine the exact nature of the transparency obligations that can be derived from the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> in concrete situations. She explains how the application of the EU <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is affected by the manner in which transparency contributes to the realisation of {{a variety of}} goals, the context in which it is applied, and the presence of conflicting interests. The key to understanding the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is appreciating its instrumental value. By being transparent, governments can promote democracy and individual rights, and improve economic performance. These goals are realised by means of two related but distinct mechanisms. First, transparency aids people in decision-making. Second, it allows them to see what is going on inside government. As such it is a precondition for any attempt to affect what is going on inside that government. Understanding how transparency functions is insufficient though: whether there is an obligation to be transparent is determined by the normative framework that governs the relation between the government and its citizens. This framework differs depending on whether this relation is perceived as one involving the citoyen, homo economicus, or homo dignus. For the citoyen, the overarching principle governing its relation with the government is democracy. For homo economicus, it is the promotion of the internal market and the Treaty freedoms. For homo dignus, it is the respect for human rights. The contents of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> are determined by these higher-order principles. Because of that, we can only derive those particular transparency obligations from it that do in fact contribute to the realisation of the state that is embodied in those higher order principles. Because transparency always functions in the same two distinct ways to bring about its positive effects – it facilitates decision-making and allows outsiders to see what public authorities are doing – our understanding of {{the manner in which it}} functions provides us with a way to determine what concrete transparency obligations we can derive from the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency,</b> provided we know what effects the law requires us to achieve by its observance...|$|E

40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is {{something}} of an oddity in EU law. Indeed, some doubt that there is one general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency.</b> The importance of transparency within the EU can be established beyond a doubt, and it is prevalent in numerous fields of EU law, but the obligations that are derived therefrom vary wildly. This makes it hard to get a good grasp of what the principle requires. It is possible to bring some system into this chaos, though. The author identifies two mechanisms by which transparency brings about the many positive consequences that have been attributed to it and combines them with the normative frameworks that guide the relation between public authorities and EU citizens into six categories of transparency obligations. Each of these categories has a distinct goal, and suggests a different answer to the questions one is faced with when confronted with a demand to be ‘transparent. ...|$|E
40|$|Contrary to a deep-rooted belief, it {{is argued}} in this article that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> as {{promoted}} at the European level needs to be extended beyond merely the right of access to documents. Considered as a precondition for effective accountability, transparency, of which access to documents is only one component, substantiates the right of information and represents {{an essential element of}} any democratic political system. A broader definition is therefore proposed and appropriate standards are generated to assess whether the EU institutions engaged in law-making are actually transparent. Empirical evidence shows that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is inconsistently respected by the EU legislator. Whilst the Commission meets the expected levels of compliance, practice in the Council turns out to be increasingly but not yet sufficiently satisfactory. Surprisingly, arrangements in the Parliament, given the restrictions on access to its activities, the 'misleading' public status of its sittings and the opacity of its voting system, prove inadequate.
