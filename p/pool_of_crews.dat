2500|$|When {{planning}} {{indicated that}} the B-25 was the aircraft best meeting all specifications of the mission, two were loaded aboard the aircraft carrier [...] at Norfolk, Virginia, and subsequently flown off the deck without difficulty on 3 February 1942. The raid was immediately approved and the 17th Bomb Group (Medium) was chosen to provide the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>crews</b> from which volunteers would be recruited. The 17th BG {{had been the first}} group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in the spring of 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. Eighth Air Force.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leadership}} roles themselves change each year {{as they are}} given, or [...] "passed down", to younger students. [...] The process for determining who gets the responsibility of these roles changes from pot to pot, but ultimately, the candidates are voted on according to who best represents the desired qualities. In the cases <b>of</b> <b>crew</b> chiefs and Yellowpots, the vote is decided within the dorm by the leaders for that year, and candidates are usually chosen from the freshman of that dorm. For the higher positions, such as the Redpots, the candidates are chosen from the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>Crew</b> Chiefs, Yellows, and {{any member of the}} applicable year. The Greenpots are the only non-dorm-specific pots that do not use crew chiefs or Yellowpots as candidates.|$|R

50|$|Special warfare combat medics are {{the primary}} or lead combat medics in a SWCC detachment. Previously, SEAL corpsmen served as the lead medics in larger SWCC {{detachments}} and managed shoreside clinics at special boat teams, managing sick call, training all SWCCs as medic assistants, and rendering emergency medical care to both SWCCs and SEALs while deployed in the field. These SEALs contributed greatly to the special boat teams and the professional development of their SWCC combat medic counterparts. While readiness is still achieved by <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>crew</b> skills through medic assistant quals, SWCCs are now taking on lead medic roles within their community capitalizing on {{the benefit of a}} stable maritime platform, additional medical equipment, and the ability to provide longer-term stabilization of casualties on board their craft.|$|R

50|$|On 25 May 1950, the {{squadron}} took delivery {{of its first}} English Electric Canberra B2 thereby becoming the RAF’s first jet bomber unit. Without a training unit in existence, conversion to type was achieved by {{the squadron}} itself with assistance from English Electric test pilots. Most of the type’s service trials were flown by the squadron and, {{by the end of}} 1950, nine Canberra B2s were held on strength. Out <b>of</b> the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> type-qualified <b>crews,</b> a wing <b>of</b> five squadrons had been formed by August 1952 at Binbrook, comprising Nos. 9, 12, 50, 101 and 617.|$|R
5000|$|Kurosawa's {{aesthetic}} {{visual sense}} meant that {{his attention to}} cinematography and filming was also demanding and often went beyond the attention which directors would normally expect to use with their cameramen. His reputation as an editor of his own films was consistent throughout his lifetime in his insisting on close participation with any other editors involved in the editing of his films. Throughout his career, Kurosawa worked constantly with people drawn from the same <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> creative technicians, <b>crew</b> members and actors, popularly known as the [...] "Kurosawa-gumi" [...] (Kurosawa group).|$|R
40|$|A {{study which}} uses Hackman's Normative Model (1986) for group {{effectiveness}} {{to see if}} there are any differences between the behaviors of effective and less effective captains at building and maintaining their crews is presented. Captains were selected using crew evaluations, creating a final <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> six effective <b>crew</b> managers and four captains less proficient as crew leaders. Data collection began at crew briefings, and continued through two trips, with intense data gathering during critical incidents for both task and process events.

It is concluded that effective captains expand the set of interactions, decreasing the limitations on how the group will work together...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of psychosocial and {{psychiatric}} issues that may affect crew members during an expeditionary mission to Mars. In terms of selection, only a subset of all astronaut candidates will be willing to be away from family and friends for the two- to three-year mission, so the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>crew</b> members will be restricted and possibly skewed psychologically in ways that cannot be foreseen. Little is known about the physical and psychological effect of long-duration microgravity and the high radiation that occurs in deep space. In addition, on Mars the crew members will be subjected to a gravity field that is only 38 percent of Earth gravity, and the effect of this situation on their physical and emotional well-being is unknown. Given the long distances involved, the crew must function autonomously and develop their own work schedules and solve operational emergencies themselves. They must also {{be able to deal with}} medical and psychiatric emergencies, such as physical trauma due to accidents as well as suicidal or psychotic thinking due to stress and depression. Basic life support and staples such as water and fuel will need to be provided from resources on Mars and its atmosphere. There will be a great deal of leisure time (especially during the outbound and return phases of the mission), and occupying it meaningfully and flexibly may be a challenge.|$|R
500|$|From the beginning, Kurosawa {{displayed}} a bold, dynamic style, {{strongly influenced by}} Western cinema yet quite distinct from it. Kurosawa was extensively involved with every aspect of film production. He was also a gifted screenwriter, and would usually work in close collaboration with his co-writers {{from the beginning of}} the development of a film to ensure a high-quality script, which he insisted was the absolute foundation of a good film. He frequently served as editor of his own films and was regarded by his production team as [...] "the greatest editor in the world." [...] Though it was common in the Japanese film industry of that time for established directors to assemble around them a team, or [...] "gumi," [...] with people drawn from the same <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> creative technicians, <b>crew</b> members and actors working from film to film (for example, the director Hiroshi Inagaki, who worked at Toho during the same period as Kurosawa, had such a team), Kurosawa's team, known as the [...] "Kurosawa-gumi" [...] (Kurosawa group)—including, for example, the cinematographer Asakazu Nakai, the production assistant Teruyo Nogami and the actor Takashi Shimura—was remarkable for its loyalty to the director and the consistent quality of its work.|$|R
5000|$|The BBC {{claimed a}} number of TV firsts {{achieved}} by the production team. Many of the filming techniques first used on Planet Earth, such as the gyroscopically-stabilised helicopter camera known as the Heligimbal, were adopted again, along with new technology. In [...] "The Great Tide", some of the surface-water footage was shot from a boat-mounted stabilised camera, previously used in the Hollywood film industry. Innovations on [...] "The Great Flood" [...] included FrankenCam, a motion-control macro camera developed by Ammonite Films and capable of shooting extreme close-ups of tiny subjects. The team were also the first to film narwhals from {{the air and the}} first to reveal how grizzly bears use their feet to scoop up dead salmon from deep <b>pools.</b> The <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> [...] "The Great Migration" [...] had the good fortune of witnessing the first eruption of a Tanzanian volcano in 40 years, and managed to shoot aerial footage of the event.|$|R
