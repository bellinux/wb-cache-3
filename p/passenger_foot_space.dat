40|$|Status: To date seats (in {{particular}} air plane seats) {{are characterized}} by poor sitting comfort (hardness, submarining, shear stress in the skin in recline position), build-up of heat and humidity, no adaptation to body size (edge pressure for small <b>passengers,</b> no <b>foot</b> <b>space</b> for tall <b>passengers,</b> hardly any provision for children), poor access to luggage. Goal of the project: The project is aimed at improving sitting comfort by constructions which are significantly different. Methods: Biomechanical methods are used which means that starting point of the work are {{the requirements of the}} passenger; from their construction and design is derived, not vice versa. Results: Seat I features the following innovatives: () Foam is replaced by a special fabric which is used as hammock. The seat provides just {{a small fraction of the}} standard weight, heat resistance and humidity resistance, this is combined with the standard sitting comfort. (b) The firmness of the hammock is varied on seat and back rest according to the biomechanical requirements. (c) The sitting surface is declined up to 25, pivoting around the knee joint of the passenger avoiding pinching of the hollow of the knee this way. (d) The length of the sitting surface is reduced for children up to 25 cm. (e) This allows for high decline of the back rest even in low pitch settings. (f) The sitting surface can be tilted up. (g) The seat can be folded for storage. (h) 3 degrees of freedom are controlled by just one lever. Seat II: (a) The sitting surface is raised by 10 cm compared to normal for providing enough leg room for tall passengers and for providing storage under the seat. (b) Two segment foot rests for normal sized passengers and children. Fields of application: Seats for air planes, cars, home, garden. (orig.)
