50|$|<b>Pilsicainide</b> {{is a drug}} used {{clinically}} in Japan {{to treat}} cardiac arrhythmias. It functions by blocking the fast inward movement of sodium ions through the Nav1.5 sodium channel {{that contributes to the}} rapid depolarization characteristic of phase 0 in the cardiac action potential. <b>Pilsicainide</b> is a pure sodium channel blocker, meaning it does not significantly affect any other cardiac channels including potassium and calcium channels. <b>Pilsicainide</b> binds to a common site on the sodium channel through either intracellular or extracellular application(3). The affinity of <b>pilsicainide</b> for the sodium channel receptor and its rate of binding are dependent {{on the state of the}} channel. It has been proven to have a greater affinity for the receptor in its inactivated state as opposed to resting or open(4), thereby following the modulated receptor hypothesis(5). Binding of <b>pilsicainide</b> selectively inhibits the channel(6), preventing the movement of sodium ions into the cardiac cell. This decreases the rate of depolarization of the cell membrane as well as the action potential amplitude, but has no effect on the overall duration of the action potential(6). Suppression of the depolarization rate is use-dependent(7), and therefore inhibition increases with increased stimulation. <b>Pilsicainide</b> also causes delayed impulse conduction through the myocardium in a dose-dependent manner(8). The effects of <b>pilsicainide</b> have a slow rate of onset and offset resulting in a prolonged recovery time(9). This contributes to its potent blocking activity and its classification as a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent(10).A cardiac arrhythmia includes any abnormal heartbeat and can be manifested as tachycardia, bradycardia, or other irregular rhythms. <b>Pilsicainide</b> has been proven successful in treating both ventricular(11) and supraventricular arrhythmias with few adverse effects(12). It is especially effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia(14). It may result from various heart abnormalities or may occur spontaneously in a seemingly healthy individual(15). Atrial fibrillation is characterized by rapid, disorganized electrical impulses in the atria resulting in depolarization of only a small group of myocardial cells. This prevents the atria from undergoing coordinated contraction, instead resulting in small fibrillations of the heart muscle. Re-entry occurs when an impulse does not die after activating the heart but instead returns to the atria and causes re-excitation(16). Simultaneous re-entry of multiple impulses with short wavelengths results in atrial fibrillation(17). Impulse wavelength is the product of the conduction velocity and the effective refractory period. <b>Pilsicainide</b> suppresses atrial conduction velocity but also increases the effective refractory period(18). Its effects on the refractory period are significantly more substantial, and therefore <b>pilsicainide</b> treatment results in an increased wavelength and termination of atrial fibrillation. A single oral dose of <b>pilsicainide</b> effectively restores normal sinus rhythm in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation and a healthy left ventricle. Long-term therapy with <b>pilsicainide</b> is successful in treating chronic atrial fibrillation).|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Pilsicainide,</b> {{classified}} as a relatively selective Na+ channel blocker, also has an inhibitory action on the rapidly-activating delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKr) through human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels. We studied the effects of chronic exposure to <b>pilsicainide</b> on the expression of wild-type (WT) hERG proteins and WT-hERG channel currents, {{as well as on}} the expression of mutant hERG proteins, in a heterologous expression system. Methods: HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT or mutant hERG proteins were subjected to Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy and patch-clamp experiments. Results: Acute exposure to <b>pilsicainide</b> at 0. 03 – 10  μM influenced neither the expression of WT-hERG proteins nor WT-hERG channel currents. Chronic treatment with 0. 03 – 10  μM <b>pilsicainide</b> for 48  h, however, increased the expression of WT-hERG proteins and channel currents in a concentration-dependent manner. Chronic treatment with 3  μM <b>pilsicainide</b> for 48  h delayed degradation of WT-hERG proteins and increased the channels expressed on the plasma membrane. A cell membrane-impermeant <b>pilsicainide</b> derivative did not influence the expression of WT-hERG, indicating that <b>pilsicainide</b> stabilized the protein inside the cell. <b>Pilsicainide</b> did not influence phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B) or expression of heat shock protein families such as HSF- 1, hsp 70 and hsp 90. E 4031, a chemical chaperone for hERG, abolished the <b>pilsicainide</b> effect on hERG. Chronic treatment with <b>pilsicainide</b> could also increase the protein expression of trafficking-defective mutant hERG, G 601 S and R 752 W. Conclusions: <b>Pilsicainide</b> penetrates the plasma membrane, stabilizes WT-hERG proteins by acting as a chemical chaperone, and enhances WT-hERG channel currents. This mechanism could also be applicable to modulations of certain mutant-hERG proteins...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Pilsicainide,</b> a pure Na+ channel blocker, is {{a popular}} {{antiarrhythmic}} drug {{for the management of}} atrial tachyarrhythmias (AT), in Japan. However, serious drug-induced proarrhythmias (DIPs) may unexpectedly occur. We assessed the clinical background of AT patients presenting with DIPs caused by <b>pilsicainide.</b> Methods: This study retrospectively enrolled 874 consecutive patients (543 men, 63. 6 ± 15. 3 years old, and 57. 9 ± 16. 5  kg of body weight), who were orally administered <b>pilsicainide</b> for AT management. We evaluated the relationship between DIPs and serum <b>pilsicainide</b> concentration, renal dysfunction (estimate glomerular filtration rate, eGFR), and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. Results: Among the patients, 154 (17. 6 %) had renal dysfunction (eGFR< 50  mL/min), including 12 (1. 4 %) on hemodialysis. DIPs were present in 10 patients (1. 1 %) : all had renal dysfunction, and one was on hemodialysis. The eGFR in DIP patients was significantly lower than that in the non-DIP patients (32. 2 ± 15. 1 vs. 68. 4 ± 22. 1  mL/min, p< 0. 001). Among the clinical factors measured, only renal dysfunction (eGFR< 50  mL/min) was significantly associated with DIPs (OR 44. 6; 95 % CI 5. 61 – 335. 0, p< 0. 001). Interestingly, among the ECG parameters, the corrected QT (QTc) intervals in DIP patients were longer than those in non-DIP patients (555. 8 ± 37. 6 vs. 430. 7 ± 32. 6  ms, p< 0. 001).

40|$|Background and purpose: <b>Pilsicainide,</b> an {{anti-arrhythmic}} drug used in Japan, {{is described}} as a pure sodium channel blocker. We examined the mechanisms by which it is able to block open channels, because these properties may be especially useful to reduce hyperexcitability in pathologies characterized by abnormal sodium channel opening. Experimental approach: The effects of <b>pilsicainide</b> on various heterologously expressed human sodium channel subtypes and mutants were investigated using the patch clamp technique. Key results: <b>Pilsicainide</b> exhibited tonic and use-dependent effects comparable to those of mexiletine and flecainide on hNav 1. 4 channels. These use-dependent effects were abolished in the mutations F 1586 C and Y 1593 C within segment 6 of domain IV, suggesting that the interaction of <b>pilsicainide</b> with these residues is critical for its local anaesthetic action. Its affinity constants for closed channels (KR) and channels inactivated from the closed state (KI) were high, suggesting that its use-dependent block (UDB) requires the channel to be open for it to reach a high-affinity blocking site. Accordingly, basic pH, which slightly increased the proportion of neutral drug, dramatically decreased KR and KI values. Effects of <b>pilsicainide</b> were similar on skeletal muscle hNav 1. 4, brain hNav 1. 1 and heart hNav 1. 5 channels. The myotonic R 1448 C and G 1306 E hNav 1. 4 mutants were more and less sensitive to <b>pilsicainide,</b> respectively, due to mutation-induced gating modifications. Conclusions and implications: Although therapeutic concentrations of <b>pilsicainide</b> may have little effect on resting and closed-state inactivated channels, it induces a strong UDB due to channel opening, rendering the drug ideally suited for inhibition of high-frequency action potential firing...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{examined}} the relationship between repolarization abnormality and coved-type ST-segment elevation with terminal inverted T-wave (type 1 electrocardiogram [ECG]) in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS). BackgroundRecent experimental studies have suggested that accentuation of the right ventricular action potential (AP) notch preferentially prolongs epicardial AP causing inversion of the T-wave. MethodsIn 19 patients with BrS and 3 control subjects, activation-recovery intervals (ARIs) and repolarization times (RTs) in the epicardium and endocardium were directly examined with the use of local unipolar electrograms at the right ventricular outflow tract. Surface ECG, ARI, and RT were examined before and after administration of <b>pilsicainide.</b> ResultsType 1 ECG was observed in 10 of the 19 BrS patients before the administration of <b>pilsicainide</b> and in all of the 19 patients after the administration of <b>pilsicainide.</b> We found that ARI and RT in the epicardium were shorter than those in the endocardium in all 9 BrS patients without type 1 ECG under baseline conditions and in all control subjects regardless of <b>pilsicainide</b> administration. However, longer epicardial ARI than endocardial ARI was observed in 8 of the 10 BrS patients manifesting type 1 ECG under baseline conditions and in all of the BrS patients after the administration of <b>pilsicainide.</b> Also, epicardial RT was longer than endocardial RT in all patients manifesting type 1 ECG regardless of <b>pilsicainide</b> administration. ConclusionsOur data provide support for the hypothesis that the negative T-wave associated with type 1 BrS ECG is due to a preferential prolongation of the epicardial AP secondary to accentuation of the AP notch in the region of the right ventricular outflow tract...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{therapeutic}} {{goals of}} atrial fibrillation (AF) patients are to reduce symptoms and prevent severe complications associated with AF. This study compared {{the efficacy of}} flecainide versus <b>pilsicainide</b> in reducing the frequency of AF and improving quality of life (QOL) in symptomatic paroxysmal AF patients without structural heart disease. Methods: The Atrial Fibrillation and Quality Of Life (AF-QOL) study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label crossover study that compared flecainide and <b>pilsicainide</b> as antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Patients were randomized to receive 3 months of treatment with flecainide twice daily or <b>pilsicainide</b> 3 times daily. Each treatment consisted of a dose-finding phase (weeks 1 – 4) and an efficacy phase (weeks 5 – 12). Forty-three patients completed the trial. The main outcome {{was the number of}} days with documented AF episodes using a patient-operated electrocardiogram. QOL questionnaires (SF- 36 and AF-specific QOL scores) were also completed. Results: The median (range) AF frequencies (days/ 8 weeks) were 2 (0 – 50) in the flecainide treatment group and 1 (0 – 54) in the <b>pilsicainide</b> treatment group (no significant between-group difference).

40|$|Background: Ablation {{of complex}} {{fractionated}} atrial electrograms (CFAE) is now performed {{in patients with}} persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). However, extensive ablation is often necessary to eliminate all CFAE or to terminate AF. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) on CFAE. Methods and Results: Sixty patients, including 38 with longstanding persistent AF and 22 with persistent AF, underwent box isolation. After box isolation, CFAE maps were created before and after infusion of a pure Na+ blocker, <b>pilsicainide</b> (1 mg/kg), in 30 patients or a pure IKr blocker, nifekalant (0. 3 mg/kg), in 30 patients. Nifekalant had a greater effect on AF termination than <b>pilsicainide</b> (33. 3 % versus 6. 7 %, P = 0. 01). Both AADs similarly reduced CFAE. Ablation of CFAE localized by nifekalant and <b>pilsicainide</b> terminated AF in 26. 7 % and 20 % of the patients, respectively. After a single ablation procedure, patients in whom AF was terminated by CFAE ablation had a lower recurrence rate than those in whom AF was not terminated despite CFAE ablation (19. 2 % vers us 35. 3 %, P = 0. 04).

40|$|Modification of spiral wave (SW) reentry by {{antiarrhythmic}} {{drugs is}} a central issue to be challenged for better understanding of their benefits and risks. We investigated the effects of <b>pilsicainide</b> and/or verapamil, which block sodium and L-type calcium currents (I(Na) and I(Ca,L)), respectively, on SW reentry. A two-dimensional epicardial ventricular muscle layer was created in rabbit hearts by cryoablation (n = 32), and action potential signals were analyzed by high-resolution optical mapping. During constant stimulation, <b>pilsicainide</b> (3 - 5 microM) caused a frequency-dependent decrease of conduction velocity (CV; by 20 %- 54 % at 5 Hz) without affecting action potential duration (APD). Verapamil (3 microM) caused APD shortening (by 16 % at 5 Hz) without affecting CV. Ventricular tachycardias (VTs) that were induced were more sustained {{in the presence of}} either <b>pilsicainide</b> or verapamil. The incidence of sustained VTs (> 30 s) /all VTs per heart was 58 % +/- 9 % for 5 microM <b>pilsicainide</b> vs. 22 % +/- 9 % for controls and 62 % +/- 10 % for 3 microM verapamil vs. 22 % +/- 8 % for controls. The SWs with <b>pilsicainide</b> were characterized by slower rotation around longer functional block lines (FBLs), whereas those with verapamil were characterized by faster rotation around shorter FBLs. Combined application of 3 microM <b>pilsicainide</b> and 3 microM verapamil resulted in early termination of VTs (sustained VTs/all VTs per heart: 2 % +/- 2 % vs. 29 % +/- 9 % for controls); SWs showed extensive drift and decremental conduction, leading to their spontaneous annihilation. Blockade of either I(Na) or I(Ca,L) stabilizes SWs in a two-dimensional epicardial layer of rabbit ventricular myocardium to help their persistence, whereas blockade of both currents destabilizes SWs to facilitate their terminatio...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} <b>pilsicainide,</b> a pure Na+ channel blocker, and nifekalant, a pure rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) blocker, on the electrophysiological characteristics within the pulmonary vein (PV) and at the PV-left atrial (LA) junction. Methods and Results: We used a basket catheter for PV mapping in 38 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Programmed stimulation was performed in the distal PV and PV-LA junction {{before and after the}} infusion of <b>pilsicainide</b> (1 mg/kg; n = 24) or nifekalant (0. 3 mg/kg; n = 14). Both drugs significantly prolonged the effective refractory period (ERP) of the distal PV and PV-LA junction. <b>Pilsicainide</b> significantly decreased the ERP heterogeneity of the PV and PV-LA junction (36 ± 43 vs. 9 ± 60 ms, P < 0 : 05). In contrast, nifekalant significantly increased the ERP heterogeneity of the PV and PV-LA junction (from 38 ± 34 to 60 ± 46 ms, P < 0 : 01). <b>Pilsicainide</b> significantly prolonged the conduction time (S 1 -A 1) from the distal PV to the PV-LA junction (from 42 ± 12 to 63 ± 26 ms, P < 0 : 001), whereas this did not change with nifekalant. Conclusions: In AF patients, <b>pilsicainide</b> has antiarrhythmic effects mainly on the distal PV by modifying the ERP and conduction properties.

40|$|We {{pharmacologically}} characterized microminipigs as an in vivo experimental {{model by}} assessing cardiovascular effects of <b>pilsicainide,</b> verapamil and E- 4031, which can preferentially inhibit cardiac Na+, Ca 2 + and K+ channels, respectively. Intravenous infusion of 1  mg/kg of <b>pilsicainide</b> (n =  4), 0. 1  mg/kg of verapamil (n =  4) and 0. 01 followed by 0. 1  mg/kg of E- 4031 (n =  5) over 10  min decreased the heart rate, {{mean blood pressure}} and ventricular contractility. Moreover, <b>pilsicainide</b> prolonged the PR interval, QRS width and QTc; verapamil prolonged the PR interval, but shortened the QRS width and QTc; and E- 4031 prolonged the QTc, whereas no substantial change was detected in the PR interval or QRS width. Peak plasma concentrations of <b>pilsicainide,</b> verapamil and E- 4031 in microminipigs were 1. 7 – 4. 8 times higher than those expected in humans and dogs, possibly due to smaller effective volume of drug distribution.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} our study was to {{determine}} what variables were associated with ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced during electrophysiological stimulation test in patients without apparent organic heart disease. MethodsOur study evaluated 77 patients (51 ± 15 years) who underwent electrophysiological stimulation test, signal averaging, and Na+ channel-blocker challenge test (<b>pilsicainide</b> test). The subjects were divided into two groups, the Brugada group and non-Brugada group. Further, the patients were divided into three subgroups on the base of symptoms (8, 7 symptomatic; 9, 13 syncope; 28, 12 asymptomatic group; in the Brugada and non-Brugada groups, respectively). Multivariate analyses evaluated the association between baseline clinical factors and the induction of VF. ResultsThe inducibility of VF was significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher in the Brugada group (n= 33, 73 %) than the non-Brugada group (n= 4, 13 %). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 31. 6; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 3 – 430. 6; p< 0. 01), type 1 electrocardiogram after <b>pilsicainide</b> test (OR 21. 3; CI: 1. 7 – 272. 2; p< 0. 02), and syncope (OR 13. 5; CI: 1. 2 – 158. 8; p< 0. 05) were strongly associated with the inducibility of VF, but not with family history, type 1 electrocardiogram in control, positive in late potential, maxΔST elevation (≧ 200 μV) after <b>pilsicainide</b> test.

The tonic block in the presence of <b>pilsicainide</b> was similar in WT and p. V 1328 M, when sodium currents were induced by a low frequency pulse protocol (q 15 s). On the contrary, p. V 1328 M mutation enhanced <b>pilsicainide</b> induced use-dependent block at 2 Hz. (Ki: WT, 35. 8 μM; V 1328 M, 19. 3 μM). Conclusion: Our study suggests that a subclinical SCN 5 A mutation, p.

40|$|Electrocardiographic {{changes were}} {{evaluated}} retrospectively in five patients without previous episodes of syncope or ventricular fibrillation who developed abnormal ST segment elevation mimicking the Brugada syndrome in leads V 1 -V 3 after {{the administration of}} class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs. <b>Pilsicainide</b> (four patients) or flecainide (one patient) were administered orally {{for the treatment of}} symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or premature atrial contractions. The QRS duration, QTc, and JT intervals on 12  lead surface ECG before administration of these drugs were all within normal range. After administration of the drugs, coved-type ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads was observed with mild QRS prolongation, but there were no apparent changes in JT intervals. No serious arrhythmias were observed during the follow up periods. Since ST segment elevation with mild QRS prolongation was observed with both <b>pilsicainide</b> and flecainide, strong sodium channel blocking effects in the depolarisation may have been the main factors responsible for the ECG changes. As the relation between ST segment elevation and the incidence of serious arrhythmias has not yet been sufficiently clarified, electrocardiographic changes should be closely monitored whenever class Ic drugs are given.    Keywords: class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs; Brugada syndrome; ST segment elevatio...|$|E

40|$|Background: Class IC {{antiarrhythmic}} drugs, used {{to prevent}} paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs), are well known to effectively unmask the electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern of Brugada syndrome. We used these drugs to investigate the prevalence and {{prognosis of patients with}} lone and paroxysmal ATs and Brugada-type ECGs. Methods and results: We enrolled 702 consecutive patients who were given class IC antiarrhythmic drugs (<b>pilsicainide</b> or propafenone) to inhibit paroxysmal ATs. We analyzed 12 -lead ECGs before and after drug administration using a computerized ECG system. A Brugada-type ECG was defined as a coved pattern of ST segment elevation (> 0. 2  mV) in leads V 1 −V 2. No patients had risk-stratifying factors of the syndrome. Forty-four patients (6. 3 %) had significant ST-segment elevation in leads V 1 −V 2 after drug administration. Among these patients, a coved ECG pattern was observed in 10 (1. 4 %). The use of <b>pilsicainide</b> (n= 9) was significantly (P= 0. 02) greater than that of propafenone (n= 1). During the follow-up period of 85 ± 19 months, none of the 10 patients had ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{administered}} <b>pilsicainide</b> chloride, a class Ic pure {{sodium channel}} blocker, {{to patients with}} Brugada syndrome (BS) and evaluated the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and T-wave alternans (TWA). BackgroundVentricular arrhythmia and TWA are sometimes induced by a sodium channel blocker challenge test in BS patients, but {{the significance of the}} induced VA and TWA is not known. MethodsPilsicainide was administered to 65 patients with BS (10 symptomatic and 55 asymptomatic patients), and the occurrence of VA, TWA, and change of electrocardiogram were evaluated. Electrophysiologic study was performed in 57 patients, and the induction of VA by programmed electrical stimulation (PES) was evaluated. ResultsVentricular arrhythmia was not induced by administration of <b>pilsicainide</b> in 55 patients (no-VA group). Administration of pilsicainide-induced VA in 10 patients (Pil-VA group) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in four patients. Pilsicainide-induced VA in 60 % of the symptomatic patients but in only 7 % of asymptomatic patients (p < 0. 01). ST level, QTc, and indexes of cardiac conduction in the Pil-VA group were not different from those in the no-VA group. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by PES in 67 % of the patients in the Pil-VA group and in 33 % of the patients in the no-VA group. In six cases, macroscopic TWA occurred in association with pilsicainide-induced VA, but TWA occurred in only one patient without pilsicainide-induced arrhythmia. ConclusionsAdministration of a sodium channel blocker results in induction of not only ST-elevation but also VA and TWA in patients with BS...|$|E
40|$|SummaryA healthy 25 -year-old man {{suffered}} from {{loss of consciousness}} due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Emergency services required multiple cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. Repeated electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings after admission showed non-type 1 Brugada ST-segment elevation in V 1 and V 2. Intravenous <b>pilsicainide</b> infusion augmented the ST-segment elevation but its morphology did not represent type- 1 ECG. Intravenous administration of isoproterenol normalized the ST-segment elevation, and programmed electrical stimulation induced VF.

40|$|Early Repolarization ” by Watanabe {{and colleagues}} 1 with great {{interest}} and congratulate the authors for their publication.

40|$|SummaryThe {{patient was}} a 74 -year-old woman with angina pectoris, who had {{undergone}} percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement in the right coronary artery on October 2, 2007. On November 12 of the same year, she suffered from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She was treated with <b>pilsicainide</b> hydrochloride administered by intravenous injection, which {{was followed by a}} sudden sinus standstill, with marked bradycardia and a shock state. The patient was then treated with a catecholamine, however, the shock state persisted for about an hour. An electrocardiogram revealed persistent ST depression in leads V 4 – 6 along with elevation of the serum creatinine kinase. A coronary angiography performed on the admission day revealed no abnormality. On the third hospital day, a dual-isotope myocardial SPECT using 201 Tl and 99 mTc-pyrophosphate demonstrated an annular accumulation of 99 mTc-pyrophosphate concordant with the endocardium from apex to the mid-portion of the left ventricle, suggestive of subendocardial infarction.

40|$|AbstractA 43 -year-old man {{presented}} with nausea. The patient developed ventricular fibrillation (VF), which was refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs and defibrillation. A coronary angiogram showed no coronary artery stenosis. We recorded various fatal arrhythmias, including bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT). The presence of multiple types of BVTs that were refractory to {{drugs such as}} adenosine triphosphate, isoproterenol, verapamil, propranolol, and <b>pilsicainide,</b> and easily recurred after defibrillation indicated aconite poisoning. After persisting for 24 h, VF spontaneously resolved and sinus rhythm was restored. Laboratory data revealed lethal concentrations of aconitine. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of aconite poisoning-induced BVTs manifesting with multiple morphologies on 12 -lead electrocardiogram. The arrhythmogenic effects of aconitine are well recognized. In addition to causing VT and VF, aconitine also can cause BVT. Aconitine can lead to delayed afterdepolarization which has an important role in triggering and maintaining BVT. However, in this case, the concentration of aconitine was high enough to render these drugs ineffective. Prompt application of percutaneous cardio-pulmonary support, which was continued until the aconitine was metabolized, proved successful in this case and should be considered as a management approach in cases of severe aconite poisoning...|$|E
