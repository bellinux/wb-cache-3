40|$|Abstract Background For {{low income}} and uninsured <b>populations,</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> clinics are an {{important}} source of health care, including preventive services such as mammography screening. However, little is known about how well breast health is coordinated within the <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> clinic environment and what barriers patients encounter. Methods A needs assessment was conducted among eight community-based <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> clinics located in Montgomery County, Maryland to learn about breast cancer referral and screening procedures. Structured in-depth interviews were conducted with clinic staff during the summer of 2008. Results <b>Safety</b> <b>net</b> clinics reported that they routinely identified women who need mammography screening and referred women to mammography screening facilities. However, clinics were not aware of the limited number of free or low cost mammography screening slots available in the county or the waiting time to receive mammography services. Overall, screening barriers were common in the <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> system and only a few procedures were in place to help women overcome these barriers. Conclusion <b>Safety</b> <b>net</b> clinics face multiple barriers in providing and coordinating breast cancer screening services for low income or uninsured patients. These barriers prevent the efficient allocation of mammography screening services and prevent underserved women from accessing an important preventive health service. </p...|$|R

As per America’s Health Care Safety Net: Intact But Endangered, <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> have two characteristics: they maintain an open-door policy for their services, and that most of the patients are uninsured or on Medicaid. Some <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> hospitals even offer high-cost services like burn, trauma, and neonatal treatments. Some also provide training for medical professionals.

40|$|An {{estimated}} 1. 5 {{million people}} living in the United States will experience homelessness each year. Nearly a quarter of these individuals will be children. Homelessness is a significant concern for public health because this population is associated with high levels of chronic illness and morbidity, substance abuse, mental illness, and frequent emergency department visits, which place an increased burden on the US health care system. Despite declines {{over the past several years}} in the incidence of homelessness, it still remains a relevant problem for public health, and its importance has been recognized by the current US administration in the implementation of Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness. This fight to end homelessness in the US cannot successfully be won without the provision of comprehensive programs and services designed to serve the homeless population and subsets of the <b>population.</b> Operation <b>Safety</b> <b>Net</b> in Pittsburgh serves as a model for success in this effort to effectively and efficiently prevent and end homelessness in the US once and for all...|$|R

40|$|Social <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> is {{a measure}} taken by the {{government}} in order to prevent the vulnerable section of its population to fall beyond a certain level of poverty. Social <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> programmes (SSNPs) are designed to provide support for the vulnerable section of the society. With a vision to prevent transmission of poverty from generation to generation, the <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> programmes opt for a more efficient society in terms of the choices made by individuals. The social <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> play both a redistributive and a productive role supporting moral philosophy as well as managing risks. These two are the major pillars that justify the existence of <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> programmes. It should be mentioned at the outset that the <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> programmes create a path towards poverty reduction in the long run. They do not reduce poverty directly, rather these programmes tend to reduce transitional poverty through ensuring proper nutritional intake, education, health care, etc. In other words, the <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> programmes are methods through which poverty is expected to fall through investment in human capital.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{illness is}} common in childhood, and it is {{difficult}} for healthcare professionals to distinguish seriously ill children from the vast majority with minor or self-limiting illnesses. <b>Safety</b> <b>netting</b> provides parents with advice on when and where to return if their child deteriorates, and it is widely recommended that parents of acutely sick young children should be given <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice. Yet little is known about how and when this is given. We aimed to understand what <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice first contact clinicians give parents of acutely sick young children, how, when, and why. METHODS: This was a qualitative study. Interviews and focus groups were held with doctors and nurses in a general practice surgery, a District General Hospital emergency department, a paediatric emergency department, and an out-of-hours service. Data were analysed using the method of constant comparison. RESULTS: Sixteen clinicians participated. They described that <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice includes advising parents what to look for, when and where to seek help. How <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> was delivered and whether it was verbal or written was inconsistent, and no participants described being trained in this area. <b>Safety</b> <b>netting</b> appeared to be rarely documented, and was left to individual preference. Limitations of written materials, and structural barriers to the provision of <b>safety</b> <b>netting,</b> were perceived. Participants described that <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> was influenced by clinicians' experience, confidence, time and knowledge; and perceived parental anxiety, experience, and competence. Participants noted several limitations to <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> including not knowing if it has been understood by parents or been effective; parental difficulty interpreting information and desire for face-to-face reassurance; and potential over-reassurance. CONCLUSION: First contact clinicians employ a range of <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> techniques, with inconsistencies within and between organisations. Structural changes, clinician training, and documentation in patient notes may improve <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> provision. Research is needed into the optimal components of <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice so that clinicians can consistently deliver the most effective advice for parents.

Formal and informal <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> are part of a holistic framework of poverty alleviation, to protect the poor and the vulnerable against the consequences of risks.

It presents a description of the methodology used for compiling the inventories and analyses by region, type of intervention involved, sector board, and instrument. The World Bank has engaged with 118 countries on <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> issues over the six years under review, providing lending in 68, analytic products in 86, training in 87, and a combined package of all three services in 42, demonstrating the increased sophistication and the important role of <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> in social policy. There is noticeable variability over time as the portfolio and analytic effort expand when large or multiple countries face economic crises. The regional distribution of <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> activities shows the dominance of Latin America. The analysis also shows the diversity within the portfolio, with respect to both the type of intervention supported and the range of sectors involved in <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> work. Finally, the report delineates the implications and outlook for the future. <b>Safety</b> <b>Nets</b> and Transfers,Banks&Banking Reform,,Labor Policies,Debt Markets...|$|R
