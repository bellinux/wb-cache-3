Using Manski (1993) linear-in-means model, this paper illustrates that the gender composition effect that is currently estimated in education function is the function of three parameters: social multiplier, gender differences in outcome and gender composition effect (known as a gender <b>peer</b> <b>effect).</b> The appropriate gender <b>peer</b> <b>effect</b> is identified after using Graham’s variance restriction method to identify and rule out a social multiplier effect.

50|$|A common {{approach}} in education evaluation {{research is to}} compare the learning gains of individual students in charter schools to their gains {{when they were in}} traditional public schools. Thus, in effect, each student acts as his/her own control {{to assess the impact of}} charter schools. A few selected examples of this work find that charter schools on average outperform the traditional public schools that supplied students, at least after the charter school had been in operation for a few years. A possible limitation of this type of study is that it does not automatically distinguish between possible benefits of how the school operates (e.g. school structure) and possible <b>peer</b> <b>effects,</b> that is, effects of students on each other. At the same time, there appears to be a wide variation in the effectiveness of individual charter schools.|$|E

Our learning environment determinant is {{the percentage of the}} child’s peers having at least one parent with university education. In our regression we use Norwegian register data of all graduating secondary pupils during the years 2002 to 2007 and their parents. The results in our main analysis, using the final assessments as the dependent variable, indicate a negative <b>peer</b> <b>effect</b> of being in a good learning environment. This indicates that children’s school performance gets poorer when the parents’ education level at school increases. We carried out subsample analyses and controlled for school fixed effects in the main analysis to explore what kind of mechanisms causing our negative results. The results from the subsample analyses show that the well-performing pupils are more negatively affected being in a good learning environment, and the subsample reveals that there probably is no selection of well-performing pupils into schools. When controlling for school fixed effects in the main analysis the estimates became close to zero. This indicates no <b>peer</b> <b>effect.</b> The results suggest that the negative effect we found in the main analysis was due to school specifics as for instance the school quality or the teachers’ grade setting. To examine the school specifics more thorough we did an analysis using the examination grades as the dependent variable. The results from this analysis revealed a positive <b>peer</b> <b>effect.</b> This indicates that the teacher’s grade setting probably was the reason for our negative estimates in the main analysis. We also controlled for school fixed effects in this analysis and found no <b>peer</b> <b>effect.</b> This indicates that a child’s peers at school do not influence the child’s own school performance.

50|$|To make inferences and {{predictions}} about behavior concerning a voting decision, certain {{factors such as}} gender, race, culture or religion must be considered. Moreover, key public influences include the role of emotions, political socialization, tolerance of diversity of political views and the media. The effect of these influences on voting behavior is best understood through theories on the formation of attitudes, beliefs, schema, knowledge structures {{and the practice of}} information processing. For example, surveys from different countries indicate that people are generally happier in individualistic cultures where they have rights such as the right to vote. Additionally, social influence and <b>peer</b> <b>effects,</b> as originating from family and friends, also {{play an important role in}} elections and voting behavior. An important question in this context is how to disentangle the social contagion by peers from external influences.

30|$|Third, {{we found}} that network {{properties}} of connectivity, transitivity, and network distance can indirectly influence diffusion through the specific <b>peer</b> <b>effect</b> that occurs on the network. Specifically, in the scenario of positive externality effect, both experience effect and externality effect are generally enhanced in networks that are well connected, highly transitive, and with low distance between individuals. The effectiveness of the diffusion is thus improved. These findings {{are in line with}} existing studies (Janssen and Jager 2003; Laciana et al. 2013; Peres 2014). However, we find no studies considering the negative effect. In the case of negative effect, our work shows that these characteristics shape the two effects in a way that helps speed up diffusion, but tends to lower the coverage it could reach. These together suggest that each specific <b>peer</b> <b>effect</b> is reshaped by the structure of the network where it occurs. This could further influence the effectiveness of the diffusion.|$|R
