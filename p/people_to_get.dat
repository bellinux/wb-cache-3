Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of their}} sacred status and their less {{aggressive}} behavior {{compared to other}} primates, langurs are generally not considered pests {{in many parts of}} India.

While people may feed them in temples, they do not extend such care to monkey at their homes.
