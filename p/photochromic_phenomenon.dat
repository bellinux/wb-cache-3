40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the optical transmittance of bilayer samples consisting of pyrolytically coated amorphous Mg-Sn-O and metal oxide films such as In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 decreases upon ultraviolet illumination, which can be recovered by annealing in air at ∼ 300 ℃. Spectral, structural, and compositional studies suggest that this <b>photochromic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is induced by photoelectronic excitation in the Mg-Sn-O film, electron injection into the metal oxide, which becomes negatively charged, and subsequent formation of metallic particles, which absorb and/or scatter visible light...|$|E
40|$|An easy {{experiment}} on {{the synthesis of}} 3, 3 -diphenyl- 3 H-naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyran and characterization of its photochromic behaviour is reported. Upon irradiation of an uncoloured toluene solution of 3, 3 -diphenyl- 3 H-naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyran with near UV light, an intense yellow colouration is produced due {{to the formation of}} two coloured open forms. When the irradiation source is removed the coloured open forms return to the uncoloured state. The analysis of the absorbance decay with time allows the determination of the discoloration rate constants of each open form. The reversibility of the <b>photochromic</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> well demonstrated by the exposure of the solution to sunlight for a few seconds, is particularly attractive to the students...|$|E
40|$|A strong {{reversible}} <b>photochromic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in spiro-oxazine (SO) dye-doped {{polyvinyl alcohol}} (PVA) films is reported. The absorption {{spectrum of the}} SO/PVA film shows an ultra-violet (UV) light induced isormerization process taking place between two molecular configurations, which correspond to the two characteristic absorption bands at 360 nm and 595 nm, respectively. The temporal behavior of this photo-isomerization process is investigated. The molecular absorption coefficients of SO 1 to UV light and SO 2 to the probe beam at 515 nm {{are found to be}} 1. 2 cm 2 /J and 6 × 10 - 2 cm 2 /J, respectively. The life time of SO 2 in the dark is about 38 s. Spatial light modulation and UV-to-visible image conversion using this photochromic film are demonstrated experimentally.

40|$|<b>Photochromic</b> <b>phenomena</b> {{are very}} briefly surveyed, with special {{emphasis}} on reversible photocyclizations on which many <b>photochromic</b> <b>phenomena</b> are based. The chromic behaviour of dianthrone. DA. and its derivatives is reviewed. It is suggested that the coloured modification B is common to all cases ob-served, {{and that it is}} identical with the thermochromic coloured form. A detailed study of the reversible and irreversible photoreactions, thermal reactions, and emission properties of DA and its derivatives is reported, based on the use of both stationary and flash methods, {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and solvents. All compounds are fluorescent and phosphorescent, and their triplet—triplet absorption spectra and triplet decay were observed at sufficiently low temperatures. With increasing temperature the triplet decays mainly via its conversion into B, in some cases via a precursor D. Both triplet — D and D — B are strictly viscosity-controlled reactions. At still higher temperature...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} novel pyrrolidene imines bearing {{functionalized}} aryl or naphthyl moieties was synthesized and their photochromic properties studied by UV spectroscopy. UV irradiation of these heterocyclic Schiff bases {{at room temperature}} promotes the trans-cis photoisomerization of the C=N double bond with formation of a variable amount of the cis-isomer that, {{in the absence of}} light, returns thermally to the original form in few seconds. The thermal cis-trans re-isomerization of these molecular switches is much more slower than for the common benzylidene aniline-type imines, allowing the observation of the <b>photochromic</b> <b>phenomena</b> at room temperature. Strong electron-donor substituents in the para-position of the aniline part of the molecule decreases even more the kinetics of the thermal cis-trans re-isomerization leading to a manifest change in the UV spectrum.

40|$|Extent: 6 p. Erratum (Corrigendum) {{published}} {{for this}} article in: Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter, 2014; 26 (23) : 239502 Natural pink and brown diamonds exhibit surprising <b>photochromic</b> <b>phenomena</b> when optically pumped with ultraviolet light of photon energy epsilon ≥ 4. 1 eV, including a subsequent sensitivity to infrared pumps, which is not evident prior to UV exposure. In this study, we observe the dependence of photochromism on pump photon energy and intensity, for both UV and IR pumps. From these observations, we propose a model of several distinct charge transfer processes between multiple species of optically active defect centres. We show {{it is likely that}} the UV-induced behaviour of pink diamond photochromism is linked to the vacancy clusters responsible for brown colouration in diamonds.

40|$|DFT and TDDFT {{methods have}} been {{performed}} to investigate the photoisomerization effect for dithiazolylarylene on solution. The weak S center dot center dot center dot N interaction and CH center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bond restrain {{the rotation of the}} side-chain thiazolyl ring in open-isomer la, the higher stability of which prefers to show a high quantum yield of photoisomerization. The calculated UV-Vis spectrum at around 320 nm for open-isomer la is bathochromically shifted to 647 nm for closed-isomer 1 b, in excellent agreement with the experimental <b>photochromic</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> The electron transition in ECD (electron circular dichroism) spectra for closed-isomer 1 b with two chiral carbon atoms is dominated by ICT (intramolecular charge transition) and LE (local excitation) corresponding to one positive (440 nm) and one negative Cotton effect (650 nm), respectively, where the two chiral carbon atoms play a slight role in these transitions. The PES in the S- 1 and S- 0 states, respectively, indicates that the cyclization reaction from open-isomer la to closed-isomer 1 b is allowed in the photoexcited state with high-conversion quantum efficiency, while it is forbidden in the thermodynamic process. In addition, the second-order nonlinear optical response for closed-isomer 1 b is nearly six times larger than that for open-isomer la. It is also confirmed that the photoirradiation evokes the photoisomerization character to show dramatic difference in the second-order NLO response, which can be applied to designing photochromic materials and reversible NLO switches...|$|E
