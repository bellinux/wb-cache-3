5|$|For {{isotopes}} with {{atomic mass}} unit values {{less than that of}} the most abundant stable isotope, 106Pd, the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being rhodium. The primary mode of decay for those isotopes of Pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is beta decay with the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> of this decay being silver.|$|E
50|$|A common {{explanation}} for this supposed phenomenon is that manufactured goods have a greater income elasticity of demand than <b>primary</b> <b>products,</b> especially food. Therefore, as incomes rise, the demand for manufactured goods increases more rapidly than demand for <b>primary</b> <b>products.</b> In addition, <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> have a low price elasticity of demand, so a decline in their prices tends to reduce revenue rather than increase it.|$|R
5000|$|To {{determine}} equilibrium, we {{need only}} {{to look at the}} market for one of the goods, as per Walras' law. We consider the market for the South's goods: <b>primary</b> <b>products.</b> The demand for imports, M, from the South is a positive function of per capita consumption in the North and a negative function of the terms of trade, , (higher [...] means relative price of <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> is high and less will be demanded). The supply side comes from export of <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> by the South, X, and is a positive function of the terms of trade and the South’s aggregate consumption of <b>primary</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Constitution Alteration (Organised Marketing of <b>Primary</b> <b>Products)</b> 1946 was an Australian {{referendum}} {{held in the}} 1946 referendums {{which sought}} to alter the Australian Constitution to remove restrictions in Section 92 of the Constitution which limited Commonwealth power to make laws {{with respect to the}} organised marketing of <b>primary</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E
5|$|Glucose, {{dextrose}} or grape sugar, occurs {{naturally in}} fruits and plant juices {{and is the}} <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> of photosynthesis. Most ingested carbohydrates are converted into glucose during digestion {{and it is the}} form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the bloodstream. It can be manufactured from starch by the addition of enzymes or in the presence of acids. Glucose syrup is a liquid form of glucose that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|In {{explosive}} eruptions, {{the eruption}} of magma {{is driven by the}} rapid release of pressure, often involving the explosion of gas previously dissolved within the material. The most famous and destructive historical eruptions are mainly of this type. An eruptive phase can consist of a single eruption, or a sequence of several eruptions spread over several days, weeks or months. Explosive eruptions usually involve thick, highly viscous, silicic or felsic magma, high in volatiles like water vapor and carbon dioxide. Pyroclastic materials are the <b>primary</b> <b>product,</b> typically in the form of tuff. Eruptions the size of that at Lake Toba 74,000 years ago, at least , or the Yellowstone eruption 620,000 years ago, around , occur worldwide every 50,000 to 100,000years.|$|E

5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E

Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.|$|E

25|$|In trade terms, the Australian {{economy has}} had {{persistently}} large current account deficits (CADs) {{for more than}} 50 years. One single factor that undermines balance of payments is Australia's narrow export base, making it highly sensitive to the volatility of global <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> prices. In addition, due to a colonial heritage {{a lot of companies}} operating in Australia are foreign-owned and as a result, Australia's net income outlay between it {{and the rest of the}} world is always negative; this results in persistent current account deficits even during times of positive net merchandise exports.|$|E
25|$|The {{skilled worker}} {{shortage}} {{was much more}} severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its heavy oil experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, and wound down the production of Orimulsion, which was the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> from its oil sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.|$|E
