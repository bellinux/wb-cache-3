5|$|Dale {{mistakes}} Jerry for Horace, who {{is married}} to her friend Madge (Helen Broderick). Following the success of Jerry's opening night in London, Jerry follows Dale to Venice, where she is visiting Madge and modelling/promoting the gowns created by Alberto Beddini (Erik Rhodes), a dandified Italian fashion designer with a <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> malapropisms.|$|E
5|$|David Healy as Shane Weston, the {{commander-in-chief}} of WIN's London Headquarters and Deputy Head {{of the international}} organisation, who has a <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> feeble jokes. Healy, an American actor resident in the United Kingdom, had voiced supporting characters in Captain Scarlet, and was often contracted to play transatlantic characters in British television.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 Queneau met {{and briefly}} joined the Surrealists, but never fully shared their <b>penchants</b> <b>for</b> {{automatic}} writing or ultra-left politics. Like many surrealists, he entered psychoanalysis—however, not {{in order to}} stimulate his creative abilities, but for personal reasons, as with Leiris, Bataille, and Crevel.|$|R
5000|$|Humanity {{has split}} itself into three factions: Earthers, based around a future Earth {{administrated}} by corporations; Gongens, descendants of East Asians living on Mars (renamed Gongen) following a continent-wide nuclear disaster; Mavericks, anarchists in the [...] "Outer Rims" [...] with <b>penchants</b> <b>for</b> cybernetic replacements. The two alien races are the Quay, a chitinous slave race with tribal tendencies and Mesoamerican- and Austronesian-styled proper nouns, and the Shi, an advanced race of floating, psychic aliens with proper nouns styled after Indo-Aryan languages.|$|R
5000|$|Wake of the Flood is {{the sixth}} studio album by rock band the Grateful Dead. Released October 15, 1973, {{it was the}} first album on the band's own Grateful Dead Records label. Their first studio album in nearly three years, it was also the first without {{founding}} member Ron [...] "Pigpen" [...] McKernan, who had recently died. His absence and keyboardist Keith Godchaux's <b>penchants</b> <b>for</b> bebop and modal jazz (rather than McKernan's tendencies toward the blues and soul music) contributed to the band's musical evolution. Godchaux's wife, backing vocalist Donna Jean Godchaux, also joined the group and appears on the album.|$|R
5|$|On 20 May 1789, Prittwitz was {{appointed}} {{general of the}} cavalry by the new Prussian king Frederick William II. His <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> gambling caused his dismissal as inspector in 1790. He died on the 4 June 1793 in Berlin, and his body was removed to his estate in Quilitz for burial.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, with a <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also note}} Flagg’s <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> evil. Tony Magistrale, author of Stephen King: The Second Decade, Danse Macabre to The Dark Half sees Flagg as a Shakespearian villain {{comparing}} him to Iago, Edmund and Richard III, contending that Flagg is an antihero. Magistrale believes that Flagg’s evil {{is based on}} his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction; although he seeks power, it is merely a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction.|$|E
5|$|Ruth's legendary {{power and}} charismatic {{personality}} {{made him a}} larger-than-life figure during the Roaring Twenties. During his career, he {{was the target of}} intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field <b>penchants</b> <b>for</b> drinking and womanizing. His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages. After his retirement as a player, he was denied a managerial job in baseball, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with cancer, which claimed his life two years later.|$|R
2500|$|Chiles is {{a parody}} of famed {{attorney}} Johnnie Cochran; both are bespectacled, mustachioed, well-dressed, African American lawyers with the same initials and <b>penchants</b> <b>for</b> grandiose vocabulary. [...] According to the diplomas in his office, Chiles attended Dartmouth College and Stanford Law School. Morris also emulates Cochran's distinctive enunciation and delivery. After appearing in several episodes during the series' later years, Chiles, {{along with many other}} minor characters from the show's past, appeared again in the program's finale and was crucial in failing to achieve acquittal of the characters on charges of violating the Good Samaritan Law. Jackie's catchphrase is saying several adjectives in succession for added emphasis, such as [...] "lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!" ...|$|R

5|$|Gilchrist {{has been}} {{the chair of the}} National Australia Day Council since 2008. In 2008, Gilchrist {{supported}} debate on whether Australia Day should be moved to a new date because the current date marks European settlement and is offensive to many Aboriginal Australians. Gilchrist is considered to have left-wing views; Australian captain Ricky Ponting commented in his annual Captain's Diary that his deputy had a <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> reading Karl Marx while on tour.|$|E
5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had a <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, Johor {{began to}} receive the first Chinese {{settlers}} (mainly immigrants from Swatow and Chaozhou). The young Temenggong, Tun Daeng Ibrahim, took up the administrative tasks of the state. He imposed taxes upon these settlers, which went to the Temenggong's charge. However, unlike the Temenggong, Sultan Ali was unwilling to involve himself with {{the affairs of the}} state {{but at the same time}} complained of receiving insufficient allowance from the British. He was well known for his <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> an extravagant lifestyle, and was chalking up considerable debts by the 1850s.|$|E

5000|$|The initial {{books written}} by Dexter were general studies text books. [...] He began writing mysteries in 1972 during a family holiday: [...] "We {{were in a}} little guest house halfway between Caernarfon and Pwllheli. It was a Saturday and it was raining—it's not unknown for it to rain in North Wales. The {{children}} were moaning... I {{was sitting at the}} kitchen table with nothing else to do, and I wrote the first few paragraphs of a potential detective novel." [...] Last Bus to Woodstock was published in 1975 and introduced the character of Inspector Morse, the irascible detective whose <b>penchants</b> <b>for</b> cryptic crosswords, English literature, cask ale, and Wagner reflect Dexter's own enthusiasms. Dexter's plots used false leads and other red herrings.|$|R
6000|$|Stran. [...] If I chose, [...] I {{might be}} whiter; but I have a <b>penchant</b> [...] <b>For</b> black--it is so honest, and, besides, [...] Can neither blush with shame nor pale with fear; [...] But I have worn {{it long enough}} of late, [...] And now I'll take your figure.|$|R
5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little {{influence}} with President Van Buren. His <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> wielding his power {{for his own}} interests did not abate. He lobbied the Senate to promote Samuel Milroy, whom he owed a favor, {{to the position of}} Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E
5|$|Mithra: The Mithra are a race {{of hunters}} who live {{alongside}} the Tarutaru in Windurst. They {{are known for their}} energy, curiosity, and their <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> causing playful mischief. Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity, and so only female mithra leave the home, making females the only playable gender. Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower HP and charisma. Mithra are cursed with envy.|$|E
5|$|Olds was {{promoted}} to brigadier general after returning from Vietnam but did not hold another major command. The remainder of his career was spent in non-operational positions, as Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy and as an official in the Air Force Inspector General's Office. His inability to rise higher as a general officer is attributed to both his maverick views and his <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> drinking.|$|E
500|$|Davies {{continued}} to submit scripts to the WGYT during his studies at Oxford, including Box, {{a play about}} the influence of television that Evans noted contained Davies' <b>penchants</b> <b>for</b> misdirecting the audience and mixing comedy and drama; In Her Element, which centred on the animation of still objects; and Hothouse, an Alan Bennett-inspired piece about internal politics in an advertising office. In 1984, he made his final performance for the WGYT and signed up for a course in Theatre Studies at Cardiff University after graduating from Oxford. He worked sporadically for the Sherman Theatre's publicity department and claimed unemployment benefit in the interim. In 1985, Davies began his professional television career after a friend suggested that he should talk to a television producer who was seeking a temporary graphic artist for the children's show Why Don't You? ...|$|R
2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{depictions of}} a real person, the infamous {{criminal}} Mark 'Chopper' Read (Franklin) appears as a special guest in various incongruous situations, such as reading a story for children a la Play School or calling numbers for bingo. Much of the humour in Chopper's segments derives from his <b>penchants</b> <b>for</b> swearing and violence, {{as well as his}} lack of education, as demonstrated in the bingo sketch where he points out [...] "I can't even fuckin' count, and I'm gonna host bingo! It's just like bloody dingo but it's safer with your kids, isn't it?". Chopper also makes many threatening statements directed at Neville Bartos, a character based on a real person who the real Chopper allegedly shot before going to prison, but with whom Chopper is now good friends. Franklin's portrayal of Read is as much based on the real Chopper as it is on Eric Bana's take on the man as portrayed in the 2000 Andrew Dominik film of the same name.|$|R
6000|$|Of course, Slowfoot {{was with}} him--amiable, meek, and silent as ever. And so was Baby La Certe, a five-year-old by that time, and {{obviously}} {{a girl with}} a stronger <b>penchant</b> than ever <b>for</b> tobacco! ...|$|R
5|$|Ultimate {{released}} {{the game for}} the ZX Spectrum at an above-average price to combat piracy. Its premium product packaging became a company standard. The developers had finished Sabre Wulf sequels in advance of its release but—in keeping with their <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> secrecy—chose to withhold them for marketing purposes. The sequels were swiftly released later that year. Ultimate hired outside developers to port Sabre Wulf to other computing platforms: the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC. The game was later featured in compilations including the 2015 retrospective of games by Ultimate and its successor, Rare.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Chongqing was {{reeling from}} {{problems}} such as air and water pollution, unemployment, poor public health, and complications from the Three Gorges Dam. According to analysts, Hu wanted to transfer his ally Wang Yang out of Chongqing before these problems intensified. Bo was initially reluctant to go to Chongqing and was reportedly unhappy with his new assignment. He had hoped to become vice-premier instead, but Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-premier Wu Yi argued against Bo's promotion to vice-premiership. In particular, Wu was critical of Bo's <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> self-promotion, and Wen cited international lawsuits against Bo by Falun Gong adherents {{as a barrier to}} his holding higher office.|$|E
5|$|Born into a well-read {{and educated}} family, Hambro {{developed}} a <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> French literature, marking an incongruity to the literary taste of his parents—they had been readers of English {{literature in the}} Anglo-American tradition. Making his debut in 1960 with the satirical novel De frafalnes klubb, Hambro published trilogies and other novels {{for the next two}} decades. He had a keen interest in linguistics; in the 1969 book Ting, tanke, tale he problematized linguistic questions in a popular scientific way. A translator of French literature, he chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators in the early 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The mind-blindness theory {{helps to}} explain the {{impairment}} in the social development of individuals {{as well as the}} impairment in the communication skills of autistics and AS patients. However {{one of the most important}} limitations of this theory is that it is unable to explain the highly repetitive behaviours which is a characteristic trait seen in AS and autism. This triad is explained through the process of systemising. The theory also did not account for the motor problems and the superior rote memory skills that were associated with autism. These aspects along with the highly repetitive behaviours formed the triad of strengths. Simon Baron-Cohen himself has acknowledged that the theory, while adept at explaining the communications difficulties experienced by autism and Asperger's patients, fails to explain such patients' <b>penchants</b> <b>for</b> narrowly defined interests, an important step to proper diagnosis. Furthermore, mind-blindness seems decidedly non-unique to those with autism or Asperger's syndrome, since conditions ranging from schizophrenia to various narcissistic personality disorders and/or anti-social personality disorders all exhibit mind-blindness to some degree.|$|R
5000|$|... 557 Violetta is a {{minor planet}} {{orbiting}} the Sun that was discovered by German astronomer Max Wolf on 26 January 1905 in Heidelberg. In light of M. F. Wolf's <b>penchant</b> ca. 1905 <b>for</b> naming asteroids after operatic heroines, {{it is likely that}} 557 Violetta is named after the protagonist of Giuseppe Verdi's famous opera La Traviata.|$|R
6000|$|Aurora, who look'd more {{on books}} than faces, [...] Was very young, {{although}} so very sage, [...] Admiring more Minerva than the Graces, [...] Especially upon a printed page. [...] But Virtue's self, {{with all her}} tightest laces, [...] Has not the natural stays of strict old age; [...] And Socrates, that model of all duty, [...] Own'd to a <b>penchant,</b> though discreet, <b>for</b> beauty.|$|R
5|$|Cyril, an eleven-year-old with a nasty <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> making trouble, {{comes to}} stay at the Place for three months. While there, he {{frequently}} lies, sneakily torments Lad, and plays such horrible pranks on the staff that two quit. After he is caught kicking Lad in plain sight, the Master loses his temper and scolds him. Cyril goes into a rage and runs away in a snowstorm. He gets lost and falls off a high cliff, landing on a small ledge. Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the ledge to save the boy from a bobcat. Now trapped with the boy, Lad keeps him warm until a rescue party arrives.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{was born}} in Amherst, Massachusetts. Although part of a {{prominent}} family with strong ties to its community, Dickinson lived much {{of her life in}} reclusive isolation. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a noted <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> white clothing and became known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence. Dickinson was a recluse for the later years of her life.|$|E
5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
6000|$|... "But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon--if I have a <b>penchant,</b> it is <b>for</b> a philosopher. Yet, {{let me tell}} you, sir, it is {{not every}} dev--I mean it is not every gentleman {{who knows how to}} choose a philosopher. Long ones are not good; and the best, if not {{carefully}} shelled, are apt to be a little rancid on account of the gall!" ...|$|R
50|$|Sáenz-Díez’ {{ancestors}} {{made their}} name in business, but they stayed clear {{of politics and}} nothing is known of their preferences. Until his early 30s also Juan did not demonstrate any <b>penchant</b> either <b>for</b> political activity or for public engagements. In the 1920s his only endeavors were those related to the local Santiago societé and tourist organizations; once in the early 1930s he had moved to Madrid he was noted merely for presence in Junta de Gobierno of Ler Gallego, an association of the Gallegos living in the capital. Though in {{the final years of}} the Republic he donated small sums to right-wing press, he was not recognized as militant of any party of grouping.|$|R
5000|$|... "Black Baron" [...] was a {{nickname}} of Wrangel's, from the alleged <b>penchant</b> of his <b>for</b> wearing (and dressing {{some of his}} elite units in) black uniforms. Wrangel's offensive was indeed halted by the Red Army, and Wrangel and his troops were forced to retreat to Crimea in November 1920, pursued by both Red and Black cavalry and infantry. Wrangel {{and the remains of}} his army were evacuated from Crimea to Constantinople on 14 November 1920.|$|R
