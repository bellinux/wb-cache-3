5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become the <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local washes were {{considered}} the <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> these sands, {{which would have}} been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift.

At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E

American missionaries who arrived after World War II built the first church and school on Satawal.|$|E
