25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a <b>phosphating</b> process.|$|E

One of the most important classes of ligands are <b>phosphate</b> esters. In this thesis I describe the investigation of some <b>phosphate</b> ester-metal ion equilibria.

In addition, the complexation of 1 -naphthyl <b>phosphate,</b> 8 -quinolyl <b>phosphate</b> and 8 -quinolyl methyl <b>phosphate</b> with nickel and cobalt ions was also studied.

The calorimetric results show that the desolvation of ligand and metal ion during the complexation plays an important role. The possibility of similar correlations for complexes of triphosphates is also discussed...|$|R

Dissolution of phosphate-containing minerals induced by a changing rhizosphere equilibrium through proton input is one important mechanism that releases <b>phosphate</b> into bioavailable forms. Our objectives were (i) to determine <b>phosphate</b> {{release kinetics}} during H+ addition in calcareous soils of the Schwäbische Alb, Germany, and to assess the influence of (ii) land-use type (grassland vs. forest) and (iii) management intensity on reactive <b>phosphate</b> pools and <b>phosphate</b> release rate constants during H+ addition. <b>Phosphate</b> release kinetics were characterized by a large fast-reacting phosphatepool, which could be attributed to poorly-crystalline calcium <b>phosphates,</b> and a small slow-reacting <b>phosphate</b> pool probably originating from carbonate-bearing hydroxylapatite. Both reactive <b>phosphate</b> pools—as well as total <b>phosphate</b> concentrations (TP) in soil—were greater in grassland than in forest soils. In organically fertilized grassland soils, concentrations of released <b>phosphate</b> were higher than in unfertilized soils, likely because organic fertilizers contain poorly-crystalline <b>phosphate</b> compounds which are further converted into sparingly soluble <b>phosphate</b> forms.
