5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity {{in the afternoon}} compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least <b>productive</b> <b>time</b> being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E

The book rebutted claims of African inferiority, and would come to serve as the basis of much Afrocentric historiography in the 20th century. The Negro predicted unity and solidarity for colored people around the world, and it influenced many who supported the Pan-African movement.|$|E

25|$|Productivity is a {{standard}} efficiency metric for evaluation of production systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume many specific forms, for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=inventory turnover). It is also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total time) and yield η (ratio between produced volume and <b>productive</b> <b>time)</b> to better evaluate production systems performances. Cycle times can be modeled through manufacturing engineering if the individual operations are heavily automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include: time and motion study, predetermined motion time systems and work sampling.|$|E

A fervent nationalist, Dvořák used the folk music of his native land in his music, and encouraged American composers to do the same. One of the Conservatory's students, the African American Harry Burleigh, introduced him to the songs of the minstrel shows and spirituals, and Dvorak was deeply moved, enough to write a well-known essay in an 1895 issue of Harper's declaring that American composers should use the diverse folk elements of their country in their compositions.|$|E

Although the job offered security and good pay, Casanova describes his last years as boring and frustrating, {{even though it was}} the most <b>productive</b> <b>time</b> for writing. His health had deteriorated dramatically, and he found life among peasants to be less than stimulating. He was only able to make occasional visits to Vienna and Dresden for relief. Although Casanova got on well with the Count, his employer was a much younger man with his own eccentricities. The Count often ignored him at meals and failed to introduce him to important visiting guests. Moreover, Casanova, the testy outsider, was thoroughly disliked by most of the other inhabitants of the Castle of Dux. Casanova's only friends seemed to be his fox terriers. In despair, Casanova considered suicide, but instead decided that he must live on to record his memoirs, which he did until his death.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{pressures}} {{and the increasing}} importance of resource efficiency make the streamlining of production processes necessary. In this context, the reduction of non-productive times, i. e. of the part of machine tools’ total run time which, contrary to <b>productive</b> <b>times,</b> does not create value, represents an important lever. The percentage of non-productive times of many modern production processes is just below or even above that of <b>productive</b> <b>times.</b> However, streamlining non-productive times is extremely complicated. Computerized Numerical Controls (CNC) are very comprehensive {{in terms of their}} usage, specification language and parameter settings. Only very few people possess the specialised knowledge required for streamlining non-productive times. In order to counter this situation, a new method to reduce non-productive times will be covered in this thesis. For this purpose eight different processes to analyse the potential of non-productive times will be presented first. Following on from that, the actual method for reducing non-productive times is introduced. It consists of eight groups organised by topic, each representing a different streamlining process. Three of these groups will be the focus of this thesis. The eight groups will be covered and compared to one another. At the same time specific benefits and disadvantages are also detailed. However, due to the complexity of manual operation of a large part of processes computer programmes have been developed to automate certain parts of usage and thus facilitating their use. In {{order to be able to}} assess both the processes for an analysis of potential and the method to reduce non-productive times these processes were applied to three selected, real production processes of high-volume production of automotive powertrain components. Rising potentials, and/ or potentials to rise will be covered and explained in detail. The evaluation of the processes to analyse and reduce non-productive times will be conducted using both the potentials identified and additional assessment criteria...|$|R
2500|$|A minor hit in 1965, [...] "Wine and Women", {{led to the}} group's first LP, The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs. By 1966 Festival was, however, on {{the verge}} of {{dropping}} them from the Leedon roster because of their perceived lack of commercial success. It was at this time that they met the American-born songwriter, producer and entrepreneur Nat Kipner, who had just been appointed A manager of a new independent label, Spin Records. Kipner briefly took over as the group's manager and successfully negotiated their transfer to Spin in exchange for granting Festival the Australian distribution rights to the group's recordings. Through Kipner the Bee Gees met engineer-producer, Ossie Byrne, who produced (or co-produced with Kipner) many of the earlier Spin recordings, most of which were cut at his own small, self-built St Clair Studio in the Sydney suburb of Hurstville. Byrne gave the Gibb brothers virtually unlimited access to St Clair Studio {{over a period of several}} months in mid-1966.

During this <b>productive</b> <b>time</b> they recorded a large batch of original material—including the song that would become their first major hit, [...] "Spicks and Specks" [...] (on which Byrne played the trumpet coda)—as well as cover versions of current hits by overseas acts such as the Beatles.
