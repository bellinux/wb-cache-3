50|$|Woolmark is a {{trademark}} owned by Australian Wool Innovation Limited (AWI). AWI licenses this trademark {{to be used}} by affiliated vendors on their products as an certification mark that the product conforms to a set of standards laid by the organization. AWI claims that the mark is employed on textile products as an assurance that the product is made of 100% <b>pure</b> <b>new</b> <b>wool.</b> It signifies the brand of wool. The logo was designed by Italian graphic artist Francesco Saroglia and introduced in 1964.|$|E
5000|$|The S number {{often is}} used in {{conjunction}} with the word [...] "super" [...] which originally meant the best wool, (called choice wool in the United States) [...] As now used Super means <b>pure</b> <b>new</b> <b>wool</b> and can also be used for fabrics made from wool blended with rare fiber (such as mohair, cashmere wool and alpaca), and also with silk. The inclusion of Elastane to give the fabric a stretch effect is permitted, as also is the inclusion of up to 5% non-wool yarn for decorative effects. For wool blend fabric descriptions, the word Super is not permitted. Subject to the wool content being at least 45%, the S number may be used.|$|E

40|$|<b>New</b> Zealand <b>Wool</b> Production and Disposal New Zealand is {{the third}} largest producer, and second largest exporter, of wool in the world. Over {{the past thirty years}} <b>New</b> Zealand's <b>wool</b> {{production}} has more than doubled. Since 1967 / 68, however, a marked decline has occurred in the rate at which wool production was increasing. This decline may be attributed primarily to present economic and managerial advantages of expanding beef production, rather than sheep production, {{in many parts of the}} country. Wool provides an important source of export earnings for <b>New</b> Zealand. <b>Wool</b> exports in 1970, valued at $ 204. 5 million, constituted 19 % of the total New Zealand earnings from export produce. 1. Source: Department of Statistics (3), p. 567. This places wool third in importance, after meat and dairy produce, as an export earner. The bulk of the <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wool</b> clip is sold at auction in New Zealand and exported in the greasy state. The major markets for <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wool</b> are the United Kingdom, the U. S. A., Japan, Belgium, France, Italy, and the U. S. S. R. Local mill purchases take only a small proportion of the wool clip...|$|R

This research has suggested that New Zealand textile design has been under-utilised as a means of adding value to this commodity and set out to investigate how design in conjunction with technology and marketing could create a new product idea and propose a new story. Investigations into design, technology and marketing were carried out within a generic product design framework for a defined textile interior product. Research ceased at the point at which a product story could be proposed. Woven prototypes developed through studio practice explored a 3 D contoured aesthetic for <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wool</b> fabrics incorporating specialist yarn technology, and manufacturing capabilities were assessed to determine whether New Zealand industry could feasibly produce the resultant fabrics.
