5|$|The troublemaker Bricriu once incites three heroes, Cú Chulainn, Conall Cernach and Lóegaire Búadach, {{to compete}} for the champion's portion at his feast. In every test that is set Cú Chulainn comes out top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire will accept the result. Cú Roí mac Dáire of Munster settles it by visiting each {{in the guise of a}} hideous churl and {{challenging}} them to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them in return. Conall and Lóegaire both behead Cú Roí, who <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> head and leaves, but when the time comes for him to return they flee. Only Cú Chulainn is brave and honourable enough to submit himself to Cú Roí's axe; Cú Roí spares him and he is declared champion. This beheading challenge appears in later literature, most notably in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Other examples include the 13th century French Life of Caradoc and the English romances The Turke and Gowin, and Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} movie {{opens with}} the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases {{one of them}} to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower.

He also wins in a local tournament, thanks to the horse and banner given him by the lady. A knight of Lombardy, Sir Valentyne, challenges him (on the honour of his beloved lady) to come to Lombardy to fight with him. This section of Thomas Chestre's tale does not derive from Marie de France's Lanval or from the English Sir Landevale, but perhaps from another romance that is now lost. Launfal makes the voyage, and defeats Valentyne, thanks to his invisible servant Gyfre, who <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> helmet and shield when Valentyne knocks them down.

When the bridge starts, the band is shot performing in one room while Moody is in another, playing on the piano. Throughout the video, Lee is never filmed on ground level.

Angier realizes that [...] "Alfred Borden" [...] is actually an identity assumed by twin brothers who took turns being Borden and Fallon; the twin who loved his hanged wife Sarah, {{and the one who}} loved the assistant Olivia. Fallon loved Olivia and is the more hot headed of the two brothers; he is the twin who, despite promising not to return to Angier's show, does so and is caught. Fallon, having exacerbated Sarah's depression which leads to her suicide, is the twin who is hanged. The surviving twin is Sarah's husband. Borden berates Angier for going too far in his quest for dominance. Angier explains that giving his audience a moment of wonder, and to bask in their applause, was his great ambition.

500|$|An extended, eight-minute {{video for}} [...] "Pyramids", also {{directed}} by Elderkin, was later released on September 8, 2012. The video follows a loose narrative, with stream-of-consciousness scenes, and utilizes several songs from Ocean's album channel ORANGE. It begins with Ocean drinking four shots of absinthe at a bar, before opening fire upon the bar itself; {{a segment of}} [...] "Pink Matter" [...] plays during this portion. A title card appears as Ocean boards his motorcycle (the song [...] "Start" [...] appears.) As he rides off into the desert, a snippet {{of the first half}} of [...] "Pyramids" [...] plays before transition directly into the second half. Shots of Ocean singing on his motorbike are interspersed with slow-motion scenes of Ocean walking through a strip club in a hallucinogenic haze, occasionally bursting into laughter; the club employs vampy women. Ocean is then seen in front of a large neon triangle with the Kabbalahian Tree of Life in neon upon it, from which John Mayer emerges and performs an entirely new guitar solo exclusive to the video. James Montgomery of MTV News characterizes the scene as an inadvertent [...] "vision quest". Ocean falls down backwards, instantly re-appearing in the desert as a plane flies overhead. The song [...] "End" [...] appears as Ocean walks back to his motorcycle, <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> helmet and walks down the highway towards a pyramid in the distance.|$|E

[...] The people of the town predict great things for Joseph Taylor, Jr., or Joe as he will {{come to be called}} (Musical number: [...] "Joseph Taylor, Jr."). [...] Joe learns what a baby learns: the comforting {{presence}} of his mother, the presence of another figure, who does not smell as nice, and who always leaves as soon as he <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> black bag. [...] Joe is seen as a baby and then not again as a child; the audience takes his perspective. [...] Joe's Grandma notices him trying to walk, calls for Marjorie to witness the first steps, and once he takes them, as the chorus states, [...] "the world belongs to Joe" [...] ("One Foot, Other Foot"). [...] Joe grows to school age, and loses his beloved Grandma. [...] He is comforted by Jennie Brinker, a businessman's daughter. [...] The two grow to high school age and date, though Joe lacks the nerve to kiss her, to Jennie's frustration.

500|$|In Camelot on New Year's Day, King Arthur's {{court is}} exchanging gifts {{and waiting for}} the feasting to start when the king asks first to see or hear of an {{exciting}} adventure. A gigantic figure, entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse, rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe {{in one hand and a}} holly bough in the other. Refusing to fight anyone there on the grounds that they are all too weak to take him on, he insists he has come for a friendly [...] "Christmas game": someone is to strike him once with his axe on condition that the Green Knight may return the blow in a year and a day. The splendid axe will belong to whoever takes him on. Arthur himself is prepared to accept the challenge when it appears no other knight will dare, but Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur's knights and his nephew, begs for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However, the Green Knight neither falls nor falters, but instead reaches out, <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> severed head and remounts, holding up his bleeding head to Queen Guinevere while its writhing lips remind Gawain that the two must meet again at the Green Chapel. He then rides away. Gawain and Arthur admire the axe, hang it up as a trophy and encourage Guinevere to treat the whole matter lightly.|$|E

The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [...] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth." ...|$|E
