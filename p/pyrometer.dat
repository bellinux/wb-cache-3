25|$|Consider {{the case}} of using gold as the source (mp = 1063°C). In this technique, the current through the {{filament}} of the <b>pyrometer</b> is adjusted until the light intensity of the filament matches that of a black-body at the melting point of gold. This establishes the primary calibration temperature and can be {{expressed in terms of}} current through the <b>pyrometer</b> lamp. With the same current setting, the <b>pyrometer</b> is sighted on another black-body at a higher temperature. An absorbing medium of known transmission is inserted between the <b>pyrometer</b> and this black-body. The temperature of the black-body is then adjusted until a match exists between its intensity and that of the <b>pyrometer</b> filament. The true higher temperature of the black-body is then determined from Planck's Law. The absorbing medium is then removed and the current through the filament is adjusted to match the filament intensity to that of the black-body. This establishes a second calibration point for the <b>pyrometer.</b> This step is repeated to carry the calibration to higher temperatures. Now, temperatures and their corresponding <b>pyrometer</b> filament currents are known and a curve of temperature versus current can be drawn. This curve can then be extrapolated to very high temperatures.|$|E
25|$|For {{refractory}} materials (e.g. platinum, tungsten, tantalum, some carbides and nitrides, etc.) the extremely {{high melting point}} (typically considered to be above, say, 1800°C) may be determined by heating the material in a black body furnace and measuring the black-body temperature with an optical <b>pyrometer.</b> For the highest melting materials, this may require extrapolation by several hundred degrees. The spectral radiance from an incandescent body {{is known to be}} a function of its temperature. An optical <b>pyrometer</b> matches the radiance of a body under study to the radiance of a source that has been previously calibrated as a function of temperature. In this way, the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the intensity of radiation is unnecessary. However, known temperatures must be used to determine the calibration of the <b>pyrometer.</b> For temperatures above the calibration range of the source, an extrapolation technique must be employed. This extrapolation is accomplished by using Planck's law of radiation. The constants in this equation are not known with sufficient accuracy, causing errors in the extrapolation to become larger at higher temperatures. However, standard techniques have been developed to perform this extrapolation.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{measurement}} {{was initially}} done by Basset using an optical <b>pyrometer</b> {{to measure the}} intensity of the incandescent light from the sample. Colleagues at UC Berkeley were better able to utilize the black body radiation and more accurately measure the temperature. The hot spot produced by the laser also created large thermal gradients in between the portions of sample that were hit by the focused laser and those that were not. The solution to this problem is ongoing but advances have been made with the introduction of a double-sided approach.|$|E
30|$|At {{systematically}} arranged {{sampling points}} {{in each of}} these 9 plots we installed thermocouples, metal and ceramic tile <b>pyrometers,</b> calorimeters, and visually estimated preburn fuel loads and fuel consumption postburn. Methods used for each of these techniques are described below. Sampling intensity varied among the 9 burns (Table 1); additional sampling points consisting of only calorimeters and <b>pyrometers</b> were used in the burn-only and herbicide-and-burn plots so that spatial patterns of fire temperature could be examined for a separate study. In this study, we only focus on sampling points where thermocouples were deployed with calorimeters and <b>pyrometers</b> (140 sampling points).|$|R

50|$|To more {{accurately}} measure {{the temperature of}} real objects with unknown or changing emissivities, multiwavelength <b>pyrometers</b> were envisioned at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and described in 1992. Multiwavelength <b>pyrometers</b> use three or more wavelengths and mathematical manipulation of the results to attempt to achieve accurate temperature measurement even when the emissivity is unknown, changing, and different at all wavelengths.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} days of {{measurement}} of high temperatures, another factor was important, and used by Josiah Wedgwood in his <b>pyrometer.</b> The temperature reached in a process was estimated by the shrinkage of a sample of clay. The higher the temperature, the more the shrinkage. This was the only available more or less reliable method of measurement of temperatures above 1000°C. But such shrinkage is irreversible. The clay does not expand again on cooling. That is why it could be used for the measurement. But only once. It is not a thermometric material in the usual sense of the word.|$|E
25|$|Extrinsic {{fiber optic}} sensors use an optical fiber cable, {{normally}} a multi-mode one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is {{their ability to}} reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation <b>pyrometer</b> outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors {{can be used in}} the same way to measure the internal temperature of electrical transformers, where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other measurement techniques impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the Sagnac effect to detect mechanical rotation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{experiments}} with laser heating, temperature {{came from a}} calibration of laser power made with known melting points of various materials. When using the pulsed ruby laser this was unreliable due to the short pulse. YAG lasers quickly become the standard, heating for relatively long duration, and allowing observation of the sample throughout the heating process. It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical <b>pyrometer</b> to measure temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000°C to 1600°C. The first temperature measurements had a standard deviation of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of temperature measurement used in Bassett's group. The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known black body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.|$|E

30|$|Two {{recent studies}} {{compared}} values reported from <b>pyrometers</b> and calorimeters {{to a variety}} of metrics derived from time-temperature curves as measured by thermocouples (Perez and Moreno 1998, Wally et al., in press). Here, we extend these studies by comparing the predictive ability of two thicknesses of thermocouples, two types of <b>pyrometers,</b> and two sizes of calorimeters to the same time-temperature metrics as those used by Perez and Moreno (1998) and Wally et al. (in press). Because thermocouples, <b>pyrometers,</b> or calorimeters are either too expensive or too labor intensive to deploy in many management scenarios or landscape-level research projects, we also compare the time-temperature metrics to a simple field estimate of fuel consumption. Finally, we provide a cost and labor comparison of these techniques.|$|R

2500|$|In {{determining}} melting {{points of}} a refractory substance by this method, {{it is necessary}} to either have black body conditions or to know the emissivity of the material being measured. The containment of the high melting material in the liquid state may introduce experimental difficulties. Melting temperatures of some refractory metals have thus been measured by observing the radiation from a black body cavity in solid metal specimens that were much longer than they were wide. To form such a [...] cavity, a hole is drilled perpendicular to the long axis {{at the center of a}} rod of the material. These rods are then heated by passing a very large current through them, and the radiation emitted from the hole is observed with an optical <b>pyrometer.</b> The point of melting is indicated by the darkening of the hole when the liquid phase appears, destroying the black body conditions. Today, containerless laser heating techniques, combined with fast pyrometers and spectro-pyrometers, are employed to allow for precise control of the time for which the sample is kept at extreme temperatures. Such experiments of sub-second duration address several of the challenges associated with more traditional melting point measurements made at very high temperatures, such as sample vaporization and reaction with the container.|$|E
