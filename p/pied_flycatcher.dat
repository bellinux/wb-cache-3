25|$|In an anecdotal account, Simmons {{reported}} that a female marsh harrier courted a male to obtain access to food he had stored. She then took this food and fed it to chicks that had been fathered by another male. More extensive studies focused on possibly deceitful behaviour in the <b>pied</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> a species in which males may possess more than one territory. Females gain from mating with a male that has no other mates and males may try to deceive females about their mating status (mated or unmated). Females frequently visit the male, {{and if he is}} always alone on his territory he is probably unmated. Thus, by repeated sampling of male behaviour, females are usually able to avoid mating with previously mated males.|$|E

500|$|The typical {{image of}} {{migration}} is of northern landbirds, such as swallows (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics. However, many Holarctic wildfowl and finch (Fringillidae) species {{winter in the}} North Temperate Zone, in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the pink-footed goose migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the dark-eyed junco migrates from subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American goldfinch [...] from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents. [...] Some ducks, such as the garganey Anas querquedula, move completely or partially into the tropics. The European <b>pied</b> <b>flycatcher</b> Ficedula hypoleuca also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{ecological}} and evolutionary {{implications of a}} recent secondary contact between two closely related bird species: collared (Ficedula albicollis) and <b>pied</b> (F. hypoleuca) <b>flycatchers.</b> Collared flycatchers started to colonize the Swedish island of Öland, where <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> were already present, in the late 1950 s-early 1960 s. My major aims were to investigate which factors are acting against versus for long-term coexistence between the two species. Specifically, I investigated {{the relative importance of}} allopatric divergence, interspecific competition, hybridization and learning in promoting or inhibiting coexistence. The combined effects of interspecific competition and hybridization drives <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> towards local extinction in their preferred deciduous habitat. However, my results also show that <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> are better able to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. This trade-off between competitive ability and resilience in the face of harsh conditions facilitates a regional coexistence between the species. Coexistence is furthermore favoured by competition-mediated divergence in breeding habitat choice, timing of breeding and male breeding plumage colouration. Due to interspecific competition, male <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> are forced to breed in a more mixed forest type with a later peak in food abundance, which is accompanied by a divergence in breeding time between the two species. In areas shared with collared <b>flycatchers,</b> male <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> with brown plumage coloration, most divergent from that of collared flycatchers, are favoured by selection. In addition to facilitating coexistence, the observed shift in habitat occupancy increases reproductive isolation between the two species. By using cross-fostering experiments I demonstrate that natal habitat imprinting has the potential to additionally speed up habitat segregation. Finally I show that hybrid nestlings express an intermediate response to harsh environments, indicating that another aspect of ecological-based selection may be important in reproductive isolation between the species. In summary, my results show that adaptations during historic allopatry are important both in facilitating coexistence as well as in providing a foundation for further ecological divergence at secondary contact. This is of relevance today as many species are shifting their distributions in response to habitat disturbance and global warming...|$|R

40|$|Parasites may {{influence}} the outcome of interspecific competition between closely related host species through lower parasite virulence in the host with which they share the longer evolutionary history. We tested this idea by comparing the prevalence of avian malaria (Haemosporidia) lineages and their association with survival in <b>pied</b> and collared <b>flycatchers</b> (Ficedula hypoleuca and F. albicollis) breeding in a recent contact zone on the Swedish island of Oland. A nested PCR protocol amplifying haemosporidian fragments of mtDNA was used to screen the presence of malaria lineages in 1048 blood samples collected during 6 years. Competitively inferior <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> had a higher prevalence of blood parasites, including the lineages that were shared between the two flycatcher species. Multistate mark-recapture models revealed a lower survival of infected versus uninfected female <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> while no such effects were detected in male <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> or in collared flycatchers of either sex. Our results show that a comparatively new host, the collared flycatcher, appears to be less susceptible to a local northern European malarial lineage where the collared flycatchers have recently expanded their distribution. Pied flycatchers experience strong reproductive interference from collared flycatchers, and the additional impact of species-specific blood parasite effects adds to this competitive exclusion. These results {{support the idea that}} parasites can strongly influence the outcome of interspecific competition between closely related host species, but that the invading species need not necessarily be more susceptible to local parasites...|$|R

40|$|Avian blue-green eggshell {{coloration}} {{has been}} proposed as a female signal of genetic or phenotypic quality to males.

Using 5 years of data and animal models, we explored these effects in a free-living population of <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers.</b> Permanent environmental and year effects were negligible, although year environmental variance (VYear) was significant for all but one of the traits. However, we found high–moderate narrow-sense heritabilities for some colour parameters.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} heterogeneity in relative fitness of competing species {{is a key}} factor affecting the structure of communities. However, it is not intuitive why species that are ecologically similar should differ in their response to environmental changes. Here we show that two sympatric flycatchers differ in reproductive strategy and in sensitivity to harsh environment. The fitness of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), which are dominant in interference competition, is more sensitive than the fitness of <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (Ficedula hypoleuca) to the seasonal decline in environmental conditions. In order to control {{for the possibility that}} this pattern arises solely from differences in microhabitat use (i. e. a local niche differentiation), we performed a partial cross-fostering experiment of young between the two species (i. e. resulting in nests containing young of both species). Our results show that the growth of nestling <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> is less influenced by the seasonal decline in environmental conditions. We suggest that a life-history trade-off between interference competitive ability and robustness to harsh environment promotes a regional coexistence of the two species...|$|R
40|$|Speciation can {{be viewed}} as the {{formation}} of reproductive barriers between different populations. This thesis investigates patterns of natural and sexual selection shaping reproductive barriers between two hybridizing flycatchers (i. e. collared – and <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers).</b> Behaviorally driven sexual isolation depends on both the availability of conspecific mates and on discrimination ability of individuals. My results demonstrate that these two factors may also interact. Discrimination abilities may change in response to the relative frequency of two interbreeding species. The underlying reason appears to be that male <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> have a song that incorporates more elements of the song characteristics of male collared flycatchers into their own song repertoires when occurring in areas inhabited predominantly by collared flycatchers. I investigated selection pressures acting on hybrids. In migratory species, hybrid fitness might be reduced as a consequence of intermediate suboptimal migration routes (extrinsic post zygotic isolation). Comparison of stable isotope signatures of revealed that parental species have separate wintering grounds, but hybrids appear to winter at the same location as <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers.</b> A possible dominance effect in the inheritance of migration direction may hence reduce this potential cost. This interpretation is supported by the absence of a reduction in juvenile to adult survival of hybrids. By further comparing male hybrid fitness to that of the parental species, using lifehistory data, I demonstrate that hybrid males experience a moderate reduction in fitness (mainly through a sexually selected disadvantage). Sexual selection acting on male hybrids can {{play a major role in}} the speciation process because when the same characters affect assortative mating as well as hybrid fitness, reinforcement of reproductive barriers becomes more likely. Even when reproductive isolation is completed- the fate of newly formed species may be uncertain since they may strongly compete for ecological space. Long-term persistence of ecologically similar, species requires that there are spatial or temporal variation in their relative fitness. The growth of nestling <b>pied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> is less affected by harsh environmental conditions. We suggest that a regional co-existence of the two flycatcher species is due to a lifehistory trade-off between interference competitive ability and robustness to a harsh conditions. Overall, the studies in this thesis reveal the complexity of the interactions between mate choice and competition in shaping sexual signals. Furthermore, it suggests that natural selection is moderate on hybrid males and that sexual selection may have strong implications for the maintenance of species integrity...|$|R
