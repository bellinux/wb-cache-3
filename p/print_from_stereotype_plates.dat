60|$|Excepting {{those which}} have {{appeared}} as articles in periodicals {{during the last}} eight years, the essays here gathered together were originally re-published in separate volumes at long intervals. The first volume appeared in December 1857; the second in November 1863; and the third in February 1874. By the time the original editions {{of the first two}} had been sold, American reprints, differently entitled and having the essays differently arranged, had been produced; and, for economy's sake, I have since contented myself with importing successive supplies <b>printed</b> <b>from</b> the American <b>stereotype</b> <b>plates.</b> Of the third volume, however, supplies have, as they were required, been <b>printed</b> over here, <b>from</b> plates partly American and partly English. The completion of this final edition of course puts an end to this make-shift arrangement.|$|R

2500|$|Five years later, Giles {{published}} a 40-page brochure (1879) On some Translations and Mistranslations in Dr. Williams' Syllabic Dictionary that was reported extensively among English-language newspapers published in China (Aylmer 1997: 21).

50|$|The great edition, {{of which}} the text and {{apparatus}} appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself editio viii; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints <b>from</b> <b>stereotype</b> <b>plates</b> and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869-72 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, {{the testimony of the}} Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the Vatican manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend Samuel Prideaux Tregelles.|$|R

50|$|English sources often {{describe}} {{the process as}} having been invented in 1725 by William Ged, who apparently <b>stereotyped</b> <b>plates</b> for the Bible at Cambridge University before abandoning the business. However, Count Canstein had been publishing stereotyped Bibles in Germany since 1712 and an earlier form of <b>stereotyping</b> <b>from</b> flong was described in Germany in 1702. It is even possible that the process was used {{as early as the}} fifteenth century by Johannes Gutenberg or his heirs for the Mainz Catholicon. Wide application of the technique, with improvements, is attributed to Charles Stanhope in the early 1800s. Printing plates for the Bible were stereotyped in the US in 1814.|$|R
