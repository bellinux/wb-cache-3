When the load current exceeds the capability of the generator to supply both magnetization reactive power and load power the generator will immediately cease to produce <b>power.</b> <b>The</b> <b>load</b> must be removed and the {{induction generator}} restarted with either a DC source, or if present, residual magnetism in the core.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{solution}} {{is to use the}} Hall effect to create a current that flows with the fluid. The normal scheme is to place arrays of short, vertical electrodes {{on the sides of the}} duct. The first and last electrodes in the duct <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> Each other electrode is shorted to an electrode on the opposite side of the duct. These shorts of the Faraday current induce a powerful magnetic field within the fluid, but in a chord of a circle at right angles to the Faraday current. This secondary, induced field makes current flow in a rainbow shape between the first and last electrodes.|$|E

Electrons that are created on the n-type side, or created on the p-type side, [...] "collected" [...] by the junction and swept onto the n-type side, may travel through the wire, <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>load,</b> and continue through the wire until they reach the p-type semiconductor-metal contact. Here, they recombine with a hole that was either created as an electron-hole pair on the p-type side of the solar cell, or a hole that was swept across the junction from the n-type side after being created there.|$|E
50|$|Diesel rotary {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} devices (DRUPS) combine the functionality of a battery-powered or flywheel-powered UPS and a diesel generator. When mains electricity supply is within specification, an electrical generator with a mass functions as motor to store kinetic energy in an electro-mechanical flywheel. In combination with a reactor or choke coil, the electrical generator also works as active filter {{for all sorts of}} power quality problems, like harmonics, RFI, and frequency variations. When mains electricity supply fails, stored energy in the flywheel is released to drive the electrical generator, which continues to supply power without interruption. At the same time (or with some delay, for example 2 to 11 seconds, to prevent the diesel engine from starting at every incident), the diesel engine takes over from the flywheel to drive the electrical generator to make the electricity required. The electro-magnetic flywheel can continue to support the diesel generator in order to keep a stable output frequency. Typically a DRUPS will have enough fuel to <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> for days or even weeks in the event of failure of the mains electricity supply.|$|E

5000|$|The {{power supply}} {{circuits}} in electronic equipment that produce direct current (DC) {{needed by the}} device from the alternating current (AC) supplied by mains use filter capacitors to smooth the DC current. A large electric charge can remain in these capacitors after the unit is turned off, constituting a shock hazard. For example switching mode power supplies use a bridge rectifier to convert mains AC power into DC at 320 V (for 220 V mains) or 160 V (for 115 V. mains), before the voltage is reduced by the chopper. These incorporate one or more filter capacitors to smooth the pulsing output voltage from the rectifier. These must typically store enough energy at this high voltage to <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> during the zero crossings of the AC input. In addition, the capacitors in many supplies are made large enough to supply the load during AC outages lasting for a significant fraction of a second. This stored charge is often enough to deliver a lethal shock. The capacitors in high voltage DC power supplies used in devices such as lasers, x-ray machines, radio transmitters and old style CRT computer monitors and televisions can have higher, more dangerous voltages.|$|E

40|$|A single {{inductor}} dual input dual output (SIDIDO) DC-DC converter {{is proposed}} for solar energy harvesting applications. The converter supports hybrid power supplies {{from both the}} photovoltaic (PV) cells and the rechargeable battery.

When the PV cells output power is insufficient for the load, the converter will schedule the PV cells and the battery to <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> together. When the PV cells output power {{is larger than the}} load, the surplus PV cells energy is used to charge the rechargeable battery through the converter's second output.

In case of any power disruption, an offline UPS system starts <b>powering</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> to avoid blackout.

For such systems, {{the use of a}} multiple-input converter (MIC) has the advantage of simpler circuit structure and lower cost, compared to the use of several single-input converters. By decomposing converters into basic cells, namely, pulsating source cells and output filters, a set of basic rules for generating multiple-input converter topologies is proposed. Specifically, two families of multiple-input converters are systematically generated. In the first family of MICs, all the input sources can <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> simultaneously or individually.

However, the interfacial adhesion and compressive performance of UHMWPE fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FPCs) are extremely low.
