40|$|Abstract. Now it is {{generally}} recognized that informatics is {{to be based on}} its own solid foundations which should state its self-dependence and provide its self-development. In the paper we propose to use a gnoseology-based approach for developing methodological, conceptual, and formal levels of foundations. At the methodological level we describe a number of general gnoseological principles and a system of philosophical categories specifying the main features of the approach. On the conceptual level we propose to elucidate basic notions of informatics in integrity of their intensional and extensional aspects. Then we use developed notion models to construct their mathematical counterparts at the formal level. Such constructions start with formalization of the notion of data as intensionalized data. The main kinds of such data are <b>presets,</b> <b>sets,</b> and computability applicable to the described types of intensionalized data. At last, we construct hierarchy of predicate logics over introduced intensionalized data...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} <b>presetting,</b> response inhibition, <b>set</b> shifting, and a priori planning in autism: abilities that can be lumped together under the term cognitive flexibility. Cognitive flexibility is an aspect of executive functioning, which in turn is mediated by the prefrontal cortical lobes. A group of adults with high-functioning autism (HFA; n = 23) were compared with a normal control group (n = 32), by using a computerized variant of the Sternberg response bias paradigm. Contrary to the results of earlier studies, no deficit was found in <b>presetting,</b> response inhibition, <b>set</b> shifting, and a priori planning in participants with autism, even when the medication factor was taken into account. Methodological issues that could be explanatory for this difference are discussed. An additional finding was, that individuals with HFA (especially those on medication) were slow in reacting.

40|$|Egress model {{developers}} {{are in a}} difficult position. It is {{in their interest to}} develop models that are simplified representations of reality {{and at the same time}} reduce inadvertent misuse. While default values enable immediate (i. e. out-of-the-box) use of models without in-depth familiarization with modelling assumptions, defaults often represent optimistic and/or even unrealistic evacuee behaviours. In this paper, the term ‘default’ relates to a <b>preset,</b> fixed <b>setting</b> or value (or distribution) for a parameter or algorithm. Most egress models provide default values for five core behavioural elements: pre-evacuation time, travel speeds, route usage, route availability and flow conditions. These behavioural elements typically need to be represented in order for the model to function. The authors suggest that bounding default settings, rather than optimistic values, should be provided for each behavioural element. Here, a bounding default setting is a value derived from relevant empirical data that prolongs the overall evacuation time produced for a particular design. If a user wishes to decrease the conservative nature of a setting, he or she would be required to justify the modification of the bounding default value(s). This approach allows immediate model use but forces the user to modify the settings to obtain credible design scenarios...|$|R

This paper shows the influence of window glass specifications (area, U-value and Solar heat gain coefficient) and air-conditioning conditions (preset temperature for heating and cooling) onto the annual heat load of the school classroom. As a result of numerical calculations applying the Taguchi method, main points and effects to select the window glass and the air conditioning condition are shown as follows. 1) The influence of the preset temperature for heating is the largest in the area north than Osaka. 2) In the selection of glass performance in Sapporo, Morioka, Niigata, Osaka, and Fukuoka, U-value is more important for energy saving than the solar heat gain coefficient. 3) The influence of the window area is smallest in these 5 factors. 4) The low lapse rate of energy consumption would be expected from about 20 to 90 % by the best selection of window glass and the air conditioning <b>preset</b> temperature <b>setting.</b> 5) An annual heat load presumed by Taguchi-method using SN ratio considering all 5 factors becomes smaller by about 30 % than the load calculated by SMASH in the most suitable conditions...|$|R

Recent variations to the basic model proposed by the authors enable it to order state space using a subset of the input vector and to apply a local adaptation procedure that does not rely on a predefined test duration limit. Both these variations have been incorporated into a new feature map architecture that forms an integral part of an Hybrid Learning System (HLS) based on a genetic-based classifier system. Problems are represented within HLS as objects characterized by environmental features. Objects controlled by the system have <b>preset</b> targets <b>set</b> against a subset of their features. The system's objective is to achieve these targets by evolving a behavioural repertoire that efficiently explores and exploits the problem environment. Feature maps encode two types of knowledge within HLS — long-term memory traces of useful regularities within the environment and the classifier performance data calibrated against an object's feature states and targets. Self-organization of these networks constitutes non-genetic-based (experience-driven) learning within HLS.

We constructed a high-resolution physical map covering the critical deleted region in B-CLL at 13 q 14 and flanking sequences. The order and position of both genomic markers and known genes were determined precisely. Three novel genes, CLLD 6, CLLD 7, and CLLD 8, were isolated and characterized. The predicted protein sequence of CLLD 6 revealed no homology with known proteins. However, both CLLD 7 and CLLD 8 predicted proteins contain known functional domains. CLLD 7 has both an RCC 1 and a BTB domain, and could thus be involved in cell cycle regulation by chromatin remodeling.

40|$|Abstract Background Plants contain {{numerous}} Su(var) 3 - 9 homologues (SUVH) {{and related}} (SUVR) genes, {{some of which}} await functional characterization. Although there have been studies {{on the evolution of}} plant Su(var) 3 - 9 SET genes, a systematic evolutionary study including major land plant groups has not been reported. Large-scale phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses can help to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and contribute to improve genome annotation. Results Putative orthologs of plant Su(var) 3 - 9 SET protein sequences were retrieved from major representatives of land plants. A novel clustering that included most members analyzed, henceforth referred to as core Su(var) 3 - 9 homologues and related (cSUVHR) gene clade, was identified as well as all orthologous groups previously identified. Our analysis showed that plant Su(var) 3 - 9 SET proteins possessed a variety of domain organizations, and can be classified into five types and ten subtypes. Plant Su(var) 3 - 9 SET genes also exhibit a wide range of gene structures among different paralogs within a family, even in the regions encoding conserved <b>PreSET</b> and <b>SET</b> domains. We also found that the majority of SUVH members were intronless and formed three subclades within the SUVH clade. Conclusions A detailed phylogenetic analysis of the plant Su(var) 3 - 9 SET g enes was performed. A novel deep phylogenetic relationship including most plant Su(var) 3 - 9 SET genes was identified. Additional domains such as SAR, ZnF_C 2 H 2 and WIYLD were early integrated into primordial PreSET/SET/PostSET domain organization. At least three classes of gene structures had been formed before the divergence of Physcomitrella patens (moss) from other land plants. One or multiple retroposition events might have occurred among SUVH genes with the donor genes leading to the V- 2 orthologous group. The structural differences among evolutionary groups of plant Su(var) 3 - 9 SET genes with different functions were described, contributing to the design of further experimental studies. </p...|$|R

Remington began {{production of the}} M1903 in September 1941, at serial number 3,000,000, using old tooling from the Rock Island Arsenal which had been in storage since 1919. The very early rifles are almost indistinguishable from 1919-made Rock Island rifles. As the already worn tooling began to wear beyond use Remington began seeking Army approval for a continuously increasing number of changes and simplifications to both speed up manufacture and improve performance. The milled parts on the Remington M1903 were gradually replaced with stamped parts until, at about serial number 3,330,000, the Army and Remington recognized that a new model name was appropriate. Other features of the M1903, such as high-grade walnut stocks with finger grooves, were replaced with less expensive but serviceable substitutes. Most milled parts made by Remington were marked with an [...] "R". M1903 production was discontinued {{in favor of the}} M1903A3. The most noticeable visual difference in the M1903A3 was the replacement of the barrel-mounted rear sight with a smaller, simpler aperture rear sight mounted on the rear of the receiver; it was primarily adopted in order to speed familiarization by soldiers already trained on the M1 Garand, which had a similar sighting system. However, the leaf spring providing tension to the elevation adjustment on the new aperture sight tended to weaken with continued use over time, causing the rifle to lose its <b>preset</b> range elevation <b>setting.</b> Other modifications included a new stamped cartridge follower; ironically, the rounded edges of the new design largely alleviated the 'fourth-round jam' complaints of the earlier machined part.
