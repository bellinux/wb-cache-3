The FEAF deployment order specified {{that the two}} RB-17 aircraft be equipped with normal armament insofar as practicable, not {{to interfere with the}} <b>photographic</b> <b>capability</b> of the aircraft. This posed a problem for the Flight, since the RB-17s had been flying peacetime missions and were not equipped for combat. However, the 6204th found the necessary gunners and equipment, made the modifications to the aircraft, and by late August 1950 the detachment began flying photo-mapping missions over Korea. By the end of November 1950, it had photographed the entire North Korean area at least once and re-photographed some areas as far north as weather conditions permitted. By early December the detachment returned to Clark AB and resumed the flight's mapping program in the Philippine area.|$|E
50|$|The company, Nippon Kogaku KK ('Japan Optics'), {{was formed}} in 1917 with the merger of three Japanese optical {{manufacturers}} to produce precision optical glass. In 1925 the brand expanded to produce the first microscope with a revolving nosepiece and interchangeable objectives - the Joico microscope. Over {{the next few decades}} the microscopy division progressed considerably with the introduction of groundbreaking polarising and stereomicroscopes in addition to metrology products for measuring and inspection. Nikon launched the Optiphot and Labophot microscopes in the 1970s and established the CF Optical system. The 1980s saw more than 80 new products, including the inverted Diaphot microscope, which was at the forefront of IVF techniques. The introduction of the Eclipse range of infinity optics in the 1990s was a radical departure from traditional microscope design. This in-house expertise in optical technologies has been instrumental in differentiating Nikon from its competitors. CFI60 optics offer advantages for both industrial and biological applications as lenses generally have higher numerical apertures (N.A.s) and longer working distances than comparable lenses and provide increased resolution, greater light-gathering capability and high performance in confocal imaging. The infinity optical system also has the benefit that the distance between the objective and the eyepiece tube is not fixed, allowing a variety of imaging modules to be inserted into the light path without any compromise in optical quality. This has allowed microscopes to be transformed into versatile imaging workstations that provide users with instant access to several imaging methods. Using a Nikon Diaphot microscope, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be successfully cloned from an adult cell. Nikon's <b>photographic</b> <b>capability</b> has extended to a series of digital camera systems optimized for microscopy-based applications enabling the digital transfer of images.|$|E

40|$|The {{utilization}} of high resolution image processing allows forensic analysts and visualization scientists to assist detectives by enhancing field photographs, and {{by providing the}} tools and training to increase the quality and usability of field photos. Through the use of digitized photographs and computerized enhancement software, field evidence can be obtained and processed as `evidence ready`, even in poor lighting and shadowed conditions or darkened rooms. These images, which are most often unusable when taken with standard camera equipment, can be shot in the worst of photographic condition and be processed as usable evidence. Visualization scientists have taken the use of digital photographic image processing and moved the process of crime scene photos into the technology age. The use of high resolution technology will assist law enforcement in making better use of crime scene photography and positive identification of prints.

40|$|Active lenses {{today have}} a variety of uses from <b>photographic</b> <b>capabilities</b> in small mobile devices to {{applications}} in engineering. They provide faster response times and higher portability and efficiency when compared to their traditional lens assemblies. For this project, I have evaluated two different methods of active lens actuation: using an electromagnetic actuator and using an electroactive polymer. From testing each method's abilities, {{it was found that the}} electromagnetic actuator, though robust in design poses issues over long-time use. The electromagnetic actuator was able to generate a focal power range of 11. 9 to 19. 2 diopters (52 to 84 mm focal length range), but a high power consumption led to problems with heating the internal components of the active lens assembly. In the EAP method, a lower power consumption proved to be a viable option for actuation, and through testing and calculation, it was determined to be useful in application. However, a proposed efficient design must be further explored. by Christopher Kwok. Thesis: S. B., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2016.

40|$|The first {{permanent}} {{photograph was}} created in 1826 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. To do this, he coated light sensitive chemicals on a metal plate and exposed it in a camera obscura (a box with a small hole; a “pinhole camera”). Once the plate was properly exposed to light, he used more chemicals to stop the plate from being light sensitive and make the image permanent on the plate. Throughout the years, many photographers and chemists used many different chemicals, materials, and procedures to create permanent and beautiful images (i. e. Daguerreotypes, Calotypes, Heliographs, etc). With each new process, the previous processes became obsolete because the newer ways were cheaper, quicker, and more accessible to nonprofessionals. As a photographer who started in film (and having almost no knowledge in chemistry), the antique photographic processes intrigued me. At The University of Rhode Island, the only photography courses are Digital Photography and Black and White Film Photography (using silver halide negatives and gelatin silver prints). Knowing {{that there are more}} than just two photographic processes, I wanted to expand my photographic options and also learn more about the science of photography. Each antique (now called “alternative”) process creates a different effect than that of black and white film and digital, and they all have their own unique aesthetic. This semester, I have worked with and researched different processes and created images using these processes. In doing so I now have experience with and access to more processes, I have a greater understanding of the chemicals used in photography and the science of photography, and I can expand my photographic aesthetic using each of these processes. This project also dovetails with my English major, because I have written a simplified how-to guide for the processes that I worked with so more people can have access to alternative process photography. Through this project, I have found a new love for a different medium of photography, I have expanded my <b>photographic</b> <b>capabilities,</b> and I will certainly be incorporating alternative process photography into my future work...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{creation}} of images of imaginary solar systems my thesis will explore the development of space through the processes of collograph and four-color intaglio-type inversion printmaking with painting. I am interested {{in the possibility of}} what we know and can touch, so I create my own visual universes for exploration. Kasimir Malevich influenced my personal exploration. Malevich created his own movement of Suprematism, which enabled him to construct images that had no reference at all to reality. Suprematism refers to the pure feeling in art over art 2 ̆ 7 s objectivity. I began treating the surface of the imprinted paper by creating depth out of translucent and opaque levels of color. The visual imagery that I supply the viewer with is an intricate knotting of fluid shapes, much like Irish calligraphy and scroll work, {{in order to create a}} texture that depicts a solar system. Depicting the stars use to be considered a scientific and artistic endeavor. My thesis is my artistic interpretation of an unknown galaxy in which the viewer can immerse themselves in movement, depth, imagination and the Sublime. By using simple shapes in order to construct a fictitious environment, I am inviting the everyday viewer to contemplate my space. Deeply embossed collographs become landscape surfaces for painting. The choice of colors results in pulling some shapes forward and pushing others back to create atmospheric perspective. In doing so, I am able to create 3 -demenional images on a 2 -dementional surface. The technique of Four-Color Intaglio-Type inversion permits creating images from photographs of the collographic boards. Adobe Photoshop will enable manipulation of size, color and saturation levels of the images, which will draw attention to key areas from the original collographic plates. This replicates the way that a telescope with <b>photographic</b> <b>capabilities</b> would function in deep space. This dynamic artistic idea translates the high relief texture of Vincent Van Gogh 2 ̆ 7 s paintings to printmaking. This idea was also inspired by the simple geometric forms and organic lines found in the paintings of Kasimir Malevich. My initial experiments suggest that the exploration of these techniques and media will be productive in {{the creation}} and expression of the solar systems I envision...|$|R

The purpose of this thesis was to make a flight test comparison of the <b>photographic</b> resolution <b>capabilities</b> of one miniature camera, the 70 X 70 mm format P- 2, with a standard Air Force K- 17 cameras. Two lenses were used with each camera: 80 mm and 150 mm, f/ 2. 8 Schneider Xenotars with the P- 2 and 6 " and 12 " Kodak Aero Ektars with the K- 17. The primary objective was to determine whether, in spite of the reduced image size (scale), the miniature camera can at least match the standard camera in information gathering capability. Since the emulsion plays an important part in the system, several different types were considered in detail. [TRUNCATED...|$|R
40|$|Background This {{descriptive}} explorative {{study had}} two aims. Firstly, {{to survey the}} use of mobile phones by health professionals for photographing patients, their body parts/organs or confidential patient information in the clinical setting of a DHB. The second aim was to explore the perceptions and attitudes of health professionals {{in regard to the}} DHB’s policy on photographic recordings. It was hoped that results would show whether there was a need for update of local policy, which would in turn provide clarification of the responsibilities that health professionals have in maintaining the confidentiality of patient images on personal mobile devices. Overseas evidence suggests that ownership and use of mobile phones for their <b>photographic</b> <b>capabilities</b> in the healthcare setting is high. However, until now, no research has been conducted in New Zealand. The clinical mobile phone photography practices of health professionals in New Zealand has major implications for maintaining the confidentiality of the patient record and the integrity of the medical photography profession. Method An online survey comprising 36 questions was distributed via email to all nursing, medical and allied health staff members employed at the local DHB. The survey was open for responses for a three week period from late September to mid October 2015. Key findings 951 completed responses were received. A third of respondents (33. 1 %, n= 306) had taken photographs of patient or patient information using a mobile phone yet written consent was obtained by only 28. 4 % (n= 87) of respondents. When consent was obtained, verbal was the most popular method (85. 9 %, n= 263) with 40. 8 % (n= 125) of respondents rarely or never recording in the patient’s notes that they took photographs. The most common location for storing images taken personally was on the mobile phone itself (45. 7 %, n= 106). Respondents were more likely to take non-identifiable images than identifiable images on their mobile phones. Them most common reason for taking photographs of patient or patient information was for input from another health professional (26. 5 %, n= 252), 17. 3 % (n= 164) for education/training purposes and 9. 5 % (n= 90) for presentations. Three-quarters of respondents were either unaware of local policy regarding photographic recordings or were aware of it but had not read it. The majority of respondents thought that the patient owned images taken on health professionals’ mobile phones (65. 2 %, n= 691). Conclusion Despite being the first study of its kind in New Zealand, evidence suggests that a proportion of health professionals are utilising mobile phone technology to perform photography in the clinical setting. Most health professionals are aware of their responsibilities surrounding maintenance of patient privacy. However, as mobile phone photography is becoming increasingly common in patient care, evidence here suggests that not all health professionals understand the value they hold and are unaware of their responsibilities for managing the safe storage and movement of these images. Update of local policy in line with professional medical photography guidelines is required to match advancement in technological capabilities available to health professionals. This would improve the integrity and safe handling of images that form part of the confidential patient record...|$|R
