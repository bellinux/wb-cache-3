2500|$|The UK {{copyright}} originally expired {{at the end}} of 1987 (50 {{years after}} Barrie's death) but later revived in 1995 when legislation was changed following the directive to harmonise copyright laws within the EU, which extended the copyright term to 70 years after the author's death. However, in 1988, former Prime Minister James Callaghan sponsored an amendment to a Parliamentary Bill granting the hospital a right to royalties in perpetuity for any performance, publication, broadcast [...] of the play or adaptation of the play. The bill does not grant the hospital full intellectual property rights over the work such as creative control over the use of the material or the right to refuse permission to use it. It [...] does not cover the Peter Pan section of The Little White Bird, which predates the play and is not therefore an [...] "adaptation" [...] of it. The exact phrasing is in section 301 of, and Schedule 6 to, the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988:301. The provisions of Schedule 6 have effect for conferring on trustees {{for the benefit of the}} Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London, a right to a royalty in respect of the public performance, commercial publication, broadcasting or inclusion in a cable <b>programme</b> <b>service</b> of the play 'Peter Pan' by Sir James Matthew Barrie, or of any adaptation of that work, notwithstanding that copyright in the work expired on 31 December 1987.|$|E

Although this was achieved through the licences granted to cable operators, they were usually just the local distributors of national broadcasts, and the Authority's dealings were in practice with those who provided the programme channels.

50|$|Whilst the {{original}} service provided by TWW from St Hilary {{had to carry}} a mix of content for viewers {{on each side of}} the Bristol Channel, the west and north of Wales were served by other VHF transmitters which carried a more specific Welsh <b>programme</b> <b>service</b> branded Teledu Cymru. TWW had acquired the licence to broadcast to the west and north of Wales following the commercial failure of WWN (Wales West and North) which originally held a separate franchise licence for a much larger but, critically, less densely populated part of Wales. Following the acquisition of WWN, a second VHF transmitter (using Ch7) was added at St Hilary in 1965 to effectively extend the ex WWN transmitter network into SE Wales thus permitting programmes of specific interest in Wales to be broadcast exclusively to Wales whilst running a separate schedule for English viewers on Ch 10. This was the first significant step in providing two distinct and separate programme services for Wales and for West and effectively established TWW's area as a 'dual region' during the last few years of their tenure.|$|E
