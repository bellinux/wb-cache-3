40|$|Next to good hemocompatibility {{performance}} of new medical devices, {{which has to}} be tested according to the ISO 10993 - 4, the detection of pyrogen-contaminated devices plays a pivotal role for safe device application. During blood contact with pyrogen-contaminated devices, intense inflammatory and hemostatic reactions are feared. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the influence of pyrogenic contaminations on stents according to the ISO 10993 - 4. The pyrogens of different origins like lipopolysaccharides (LPS), purified lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or zymosan were used. These pyrogens were dried on stents or dissolved and circulated in a Chandler-loop model for 90 min at 37 degrees C with human blood. Before and after circulation, parameters of the hemostatic system including coagulation, platelets, complement and leukocyte activation were investigated. The complement system was activated by LPS isolated from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and by LTA. Leukocyte activation was triggered by LPS isolated from K. pneumoniae, LTA and zymosan, whereas coagulation and platelet activation were only slightly influenced. Our data indicate that pyrogen-contaminated devices lead to an alteration in the hemostatic response when compared to depyrogenized devices. Therefore, <b>pyrogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> should be performed prior to hemocompatibility tests according to ISO 10993 - 4 in order to exclude hemostatic activation induced by pyrogen contaminations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an in vitro test system for {{pyrogenic}} substances. Three clones derived from human monocytoid cell lines, which were selected by their high sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were assessed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Their response to pyrogen-containing samples was compared with that in a Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay and the rabbit pyrogen test. We show here that the induction of TNF in these clones is a valid in vitro alternative to determine endotoxin in commercial preparations requiring <b>pyrogenicity</b> <b>testing.</b> Cell clones derived from Mono Mac 6 (MM 6 2 H 8 and MM 6 4 B 5) responded to sub-ng/ml concentrations of complete rough-strain and smooth-strain LPS, to ng/ml concentrations of diphosphoryl-lipid A, and to microgram/ml concentrations of monophosphoryl-lipid A and to detoxified LPS. Cells reacted to > or = 1 microgram/ml lipoteichoic acid by TNF production, and were relatively insensitive to toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) and to muramyl dipeptide adjuvant peptide. The reaction pattern of a clone derived from THP- 1 (THP- 1 1 G 3) was in general, similar to that of the MM 6 clones, except that THP- 1 1 G 3 failed to react to diphosphoryl-lipid A. When tested on commercial samples destined for parenteral use, there was a close correlation between a sensitive Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test and the cell culture test on the one hand, and between the pyrogen test and the cell culture test on the other hand. The data suggest that this cell-based test is able to recognize pyrogens derived from gram-negative organisms in test samples with appropriate sensitivity and specificity. This test appears to be able to eliminate some of the false-positive data obtained in the LAL test...|$|E
40|$|The {{urgency of}} the {{transition}} to replace animal tests in safety assessment of chemicals and cosmetics was triggered by societal resistance to animal testing (Rowan, 2007) and the scientific dispute concerning the value of animal testing (Olson et al., 2000). Since the 1980 s the European Union (EU) has been developing policies to reduce an-imal studies. However, these policies have not been very successful, since only a few regulatory safety assessments in animals (among which the Draize eye test, skin senti-sation <b>test,</b> <b>pyrogenicity</b> <b>test</b> and batch potency test tetanus vaccine) have been (partly) replaced by innovative methods. These few 'successful' replacement processes were laborious and took decades...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen 6 -O-acyl-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamines (6 -O-acyl-MDPs), {{including}} four inactive D-isoasparagine and L-isoglutamine analogs, were <b>tested</b> for their <b>pyrogenicity</b> and immunopotentiating activity to stimulate primary humoral and cellular immune responses in guinea pigs to a model protein antigen, ovalbumin, when administered in various vehicles. Among them, derivatives whose muramic acid residue was substituted by alpha-branched (and beta-hydroxylated) higher fatty acids at the carbon- 6 position, especially 6 -O-(2 -tetradecylhexadecanoyl) -MDP (B 3 O-MDP) and, {{to a lesser}} extent, 6 -O-(3 -hydroxy- 2 -docosylhexacosanoyl) -MDP (BH 48 -MDP) and its L-serine analog [BH 48 -MDP(L-Ser) ], were found to exert strong adjuvant activity in both the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity and the stimulation of circulating precipitating antibody levels when combined with nonirritating vehicles (liposomes, squalene-in-water emulsion, and phosphate-buffered saline). These vehicles did not efficiently support the adjuvant activity of MDP, the parent molecule of the above lipophilic derivatives. <b>Pyrogenicity</b> <b>tests</b> showed that introduction of alpha-branched higher fatty acid groups but not of straight, long-chain fatty acids at the 6 -position of the muramic acid residue resulted in marked decrease of the pyrogenicity inherent to MDP via intravenous administration...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli {{endotoxin}} {{injected into}} CMRL mice in a 23 ° environment produced a fall in rectal temperature at 3 hr post-injection. Endotoxin given i. v. produced a greater hypothermia than if injected i. p. Pretreatment of the mice with pertussis vaccine, BCG or Corynebacterium parvum substantially increased their responsiveness to endotoxin. SJL mice were {{more sensitive to}} endotoxin than CMRL mice and showed hypothermias as great as - 4 · 9 °. Endotoxins from Salmonella typhi and Bordetella pertussis had a similar activity to Esch. coli endotoxin, but Shigella flexneri was less active. There was {{no evidence to support}} the idea that endotoxin responsiveness depends on the mice having previous environmental exposure to the corresponding bacterium e. g. in the gut flora. The relative endotoxic activities of 1 batch each of pertussis, TAB and cholera vaccines were assayed by the hypothermias produced in SJL mice. Cholera vaccine was twice as potent as TAB which was 4 times more active than pertussis. The index of precision of the mouse hypothermia test (0 · 32 - 0 · 65) is not inferior to that of the standard rabbit <b>pyrogenicity</b> <b>test</b> (about 0 · 6). The test should be useful for comparing the endotoxic activities of preparations such as bacterial vaccines which may be rich in endotoxin...|$|R
40|$|The lipopolysaccharides {{and free}} lipid A from several strains of Rhodospirillaceae were assayed {{comparatively}} {{with those of}} Enterobacteriaceae {{in a number of}} biological tests. Free lipid A's from Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa and Rhodospirillum tenue exhibited strong serological cross-reactions {{with each other and with}} free lipid A from Salmonella. Lipid A's from Rhodopseudomonas viridis and Rhodopseudomonas palustris, although cross-reacting with each other, did not do so with either the lipid A of R. gelatinosa or R. tenue or with that of Salmonella. The presence or absence of the above cross-reactions agreed with corresponding similarities or differences in the chemical structure of the lipid A preparations. The lipopolysaccharide of R. gelatinosa was highly toxic for adrenalectomized mice and pyrogenic for rabbits; however, it exhibited no anti-complementary activity. The activity of the R. tenue lipopolysaccharide was very low in both the lethality and <b>pyrogenicity</b> <b>tests.</b> Its corresponding free lipid A also exhibited low pyrogenic activity; however, its lethal toxicity for adrenalectomized mice was considerably higher than that of the intact parent lipopolysaccharide. Both intact lipopolysaccharide and, unexpectedly, the free lipid A exhibited no anti-complementary activity. The lipopolysaccharides of R. viridis and R. palustris were virtually nontoxic for mice and nonpyrogenic for rabbits. Both lipopolysaccharides were highly potent in their interaction with complement. They therefore represent the first example of nontoxic lipopolysaccharides exhibiting high anti-complementary activity...|$|R
40|$|Recently, we {{developed}} a high yield production process for outer membrane particles from genetically modified bacteria, called Generalized Modules of Membrane Antigens (GMMA), and the corresponding simple two step filtration purification, enabling economic manufacture of these particles for use as vaccines. Using a Shigella sonnei strain that was genetically modified to produce penta-acylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with reduced endotoxicity and to maintain the virulence plasmid encoding for the immunodominant O antigen component of the LPS, scale up of the process to GMP pilot scale was straightforward and gave high yields of GMMA with required purity and consistent results. GMMA were formulated with Alhydrogel and were highly immunogenic in mice and rabbits. In mice, a single immunization containing 29 ng protein and 1. 75 ng of O antigen elicited substantial anti-LPS antibody levels. As GMMA contain LPS and lipoproteins, assessing potential reactogenicity was a key aspect of vaccine development. In an in vitro monocyte activation test, GMMA from the production strain showed a 600 -fold lower stimulatory activity than GMMA with unmodified LPS. Two in vivo tests confirmed the low potential for reactogenicity. We established a modified rabbit <b>pyrogenicity</b> <b>test</b> based on the European Pharmacopoeia pyrogens method but using intramuscular administration of the full human dose (100 μg of protein). The vaccine elicited an average temperature rise of 0. 5 °C within four hours after administration, which was considered acceptable and showed that the test is able to detect a pyrogenic response. Furthermore, a repeat dose toxicology study in rabbits using intramuscular (100 μg/dose), intranasal (80 μg/dose), and intradermal (10 μg/dose) administration routes showed good tolerability of the vaccine by all routes and supported its suitability for use in humans. The S. sonnei GMMA vaccine is now in Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trials...|$|R

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendapatkan informasi mengenai karakteristik praklinis 99 mTc-kanamisin meliputi toksisitas, sterilitas, pirogenitas, dan biodistribusi. Uji toksisitas dilakukan pada 5 ekor mencit yang diinjeksi 99 mTc-kanamisin secara intra vena ekor, dilanjutkan dengan pengamatan sampai dengan 24 jam setelah injeksi. Hasil pengamatan menunjukkan bahwa 99 mTc-kanamisin tidak bersifat toksik. Uji sterilitas dengan metode inokulasi 99 mTc-kanamisin secara langsung pada medium {{nutrient}} agar dan tioglikolat cair menunjukkan bahwa 99 mTc-kanamisin bersifat steril. Uji pirogenitas pada 3 ekor kelinci yang diinjeksi 99 mTc-kanamisin secara intra vena pada telinga menunjukkan bahwa suhu total respon sebesar 2, 9 oC, yang berarti 99 mTc-kanamisin belum bebas pirogen. Biodistribusi 99 mTc-kanamisin dilakukan pada mencit yang tidak diinfeksi dan yang diinfeksi dengan bakteri Escherichia coli dan Staphylococcus aureus secara intra-muskular pada 24 jam sebelum injeksi 99 mTc-kanamisin. Beberapa sampel organ dan jaringan mencit diambil pada interval waktu 30, 60, dan 180 menit pasca injeksi 99 mTc-kanamisin secara intravena melalui ekor mencit, menunjukkan bahwa 99 mTc-kanamisin terakumulasi di dalam organ target yaitu otot paha kiri. Nilai rasio otot paha kiri terhadap otot paha kanan yang diperoleh sebesar 3, 63 dan 5, 64, masing-masing untuk E. coli dan S. aureus. Radiofarmaka 99 mTc-kanamisin bersifat tidak toksik, steril, mengandung pirogen, terdistribusi di dalam tubuh mencit dengan baik, dan diekskresikan secara cepat dari dalam tubuh mencit melalui ginjal mulai 30 menit pasca injeksi, baik pada mencit yang diinfeksi bakteri maupun mencit yang tidak diinfeksi bakteri.

Sterility testing of radiopharmaceutical 99 mTc-kanamycin conducted with direct inoculation on Nutrient Agar and liquid Thioglicolat medium showed that the radiopharmaceutical was sterile. <b>Pyrogenicity</b> <b>test</b> conducted in 3 rabbits injected with the radiopharmaceutical 99 mTc-kanamycin showed that the total temperature response was 2. 9 oC, that means that the radiopharmaceutical was not free from pyrogen. Biodistribution of 99 mTc-kanamycin at intervals of 30, 60, and 180 minutes post intravenously injection through the tail of mice, infected with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus intramuscularly 24 hours earlier, showed that 99 mTc-kanamycin accumulates in the target organ of the left thigh muscle. The ratio values of left to right thigh muscle were 3. 63 and 5. 64 for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Radiopharmaceutical 99 mTc-kanamycin was not toxic, sterile, pyrogen, distributed in the body of mice, and were rapidly excreted from the body through the kidneys starting 30 minutes post injection, both in bacterials infected or without bacterials infected mice.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the properties of}} Staphylococcus aureus contributing to its pyrogenicity, we compared, in human monocytes, endogenous pyrogen production stimulated by heat-killed S. aureus with that stimulated by purified S. aureus cell walls or by particulate peptidoglycan prepared from the same strain. Peptidoglycan, but not the purified cell wall preparation, was found comparable to S. aureus as an endogenous pyrogen stimulus. This finding {{was associated with a}} more effective monocyte phagocytosis of S. aureus and peptidoglycan as compared with that of purified cell walls. Lysostaphin digestion of peptidoglycan markedly reduced its <b>pyrogenicity.</b> To <b>test</b> whether the chemical composition of the ingested particles is important, latex particles were tested as possible stimuli for monocyte endogenous pyrogen release.
