The Break key/Pause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.|$|E

40|$|SCALE UP! is an {{exploration}} in hand-printed surface patterns {{in relation to}} scale. The aim is to make hand-printed large-scale surface patterns, by challenging {{the limitations of the}} <b>printing</b> <b>screen,</b> the fabric width and the circle as a shape; with the circle as a pattern and structure to visualise it, by colours and bleed-through. The project is based in an interest in working large-scale, in the area of <b>screen</b> <b>printing.</b> We often see printed full-width fabrics where the repeat fills the whole width. However, a possibility to take it one step further and not be limited by the width of the fabric or the size of the <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> was seen. Why be satisfied with the size of a full-width pattern and see the <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> as a frame to keep within? The striving to challenge the size of the <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> and the fabric width were the basis of the project.

50|$|Screen {{frequency}} {{is determined}} by the type of paper the image is printed on. An absorbent paper surface, uncoated recycled paper for instance, lets ink droplets spread (dot gain)—so requires a more open <b>printing</b> <b>screen.</b> Input resolution can therefore be reduced to minimize file size without loss in quality, as long as the quality factor of 2 is maintained. This is easily determined by doubling the line frequency. For example, printing on an uncoated paper stock often limits <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> frequency to no more than 120 lpi, therefore, a quality factor of 2 is achieved with images of 240 ppi.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{integration}} of blind people into society, suitable conditions should be provided for them. The expansion of Braille (BR) use could serve the purpose. Depending on the materials used for Braille, it can be formed or printed in different ways: embossing, <b>screen</b> <b>printing,</b> thermoforming, digital printing. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the effect of thermal properties of <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks and inks with thermo-powder on the qualitative parameters of Braille. <b>Screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks and inks with thermo-powder were chosen for the research. Carrying out the qualitative analysis of printouts with Braille, the thermal stability was evaluated by analyzing the thermograms obtained with derivatograph Q- 1500. This paper presents the findings of the thermogravimetric (TG), differential thermogravimetric (DTG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of printouts printed on paperboard Plike and using traditional <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks and <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks with thermo-powder. Based on the testing findings it is determined that thermal stability of printouts printed with thermo-powder ink is higher than <b>printed</b> with <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks. It is determined that the appropriate temperature range of <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks with thermo-powder drying is 98 ºC – 198 ºC because in this case better relief of Braille dots is obtained.

40|$|For this research, {{the image}} quality {{attributes}} of offset <b>printing</b> versus <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> methods for providing high-resolution premium products, such as plastic key chains, were investigated. The three substrates investigated were Polypropylene (PP), Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and Polyester (PET). Optical properties, such as dot gain, solid ink density, ink trapping, tone reproduction and print contrast, were analyzed through color measurement and visual evaluation. In addition, the end-use applications were tested using adhesion tests, water resistance tests, and heat resistance tests {{to make certain}} that the final product achieve the best quality print and meets end-use requirements. The results of this research showed that offset printing can be used in place of <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> to produce premium products. According to the research results, solid ink density, ink trapping, and <b>print</b> contrast on <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheets show better results than offset printed sheets. However, the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheets had lower dot gain results than the offset printed sheets. Although the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheets appeared to give better optical properties than the offset printed sheet, the tone reproduction curves showed that the offset printed sheet had better visual image quality than the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet. The results of the survey, which asked candidates to compare two images (<b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet vs. offset printed sheet), showed {{that the majority of the}} people chose the offset printed sheet more often than the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet. This also supports the results of the tone reproduction curves which show that the offset printed sheet produced a higher image quality than the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet. The results of the application tests determined that the offset printed sheet withstood all three tests while the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet failed the water resistance tests and the adhesion tests...|$|R
