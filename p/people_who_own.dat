5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The statements of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>own</b> the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt {{on the day of}} the incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, and had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E

25|$|Due to no {{funding from}} the state of Georgia and its limited funding from Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties, MARTA has {{struggled}} for many years to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area. As a result, MARTA has gained a notorious reputation throughout the metro Atlanta area for being ineffective and inconvenient. Many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>own</b> cars avoid using the system altogether while residents in suburban areas usually drive their car to a MARTA rail station (instead of using bus service) if their job is near an adjacent one. MARTA's financial structure (being tied to a 1% sales tax) has forced the agency to cut services during times of economic depression, further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services.|$|E
500|$|The song Grampa was {{supposed}} to sing in his flashback, showing how he posed as a German cabaret singer in World War II, was [...] "Lili Marlene" [...] by Marlene Dietrich. The staff could not get the rights to it because, according to the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>own</b> the song, [...] "everybody makes fun of it". Much of the flashback was pitched by Conan O'Brien. The episode marks the first appearance of Superintendent Chalmers. The staff wanted to introduce a boss for Skinner, and Wallace Wolodarsky pitched his name. Much of the dialogue and interactions between Skinner and Chalmers were ad-libbed by Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria.|$|E

Another time, Allen gagged that a girl could have found a better husband in a cemetery.

2500|$|Some {{developers}} publishing on Google Play {{have been}} sued for patent infringement by [...] "patent trolls", <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>own</b> broad or vaguely worded patents {{that they use}} to target small developers. If the developer manages to successfully challenge the initial assertion, the [...] "patent troll" [...] changes the claim of the violation in order to accuse the developer of having violated a different assertion in the patent. This situation continues until the case goes into the legal system, which can have substantial economic costs, prompting some developers to settle. In February 2013, Austin Meyer, a flight simulator game developer, was sued for having used a copy-protection system in his app, a system that he said [...] "Google gave us! And, of course, this is what Google provides to everyone else that is making a game for Android!" [...] Meyer claimed that Google would not assist in the lawsuit, and he stated {{that he would not}} settle the case. His battle with the troll continued for several years, uploading a video in June 2016 discussing that he was then being sued for uploading his app to Google Play, because [...] "the patent troll apparently owns the [...] of the Google Play Store itself". Android Authority wrote that [...] "This scenario has played out against many other app developers for many years", and have prompted discussions over [...] "a larger issue at stake", in which developers stop making apps out of fear of patent problems.|$|E

To great numbers Europe looks from this shore like a safe refuge from the American summer problem; and yet I am not sure that it is altogether so; for it is not enough merely to go to Europe; one has to choose where to go when one has got there. A European city is certainly always more tolerable than an American city, but one cannot very well pass the summer in Paris, or even in London.

60|$|Thus, {{in a form}} of {{experience}} which is almost as common as ordinary dreaming, {{we see that the}} semi-somnolent self possesses a faculty not always given to the waking self. Compared with my own waking self, for instance, my half-asleep self is almost a personality of genius. He can create visions that the waking self can remember, but cannot originate, and cannot trace to any memory of waking impressions. These apparently trivial things thus point to the existence of almost wholly submerged potentialities in a mind so everyday, commonplace, and, so to speak, superficial as mine. This fact suggests that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>own</b> such minds, the vast majority of mankind, ought not to make themselves the measure of the potentialities of minds of a rarer class, say that of Jeanne d'Arc. The secret of natures like hers cannot be discovered, so long as scientific men incapable even of ordinary 'visualising' (as Mr. Galton found) make themselves the canon or measure of human nature.|$|E
60|$|It {{is alleged}} by some, {{that we do}} take off all the wool they bring us, and that we could and would take it all, if they would bring it all. To this I answer; if the Irish people do not bring it all to us, it is either {{that it is too}} far for the poor <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>own</b> the wool to bring it to the south and east coast of Ireland, there being no markets in the west and north-west parts of that island, where they could sell it; and the farmers and sheep-breeders are no merchants, nor have they {{carriage}} for so long a journey; but either the public ought to appoint proper places whether it shall be carried, and where they would receive money for it at a certain rate; or erect markets where those who deal in wool might come to buy, and where those who have it to sell would find buyers.|$|E
60|$|I {{have met}} with a Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, a gentleman of very ancient descent, but who hath in time past been in difficulties, nor do I know if his affairs are yet well redd. Birrenswork says that he {{believes}} he was very familiar with your father, whom he states to have been called Ralph Latimer of Langcote Hall, in Westmoreland; and he mentioned family affairs, which it may be of the highest importance to you to be acquainted with; but as he seemed to decline communicating them to me, I could not civilly urge him thereanent. Thus much I know, that Mr. Herries had his own share in the late desperate and unhappy matter of 1745, and was in trouble about it, although that is probably now over. Moreover, {{although he did not}} profess the Popish religion openly, he had an eye that way. And both of these are reasons why I have hesitated to recommend him to a youth who maybe hath not altogether so well founded his opinions concerning Kirk and State, that they might not be changed by some sudden wind of doctrine. For I have observed ye, Master Darsie, to be rather tinctured with the old leaven of prelacy--this under your leave; and although God forbid that you should be in any manner disaffected to the Protestant Hanoverian line, yet ye have ever loved to hear the blawing, blazing stories which the Hieland gentlemen tell of those troublous times, which, if it were their will, they had better pretermit, as tending rather to shame than to honour. It is come to me also by a sidewind, as I may say, that you have been neighbouring more than was needful among some of the pestilent sect of Quakers--a <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>own</b> neither priest nor king, nor civil magistrate, nor the fabric of our law, and will not depone either IN CIVILIBUS or CRIMINALIBUS, be the loss to the lieges what it may. Anent which heresies, it were good ye read 'The Snake in the Grass' or 'The Foot out of the Snare,' being both well-approved tracts, touching these doctrines.|$|E
