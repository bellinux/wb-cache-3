30|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that a three-phase (symmetric) short-circuit fault provokes the highest fault current among all possible faults, since {{it will cause}} the most drastic decrease of the system impedance. In order to ensure safe operation, the maximum current and electrodynamic withstand capabilities of electrical equipment are primarily designed according to this situation. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} simulate the behaviour of the power system under three-phase short-circuit fault. The symmetric faults were initialised at three potential locations marked as Fault 1 (132  kV), Fault 2 (33  kV) and Fault 3 (275  kV), which represent <b>prospective</b> <b>faults</b> occurring at the industrial branch, the domestic branch, and the transmission system, respectively (see Fig. 1). Five positions for the installation of SFCLs were proposed as shown in Fig. 1, namely at: (1) the integrating point between the conventional power plant and the upstream power grid (Location 1), (2) the interconnection between the wind farm and the port of domestic branch (Location 2), (3) the industrial loads branch (Location 3), (4) the domestic loads branch (Location 4), and (5) the bus-tie coupling the two distribution networks (Location 5).|$|R
40|$|IEEE High voltage {{direct current}} grids {{will require the}} {{development}} of dc protections that provide fast fault isolation and minimal disturbance the existing ac power networks. This paper investigates how the dc fault recovery performance of a half-bridge modular multilevel converter (HB-MMC) is impacted by different dc protection design choices. A HB-MMC point-to-point system that is protected with dc circuit breakers (CBs) is simulated on a real time digital simulator (RTDS) using detailed switch models of the converters and switch gear. A dc CB controller has been developed and implemented in a software-in-the-loop fashion, and has been made available free for download. A novel blocking scheme for the HB-MMC is proposed, which limits the <b>prospective</b> dc-side <b>fault</b> current, benefiting dc switch gear. A comparison of circulating current controllers shows that the standard dq controller {{is likely to be}} unsuitable for fault studies. Finally, benchmarking shows that a 48 % reduction in power flow recovery time and a 90 % reduction in the energy dissipated in the circuit breaker can be achieved, along with other benefits, depending on the protection design...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{effective}} methodology to detect early stage faults in rotating machinery is proposed. The methodology {{is based on}} the analysis of cyclostationarity, which is inherent to the vibration signals generated by rotating machines. Of a particularly interest are the second and higher orders cyclostationary components since they contain valuable information, which can be used for the early detection of faults in rolling bearings and gear systems. The first step of the methodology consists in the separation of the first-order periodicity components from the raw signal, in order to focus the analysis in the residual part of the signal, which contains the second and higher order periodicities. Then, the residual signal is filtered and demodulated, using the frequency range of highest importance. Finally, the demodulated residual signal is auto-correlated, obtaining an enhanced signal that may contain clear spectral components related to the presence of a <b>prospective</b> localized <b>fault.</b> The methodology is validated analyzing experimental vibration data for two different cases. The first case is related to the detection of a crack in one of the teeth of a gearbox system and the second case is related to the detection of a pitfall in the inner race of a rolling bearing. The results show that the proposed method for the condition monitoring of rotating machines is a useful tool for the tasks of fault diagnosis, which can complement the analysis made using traditional diagnostic techniques...|$|R
50|$|In a {{resistive}} FCL, {{the current}} passes directly through the superconductor. When it quenches, the {{sharp rise in}} resistance reduces the fault current from what it would otherwise be (the <b>prospective</b> <b>fault</b> current). A resistive FCL can be either DC or AC. If it is AC, {{then there will be}} a steady power dissipation from AC losses (superconducting hysteresis losses) which must be removed by the cryogenic system. An AC FCL is usually made from wire wound non-inductively; otherwise the inductance of the device would create an extra constant power loss on the system.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnitude}} of fault currents differ widely {{depending on the}} type of earthing system used, the installation's supply type and earthing system, and its proximity to the supply. For example, for a domestic UK 230 V, 60 A TN-S or USA 120 V/240 V supply, fault currents may be a few thousand amperes. Large low-voltage networks with multiple sources may have fault levels of 300,000 amperes. A high-resistance-grounded system may restrict line to ground fault current to only 5 amperes. Prior to selecting protective devices, <b>prospective</b> <b>fault</b> current must be measured reliably at the origin of the installation and at the furthest point of each circuit, and this information applied properly to the application of the circuits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we report}} {{the results from}} {{evaluation}} {{on the use of}} 2 nd generation high-temperature superconducting wires, or 2 G HTS conductors, as elements for superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). The unique features of 2 G HTS conductors such as high N-values, superior electromechanical performance, large surface area available for cooling, and their availability in long-lengths that could be produced by highthroughput and low-cost manufacturing, may provide advantages for SFCL applications. We tested SuperPower’s standard ion-beam-assisted-deposition based 2 G HTS conductors under various conditions. First, individual conductors 10 - 20 cm long with dc critical current (Ic) ranging from 180 amps to 277 amps were tested at <b>prospective</b> <b>fault</b> current up to 3 kA (peak). 2 G HTS conductors demonstrated good fault current limiting performance, including first peak limitation. Quench current was in the range of 1. 8 to 3 times Ic, and the response time was within 1 ms. Secondly, 3 - 5 conductors in parallel connections demonstrated uniform current sharing and fast recovery under no-load condition. Finally, an assembly consisted of 12 elements in series connection was tested at high-power condition at KEMA PowerTest. Each element had four 40 cm long conductors with Ic ~ 120 A in parallel connection. With 1080 V supply voltage and 90 kA <b>prospective</b> <b>fault</b> peak current, the fault current was limited to 32 kA at the 1 st peak with 3. 2 kA in the HTS elements. The response time was less than 1 ms. All these testing results indicate that our 2 G HTS conductors are promising for practical SFCL applications.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} has arisen {{in the possibility}} that changes in the Earth's inertia tensor accompanying earthquakes may provide the excitation for the, Chandler ' wobble of the rotation axis.

40|$|Growing {{electricity}} demand {{from a range}} of sources with higher loads and the industry structural changes open the possibility of more frequent and larger fault currents producible in liver power grids. Traditional solutions to the fault have difficulties in satisfying the requirement of the new power grid requirement due to many factors, such as high cost and additional impact to power grid in normal loading condition, which leads to the research for an efficient alternative solution of interest to both academia and industry: Superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). Critical current Ic is used to describe the maximum current that a superconductor can transport {{and is one of the}} most important parameters to be considered while designing a SFCL. Guaranteeing the homogeneous distribution of the critical current density flowing in a superconductor is not possible due to manufacturing process limitations. In this paper, the impact of critical current inhomogeneity of coated high temperature superconductors (HTSs) during the quench process is studied experimentally. The results show that both the amount of Ic degradation and the size of Ic degraded segments have a great impact on the maximum temperature generated in the quench process of HTSs when the <b>prospective</b> <b>fault</b> current is low (1. 13 Ic to 1. 51 Ic.

40|$|Power-dense, {{low-voltage}} marine electrical {{systems have}} the potential for extremely high fault currents. Superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs) have been of interest for many years and offer an effective method for reducing fault currents. This is very attractive in a marine vessel in terms of the benefits arising from reductions in switchgear rating (and consequently size, weight and cost) and damage at the point of fault. However, {{there are a number of}} issues that must be considered prior to installation of any SFCL device(s), particularly in the context of marine applications. Accordingly, this study analyses several such issues, including: location and resistance sizing of SFCLs; the potential effects of an SFCL on system voltage, power and frequency; and practical application issues such as the potential impact of transients such as transformer inrush. Simulations based upon an actual vessel are used to illustrate discussions and support assertions. It is shown that SFCLs, even with relatively small impedances, are highly effective at reducing <b>prospective</b> <b>fault</b> currents; the impact that higher resistance values has on fault current reduction and maintaining the system voltage for other non-faulted elements of the system is also presented and it is shown that higher resistance values are desirable in many cases. It is demonstrated that the exact nature of the SFCL application will depend significantly on the vessel’s electrical topology, the fault current contribution of each of the generators, and the properties of the SFCL device, such as size, weight, critical current value and recovery time...|$|E
40|$|Fault {{current levels}} in {{electrical}} systems are rising due to natural growth in demand, the increasing presence of distributed generation (DG), and increased network interconnection. This rising trend {{is expected to}} continue in the future. Marine vessel power systems are highly power-dense and are often safety-critical. Power system protection is increasingly challenging in these systems. Superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs) offer an attractive solution to many of the issues faced. This thesis establishes and reviews {{the state of the art}} in resistive SFCL technology and application knowledge, and provides crucial research-based guidance for the adoption of resistive SFCLs in future power systems. The issues associated with the application of resistive SFCLs [...] -including location, resistance rating, the recovery period, and interaction with protection systems [...] -are demonstrated. The relationship between several resistive SFCL design parameters is established using a generic analytical approach, hence providing a framework for validating SFCL designs. In particular, it is shown that a particular SFCL resistance rating leads to a peak in the superconductor energy dissipation, which generally should be avoided. It is proven that resistive SFCLs have an inverse current-time characteristic, i. e., they will operate in a time that inversely depends upon the initial fault current magnitude. This knowledge is critical for underpinning the operation of a novel protection scheme using multiple resistive SFCLs. The scheme offers several advantages: very fast-acting operation in response to faults anywhere on the system under study; maximum <b>prospective</b> <b>fault</b> currents are prevented from occurring, reducing the duty on circuit breakers; inherent, fast-acting backup; and communications is not required. It is shown that the scheme is suited to highly-interconnected systems with a high presence of DG.

40|$|To fulfil the {{requirements}} of the Bachelor of Engineering at Murdoch University, students are required to undertake either a research project or internship project. This final year thesis project was carried out during an internship placement at Fortescue Metals Group (“Fortescue”). The project involved the modelling and analysis of a new power system at one of Fortescue’s mine sites in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Power systems are modelled for the purpose of analysing system safety, reliability and efficiency. The process that engineers take to ensure power systems have these qualities in the design phase is greatly simplified by modelling. The modelling is carried out using specialised power system analysis tools in order to simulate the steady-state and transient operating conditions that system components are likely to be subjected to. The power system modelling at Fortescue was carried out in the preferred modelling software, PowerFactory by DIgSILENT. The studies that were undertaken for analysis were Load Flow, Short-Circuit and Motor-Starting Studies, with an additional task of assessing the coordination of protective devices. The Load Flow study was carried out for the normal operation of the system, where the system is running at maximum demand. The Short-Circuit study scenarios included the maximum and minimum <b>prospective</b> <b>fault</b> currents during three-phase short-circuits and single-phase to ground short-circuits. The Motor-Starting studies were carried out on the maximum motor loads connected to each substation. The methodology and techniques used to conduct these studies are outlined in the report. The results indicated that the system components were adequately rated in order to safely and reliably supply power to the various loads. Equipment ratings were not exceeded in normal operation of the system, or throughout any of the short-circuit fault scenarios. The studies illustrated that motors could successfully start-up without damaging equipment due to inrush currents, and the protection settings were all adequately coordinated. The detailed analysis of these results is carried out throughout this internship report...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{discharges}} {{have been}} used extensively in devices for interruption of fault currents. Much work has investigated the use of arc discharges for interrupting DC current. The problem with DC current {{is that there is}} no natural current zero where thermal losses from the arc dominate thus leading to arc extinction and the interruption of fault current. Helical arc been arranged by using splitter blades to separate the arc turns. The expansion of a helical arc confined between polymeric splitter blades is governed by both electromagnetic and aerodynamic forces. These arise due to the complex interaction between the individual arc turns, arc/ splitter blade interactions and surrounding media. These interactions can be exploited to control the rate of expansion. During this expansion stage there is a substantial increase in arc voltage which in low voltage systems can limit the current thereby causing current interruption providing the arc quenching conditions are suitable. An experimental study has been undertaken to assess the fundamental characteristics of helical arcs con�fined between �different arrangements of PTFE, PE and copper blades in three different sizes (180 mm, 360 mm and 500 mm). Significant improvements in arc current limitation and interruption capability are observed when the arc voltage increases. A substantial increase in arc voltage was observed for all combinations of copper/ PTFE splitter blades. It was noted that the <b>prospective</b> <b>fault</b> current is forced to near zero when copper blades are used in conjunction with PTFE blades. With the larger PTFE and PE blades sized 360 mm and 500 mm, it was observed that the arc stayed within the limit of blades, thus providing better arc control capability. Simplified modelling of the forces acting on the arc (electromagnetic, aerodynamic) have been assessed. The electromagnetic forces act not only to produce radial expansion of the arc but also to keep alignment between the turns. The generation of the aerodynamic forces is very complex to model and indeed the modelling presented can only be used indicatively in any analysis at this stage. The work indicates that a compact DC interruption device may be possible based on the confinement of the plasma within the splitter blades and interaction with polymeric material...|$|E
