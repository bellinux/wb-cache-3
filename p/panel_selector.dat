40|$|Building on a unique, multi-source, and multi-method {{study of}} R&D {{projects}} in a leading professional service firm, we develop {{the argument that}} organizations {{are more likely to}} fund projects with intermediate levels of novelty. That is, some project novelty increases the share of requested funds received, but too much novelty is difficult to appreciate and is selected against. While prior research has considered the characteristics of the individuals generating project ideas, we shift the focus to <b>panel</b> <b>selectors</b> and explore how they shape the evaluation of novelty. We theorize that a high panel workload reduces panel preference for novelty in selection, whereas a diversity of panel expertise and a shared location between panel and applicant increase preference for novelty. We explore the implications of these findings for theories of innovation search, organizational selection, and managerial practice...|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} year of the {{competition}} there was a single prize of £25,000. In 2010 the Visitors’ Choice Prize, worth £10,000, was introduced. The two major prizes available are the Threadneedle Prize and the Visitor’ Choice Prize. In 2012 the Threadneedle Prize was increased from £25,000 to £30,000 making it the largest prize for single work of art in the UK. For the Threadneedle Prize, a <b>panel</b> of <b>selectors</b> shortlist six works and then choose the winner of the £30,000 prize. Two finalists for the Visitors' Choice Prize are awarded £500. Each of the five finalists for the Threadneedle Prize receives £1,000. In 2013 there are eight prizes totalling £46,000.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{the motor}} driven, clutch {{controlled}} <b>panel</b> switch <b>selectors,</b> crossbar switches using the link principle required incoming and outgoing markers {{to find an}} idle path {{and set up the}} switch train for each call. Earlier crossbar exchanges had used the crossbar switch according to the selector principle, with one input and typically 100 or 200 outputs, similar to a stepping switch. 1XB pioneered the link principle, with each switch able to handle as many phone calls as it had inputs or outputs, typically ten. This innovation diminished the cost of switches, at the expense of more complex controls. The complexity of the circuitry challenged the art of circuit drawings, leading to the development of detached contact drawings, which in turn led to the application of Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps.|$|R

2500|$|However, {{when the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame was {{established}} in 1963, Friedman was overlooked. As years passed, numerous quarterbacks were inducted, including Sammy Baugh (1963), Dutch Clark (1963), Jimmy Conzelman (1964), Paddy Driscoll (1965), Otto Graham (1965), Sid Luckman (1965), Bob Waterfield (1965), Arnie Herber (1966), Bobby Layne (1967), Y. A. Tittle (1971), Norm Van Brocklin (1971), and Ace Parker (1972). [...] Friedman's frustration grew {{as he continued to}} be overlooked. In February 1976, more than 40 years after his NFL career had ended, he wrote a letter to The New York Times pleading his case. It was not until 2005, 23 years after his death, that Friedman was finally inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A group of 40 to 50 players who played for him at Brandeis printed brochures and lobbied for his induction. He was then nominated by the Hall's veterans committee and received the requisite votes by a 39-member <b>panel</b> of <b>selectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1987, the Arts Council of Great Britain {{commissioned}} a feasibility report on New Contemporaries {{to look into}} the future viability of the exhibition. Published by Richard Shone, who has since become the Chair of a Volunteer Board of Directors, the report proposed a new structure and constitution for the organisation. For the first time, the exhibition was made independent from the art colleges, and supported by professional administration, inviting a <b>panel</b> of <b>selectors</b> each year to pick contributors. The exhibition was relaunched at the ICA in 1989 and toured to four regional centres. From 1989-1994, the exhibition was sponsored by British Telecom and since 2000 has been sponsored by Bloomberg. In 1996, the exhibition was invited to become an component of the Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art and has since been staged in the city every two years. New Contemporaries is also supported by the Arts Council England. During this recent period participants have included Damien Hirst, Glen Brown (both 1989) and Simon Starling (1994).|$|R

5|$|A {{recurrence}} {{of the effects}} of his injury in 1924 restricted Gilligan's cricket in 1925. Appearing in fewer games and bowling far less frequently than in previous seasons, he scored 542 runs at 15.05 and took only eight wickets. He bowled in the first four games of the season, but in his remaining seventeen appearances played only as a batsman. In 1926, he was more successful and his performances helped Sussex to rise from thirteenth to tenth in the County Championship. Playing more games, he scored 1,037 runs at 30.50, the highest seasonal batting average of his career, and took 75 wickets at 20.74. That season, although no longer considered for a place in the England team himself, Gilligan joined the <b>panel</b> of Test <b>selectors,</b> and as a consequence missed some cricket for Sussex. He published a book on that summer's tour by Australia called Collins's Men.|$|R
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} do {{not have}} jump seats in the cockpit, while others have one or two. In most airliners, the observers' seats have an audio <b>selector</b> <b>panel</b> so that the observer can monitor or participate in flight communications. An oxygen mask is provided for each station. There can be extra flight attendant jump seats in the main cabin, {{depending on how the}} airline has configured its aircraft and how many on-duty flight attendants are staffed. Both types might be stand-alone seats, or folding. Either type of jump seat may sometimes be used by off-duty staff (or an employee of another airline or other person) engaging in non-revenue travel, when no passenger seats are available in the cabin (a practice known as jumpseating). Increased security requirements for the flight deck since September 11, 2001 have meant a tightening of restrictions on who is allowed to use jump seats.|$|R
40|$|The drawing Common Grounds 3 / 52 was {{selected}} for exhibition. 2014 marks the 20 th Jerwood Drawing Prize, the largest and longest running annual open exhibition for drawing in the UK. Selected from original drawings, the Jerwood Drawing Prize has established a reputation for its commitment to championing excellence and promoting and celebrating the breadth of contemporary drawing practice within the UK. The Jerwood Drawing Prize is a joint initiative, led by Professor Anita Taylor, Dean of Bath School of Art and Design at Bath Spa University and supported by Jerwood Charitable Foundation. Drawings are chosen for the exhibition through an open submission process, and considered for inclusion by a <b>panel</b> of three <b>selectors</b> with the perspectives of practitioner, curator and writer. The selection panel changes each year, and the resulting exhibitions reflect the differing interests of each panel. The Jerwood Drawing Prize 2014 includes 51 drawings by 46 practitioners selected from 3, 234 submitted works...|$|R
2500|$|He {{has already}} been tagged as the second [...] "Captain Grumpy" [...] since Allan Border early in his {{captaincy}} reign, having to warn Mitchell Starc for unsportsmanlike behaviour, and being {{highly critical of the}} team's bowling and fielding despite beating New Zealand by over 200 runs. Yet, he has also scored 4 centuries in 5 Tests as captain, including a maiden second-innings century against New Zealand in Perth, which was also Mitchell Johnson's final cricket match. He was also undefeated in the his first 10 Tests as captain, the only one out of the past 4 captains to do so. However, late in 2016, he accumulated consecutive Test series losses, which prompted a reshuffle of the <b>selector's</b> <b>panel.</b> He is also known for being reluctant to use spinners as he no longer bowls on a regular basis, and is very defensive when he does. Since the reshuffle, however, he has used Lyon and Steve O'Keefe in tandem more, which could be due to necessity in India's spin-friendly pitches.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} get better receive {{coverage}} over a wide area, a similar linked setup can also be done with {{what is known as}} a voted receiver system. In a voted receiver, there are several satellite receivers set up to receive on the same frequency (the one that the users transmit on). All of the satellite receivers are linked to a voting <b>selector</b> <b>panel</b> that switches from receiver to receiver based on the best quieting (strongest) signal, and the output of the selector will actually trigger the central repeater transmitter. A properly adjusted voting system can switch many times a second and can actually [...] "assemble" [...] a multi-syllable word using a different satellite receiver for each syllable. Such a system can be used to widen coverage to low power mobile radios or handheld radios that otherwise {{would not be able to}} key up the central location, but can receive the signal from the central location without an issue. Voting systems require no knowledge or effort on the part of the user - the system just seems to have better-than-average handheld coverage.|$|R
