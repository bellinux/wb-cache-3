40|$|Variable {{valve lift}} (VVL) system for {{automotive}} engines {{is one of}} the key technologies to attain improvement of fuel economy and power output and reduction of emission. This paper presents a highly reliable VVL mechanism controlled by a hydraulic 3 -step rotary actuator. 3 -step VVL with high-, middle- and low-valve lift, is realized by the pivot shifting of an intermediate cam placed between a camshaft and <b>valve</b> <b>tappet.</b> The hydraulic actuator with no electric device is installed in a cylinder head and its rotary positioning generates 3 -step rotation of a specially-designed sprag cam. The actuator can work in low supply pressure of 0. 1 MPa and control 3 -step angles within the interval in which the valve is at rest during camshaft rotation. This paper describes the analytical simulation model of the VVL system, and the experimental evaluation for the developed VVL mechanism and hydraulic 3 -step rotary actuator...|$|R
50|$|Today, most cams have {{mirror image}} (symmetric) {{profiles}} with identical {{positive and negative}} acceleration while opening and closing valves. However, some high speed (in terms of engine RPM) motors now employ asymmetrical cam profiles in order to quickly open valves and set them back in their seats more gently to reduce wear. As well, production vehicles have employed asymmetrical cam lobe profiles since the late 1940s, {{as seen in the}} 1948 Ford V8. In this motor both the intake and exhaust profiles had an asymmetric design. More modern applications of asymmetrical camshafts include Cosworth's 2.3 liter crate motors, which use aggressive profiles to reach upwards of 280 brake horsepower. An asymmetric cam either opens or closes valves more slowly than it could, speed being limited by Hertzian contact stress between curved cam and flat tappet from accelerating the mass of <b>valve,</b> <b>tappet</b> and spring.|$|R
50|$|The Monosoupape had no {{carburetor}} or throttle, {{and since}} most of its air supply was taken in through the exhaust valve, {{it could not be}} controlled by adjusting the air supply to the crankcase like other rotaries. Monosoupapes therefore had a single petrol regulating control used for a limited degree of speed regulation. In early examples, engine speed could be controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the <b>valve</b> <b>tappet</b> rollers, but this was later abandoned due to causing burning of the valves.2 Instead, a blip switch was used, which cut out the ignition when pressed. This was used sparingly to avoid fouling the spark plugs, since it was only safe to be used when the fuel supply was also cut. Some later Monosoupapes were fitted with a selector switch which allowed the pilot to cut out three or six cylinders instead of all nine when hitting the blip switch, so that each cylinder fired only once per three engine revolutions but the engine remained in perfect balance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913 the Seguin {{brothers}} {{introduced the}} new Monosoupape ("single valve") series, which replaced inlet valves in the pistons {{by using a}} single valve in each cylinder head, which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve. The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the <b>valve</b> <b>tappet</b> rollers, a system later abandoned due to valves burning. The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines, and it used less lubricating oil. The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders, and developed its rated power at 1,200 rpm. [...] The later 160 hp nine-cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design, and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format.Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rhône companies used conventional pushrod-operated valves in the cylinder head, but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft, with the Le Rhônes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase {{to the top of}} each cylinder to admit the intake charge.|$|R

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Justin W. Behrens, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Mechanical Engineering, {{presented}} on June 24, 2011 at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: MODIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF A MONO-VALVE ENGINE MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Suri Rajan A four-stroke engine utilizing one <b>tappet</b> <b>valve</b> {{for both the}} intake and exhaust gas exchange processes has been built and evaluated. The engine operates under its own power, but has a reduced power capacity than the conventional 2 -valve engine. The reduction in power is traced to higher than expected amounts of exhaust gases flowing back into the intake system. Design changes to the cylinder head will fix the back flow problems, but the future capacity of mono-valve engine technology cannot be estimated. The back flow of exhaust gases increases the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate and deteriorates combustion. Intake pressure data shows the mono-valve engine requires an advanced intake valve closing (IVC) time to prevent back flow of charge air. A single actuation camshaft with advanced IVC was tested in the mono-valve engine, and was found to improve exhaust scavenging at TDC and nearly eliminated all charge air back flow at IVC. The optimum IVC timing is shown to be approximately 30 crank angle degrees after BDC. The mono-valve cylinder head utilizes a rotary valve positioned above the <b>tappet</b> <b>valve.</b> The open spaces inside the rotary valve and between the rotary <b>valve</b> and <b>tappet</b> <b>valve</b> represent a common volume {{that needs to be}} reduced {{in order to reduce the}} base EGR rate. Multiple rotary valve configurations were tested, and the size of the common volume was found to have no effect on back flow but a direct effect on the EGR rate and engine performance. The position of the rotary valve with respect to crank angle has a direct effect on the scavenging process. Optimum scavenging occurs when the intake port is opened just after TDC...|$|R

5000|$|The {{engine was}} very much based on the Rover 16's but the bore had been {{increased}} 2mm. There {{were a number of}} minor improvements. The water inlet pipe was now {{to the other side of}} the engine to provide better access to the <b>valves</b> and <b>tappets.</b> The oil box (reservoir) was now at the left rear of the engine so a catcher for oil thrown up by the flywheel is no longer necessary. Lubrication pipes had been mounted lower. There was a new partition between sump and clutch housing so oil was not thrown to the clutch. Rover's engine braking system was fitted, it has the ability to close the engine's valves.|$|R
50|$|Sidevalve engines also {{required}} their tappets adjusting, {{and in this}} case it was the tappets themselves that were adjusted directly. Small access plates were provided {{on the sides of the}} cylinder block, giving access to the gap between the <b>valves</b> and <b>tappets.</b> Some tappets had a threaded adjuster, but simpler engines could be adjusted by grinding down the ends of the valve stem directly. As the adjustment gap need only be expanded over the engine's working life (re-grinding valves into their valve seats during de-coking makes them sit lower, thus closing up the tappet gap), adjustment by removing metal was acceptable. Care was obviously needed, to not remove too much. Eventually the valves would be replaced entirely, a relatively common operation for engines of this era.|$|R

Adjustments that are permissible include <b>valve</b> <b>tappet</b> clearance, breaker,point gap, spark plug gaps, clutch and others of a similar nature. No new parts or accessories can be installed without having mention made of it in the report. No data 2 ̆ 7 are recorded during this preliminary run except the time that the engine is operated. BELT HORSEPOWER TESTS TEST B: The throttle valve is hdd wide opened and the belt load on the dynamometer is adjusted so that the engine is at the rated speed recommended by the manufacturer. Carburetor, ignition timing and manifold adjustments are all set for maximum engine power. This test is designed to determine maximum belt horsepower of the tractor at ra. te. d speed and to measure fuel consumption at the maximum power on the belt. TEST C: For tractors with carburetors the best fuel economy does not always occur when the engine develops maximum power at rated speed. Test C is intended to allow the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s representative to select a more economical fuel setting even though there is a slight loss of power. This more practical carburetor setting is used in all later tests except test F. The throttle valve is held wide open and load adjusted to give rated rpm.

50|$|The sidevalve's poppet valves {{are usually}} sited {{on one side}} of the {{cylinder}}(s). A recess in the cylinder head creates a corridor connecting the valves and the combustion chamber. The valve gear comprises a camshaft which operates the <b>valves</b> via simple <b>tappets,</b> most commonly without any further valvetrain components (such as pushrods, rocker arms, overhead valves or overhead camshafts).
