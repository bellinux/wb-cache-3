5000|$|Six {{months at}} the Tribune saw Dunne gain <b>promotion</b> to <b>editor</b> of the Sunday edition, soon {{after the start of}} 1890. This {{relieved}} him of the drudgery of the daily reporter's beat, which he disliked. Before the end of the year, he moved again, this time to the Chicago Herald—publisher John R. Walsh and editor James W. Scott were building a staff composed mainly of enthusiastic younger journalists, including Dunne's old colleague from the ballpark, Seymour. Several Whitechapel members were there, as was future politician Brand Whitlock, who later wrote, [...] "when they induced 'Pete' Dunne to come over from the Tribune, the staff seemed complete". Another reason Dunne was willing to jump papers was that he would have the opportunity to do political reporting. Although hired as a reporter, not an editor, Dunne's experience and competence quickly placed him high on the staff. Dunne got to do political work, covering the 1892 Democratic and Republican conventions. He also had to do work he found less interesting—the young Theodore Dreiser, assigned like Dunne to cover a florists' convention noted that Dunne seemed to scorn not only the event, but the fact he was assigned to cover it. Despite his affected nonchalance during such assignments, Dunne still turned in brilliant copy.|$|R

500|$|In April 2012, Susan {{starts to}} {{struggle}} with her MS again, following her split from Karl and her <b>promotion</b> to <b>editor</b> of the Erinsborough News. Jackie Brygel of TV Week said Susan {{has a lot to}} prove with Paul breathing down her neck, but her new role puts her health in jeopardy when she begins displaying signs of an MS relapse. Woodburne explained [...] "She's working 24 hours a day {{to try to get the}} paper to take on a different form and is running herself into the ground.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 271 - 274) Agness Underwood's journalism career spanned {{more than}} four decades, from 1926 when she began working as a part-time switchboard operator for the Los Angeles Record until she retired in 1968 as assistant {{managing editor of the}} Los Angeles Herald Examiner. For the majority of her career, she worked for Hearst newspapers in Los Angeles, establishing a reputation as a top crime and court reporter during the 1930 s and 1940 s, but it was her <b>promotion</b> to city <b>editor</b> of the Los Angeles Herald-Express in 1947 that made history. Rarely, if ever, had a woman broken the management barrier on a major metropolitan daily newspaper. She held the position for 17 - 1 / 2 years, {{more than four}} times longer than any of her male predecessors. Although this thesis encompasses Underwood's entire life, it focuses on the relationship between the personality traits and motivational forces established during her formative years and her later accomplishments as an adult in a male-dominated profession. Orphaned at age 5, Underwood lived with an Indiana foster family until age 15 when she left for California alone to begin a new life. The findings of this study reveal that the insecurity and low self-esteem Underwood felt as a child contributed to her drive to succeed as an adult. It is further concluded that her effectiveness as a journalist was based on a combination of innate personal qualities (intelligence, compassion and curiosity) and survival skills (skepticism, resourcefulness and perseverance) learned during the struggle to survive on her own at an early age. This thesis also examines Underwood's image as an aggressive newspaperwoman in the "Front Page" tradition [...] an image that remained essentially the same throughout her career...|$|R
