40|$|This paper {{presents}} a stochastic <b>population</b> <b>forecast</b> for China {{with a special}} emphasis on population ageing. The so-called scaled model for error was used to quantify the uncertainty attached to the population predictions. Data scarcity was {{a major problem in}} the specification of the expected error of the <b>population</b> <b>forecast.</b> Therefore, the error structures estimated for European countries were used with some modifications, taking into account the large size and heterogeneity of the Chinese population. The stochastic forecast confirms the expectation of extremely rapid population ageing {{during the first half of}} the twenty-first century in China. The old age dependency ratio (OADR) will certainly increase. Simply maintaining the current demographic rates (no international migration) would drive the OADR to 0. 42 in 2060, four times the current level. Including expected declines in mortality and net outmigration in the projection would increase the median OADR in 2060 to 0. 59, with a 80 % prediction interval of [0. 47, 0. 75]. In particular, the oldest-old population will grow much faster than any other age group. This development has major implications for policy-making in China.

40|$|<b>Forecasting</b> <b>{{population}}</b> {{growth to}} meet the service needs of a growing population is a vexed issue. The task of providing essential services becomes even more difficult when future <b>population</b> growth <b>forecasts</b> are unavailable or unreliable. The aim {{of this paper is}} to identify the main methods used in <b>population</b> <b>forecasting</b> and thereby select an approach to demonstrate that such forecasting can be undertaken with certainly and transparency, barring exogenous events. We then use the <b>population</b> <b>forecasts</b> to plan for service needs that arise from changes in population in the future. Interestingly, although there are techniques available to <b>forecast</b> such future <b>population</b> changes and much of this forecasting occurs, such work remains somewhat clouded in mystery. We strive to rectify this situation by applying an approach that is verifiable, transparent, and easy to comprehend. For this purpose we select two regional councils in Queensland, Australia. The experience derived from forecasting shows that forecasts for service needs of larger populations are more easily and accurately derived than for smaller populations. Hence, there is some evidence, at least from a service provision point of view, to justify the benefits of council/ municipality amalgamation in recent times in Australia and elsewhere. The methodology used in this paper for <b>population</b> <b>forecasting</b> and the provision of service needs based on such forecasts will be of particular interest to policy decisionmakers and planners.

We compare these <b>forecasts</b> with <b>population</b> counts for the corresponding years and find precision, bias, and the width of prediction intervals to vary by state, launch year, model specification, base period, and forecast horizon. Furthermore, we find that prediction intervals based on some ARIMA models provide relatively accurate forecasts of the distribution of future population counts but prediction intervals based on other models do not. We conclude that there is some basis for optimism regarding the possibility that ARIMA models might be able to produce realistic prediction intervals to accompany <b>population</b> <b>forecasts,</b> but a great deal of work remains to be done before we can draw any firm conclusions.

Official population projections rely in general on deterministic models which use different scenarios for future vital rates to indicate uncertainty. However, this technique shows substantial weak points such as assuming absolute correlations between the demographic components. In this paper, we argue that a stochastic projection alternative, with no a priori assumptions provides point forecasts and probabilistic prediction intervals for demographic parameters in addition. Age-sex specific <b>population</b> <b>forecast</b> for Germany is derived through a stochastic population renewal process using forecasts of mortality, fertility and migration.
