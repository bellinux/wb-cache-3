50|$|USB mice {{have lower}} latencies than PS/2 mice because {{standard}} USB mice are often polled at a default rate of 125 Hz while standard PS/2 mice send interrupts at a default rate of 100 Hz {{when they have}} data to send to the computer. Also, USB mice do not cause the USB controller to interrupt the system when they have no status change to report according to the USB HID specification's default profile for mice. Both PS/2 and USB allow the sample rate to be overridden, with PS/2 supporting a sampling rate of up to 200 Hz and USB supporting a <b>polling</b> <b>rate</b> up to 1 kHz {{as long as the}} USB mouse runs at full-speed or higher USB speeds.|$|E

An analytical model is employed to examine the smart battery characteristics to support the theoretical intrusion detection limits and capabilities of B-SIPS.

Using the results from a previous study of optimized static polling rates to create minimum and maximum thresholds, a dynamic <b>polling</b> <b>rate</b> algorithm was devised.

30|$|Sections 6.1 – 6.4 show {{a unique}} nature and large scale of experimentation. First, the {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} using two production clouds, the NeCTAR research clouds; each ran OpenStack. Second, the experiments were carried out across Melbourne and Tasmania cloud regions; the distance between them, 429  km, is impressive in terms of industry, business, and research applications. Third, {{the speed of the}} internal and external network, where the internal Melbourne network is over twice as fast as the public (Melbourne to Tasmania) network; such a difference creates some buffering problems. Fourth, since we wanted to carry out experiments in boundary computation and communication conditions, with a huge number of devices, it was necessary to use simulated field devices. That allowed us to run experiments with load of up to 800 sensors deployed in Tasmania (SCADA components were deployed in Melbourne). Fifth, the numbers of simulated devices were varied between 1 and 800, with a <b>polling</b> <b>rate</b> of 1 millisecond. Typically, SCADA systems are setup with a slower polling interval of seconds. A <b>polling</b> <b>rate</b> of 1 millisecond was deliberately chosen to put more load on the system. Sixth, all experiments were carried out during normal exploitation of clouds and connected them public networks; that formed normal business/industry conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{popularity}} of RSS and similar feed formats is growing fast. This paper gives {{an overview of}} the standards and implementations in this field, and analyzes whether they allow scheduling the retrieval of feed updates. As will be shown, such support is very limited and current feed readers therefore poll providers at fixed rates. The measurements performed as part of our study show that in general a clear mismatch exists between such fixed <b>polling</b> <b>rate</b> of feed readers and the rate at which providers update their feeds; a significant performance gain is therefore possible by embedding scheduling information within feeds. This paper proposes a scheduling approach that both reduces lag in updates for active feeds and reduces wasted resources for less active feeds. Simulations show that our approach reduces the perceived lag by twenty percent, while having the same resource requirements as a fixed-rate algorithm...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a supporting {{model for a}} unique Battery-Sensing Intrusion Protection System (B-SIPS) for mobile computers, which alerts when power changes are detected on small wireless devices. An analytical model is employed to examine smart battery characteristics to support the theoretical intrusion detection limits and capabilities of B-SIPS.

40|$|Abstract—We present OpenNetMon, an {{approach}} and open-source software implementation to monitor per-flow metrics, especially throughput, delay and packet loss, in OpenFlow net-works. Currently, ISPs over-provision capacity {{in order to}} meet QoS demands from customers. Software-Defined Networking and OpenFlow allow for better network control and flexibility in the pursuit of operating networks as efficiently as possible. Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i. e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy. We show that not only local links serving variable bit-rate video streams, but also aggregated WAN links benefit from an adaptive <b>polling</b> <b>rate</b> to obtain accurate measurements. Furthermore, we verify throughput, delay and packet loss measurements for bursty scenarios in our experiment testbed. I...|$|E
30|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the AfD will {{maintain}} its economic stance, now that the economic liberal faction has left the party – this stance does not seem helpful in strengthening its support base, and in fact might jeopardize its poll ratings. Given that populist parties often switch their positions according to the political climate, {{it would not be}} surprising if the AfD suddenly changed its position. In other words, the discrepancies between the party’s support group and its policy direction could be temporary. The AfD may abandon its radical market-oriented policies if these lead to a decline in support from blue collar workers and the unemployed. It is moreover not difficult for the AfD to change its economic stance fundamentally due to the absence of the economic liberal faction within the party. The French National Front, {{one of the most successful}} political parties in Europe now, also opposed economic intervention of the state and advocated for anti-taxation, but came to represent the interests of blue collar workers and vulnerable minorities when its <b>polling</b> <b>rate</b> was in question. Will the AfD follow the path of the French National Front, or retain its model of economic liberalism like the Freedom Party of Austria? The answer lies in the aftermath of the federal parliamentary election.|$|E
