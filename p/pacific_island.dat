40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide an {{overview}} of the health of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> young people in New Zealand, with a particular emphasis on the effects of their dietary and lifestyle behaviours upon long-term health. This research is based on the observation that noncommunicable, or life-style, diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality for <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> people in New Zealand, that these diseases are invariably attributable to dietary and lifestyle habits, and that these habits become instilled during the adolescent period. Three main methods were undertaken to achieve this aim. The first constituted a review of literature concerning the health of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> people in New Zealand, including a discussion of what health means to <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> people, along with the main health issues that this population encounters. The importance of food to <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> people is also considered in this review, along with the influence of diet on <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> people's disease patterns. Existing studies concerning the dietary habits of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> youth are also detailed. The second stage of the research involved conducting research into the health of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> young people in Christchurch, based in part on the methodology and findings of these previous studies. As the thesis will show, while Christchurch has the fourth largest <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> population in New Zealand, this population is considerably smaller than those in other main centres. This means that <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> people have less health resources and services available to them. This research revealed that <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> young people in Christchurch, and in New Zealand in general, consume a diet that is high in fat and low in other nutrients. Research into the health of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> young people is deemed necessary to help to counter the high incidence of lifestyle related diseases in the adult population. Further, by identifying potential health outlooks for the future generation of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> adults, research in Christchurch will be useful in ensuring that services and resources to meet <b>Pacific</b> <b>Islands</b> people's specific health needs...|$|R

The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed their concern about the need for a suitable naval patrol force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide suitable patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to island nations in the region. The Pacific Patrol Boat Systems Program Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN procurement organisation.|$|E

Before, he won the Isle of Man International in treacherous conditions where only sixteen out of seventy riders finished. At the road world championships in Ronse, Belgium, the Belgians controlled the race until Simpson broke free, catching two riders ahead: Henry Anglade (France) and Seamus Elliott (Ireland). Anglade was dropped, and Elliott refused to work with Simpson. They were caught; the race finished in a bunch sprint, with Simpson crossing the line in 29th. Simpson's season ended with six-day races across Europe and an invitation only race on the <b>Pacific</b> <b>island</b> of New Caledonia, along with other European riders.

5|$|Tropical Cyclone Trina (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 01F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 06P) was a weak but {{destructive}} {{tropical cyclone}} in late 2001 which caused {{some of the}} worst flooding in the South <b>Pacific</b> <b>island</b> of Mangaia, Cook Islands, in nearly 50years. Forming out of an upper-level low pressure system on November29 near the island of Rarotonga, or roughly 1,470mi (2,365km) southeast of Fiji, Trina remained practically stationary as it meandered in the same general area for over a week. Due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, the storm struggled to develop significant convection, preventing it from intensifying beyond 65km/h (40mph). After finally succumbing to wind shear on December2, the system weakened to a tropical depression near Mangaia and dissipated several days later.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of {{civilian}} administration, the Japanese population consisted of about a few hundred individuals, and reached a little over 2,000 by 1930. The Japanese resident population increased at an exponential rate from the mid-1930s onwards, and there were about 15,000 Japanese in Palau by 1938, the vast majority of whom were concentrated in Koror. The influx of Japanese immigrants fuelled the development of Koror into a city by 1939. The Palauans were quickly outnumbered by the Japanese, and constituted only about 16 percent of the city's population in 1937. The Japanese made up {{more than half of the}} islands' population, as well as 27% of Micronesia's Japanese population in a 1938 census. A large minority of the Japanese populace consisted of Okinawan immigrants, as well as a few Koreans. Palau's Japanese population was repatriated after the Japanese surrender, but people of Japanese-Palauan descent remained behind and constitute a large minority of Palau's population. A study done by the Sasakawa <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> Nations Fund estimated that about 10% of Palauans are born to a Japanese father and Palauan mother, the vast majority of whom were born before 1945. Another study done by the Foundation for Advanced Studies in International Development from Japan in 2005 estimates that about 25% of Palau's populace have some Japanese ancestry.|$|E

He was the most experienced and decorated of the three Tuvaluan athletes who came to Beijing's Olympic Games, having previously medaled in Oceanian international competitions. Logona Esau's event, which took place on August 12, included 30 athletes. He and New Zealand's Mark Spooner were the only competitors from Oceania in that particular competition. All of Esau's snatches were successful, and he lifted 102kilograms, 107kilograms, and 110kilograms successively. During the clean and jerks, Esau successfully lifted 138kilograms, then 144kilograms. He unsuccessfully attempted to lift 148kilograms. His total score, a combination of his highest snatch and clean and jerk lifts, was 254kilograms. This ranked the Tuvaluan in 23rd place out of the 24 athletes who finished the event. Tajikistan scored below Tuvalu at 250kilograms and Nepal scored immediately above at 268kilograms. In comparison, Liao Hui of China won the gold medal after lifting a combined 348kilograms.|$|E

Freeing herself, she escapes the security compound and stows away in a truck to Area 51, where she eventually obtains the artefact.|$|E
