40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} electricity generation, economic growth, and road sector energy use on environmental pollution in ten selected African countries. It employs micro panel data framework to allow for differences {{in the form of}} unobserved individual country effect. Various panel estimation techniques like Pool regression, fixed effect, and random effect methods were used, but Hausman test showed that fixed effect was the most appropriate. Variables used are GDP (constant 2000 US$), Co 2 emission (kt), Electric <b>production</b> (<b>kWh),</b> and road sector energy consumption (kt of oil equivalent). The countries were chosen based on data availability. The result shows that there is positive relationship between environmental pollution and electricity generation, and between environmental pollution and road sector energy use in the selected countries. However, the result shows that {{there is no evidence to}} support the presence of EKC in the countries examined. The paper concludes that African countries should start accessing renewable energy sources that are environmental friendly as their sources of electricity generation...|$|R
