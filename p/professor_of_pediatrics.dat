2500|$|Studies in mice {{have found}} a link between BPA {{exposure}} and asthma; a 2010 study on mice has concluded that perinatal exposure to 10µg/ml of BPA in drinking water enhances allergic sensitization and bronchial inflammation and responsiveness in an animal model of asthma. [...] A study published in JAMA pediatrics has found that prenatal exposure to BPA is also linked to lower lung capacity in some young children. This study had 398 mother-infant pairs and looked at their urine samples to detect concentrations of BPA. They study found that every 10-fold increase in BPA was tied to a 55% increase in the odds of wheezing. The higher the concentration of BPA during pregnancy were linked to decrease lung capacity in children under four years old but the link disappeared at age 5. Associate <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>pediatrics</b> at the University of Maryland School of Medicine said, [...] "Exposure during pregnancy, not after, {{appears to be the}} critical time for BPA, possibly because it's affecting important pathways that help the lung develop." ...|$|E
