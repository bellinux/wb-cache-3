We {{have worked with}} individuals with cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis who use a publiclyavailable interface that tracks the user’s head movements with a single video camera and translates them into mouse <b>pointer</b> <b>coordinates</b> on the screen. To address the problem that the interface can lose track of the user’s facial feature due to occlusion or spastic movements, we started to develop a multi-camera interface. Our multi-camera capture system can record synchronized images from multiple cameras and automatically analyze the camera arrangement. We recorded 15 subjects while they were conducting a hands-free interaction experiment. We reconstructed via stereoscopy the three-dimensional movement trajectories of various facial features. Our analysis shows that single-camera interfaces based on twodimensional feature tracking neglect {{to take into account}} the substantial feature movement in the third dimension. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction 2. Segmentation {{components}} such as {{photos and}} figures occur in large bounding boxes, characters {{are contained in}} medium size boxes, and noise in small boxes. Segmentation proceeds by projecting the medium size boxes first vertically and then horizontally to detect gaps indicating columns and paragraph breaks [2]. In addition, large bounding boxes are further analyzed by projecting both the contained medium size bounding boxes and the pixels contained {{in the area in}} order to determine whether it is a framed text area or a table. Also, collinear large boxes of similar height are detected to recognize oversized headlines. This procedure distinguishes non-text and text regions at the paragraph level. We keep <b>pointers</b> to the <b>coordinates</b> of each block and all contained boxes to facilitate subsequent reading order determination and higher level layout analysis. The technique of analyzing small, medium, and large size boxes separatelyyields good segmentation results for over...|$|R
