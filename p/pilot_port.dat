40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} an active control system for lean blowout (LBO) in a premixed combustor. The investigated control system consists of acoustical and optical sensors, an optimal, rule-based controller and a pilot fuel actuator. The controller uses the acoustic and/or optical sensors to detect the presence of “extinguishment events ” in the flame stabilization region. The frequency (number of events per second) dramatically increases as LBO is approached. LBO is prevented by “actuating ” a pilot fuel valve that increases the {{fraction of the total}} fuel injected through a small <b>pilot</b> <b>port.</b> The piloted combustion region acts to stabilize the overall combustion process. It is shown that the use of the pilot fuel injection allows safe combustor operation at a lower overall equivalence ratio, which results in significant reduction of NOx emissions...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present an analytical and easy-to-use method for evaluating the presence of air pollutants in small harbour areas along the Italian shores, and the potential exposure of workers to that risk. The research aims to highlight the possible differences in air quality characterization among different areas and periods of any analysed harbour. Therefore, the proposed method foresees a seasonal monitoring of some atmospheric pollutants within examined ports, identifying wherever possible the main source of air pollution for each zone. In particular, to pinpoint the most critical areas, the methodology foresees the monitoring of concentrations for some selected pollutants such as volatile organic compounds, particular matter and benzene. The methodology, developed within the framework of a research project supported by the Regional Authority of Lazio, has been tested in four <b>pilot</b> <b>port</b> areas. The acquired results point out that air pollutant concentrations could significantly diverge among different areas and periods of a single harbour and, consequentially, the evaluation of the results allows a spatial and temporal comparison of pollutants concentrations in each portal zone. Thus, the described method represents a useful tool for local administrations to plan best practices and the use of the best available technologies for impact mitigation, with the final goal of reducing air pollution in the most critical portal zones. © 2013 Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} largely {{proposed}} as a possible alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. Its wide flammability range allows higher engine efficiency with leaner operation than conventional fuels, for both reduced toxic emissions and no CO 2 gases. Independently, Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) also allows higher thermal efficiency and lower fuel consumption with reduced NOX emissions when compared to Spark-Ignition (SI) engine operation. For HCCI combustion, a mixture of air and fuel is supplied to the cylinder and autoignition occurs from compression; engine is operated throttle-less and load {{is controlled by the}} quality of the mixture, avoiding the large fluid-dynamic losses in the intake manifold of SI engines. HCCI can be induced and controlled by varying the mixture temperature, either by Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) or intake air pre-heating. A combination of HCCI combustion with hydrogen fuelling has great potential for virtually zero CO 2 and NOX emissions. Nevertheless, combustion on such a fast burning fuel with wide flammability limits and high octane number implies many disadvantages, such as control of backfiring and speed of autoignition and there is almost no literature on the subject, particularly in optical engines. Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder research engine equipped with both Port Fuel Injection (PFI) and Direct Injection (DI) systems running at 1000 RPM. Optical access to in-cylinder phenomena was enabled through an extended piston and optical crown. Combustion images were acquired by a high-speed camera at 1 °or 2 °crank angle resolution for a series of engine cycles. Spark-ignition tests were initially carried out to benchmark the operation of the engine with hydrogen against gasoline. DI of hydrogen after intake valve closure was found to be preferable in order to overcome problems related to backfiring and air displacement from hydrogens low density. HCCI combustion of hydrogen was initially enabled by means of a <b>pilot</b> <b>port</b> injection of n-heptane preceding the main direct injection of hydrogen, along with intake air preheating. Sole hydrogen fuelling HCCI was finally achieved and made sustainable, even at the low compression ratio of the optical engine by means of closed-valve DI, in synergy with air-pre-heating and negative valve overlap to promote internal EGR. Various operating conditions were analysed, such as fuelling in the range of air excess ratio 1. 2 - 3. 0 and intake air temperatures of 200 - 400 °C. Finally, both single and double injections per cycle were compared to identify their effects on combustion development. Copyright © 2009 SAE International...|$|E
