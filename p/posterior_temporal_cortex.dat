Bartzokis et al., has noted that there is a decrease in grey matter volume between adulthood and old age, whereas white matter volume was found to increase from age 19-40, and decline after this age. Studies using Voxel-based morphometry have identified areas such as the insula and superior parietal gyri as being especially vulnerable to age-related losses in grey matter of older adults. Sowell et al., reported that the first 6 decades of an individual's life were correlated with the most rapid decreases in grey matter density, and this occurred over dorsal, frontal, and parietal lobes on both interhemispheric and lateral brain surfaces. It is also worth noting that areas such as the cingulate gyrus, and occipital cortex surrounding the calcarine sulcus appear exempt from this decrease in grey matter density over time.

DTI scans were acquired from nineteen right-handed males and a deterministic tractography algorithm was used to identify connections between these regions implicated in tool use.

50|$|Evidence for {{the role}} of the arcuate {{fasciculus}} in language use is best represented by conduction aphasia, caused by damage to the inferior parietal lobule that extends into the subcortical white matter and damages the arcuate fasciculus. This type of aphasia inhibits the patient from repeating unfamiliar sounds. A study by Catani, Jones, and Ffytche (2005) provided the first anatomical evidence for the presence of two pathways between Wernicke’s area and Broca’s area. They found one deep pathway, interpreted to directly connect these two regions, and a shallower pathway that consists of two segments; the anterior segment connects frontal cortex with inferior parietal cortex, and the posterior segment connects Wernicke’s area with the inferior parietal cortex. Damage to the direct pathway may produce conduction aphasia, whereas damage to the indirect pathway spares the ability to repeat speech but impairs comprehension. The symptoms of conduction aphasia suggest that the connection between <b>posterior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>cortex</b> and frontal cortex plays a vital role in short-term memory of words and speech sounds that are new or have just been heard. The arcuate fasciculus connects these two regions and circulates information back and forth, possibly contributing to short-term memory.|$|E

To investigate age-related changes in the neural circuitry underlying overt non-lexical speech production, functional MRI was performed in 14 healthy younger (21 – 32 years) and 14 healthy older individuals (62 – 84 years).

For reading, neural networks also seem to be left-lateralized, comprising a network of frontal, temporoparietal, and occipitotemporal regions (Goswami 2008). Learning to read requires associating sounds with letters and the process of automatization of this ability (Haaxma 2006). The starting reader reads by decoding every single letter, a process which takes place in the gyrus angularis and the Broca area. Turkeltaub et al. (2003) found an increase in activity in left temporal and frontal areas in normal reading development, while activity in right posterior areas declined. This pattern shows the possibility that reading-related activity in the brain becomes more left-lateralized with development. Turkeltaub et al.

However, effects of individual genetic variations on dyslexia-associated deficits are only moderate and call for the assessment of the genotype’s impact on mediating neuro-endophenotypes by the imaging genetics approach. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in German participants with and without dyslexia, we investigated gray matter changes and their association with impaired phonological processing, such as reduced verbal working memory. These endophenotypical alterations were, together with dyslexia-associated genetic variations, examined on their suitability as potential predictors of dyslexia. We identified two gray matter clusters in the left <b>posterior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>cortex</b> related to verbal working memory capacity. Regional cluster differences correlated with genetic risk variants in TNFRSF 1 B. High-genetic-risk participants exhibit a structural predominance of auditory-association areas relative to auditory-sensory areas, which may partly compensate for deficient early auditory-sensory processing stages of verbal working memory. The reverse regional predominance observed in low-genetic-risk participants may in turn reflect reliance on these early auditory-sensory processing stages. Logistic regression analysis further supported that regional gray matter differences and genetic risk interact in the prediction of individuals' diagnostic status: With increasing genetic risk, the working-memory related structural predominance of auditory-association areas relative to auditory-sensory areas classifies participants with dyslexia versus control participants. Focusing on phonological deficits in dyslexia, our findings suggest endophenotypical changes in the left <b>posterior</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>cortex</b> could comprise novel pathomechanisms for verbal working memory-related processes translating TNFRSF 1 B genotype into the dyslexia phenotype...|$|E

The first two connections are implicated in a putative dorsal stream of speech perception, thought to involve translating auditory speech signals into motor representations. Thus, the current results suggest that flow of information during Imitation, starting at the <b>posterior</b> superior <b>temporal</b> <b>cortex</b> and ending in the motor cortex, enhances input to the motor cortex in the service of speech execution...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe four {{perceptually}} simple colors — red, green, {{yellow and}} blue — are {{a challenge to}} neuroscience, because no one has found cortical cells that represent color in terms of these ‘unique hues’ [1]. The chromatically selective cells at {{early stages of the}} primate visual system do not map on to the unique hues [2, 3]. Recently, however, Stoughton and Conway [4] have reported that the peak sensitivities of color cells in <b>posterior</b> inferior <b>temporal</b> <b>cortex</b> do cluster near the unique hues. The authors plot their results as a polar histogram: at each position on a hue circle, they show the number of cells that are maximally excited by that hue. There are three peaks in the histogram: one (the largest) falls close to unique red and another falls close to unique blue, while the third (less well-defined) lies in the yellow-green region. In fact, however, if the stimuli used in the experiment are plotted in a physiological color space, they form not a circle but an obtuse triangle. The peaks identified by Stoughton and Conway [4] fall at the apices of this triangle. Because these stimuli maximize the ratios of cone signals, they would maximally excite cells earlier in the visual system. So Stoughton and Conway's polar plot does not in itself show that cells of the <b>posterior</b> inferior <b>temporal</b> <b>cortex</b> represent unique hues, nor that they differ qualitatively in their behavior from chromatic cells at an earlier level...|$|R
40|$|Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) with 99 mTc-HMPAO {{was used to}} image 26 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 10 healthy controls. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data indicated a relative sparing of the occipital regions in DAT. Normalisation to occipital flow illustrated highly significant CBF deficits {{in a number of}} cortical regions, particularly in the left and right <b>posterior</b> [...] <b>temporal</b> <b>cortex</b> in DAT compared to controls. The cognitive performance of DAT patients was measured using a clinical cognitive assessment procedure (CAMCOG) and numerous correlations between these scores and rCBF were obtained. The implications and value of this investigative technique are discussed...|$|R
