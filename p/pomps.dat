2500|$|Treves {{was almost}} {{destroyed}} by the barbarians; yet the first petition of its few surviving nobles was that the emperor would re-establish the circus games as a remedy for the ruined city (vi. 15). And this was the prayer of Christians, whose baptismal oath pledged them to renounce [...] "the devil and his works ... the <b>pomps</b> and shows (spectacula)" [...] of this wicked world (vi. 6). Darker still were the iniquities of Carthage, surpassing even the unconcealed licentiousness of Gaul and Spain (iv. 5); and more fearful to Salvian than all else was it to hear men swear [...] "by Christ" [...] that they would commit a crime (iv. 15). It would be the atheist's strongest argument if God left such a state of society unpunished (iv. 12) - especially among Christians, whose sin, since they alone had the Scriptures, was worse than that of barbarians, even if equally wicked, would be (v. 2). But, {{as a matter of}} fact, the latter had at least some shining virtues mingled with their vices, whereas the Romans were wholly corrupt (vii. 15, iv. 14).|$|E

40|$|Partially {{observed}} Markov process (<b>POMP)</b> models, {{also known}} as hidden Markov models or state space models, are ubiquitous tools for time series analysis. The R package <b>pomp</b> provides a very flexible framework for Monte Carlo statistical investigations using nonlinear, non-Gaussian <b>POMP</b> models. A range of modern statistical methods for <b>POMP</b> models have been implemented in this framework including sequential Monte Carlo, iterated filtering, particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, approximate Bayesian computation, maximum synthetic likelihood estimation, nonlinear forecasting, and trajectory matching. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of these methodologies using some simple toy problems. We also illustrate the specification of more complex <b>POMP</b> models, using a nonlinear epidemiological model with a discrete population, seasonality, and extra-demographic stochasticity. We discuss the specification of user-defined models {{and the development of}} additional methods within the programming environment provided by <b>pomp.</b> Comment: In press at the Journal of Statistical Software.

40|$|Keratosis linearis with {{ichthyosis}} congenita and keratoderma (KLICK) is an {{autosomal recessive}} skin disorder {{associated with a}} single-nucleotide deletion in the 5 ′untranslated region of the proteasome maturation protein (<b>POMP)</b> gene. The deletion causes a relative switch in transcription start sites for <b>POMP,</b> predicted to decrease levels of <b>POMP</b> protein in terminally differentiated keratinocytes. To investigate the pathophysiology behind KLICK we created an in vitro model of the disease using siRNA silencing of <b>POMP</b> in epidermal air-liquid cultures. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue constructs revealed aberrant staining of <b>POMP,</b> proteasome subunits and the skin differentiation marker filaggrin when compared to control tissue constructs. The staining patterns of <b>POMP</b> siRNA tissue constructs showed strong resemblance to those observed in skin biopsies from KLICK patients. Western blot analysis of lysates from the organotypic tissue constructs revealed an aberrant processing of profilaggrin to filaggrin in samples transfected with siRNA against <b>POMP.</b> Knock-down of <b>POMP</b> expression in regular cell cultures resulted in decreased amounts of proteasome subunits. Prolonged silencing of <b>POMP</b> in cultured cells induced C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression consistent with an activation of the unfolded protein response and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The combined results indicate that KLICK is caused by reduced levels of <b>POMP,</b> leading to proteasome insufficiency in differentiating keratinocytes. Proteasome insufficiency disturbs terminal epidermal differentiation, presumably by increased ER stress, and leads to perturbed processing of profilaggrin. Our findings underline a critical role for the proteasome in human epidermal differentiation...|$|R

Limited proteolysis of the two forms of <b>POMP</b> showed that they had few if any peptides in common. The nonspecific antibiotic resistance of penB 2 was separated from the change in <b>POMP</b> by genetic transformation and by isolation of spontaneous penB mutants that showed no change in <b>POMP.</b> The genetic locus involved in the change from one <b>POMP</b> to another, which we have designated nmp- 1, is closely linked to, but not identical with, penB 2...|$|R

40|$|Proteasome {{inhibition}} {{represents a}} promising strategy of cancer pharmacotherapy, but resistant tumor cells often emerge. Here {{we show that}} the microRNA- 101 (miR- 101) targets the proteasome maturation protein <b>POMP,</b> leading to impaired proteasome assembly and activity, and resulting in accumulation of p 53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. miR- 101 -resistant <b>POMP</b> restores proper turnover of proteasome substrates and re-enables tumor cell growth. In ERα-positive breast cancers, miR- 101 and <b>POMP</b> levels are inversely correlated, and high miR- 101 expression or low <b>POMP</b> expression associates with prolonged survival. Mechanistically, miR- 101 expression or <b>POMP</b> knockdown attenuated estrogen-driven transcription. Finally, suppressing <b>POMP</b> is sufficient to overcome tumor cell resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Taken together, proteasome activity can not only be manipulated through drugs, but is also subject to endogenous regulation through miR- 101, which targets proteasome biogenesis to control overall protein turnover and tumor cell proliferation...|$|R

40|$|The {{proteasome}} is a multisubunit complex with {{a central}} role in non-lysosomal proteolysis and the processing of proteins for presentation by the MHC class I pathway. The 16 kDa proteasome maturation protein <b>POMP</b> (also named proteassemblin or hUmp 1) acts as a chaperone and is essential for the maturation of the 20 S proteasome proteolytic core complex. However, the exact mechanism, timing and localisation of mammalian proteasome assembly remains elusive. We sought to investigate the localisation of <b>POMP</b> within the cell and therefore purified the protein and produced a polyclonal antibody. For immunisation, <b>POMP</b> was overexpressed and purified from a bacterial GST-system. Interestingly, after removal of the GST-tag, <b>POMP</b> was hardly detectable by Coomassie blue- and Ponceau red-staining. However, with a reverse zinc-staining, the protein could easily be visualised. <b>POMP</b> was gel-filtrated and eluted from a calibrated chromatography column with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 64 kDa, suggesting that it forms tetramers. Moreover, localisation studies by immunofluorescence stainings and confocal microscopy revealed that <b>POMP</b> is present in the cytoplasm {{as well as in the}} nucleus...|$|R

60|$|But {{of all the}} amusements which a layman {{may follow}} and a clergyman may not, hunting {{is thought to be}} by much the worst. There is a savour of wickedness about it {{in the eyes of the}} old ladies which almost takes it out of their list of {{innocent}} amusements even for laymen. By the term old ladies it will be understood, perhaps, that I do not allude simply to matrons and spinsters who may be over the age of sixty, but to that most respectable portion of the world which has taught itself to abhor the <b>pomps</b> and vanities. <b>Pomps</b> and vanities are undoubtedly bad, and should be abhorred; but it behooves those who thus take upon themselves the duties of censors to be sure that the practices abhorred are in truth real <b>pomps</b> and actual vanities, not <b>pomps</b> and vanities of the imagination. Now as to hunting, I maintain that it is of itself the most innocent amusement going, and that it has none of that Cider-Cellar flavour with which the old ladies think that it is so savoury. Hunting is done by a crowd; but men who meet together to do wicked things meet in small parties. Men cannot gamble in the hunting-field, and drinking there is more difficult than in almost any other scene of life. Anonyma, as we were told the other day, may show herself; but if so, she rides alone. The young man must be a brazen sinner, too far gone for hunting to hurt him, who will ride with Anonyma in the field. I know no vice which hunting either produces or renders probable, except the vice of extravagance; and to that, if a man be that way given, every pursuit in life will equally lead him A seat for a Metropolitan borough, or a love of ortolans, or a taste even for new boots will ruin a man who puts himself in the way of ruin. The same may be said of hunting, the same and no more.|$|E
