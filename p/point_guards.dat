5|$|After graduating with {{a degree}} in sociology, Nash was {{selected}} 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns {{in the first round of}} the 1996 NBA draft. Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player. This was because despite his impressive college accomplishments, Nash had not played in one of the major college conferences. A major influence in Phoenix's choice was assistant coach Donnie Nelson, who met Nash back in high school as he was coached by Nelson's friend Ken Shields, and would eventually befriend the player as he played in Santa Clara. During his first two seasons in the NBA, Nash played a supporting role behind NBA star <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell, and later, Jason Kidd. Both Johnson and Cassell had NBA Finals experience, while Kidd was the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft and already an All-Star when he arrived at Phoenix.|$|E

As the September 28 {{training}} camp date approached, Morris was expected to battle with Tony Wroten for the backup point guard position behind Michael Carter-Williams.

On November 16, 2013 he scored a NBA regular season career high 20 points along with 2 assists in a 13598-point loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. On November 20, 2013, he was waived by the 76ers as part of roster moves that included signing Elliot Williams and Lorenzo Brown and waiving Kwame Brown. In December, {{he was one of}} several guards to work out with the Memphis Grizzlies. That month, he was also considered by the Los Angeles Lakers when Kobe Bryant was injured since <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> Blake, Nash and Jordan Farmar were all injured. The Lakers, however, decided to sign Kendall Marshall who was averageing 19.4 points and 9.6 assists in the D-League at the time.|$|E

Ulis had 30 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds.

On March 21, Brunson set the IHSA playoff single game scoring record against the Jahlil Okafor-led Whitney Young High School by scoring 56 {{points in a}} 7568 state playoff semifinal loss. In the game, still images of a movement by Brunson {{appeared to be an}} obscene gesture, but video of the gesture were deemed to be inconclusive and an initial suspension for the subsequent consolation game was overturned. Brunson averaged 26.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.9 steals for a Stevenson team that finished the season with a 322 record. Two members of his high school team were National Football League athletes' offspring: Matt Morrissey and Cameron Green.

50|$|After ball-handling, {{passing and}} scoring {{are the most}} {{important}} areas of the game for a <b>point</b> <b>guard.</b> As the primary decision-maker for a team, a <b>point</b> <b>guard's</b> passing ability determines how well a <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> is able to put his decision into play. It is one thing to be able to recognize the player that is in a tactically advantageous position, but it is another thing entirely to be able to deliver the ball to that player. For this reason, a <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> is usually, but not always, more skilled and focused on passing than shooting. However, a good jump shot and the ability to score off a drive to the basket are still valuable skills. A <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> will often use his ability to score in order to augment his effectiveness as a decision maker and play maker.|$|R
