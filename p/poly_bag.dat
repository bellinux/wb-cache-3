It seemed that A. gangetica plants in the shade did not compete with each other and were more competitive against A. compressus as could influence A. compressus height in the shade. It is concluded that although suppression of A. gangetica by A. compressus occurred under full sunlight, irrespective of plant density, this ability reduced under shade as A. compressus density decreased.

Among the various available biomarkers, adipose tissue {{is considered to be}} the best for the long term dietary intake but the invasive nature of tissue aspiration reduces its utility. Phlebotomy is a much less invasive method of sample collection when a large number of participants are involved in the study and therefore is an alternative, most suitable for large population based studies. In the present study fatty acid (with special emphasis on {{trans fatty acid}}) extraction from blood spotted and dried on filter paper was carried out to simplify the sample collection procedure and transportation. Methods Blood samples were collected from 19 healthy volunteers. The blood was spotted (30 spots of 10 μl each) on filter paper, dried at room temperature and stored at 4 °C in zip-lock <b>poly</b> <b>bags.</b> For comparison whole blood stored at - 70 °C was simultaneously analyzed. Results A good agreement was seen between trans fatty acid values obtained in dried blood and whole blood as evident from the pearson correlation coefficients ('r' for monounsaturated (trans) 0. 70 and for polyunsaturated (trans) 0. 692 respectively). The intraclass correlation coefficient for monounsaturated trans was 0. 805 and for polyunsarurated trans was 0. 776.

The drupes were divided in 3 diameter categories (i. e. 9 - 12, 12 - 15 and 15 - 18 mm) and the number of germinants were weekly counted for four weeks. The resulted seedlings were planted in <b>poly</b> <b>bags</b> containing rooting medium of soil and sand (1 : 1 ratio). Results of the study indicated that the seedling emergence was largest during second week irrespective of drupe size. Seedlings from 15 - 18 mm diameter class drupes recorded the highest seedling attributes followed by 12 - 15 mm and 9 - 12 mm classes. However, net assimilation rate and relative growth rate were highest in the seedlings obtained from 9 - 12 mm class drupes. With a few exceptions, first week emergents recorded the highest seedling attributes followed by second, third and fourth week germinants. Cluster analysis of the seedling attributes identified the seedlings belonging to 15 - 18 mm drupe size and emerging during first week as superior.

40|$|Population growth, urban {{expansion}} {{and economic development}} are increasing competition for water use between agriculture and other users. In addition, {{the high rate of}} soil degradation and declining soil moisture in the Sub-Saharan African Region have called for several crop production management and irrigation options to improve soil fertility, reduce water use by crops and produce 'more crops per drop of water'. Notwithstanding this, considerable variations exist in the literature on water-use efficiency, WUEcwu (economic yield per water used) for maize (Zea mays L.) across climates and soil management practices. Different views have been expressed on the effect of different rates of nitrogen (N) application on transpiration efficiency, TE (biomass produced per unit of water transpired). The objectives of the study were to assess the effect of different rates of N-enriched municipal waste co-compost and its derivatives on TE, WUEcwu and yield of maize (Z. mays L.) in comparison to inorganic fertiliser. The greenhouse pot experiment was conducted in Accra, Ghana on a sandy loam soil (Ferric Lixisol) using a split plot design. The main plot treatments were soil (S), dewatered faecal sludge (DFS), municipal solid waste compost (C), co-compost from municipal solid waste and dewatered faecal sludge (Co), compost enriched with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 (EC), co-compost enriched with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 (ECO), (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and NPK 15 - 15 - 15 +(NH 4) 2 SO 4. The sub-plot treatments were different rates of application of nitrogen fertiliser applied at the rate of 91, 150 and 210 kg Nha- 1 respectively. Maize cv. Abelehii was grown in a <b>poly</b> <b>bag</b> filled with 15 kg soil. Eight plants per treatment were selected randomly and used for the collection of data on growth parameters forth-nightly. At physiological maturity two plants per treatment were also selected randomly from each treatment plot for yield data. The results showed that TE of maize (Z. mays) varied for the different treatments and these are 6. 9 Pa in soil (S) alone to 8. 6 Pa in ECO. Increase in N application rate increased TE at the vegetative phase for fast nutrient releasing fertilisers (DFS, ECO, EC, NPK+(NH 4) 2 SO 4, (NH 4) 2 SO 4) and at the reproductive phase for slow nutrient releasing fertilisers (C and CO). Water-use efficiency increased significantly as rate of N application increased. Treatment ECO improved crop WUEcwu and was 11 % and 4 times higher than that for NPK+(NH 4) 2 SO 4 or soil alone; and 18 - 36 % higher than those for DFS and CO. Treatment ECO used less amount of water to produce dry matter yield (DMY) and grain yield (GY) that was 5. 2 % and 12. 6 %, respectively, higher than NPK+(NH 4) 2 SO 4. Similarly, the DMY and GY for ECO was 8. 9 - 18. 5 % and 23. 4 - 34. 7 %, respectively, higher than DFS and CO. High nutrient (N and K) uptake, TE, and low leaf senescence accounts for 83 % of the variations in DMY whereas WUEcwu accounts for 99 % of the variations in GY. Thus, the study concluded that different sources of fertiliser increased TE and WUEcwu of maize differently as N application rate increases.

40|$|Withania ashwagandha, {{belonging}} to the family Solanaceae, is an important medicinal herb of India with restricted geographic distribution. It is {{a rich source of}} withaferin A (WA) and other bioactive withanolides. In the present study a rapid in vitro mass propagation protocol of W. ashwagandha was developed from nodal explants. Nodal explants were cultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations and combinations of plant growth regulators (PGRs). The highest number of regenerated shoots per ex-plant (33 ± 2. 7) and highest WA (13. 4 ± 1. 15 mg/g of DW) production was obtained on MS medium supplemented with 5. 0 μM 6 -benzyladenine (BA) and 1. 0 μM Kinetin (Kn). In vitro raised shoots were further rooted on half-strength MS medium containing 2. 0 μM Indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) and analyzed forWA production. The rooted plantlets when transferred to <b>poly</b> <b>bags</b> in the greenhouse showed 90 % survival frequency. Levels of WA were higher in the in vitro and ex vitro derived shoot and root tissues as compared to field grown mother plants. In an attempt to further maximize WA production, shoot cultures were further grown in liquid MS medium supplemented with 5. 0 μM 6 -benzyladenine (BA) and 1. 0 μM Kinetin (Kn). Root cultures were grown on half strength MS liquid medium fortified with 2. 0 μMof IBA. WA production in the liquid cultures was significantly higher compared to the static composition of the same media. This protocol, first of its kind in this plant, can be successfully employed for conservation, proliferation and large-scale production of WA. The regenerated plants can also be used in traditional medicine as an alternative to naturally collected plants. University of Pretoria and National Research Foundation (NRF).

40|$|Abstract: To monitor {{respiratory}} climacteric {{behavior of}} grains {{due to global}} warming, a study was conducted using paddy, green gram, corn and cowpea at initial moisture contents of 10. 9 %, 8. 6 %, 8. 9 % and 10. 6 % respectively. These grains were packed in gunny and <b>poly</b> sack <b>bags</b> in 5 kg separately and placed in four temperature controlled insulated chambers where inside temperatures were maintained at 40, 270 (Ambient), 350, 400 & 450 C respectively. Thereafter, moisture content and 1000 grain weight of each commodity were taken for every 15 days intervals with three replicates in order to calculate dry matter loss against period of storage, stored temperature and type of packing materials. After 4 months of storage, the dry matter loss of paddy in poly sacks and gunny at 40, 270...|$|R
40|$|The Site Generated Radiological Waste Handling System handles {{radioactive}} waste {{products that are}} generated at the geologic repository operations area. The waste is collected, treated if required, packaged for shipment, and shipped to a disposal site. Waste streams include low-level waste (LLW) in solid and liquid forms, as-well-as mixed waste that contains hazardous and radioactive constituents. Liquid LLW is segregated into two streams, non-recyclable and recyclable. The non-recyclable stream may contain detergents or other non-hazardous cleaning agents and is packaged for shipment. The recyclable stream is treated to recycle {{a large portion of}} the water while the remaining concentrated waste is packaged for shipment; this greatly reduces the volume of waste requiring disposal. There will be no liquid LLW discharge. Solid LLW consists of wet solids such as ion exchange resins and filter cartridges, as-well-as dry active waste such as tools, protective clothing, and <b>poly</b> <b>bags.</b> Solids will be sorted, volume reduced, and packaged for shipment. The generation of mixed waste at the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) is not planned; however, if it does come into existence, it will be collected and packaged for disposal at its point of occurrence, temporarily staged, then shipped to government-approved off-site facilities for disposal. The Site Generated Radiological Waste Handling System has equipment located in both the Waste Treatment Building (WTB) and in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). All types of liquid and solid LLW are processed in the WTB, while wet solid waste from the Pool Water Treatment and Cooling System is packaged where received in the WHB. There is no installed hardware for mixed waste. The Site Generated Radiological Waste Handling System receives waste from locations where water is used for decontamination functions. In most cases the water is piped back to the WTB for processing. The WTB and WHB provide staging areas for storing and shipping LLW packages as well as any mixed waste packages. The buildings house the system and provide shielding and support for the components. The system is ventilated by and connects to the ventilation systems in the buildings to prevent buildup and confine airborne radioactivity via the high efficiency particulate air filters. The Monitored Geologic Repository Operations Monitoring and Control System will provide monitoring and supervisory control facilities for the system...|$|R
30|$|The {{riverbed}} drilling {{was carried}} out using boring machine and accessories that floated in the river by using approximately 16 square metres of pontoon. In order to avoid borehole walls from collapsing, steel casting HW size 114.3  mm O.D. and NW 88.9  mm O.D. was used. The boreholes were then washed by circulating water from drilling pump. Afterwards, the necessary soil samples were collected for visual examination and laboratory testing. In addition, the drilling process had been carried out in accordance with good practice as described in ASTM D 2113 - 14 (2014). The drilling focused on obtaining the core samples by penetrating the full depth of the strata. In {{order to get to}} that point, the non-retractable core barrels with 54.0  mm (N size) of core diameter were operated. In comparison, the sediment sampling method utilised a special sand bit of 30  mm diameter and 0.5  m length, connected to steel rods that used for drilling. The bit was driven into soil manually at certain depth through the river water level of 4.5  m. The method is also suitable to be conducted on self-supporting ground without hard obstructions or gravel-sized to boulder-sized particles. Subsequently, the sandy material trapped inside the bit was taken out from the drilled hole and kept in <b>poly</b> <b>bags</b> before sending in for laboratory test. As for this study, the standpipe method has been chosen to determine the riverbed permeability of Muda River Basin as it can be performed directly in river and produces adequate outcomes to measure in situ aquifer. Furthermore, the method is suitable to observe the key parameters involved in evaluating riverbank filtration in this study which are the riverbed permeability, the aquifer transmissivity and the hydrogeological setting. The method was firstly conducted by operating the in situ standpipe test at the location. Two standpipes of uPVC material with 75  mm and 100  mm (D) diameter were carefully inserted into the river streambed to minimise any disturbance on the hyporheic layer. The standpipe of 117  mm depth (Lv) was then vertically inserted into the riverbed. Streambed sediment of 150  mm height (Lv) was expected to fill the bottom part of the pipes. The pipe was in vertical position, while the river water is pour into the standpipes. The changes by which the levels drop to the surface water level (h 1 and h 2) and the time taken (t 1 and t 2) each drop were measured, respectively.|$|R
