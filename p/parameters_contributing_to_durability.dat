40|$|The {{extent to}} which an {{organosilane}} surface treatment regime can promote durability enhancement of an adhesively bonded aluminium alloy system has been determined. Results have revealed the range of application and film-conditioning <b>parameters</b> which <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> joint <b>durability</b> in a simple Boeing wedge joint. Organosilane solution parameters relating to solvent type, solution concentration, pH and hydrolysis time have all been shown <b>to</b> influence resultant <b>durability.</b> Interestingly, parameters such as film drying temperature and in-process time delay (time interval between application of the organosilane to the alloy surface and subsequent bonding) have little influence on joint performance. The factors responsible for the durability variations observed have been considered using various surface analytical techniques. Superficially, failure surfaces indicative of interfacial failure between substrate and adhesive have been observed. More detailed characterisation using both XPS and SIMS has indicated failure processes associated with a 'diffusion zone' comprising aluminium oxide and the organosilane.

40|$|Abstract. Conjoint {{analysis}} aims at measuring preferences {{on a set}} {{of options}} that are elements in the Cartesian product of parameter sets. Preferences are measured jointly, e. g., by comparing two options, where all <b>parameters</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the outcome of the comparison. For optimizing the options and for deriving preference models from measurements it is helpful to know how much each <b>parameter</b> sets <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the observed result, or at least which <b>parameters</b> <b>contributed</b> more than others. In a strict lexicographic preference order one parameter decides the outcome and only if the same value for this parameter is present in the compared options, the second most important parameter becomes decisive. In practice a strict lexicographic preference model often may not be adequate, but still some parameters can be more important than others. We discuss methods to measure a lexicographic bias in linear conjoint analysis models, i. e., we quantify how close this model is to a strict lexicographic ordering in a metric sense. We apply our methods to data sets obtained in two conjoint measurement studies. ...|$|R

We assume CP symmetry and a U(3) ^ 5 symmetry in the UV matching onto the dimension six operators, dominantly {{broken by the}} Standard Model Yukawa matrices. Corrections to these observables are predicted using the input parameters {α̂_ew, M̂_Z, Ĝ_F, m̂_t, m̂_h} extracted with one loop corrections in the same limit. We show that at one loop the number of SMEFT <b>parameters</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the precise LEPI pseudo-observables exceeds the number of measurements. As a result the SMEFT <b>parameters</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> LEP data are formally unbounded when the size of loop corrections are reached until other data is considered in a global analysis. The size of these loop effects is generically a correction of order ∼% to leading effects in the SMEFT, but we find multiple large numerical coefficients in our calculation at this order. We use a MS scheme, modified for the SMEFT, for renormalization. Some subtleties involving novel evanescent scheme dependence present in this result are explained.
