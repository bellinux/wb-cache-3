40|$|Abstract Background. The <b>protein</b> {{equivalent}} of <b>nitrogen</b> appearance is an indirect index {{commonly used to}} assess dietary protein intake in patients on CAPD. Moreover {{it has been suggested}} that the ratio between nitrogen appearance and dietary nitrogen intake (fractional urea synthesis) can predict nitrogen balance in uraemic patients. Several formulae to dir-ectly calculate the <b>protein</b> {{equivalent of}} <b>nitrogen</b> appearance have been published. It has not been established, however, what formulae give the most appropriate estimate of <b>protein</b> intake and <b>nitrogen</b> appearance. Study design. Nitrogen balance studies were carried out in seven stable patients on CAPD. All of the patients were receiving a diet whose protein con-tent (1. 2 g/kg/body wt/day) and calorie content (35 kcal/kg/body wt/day) were rigorously controlled. Six formulae for calculating <b>protein</b> equivalent of <b>nitrogen</b> appearance and nitrogen appearance were tested and the agreement of the estimating formulae was evaluated by means of the Bland and Altman method. Result. Net nitrogen balance was 1. 68 ± 0. 9 g/N day, protein intake (g/day) 81 + 19, protein intake (g/kg) 1. 05 + 0. 17. Differences in <b>protein</b> equivalent of <b>nitrogen</b> appearance of up to about 20 % were found. The smallest differences between <b>protein</b> equi-valent of <b>nitrogen</b> appearance and <b>protein</b> intake were obtained by the formulae of Bergstrom (1 + 7 g, limits of agreement — 12 and + 15 g) and Blumenkrantz (— 2 ± 5 g, limits of agreement — 11 and + 7 g). The formula of Bergstrom most closely estimated nitrogen appearance (— 0. 35 + 0. 89 g). Using such formula, the fractional urea synthesis was 54 + 12 %, giving evidence of positive nitrogen balances. Conclusion. For the routine monitoring of <b>protein</b> equivalent of <b>nitrogen</b> appearance in CAPD patients, we recommend Bergstrom's formula with the deter-mination of dialysate protein losses.

5000|$|Mycoprotein means protein from fungi. The main {{mycoprotein}} {{on sale in}} Europe and North America {{is called}} Quorn. It was originally developed as a food source to combat food shortages. [...] All Quorn products contain mycoprotein derived from the fungus Fusarium venenatum. The fungus is grown in vats using glucose syrup as food. A fermentation vat {{is filled with the}} growth medium and then inoculated with the fungal spores. The F. venenatum culture respires aerobically, so for it to grow at an optimum rate, it is supplied with oxygen, and carbon dioxide is drawn from the vat. To make <b>protein,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (in the form of ammonia) is added and vitamins and minerals are needed to support growth. The vat is kept at a constant temperature, also optimized for growth; the fungus can double its mass every five hours.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition. There are multiple systems which rate proteins by their usefulness to an organism based on their relative percentage of amino acids and, in some systems, the digestibility of the protein source. They include biological value, net protein utilization, and PDCAAS (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acids Score). Also see complete <b>protein,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> balance and protein combining. The PDCAAS {{was developed by the}} FDA as an improvement over the Protein efficiency ratio (PER) method. The PDCAAS rating is a fairly recent evaluation method; it was adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) in 1993 as [...] "the preferred 'best'" [...] method to determine protein quality. These organizations have suggested that other methods for evaluating the quality of protein are inferior.|$|E
