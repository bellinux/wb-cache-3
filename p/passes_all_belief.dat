The clustering process is used as the means for separating the belief functions into subsets that should be handled independently. While the conflicting metalevel evidence is generated internally from pairwise conflicts of <b>all</b> <b>belief</b> functions, the attracting metalevel evidence is assumed given by some external source.

30|$|Coherentism is {{an answer}} to the problem of solving the regress problem which foundationalism offers, but this will be {{discussed}} later [18]. Coherentism does not begin with basic <b>beliefs</b> on which <b>all</b> other <b>beliefs</b> stand, but rather looks at <b>all</b> <b>beliefs</b> because they are equally in need of justification. So a belief could be justified since it is coherent with other <b>beliefs</b> surrounding it. <b>All</b> the <b>beliefs</b> in one system together provide the justification for each of the other <b>beliefs</b> because <b>all</b> combined build a coherent system [2, 15, 17 – 19].|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} mechanism design {{problems in}} which agents perceive Knightian uncertainty. Uncertainty is formalized using incomplete preferences, as in Bewley (1986). Without completeness, individual decision making {{depends on a}} set of beliefs, and an action is preferred to another if and only if it has larger expected utility for <b>all</b> <b>beliefs</b> in this set. We consider two natural notions of incentive compatibility in this setting: maximal incentive compatibility requires that no strategy has larger expected utility than truth-telling for <b>all</b> <b>beliefs,</b> while optimal incentive compatibility requires that truth-telling has larger expected utility than all other strategies for <b>all</b> <b>beliefs.</b> In a model with a continuum of types, we show that optimal incentive compatibility is equivalent to ex-post incentive compatibility under fairly general conditions on beliefs. In a model with a discrete type space, we characterize full extraction of rents from private information. We show that full extraction requires sufficient disagreement in beliefs across types for optimal incentive compatible mechanisms. Contrary to the standard Bayesian case, we show that full extraction in optimal incentive compatible mechanisms is not generically possible...|$|R
