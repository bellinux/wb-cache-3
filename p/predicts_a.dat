Theoretical calculation in a quantum tunneling model reproduces the experimental alpha decay half-life data for the known darmstadtium isotopes. It also predicts that the undiscovered isotope 294Ds, which has a magic number of neutrons (184), would have an alpha decay half-life on the order of 311years: exactly the same approach <b>predicts</b> <b>a</b> ~3500-year alpha half-life for the non-magic 293Ds isotope, however.|$|E

Miyazaki was awarded the Academy Honorary Award at the Governors Awards in November 2014. He is currently developing Boro the Caterpillar, a computer-animated short film which was first discussed during pre-production for Princess Mononoke. It will be screened exclusively at the Studio Ghibli Museum in July 2017. He is also working on an untitled samurai manga. In August 2016, Miyazaki proposed a new feature-length film, titled How Do You Live?. He began animation work on the project without receiving official approval. He hopes to complete the film by 2019, though Suzuki <b>predicts</b> <b>a</b> 2020–2021 release.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Saadanius provides new evidence for competing hypotheses about the facial {{appearance of the}} ancestral crown catarrhines, or common ancestor. One reconstruction is based on living catarrhine traits and <b>predicts</b> <b>a</b> short face and a rounded braincase, {{similar to that of}} a gibbon. Another reconstruction, based on the morphology of early Miocene apes and the basal cercopithecoid Victoriapithecus, predicts that the last common ancestor had a projecting snout and tall face, like that of living baboons and the oldest fossil apes and Old World monkeys. The conservative features of Saadanius, {{similar to those of the}} older stem catarrhines, support the latter hypothesis, according to Zalmout et al. However, one palaeontologist, Eric Delson, has cautioned that geological pressure may have distorted the shape of the skull.|$|E

5|$|At ambient conditions, {{americium}} {{is present}} in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P63/mmc with lattice parameters a= 346.8pm and c= 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fmm and lattice constant a= 489pm. This fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also <b>predicts</b> <b>a</b> significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium.|$|E
5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (mass) density of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' low-energy thermal state with little internal temperature gradient, and an 'excited' high-energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a low-energy state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model <b>predicts</b> <b>a</b> low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Presently, {{there is}} much {{interest}} in how students study and what skills best facilitate their academic performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how students’ conceptions of knowledge, approaches to learning, and personality relate to academic success. An online survey was completed by 198 first-year tertiary students, including 116 off-campus psychology students. This paper will report the relationships among the key variables. As expected, Quick Learning and Simple Knowledge variables positively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Surface learning approach. In contrast, Innate Ability, Simple Knowledge, and Certain Knowledge variables negatively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Deep learning approach. Innate Ability negatively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Strategic learning approach. However, students’ conceptions of knowledge did not <b>predict</b> academic success. <b>As</b> expected, students who adopted a Surface learning approach experienced lower academic success. Contrary to expectations, however, Deep and Strategic learning approaches did not positively predict academic success. An interesting finding was that Intellect positively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Deep learning approach. Further, Conscientiousness, Intellect, and Emotional Stability positively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Strategic learning approach and negatively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Surface learning approach. Personality also predicted academic success. Neuroticism negatively predicted academic success; Conscientiousness positively predicted academic success. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
