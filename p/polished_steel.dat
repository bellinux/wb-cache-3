5|$|There are varying tales {{as to the}} {{inspiration}} for Deere to create the invention he is famed for, the steel plow. In one version he recalled the way the <b>polished</b> <b>steel</b> pitchfork tines moved through hay and soil and thought that the same effect could be obtained for a plow. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall. Crandall spread word of his success with Deere's plow quickly, and two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841 he was manufacturing 75 plows per year, and 100 plows per year in 1876.|$|E

Large sculptures from that series were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2008. Later additions to the series include Balloon Swan (2004–2011), an 11.5-foot (3.5-meter), stainless-steel bird, Balloon Rabbit (2005–2010), and Balloon Monkey, all for which children's party favors are reconceived as mesmerizing monumental forms.|$|E

25|$|The Bocuse Restaurant serves {{contemporary}} French food. It {{opened on}} May 5, 2012 after a $3 million renovation designed by Adam Tihany. Originally the Epicurian Room, and renamed the Escoffier Restaurant in 1974, the restaurant originally served classical French cuisine in an old-fashioned formal French dining room. It had French chandeliers, gilded mirrors, patterned carpets, and high-backed chairs. The redesign intended it to now resemble a brasserie, with <b>polished</b> <b>steel</b> lights, smoked-oak floors, and bentwood armchairs.|$|E
25|$|The Exeter Book, an {{original}} manuscript {{and one of}} the most important documents in Anglo-Saxon literature, is kept in the vaults of the cathedral. The Exeter Book dates back to the 10th century and is one of four manuscripts that between them contain virtually all the surviving poetry in Old English. It includes most of the more highly regarded shorter poems, some religious pieces, and a series of riddles, a handful of which are famously lewd. Some of the riddles are inscribed on a highly <b>polished</b> <b>steel</b> obelisk in the High Street, placed there on 30 March 2005.|$|E
25|$|Valencians use {{the word}} paella for all pans in the Valencian language, {{including}} the specialized shallow pan used for cooking paellas. However, in most other parts of Spain and throughout Hispanic America where the Spanish language is spoken (as opposed to the Valencian language), the term paellera ("paella pan") is more commonly used for the specialised pan while paella is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it, although both terms are deemed correct for the pan, as stated by the Royal Spanish Academy, the body responsible for regulating the Spanish language in Spain. Paelleras are traditionally round, shallow, and made of <b>polished</b> <b>steel</b> with two handles.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the facility is above ground. The only part that is underground is a subterranean corridor that links cellblocks to the lobby. Inmates spend 23 hours a day locked in their cells and are escorted by {{a minimum of three}} officers for their five hours of private recreation per week. Each cell has a desk, a stool, and a bed, which are almost entirely made out of poured concrete, as well as a toilet that shuts off if blocked, a shower that runs on a timer to prevent flooding, and a sink lacking a potentially dangerous tap. Rooms may also be fitted with <b>polished</b> <b>steel</b> mirrors bolted to the wall, an electric light that can be shut off only remotely, a radio, and on rare occasions, a black-and-white television that shows recreational, educational, and religious programming. In addition, all cells are soundproofed to prevent prisoners from communicating with each other via Morse code.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{generation}} iPod Shuffle featured a <b>polished</b> <b>steel</b> attachment clip, adopting {{for the first}} time the <b>polished</b> <b>steel</b> finishing previously found only on the larger iPods, rather than the brushed aluminum used in the second-generation iPod Shuffle. It also no longer had volume or track controls on the device itself. Instead, the packaged iPod earbuds included a three-button device on the right earbud cord. This added the functions of changing between playlists, hearing the song title and artist of the track playing, as well as play/pause, track changes and volume control. It originally was not possible to change songs or volume with most third-party headphones, since they lacked these controls. However, since the device began playing music automatically when it was turned on, third-party headphones could still be used in [...] "autoplay" [...] mode (with no volume or playback controls), and after its release, some third-party headphones and headphone adapters began to include full support for the {{third generation}}. The official headphones contained a chip designed by Apple to control the device. DRM is not however present in the chip as there is no encryption used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coefficient}} of friction of plastics is usually measured against <b>polished</b> <b>steel.</b> PTFE's {{coefficient of}} friction is 0.05 to 0.10, which is the third-lowest of any known solid material (BAM being the first, with a {{coefficient of friction}} of 0.02; diamond-like carbon being second-lowest at 0.05). PTFE's resistance to van der Waals forces means {{that it is the}} only known surface to which a gecko cannot stick. [...] In fact, PTFE can be used to prevent insects climbing up surfaces painted with the material. PTFE is so slippery that insects cannot get a grip and tend to fall off. For example, PTFE is used to prevent ants climbing out of formicaria.|$|E

2500|$|... "Mr. Horne Tooke", writes Hazlitt, [...] "was {{in private}} company, and among his friends, the {{finished}} gentleman {{of the last}} age. His manners were as fascinating as his conversation was spirited and delightful." [...] Yet [...] "his mind, and {{the tone of his}} feelings were modern." [...] He delighted in raillery, and prided himself on his cool, even temper. [...] "He was a man of the world, a scholar bred, and a most acute and powerful logician ... his intellect was like a bow of <b>polished</b> <b>steel,</b> from which he shot sharp-pointed poisoned arrows at his friends in private, at his enemies in public." [...] Yet his thinking was one-sided: [...] "he had no imagination ... no delicacy of taste, no rooted prejudices or strong attachments".|$|E

Yet – when the dreadful steel was plunged into the breast – cutting through veins – arteries – flesh – nerves – I needed no injunctions not to restrain my cries. I began a scream that lasted unintermittingly during the whole time of the incision – & I almost marvel that it rings not in my Ears still? so excruciating was the agony. When the wound was made, & the instrument was withdrawn, the pain seemed undiminished, for the air that suddenly rushed into those delicate parts felt like a mass of minute but sharp & forked poniards, that were tearing the edges of the wound. I concluded the operation was over – Oh no! presently the terrible cutting was renewed – & worse than ever, to separate the bottom, the foundation of this dreadful gland from the parts to which it adhered – Again all description would be baffled – yet again all was not over, – Dr. Larry rested but his own hand, & – Oh heaven! – I then felt the knife (rack)ling against the breast bone – scraping it! ...|$|E

In the 18th century, part of the ruins of the church had been used by a tanner, a thread manufacturer, and for grinding glass and <b>polishing</b> <b>steel.</b> The surrounding area became industrialised.
