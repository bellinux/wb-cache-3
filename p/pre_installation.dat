40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} a simple technique in pre feasible design of grid-connected photovoltaic {{systems for the}} application in all energy sectors. A user-friendly simulation tool named Pre-Installation Design for GCPV (PIDGCPV) was developed to assist PV installer or any energy consumer in preliminary evaluation on PV system sizing to avoid over/under size of system. The developed simulation tool uses an iterative method embedded in Macro Excel integrated with Microsoft Visual Basic application. The simulation tool covers three constraints, which are space, energy requirement and budget. The iterative method {{is used for the}} selection of optimal number of photovoltaic (PV) module and inverter for a proposed system. In addition, a database for PV modules, inverters, and meteorological data for each state in Malaysia is also embedded in the software. The analysis shows straightforward comparison between the simulated result and the actual installed data based on the constraint selection. It indicates that the capability of the developed simulation tool is giving higher accuracy and can be used as <b>pre</b> <b>installation</b> design tool...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present {{critical}} factors that constitute a successful implementation of the Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) in Small Medium Enterprise (SME). Many large companies have applied AMT and the applications have shown significant results in this global market era. Conveniently, these phenomenons are also engaged to Small Medium Enterprises (SME) that of high demands on performing high quality product, fast delivery, reliable and more flexible. The implementation of AMT follow several processes namely <b>pre</b> <b>installation,</b> installation, improvement and mature. In order to guarantee the succesfull of running these processes, one should consider the Critical Success Factors (CSF). We conducted a survey to 125 SMEs that have implemented AMT, and found that the CSF for each process are moderately different. Good leadership is the main critical success factor for preparing and installation of the AMT. Once the AMT started or installed and arrived at growth stage, the financial availability factor turns into a critical success factor in the AMT implementation. In, mature stage, the support and commitment of top management becomes an important factor for gaining successful implementation. By means of factor analysis, we could point out that strategic factors are the main factors in pre-installation and installation stage. Finally, in the growth stage and mature stage, both tactical and strategic factors are the important factors in the successful of AMT implementatio...|$|E
40|$|With Smartphones {{becoming}} {{an increasingly important}} part of human life, the security of these devices is very much at stake. The versatility of these phones and their associated applications has fostered {{an increasing number of}} mobile malware attacks. The purpose of the research was to answer the following research questions: 1. What are the existing methods for analysing mobile malware? 2. How can methods for analysing mobile malware be evaluated? 3. What would comprise a suitable test bed(s) for analysing mobile malware? The research analyses and compares the various tools and methods available for compromising the Android OS and observing the malware activity before and after its installation onto an Android emulator. Among several available tools and methods, the approach made use of online scanning engines to perform <b>pre</b> <b>installation</b> of mobile malware analysis and the AppUse (Android Pentest Platform Unified Standalone Environment) tool to perform post installation. Both the above approaches facilitate better analysis of mobile malware before and after being installed onto the mobile device. This is because, with malware being the root cause of many security breaches, the developed mobile malware analysis allows future security practitioners in this field to determine if newly developed applications are malicious and, if so, what would their effect be on the target. In addition, the AppUse tool can allow security practitioners to first establish the behaviour of post installed malware infections onto the Android emulator then be able to effectively eliminate malware from individual systems as well as the Google Play Store. Moreover, mobile malware analysis can help with a successful incident response, assisting with mitigating the loss of intellectual property, personal information as well as other critical private data. It can strive to limit the damage of a security breach or to reduce the scope of damage of an attack. The basic structure of the research work began with a dynamic analysis, followed by a static analysis: a) Mobile malware were collected and downloaded from the Contagio website to compromise an Android emulator, b) Mobile malware were uploaded onto five online scanning engines for dynamic analysis to perform <b>pre</b> <b>installation</b> analysis, and c) AppUse tool was implemented and used for static analysis to perform post installation analysis by making use of its: a. Android emulator and, b. JD-GUI and Dex 2 Jar tools. The findings were that the AppUse methodology used in the research was successful but the outcome was not as anticipated. This was because the installed malicious applications on the Android emulator did not generate the derived behavioural reports; instead, only manifest files in xml format. To overcome this issue, JD-GUI and Dex 2 Jar tools were used to manually generate the analysis results from the Android emulator to analyse malware behaviour. The key contribution of this research work is the proposal of a dynamic pre-installation and a static post-installation analysis of ten distinct Android malware samples. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on post installation of mobile malware analysis {{and this is the first}} research that uses the AppUse tool for mobile malware analysis...|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{urban traffic}} control systems {{frequently}} require precise traffic measurements and fast communications {{in order to}} achieve desired performance levels. Such requirements may hinder the adoption of these beneficial control systems because of the installation and maintenance costs involved. The recently developed TUC strategy has been conceived in a way that simplifies measurement requirements and yet achieves performance levels comparable to other well-established commercial systems. This was a major motivation to select TUC for a traffic control center installation in a mid-sized Brazilian city aiming at improving the traffic conditions despite the lack of wired communication between roadside controllers and the central control room. A description of the implemented system is presented, followed by field data comparing <b>pre</b> and post <b>installation</b> traffic behavior. It is found that TUC leads to a 15 - 25 % improvement in average network speed compared with pre-existing time-of-day plans...|$|R
40|$|Governments have {{installed}} elements of Monitoring Safe City (MSC) to reduce crime displacement and diffusion in crime targeted areas. The elements include closed-circuit televisions, security mirrors, bulk streets, separation of pedestrians and bike paths and barrier streets. Foregoing {{analysis on the}} effectiveness of MSC consists of three analyses which are Crime Experience Indicator (CEI), Crime Reduction Indicator (CRI) and Monitoring Safe City Element Coverage Area (MSCCA). CEI analysis does not measure control area coverage, CRI analysis does not measure the value of crime in the buffer area and the time intervals of research data set, while MSCCA analysis only calculates the percentage rate of MSC without considering the comparison results from <b>pre</b> and post <b>installations</b> within a target area. This research proposed that Weighted Displacement Quotient (WDQ) commonly used for analyzing crime displacement and diffusion be enhanced by applying Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in the target area. This WDQKDE technique includes target area, buffer area, and control area as the three key factors identified before and after installation of MSC. Based on the technique, a research model consisting of pre-procession process, development of model, integration data and visualization of results onto Geography Information System (GIS) maps was developed. Results generated from the model would display crime displacement and diffusion based on MSC elements by using color cartography. Green indicates a positive value for diffusion whereas red indicates a negative value for crime displacement. If white appears, there is no effect after the installation of MSC. The proposed model can serve as a guide for related agencies to analyze whether installation and addition of MSC elements have any influence in the decision making for changing the location of crime and diffusion in a crime prone are...|$|R
40|$|Advance Manufacturing Technology (AMT) possess {{tremendous}} {{advantages and}} challenges for organizations. Based {{on the previous}} studies of AMT implementation, we investigated the impact of conducting a proper technical need analysis on <b>pre</b> <b>installation</b> phase of AMT implementation to the overall performance. Our research was designed to manipulate several factors of technical need analysis, inconvenienced factors of implementation phase and performance factors of post implementation phase, by surveying 102 plants that had implemented advance-manufacturing process on apparel industry in Sri Lanka {{over the past five}} years. The questionnaire was designed by means of operational and concepts chart, which was made by analyzing the various critical factors that were influencing to success implementation of AMT in global context. The results indicated that the key to successful AMT planning is conducting of a Technical Need Analysis, which ultimately defines the path throughout the project. This laid a strong foundation for implementation and commissioning of needful AMT, provided the necessary and adequate organizational infrastructure to a selected manufacturing system. Further, we can conclude that for some extent Sri Lankan apparel entrepreneurs focus on a technical need analysis. Even in such an analysis, they mostly concern on technical aspects, but less attention given on financial, organizational and operational related factors. The fact of overall performance of AMT implementation is not attaining to a satisfactory level is further reflected with the above results. We were unable to gain a variety of technological implementation in our survey, as most of the firms did not have a proper inventory of such adaptations. In addition, difficulties aroused to collect data on AMTs for the last five years. In some cases, the entrepreneurs not willing to reveal their technical and business updates due to competitiveness of apparel industry. Further research could be carried out in the field of Sri Lankan apparel industry in the areas of evaluating opportunities and barriers to automation related AMT and evaluating cost benefits of design software tools to the SME entrepreneurs...|$|E
