5|$|Until {{his final}} years, Wagner's life was characterised by <b>political</b> <b>exile,</b> {{turbulent}} love affairs, poverty and repeated flight from his creditors. His controversial writings on music, drama and politics have attracted extensive comment, notably, {{since the late}} 20th century, where they express antisemitic sentiments. The effect of his ideas can be traced {{in many of the}} arts throughout the 20th century; his influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, the visual arts and theatre.|$|E
5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, many shrines {{were built}} on former pagan sites which became popular pilgrimage destinations, while other pilgrims visited {{prominent}} monasteries and sites of learning. Senior nobles or kings would travel to Rome, {{which was a}} popular destination from the 7th century onwards; sometimes these trips were a form of convenient <b>political</b> <b>exile.</b> Under the Normans, religious institutions with important shrines, such as Glastonbury, Canterbury and Winchester, promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations, maximising {{the value of the}} historic miracles associated with the sites. Accumulating relics became an important task for ambitious institutions, as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site. Indeed, by the 12th century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England, adding to the attractiveness of pilgrimages to prominent relics.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1840s, Mary Shelley {{found herself}} {{the target of}} three {{separate}} blackmailers. In 1845, an Italian <b>political</b> <b>exile</b> called Gatteschi, whom she had met in Paris, threatened to publish letters she had sent him. A friend of her son's bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi's papers, including the letters, which were then destroyed. Shortly afterwards, Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G. Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron. Also in 1845, Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley. He said he would suppress it in return for £250, but Mary Shelley refused.|$|E

5000|$|... 1667 saw {{the arrival}} of first Muslim <b>political</b> <b>exiles</b> banished by the Dutch to the Cape. These <b>political</b> <b>exiles</b> or Orang Cayen were Muslim men of wealth and {{influence}} who were banished to the Cape from their homeland in the East because the Dutch feared them {{as a threat to}} their political and economic hegemony. The first <b>political</b> <b>exiles</b> were the rulers of Sumatra. They were Sheikh Abdurahman Matabe Shah and Sheikh Mahmood. Both were buried in Constantia. From the very outset the Cape authorities accommodated the exiles away from Cape Town as they feared the exiles would escape. A tomb for these <b>political</b> <b>exiles</b> has been erected on [...] "Islam Hill" [...] in Constantia in the Cape. Sheikh Abdurahman Matebe Shah used his exile to consolidate the teaching of Islam among slaves in the Cape.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to Jayaprakash Narayan's {{call for a}} Total Revolution, Reddy emerged from his <b>political</b> <b>exile</b> in 1975. In January 1977, he was made {{a member of the}} Committee of the Janata Party and in March, he fought the General Election from the Nandyal constituency in Andhra Pradesh as a Janata Party candidate. He was the only non-Congress candidate to be elected from Andhra Pradesh. The Congress Party led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was defeated, ending 30 years of Congress rule in India and a five party coalition with Morarji Desai as its leader came to power. Reddy was unanimously elected Speaker of the Sixth Lok Sabha on 26 March 1977. However he resigned a few months later to contest in the presidential elections of July 1977. Reddy's second term as Speaker lasted three months and 17 days and remains till date the shortest tenure for anyone to have held that post.|$|E

Once, Su was angry with his young son for not understanding his unhappiness during his <b>political</b> <b>exile.</b> Wang chided Su for his silliness, prompting Su to write the domestic poem Young Son (《小兒》).|$|E

25|$|Rodríguez {{has been}} most {{influenced}} by her <b>political</b> <b>exile</b> from Chile and her transition into life in a foreign country. Her flight caused her to reflect on exile, living in different cultures, and speaking different languages. Her bilingualism, and the translation between two languages, {{has also been a}} source of both difficulty and inspiration for Rodríguez. As a result of her experiences and life torn between two nations, Rodríguez does not identify as solely Canadian, nor as solely Chilean (Silvera 209). Rather, she defines herself as Chilean-Canadian (Silvera 209).|$|E

25|$|The typical protagonist in {{the works}} of Pavese is a loner, through choice or through circumstances. His {{relationships}} with men and women tend to be temporary and superficial. He may wish to have more solidarity with other people, but he often ends up betraying his ideals and friends; for example in The Prison, the <b>political</b> <b>exile</b> in a village in Southern Italy receives a note from another political confinato living nearby, who suggests a meeting. The protagonist rejects a show of solidarity and refuses to meet him. The title of the collection of the two novellas is Before the Cock Crows, a reference to Peter's betrayal of Christ before his death.|$|E
25|$|After a {{long period}} of <b>political</b> <b>exile,</b> Su {{received}} a pardon in 1100 and was posted to Chengdu. However, he died in Changzhou, Jiangsu province after his period of exile and while he was en route to his new assignment in the year 1101. Su Shi was 64 years old. After his death he gained even greater popularity, as people sought to collect his calligraphy, paintings depicting him, stone inscriptions marking his visit to numerous places, and built shrines in his honor. He was also depicted in artwork made posthumously, such as in Li Song's (1190–1225) painting of Su traveling in a boat, known as Su Dongpo at Red Cliff, after Su Song's poem written about a 3rd-century Chinese battle.|$|E
25|$|The life of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (born Nicolae Georgescu) spanned {{most of the}} 20th century, from 1906 to 1994. In {{his native}} Romania, he lived through two world wars and three dictatorships before he fled the country. Living in <b>political</b> <b>exile</b> in the US {{in the second part}} of his life, he {{witnessed}} at a distance the rise and fall of socialism in Romania. He made many important contributions to mainstream neoclassical economics before he finally turned against it and published his paradigmatic magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. Although this opus was seminal in establishing ecological economics as an independent academic subdiscipline in economics, Georgescu-Roegen died disappointed and bitter that his paradigmatic work did not receive the appreciation he had expected for it in his own lifetime.|$|E

This is being examined on the example of Vyatka province where there were the main remonstrative forms of which <b>political</b> <b>exiles</b> took advantage {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century, as well as the ways police reacted on their actions...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of the 1989 student protests and {{building}} takeovers concerning tuition increases, a community action center was opened on the campus called the Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Community and Student Center, located in the NAC building. The center was named after CUNY alums and radical freedom fighters Assata Shakur and Guillermo Morales, both of whom are now in <b>political</b> <b>exile</b> in Cuba. Students and neighborhood residents who used the Center for community organizing against issues of racism, alleged police brutality, and the privatization and militarization of CUNY faced constant repression or opposition from the City College administration for years. After a long controversy, on October 20, 2013, City College seized the Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Community and Student Center {{in the middle of the}} night, provoking a student demonstration.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 2007, Hasina {{was arrested}} by state police at her home and taken before a local court in Dhaka. She was accused of {{extortion}} and denied bail, and was held in a building converted into a jail on the premises of the National Parliament. The Awami League said the arrest was politically motivated. On 17 July 2007, the Anti-Corruption Commission sent notices to both Hasina and Khaleda Zia, instructing them to provide details of their assets to the Commission within one week. Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy {{was out of the}} country, and said he would try to organise worldwide protest. These arrests of the political leaders were widely seen as a move by the military-backed interim government to force Hasina and Zia out of the country and into <b>political</b> <b>exile.</b> United Kingdom MPs condemned the arrest.|$|E
25|$|Several revolts were {{initiated}} against the Bolsheviks and their army {{near the end}} of the war, notably the Kronstadt Rebellion. This was a naval mutiny engineered by Soviet Baltic sailors, former Red Army soldiers, and the people of Kronstadt. This armed uprising was fought against the antagonizing Bolshevik economic policies that farmers were subjected to, including seizures of grain crops by the Communists. This all amounted to large-scale discontent. When delegates representing the Kronstadt sailors arrived at Petrograd for negotiations, they raised 15 demands primarily pertaining to the Russian right to freedom. The Government firmly denounced the rebellions and labelled the requests as a reminder of the Social Revolutionaries, a political party that was popular among Soviets before Lenin, but refused to cooperate with the Bolshevik Army. The Government then responded with an armed suppression of these revolts and suffered 10 thousand casualties before entering the city of Kronstadt. This ended the rebellions fairly quickly, causing many of the rebels to flee to <b>political</b> <b>exile.</b>|$|E
