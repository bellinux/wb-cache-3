Our solid waste disposal cost is just $ 60 a ton. Our wastewater disposal costs are only $ 0. 10 per gallon. Or, The solvent in our <b>parts</b> <b>cleaner</b> is replaced every month for $ 50. Most companies can calculate their annual waste treatment and disposal costs easily. However, these costs are {{just the tip of}} the waste cost iceberg. Disposal costs are typically only about 15 percent of a waste’s total costs (Rooney and Reid, 1996). And, just as an iceberg sunk the Titanic, the hidden waste costs could be sinking your company’s profit margins...|$|E

40|$|Bioremediating parts washers are in {{the process}} of graduating from emerging, {{experimental}} technology to efficient aqueous alternative. This method of cleaning is one example of how some manufacturers are minimizing wastewater concerns and, in the process, optimizing cleaning potential. D espite increasing acceptance in environmental and regulatory circles as a viable tool in pollution clean-up efforts, bioremediaction was not a term heard often in the parts cleaning industry until very recently. In the last few years, the technology required to introduce and control biological components in specifically designed aqueous <b>parts</b> <b>cleaners</b> has been perfected and applied successfully. The result is highly effective parts cleaning systems with extremely long bath lives. In fact, it is now possible for some companies to operate properly maintained bioremediating parts washing systems for years without changing the bath at all...|$|R

50|$|The {{inventor}} Alfred Kärcher (1901-59) from Baden-Württemberg {{founded the}} company in 1935 in Stuttgart Bad-Cannstatt. Initially Kärcher specialised {{in the design of}} industrial submersible heating elements, i.e. in salt smelters which were heated with immersion heaters. After numerous experiments, a hardening furnace for alloys was produced, the so-called “Kärcher Salt-Bath Furnace”. Some 1,200 units were sold up to 1945. Karcher invented the first modern pressure washer, the DS 350 in 1950. The company’s main focus then switched to cleaning equipment for professional and private users. Since then, Kärcher has made lead in the design and development of pressure washers. The company’s product range was expanded and now covers the entire field of cleaning (sweepers, detergents, scrubber-driers, wet and dry vacuums, vacuum cleaners, battery-powered brooms, steam cleaners, dry ice blasting equipment, <b>parts</b> <b>cleaners,</b> water treatment systems, vehicle washes and wastewater recycling systems). Kärcher also offers pumps and watering systems.|$|R

He arrived just as Production Manager Margaret French was leaving. She handed him a script and invited him to return for an audition. Reg Watson, the Producer, had already interviewed hundreds of young hopefuls for the part of Sandy, but without finding what the show was looking for. Eventually when Tonge and another hopeful were shortlisted for the part, both interviewees were asked to act out their reaction to their pet dog being run over. Tonge produced the best woeful response and the part became his.|$|R
50|$|Beside high {{mechanical}} energy, higher cleaning {{temperatures are}} one of the most effective methods of improving the cleaning results in a parts washer. In general, a 10 to 15 °F (5 to 8 °C) rise doubles the chemical reaction of the detergent. The increased chemical reaction between the greases and oils and the detergent delivers faster cleaning cycles and <b>cleaner</b> <b>parts.</b> Additionally, all greases and oils exhibit a lower viscosity at higher temperatures. Cleaning solution temperatures of 170 F and above softens or melts most oils and greases causing them to flow like water so they are easily removed resulting in faster cleaning, better results and <b>cleaner</b> <b>parts.</b> Many parts washers are not capable of maintaining this operating temperature due to the lack of amply heating systems. Additionally, careful design is required of the pumping system so it can pull in and deliver cleaning solution at temperatures that approach boiling in the parts washer. All centrifugal pumps require a net positive suction head (NPSHr) in order to be able to pump solution. As the temperature of the solution approaches the NPSHr, the pump stops pumping because the cleaning solution flashes to steam in the pump intake. Careful design of the pump is required to minimize NPSHr and allow pumping of high temperature cleaning solution.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{health and}} {{wellness}} of workers in any occupation could {{be linked to the}} specificities of the job and the attending hazards in the workplace. Objective: This was done with a view to providing baseline information that will help in the creation of awareness of occupational hazards among cleaners. Methodology: This is a descriptive study that was carried out among 230 cleaners working in a University in South Western Nigeria. Results: The results showed that knowledge about job hazards is exceedingly high among the sampled <b>cleaners.</b> <b>Part</b> of the explanations for this is that most of them had received formal training for the job. Interestingly, having received such training is the only factor that is significantly associated with the level of awareness among the cleaners. Contrary to what one might expect, the older, more experienced or more educated cleaners were not necessarily more knowledgeable about job hazards. Conclusion: This study concludes that the level of knowledge of job hazards among the cleaners is high. Notwithstanding, efforts are still necessary, particularly from public health nurses, for this level of awareness to be sustained...|$|R
2500|$|The bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) {{performs}} a service for “client” fishes (belonging to other species) by removing and eating their ectoparasites. Clients can invite a cleaning session by adopting a typical posture or simply by remaining immobile near a wrasse's cleaning station. They can even form queues while doing so. But cleaning sessions {{do not always}} end up well, because wrasses (or wrasse-mimicking parasitic sabre-toothed blennies) may cheat and eat the nutritious body mucus of their clients, rather than just the ectoparasites, something that makes the client jolt and sometimes flee. This system {{has been the subject}} of extensive observations which have suggested cognitive abilities on the <b>part</b> of the <b>cleaner</b> wrasses and their clients. For example, clients refrain from soliciting a cleaning session if they have witnessed the cleaning session of the previous client ending badly. [...] Cleaners give the impression of trying to maintain a good reputation, because they cheat less when they see a big audience (a long queue of clients) watching. Cleaners sometimes work as male-female teams, and when the smaller female cheats and bites the client, the larger male chases her off, as if to punish her for having tarnished their reputation.|$|R
40|$|A large-sized cover <b>part</b> for air <b>cleaner</b> was {{injection}} molded with ABS resin, and its incomplete filling defect {{was analyzed}} using commercial Moldflow software. To investigate {{the effect of}} processing temperature on incomplete filling defect, tensile properties, weight loss, and phase separation behavior of ABS resin were evaluated. The tensile properties of dumbbell samples were not changed up to 250 °C and decreased significantly thereafter. SEM micrographs indicated no {{significant changes in the}} status of polybutadiene rubber phase below 250 °C. These different test results indicated that ABS resin little affected the thermal decomposition in processing temperature range. The Moldflow simulation was performed using measured thickness of molded cover and actual mold design with the defects. As expected, the cover part showed unbalanced filling and incomplete sections. To improve these defects, two possible cases of hot runner system have been simulated. When applying modified 5 -gate system, the maximum injection pressure was decreased approximately 5. 5 % more than that of actual gate system. In case of 6 -gate system, the maximum injection pressure reduced by 23 %, and the injection pressure required to fill is well within the range of the molding equipment. The maximum clamping force of 6 -gate system was also significantly reduced than that of actual and 5 -gate system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} which product designs for parts and directions are most effective, and then propose how perceptional information could best be designed to facilitate user-product interaction. Three categories of perceptional information for product operational tasks were proposed in this study.

60|$|But walking {{round the}} table {{is not the only}} way of {{altering}} its appearance. We can shut one eye, or put on blue spectacles, or look through a microscope. All these operations, in various ways, alter the visual appearance which we call that of the table. More distant objects will also alter their appearance if (as we say) the state of the atmosphere changes--if there is fog or rain or sunshine. Physiological changes also alter the appearances of things. If we assume the world of common sense, all these changes, including those attributed to physiological causes, are changes in the intervening medium. It is not quite so easy as in the former case to reduce this set of facts to a form in which nothing is assumed beyond sensible objects. Anything intervening between ourselves and what we see must be invisible: our view in every direction is bounded by the nearest visible object. It might be objected that a dirty pane of glass, for example, is visible although we can see things through it. But in this case we really see a spotted patchwork: the dirtier specks in the glass are visible, while the <b>cleaner</b> <b>parts</b> are invisible and allow us to see what is beyond. Thus the discovery that the intervening medium affects the appearances of things cannot be made by means of the sense of sight alone.|$|R
40|$|Mcdine is a {{manufacturer}} and supplier of heat exchanger {{equipment to the}} automotive. medium-to-heavy truck, construction and WAC industries.

Because of the dhrersity of predeaning and post-deaning steps at those plants. {{as well as a}} number of different starting materials and final specifications, the task of replacing chlorinated solvents requires careful planning. By implementing a systematic, integrated approach to working with each plant and then using that plan to eliminate duplication of effort, Modine Manufacturing should be poised to eliminate sdvents well before the December 31, 1995 deadline. Advantages to Chlorinated Solvents For many years chlorinated solvents have been a very effective means of degreasing metal parts in a variety of industries. The popularity of these sdvents is due to their many advantages, which are as follows: 1) Good solvency and cleaning power 2) Low power consumption 3) Non-flammable 4) Safe with all common metals 5) Exii the deaning process dry, ready for subsequent processing 6) Readily adaptable to automated, conveyorized systems or batch systems 7) Recoverable through distillation An additional advantage of chlorinated solvents, when used in a vapor degreaser. is that parts are constantly condensing &n solvent, leaving the oil behind in the boiling sump.

40|$|Filled {{thermoplastic}} composites are stiffer, stronger, {{and more}} dimensionally stable than their unfilled counterparts. Such thermoplastics are usually {{provided to the}} end-user as a precompounded, pelletized feedstock. Typical reinforcing fillers are inorganic materials like talc or fiberglass, but materials derived from waste wood, such as wood flour and recycled paper fiber, are also effective as fillers. The goal of this project was to generate commercial interest in using waste-wood–paper-derived fillers (WPFs) to reinforce thermoplastics. The research strategy was twofold: developmental research and outreach. Specific objectives were (1) to improve wastepaper fiber preparation, feeding, and compounding methods, and optimize composite performance, and (2) to communicate to end-product manufacturers the advantages of WPF thermoplastics. The research was led {{and supported by the}} Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), with input from a consortium of 15 fiber suppliers and plastics manufacturers. Additional funding was provided by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Equipment was leased and installed at FPL. Eight general purpose formulations were developed—they included extrusion and injection molding grades of both polyethylene and polypropylene, reinforced with WPFs. An information packet containing performance data, appropriate processing conditions, sample pellets, sample parts, and a questionnaire was sent to nearly 500 commercial plastics manufacturers in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan. In response to requests for in-house trials, FPL researchers conducted nearly 18 site visits. The researchers ensured proper handling of the material, provided consultation, and gathered information about processing and performance. The trials went very well, and parts were successfully manufactured at all facilities. Products included automobile trim components and housings, vacuum <b>cleaner</b> <b>parts,</b> paint brush handles, bicycle parts, cosmetic cases, and other household items. Great interest has been shown in the use of WPF thermoplastics; one consortium member is establishing a 4 million kg/yr (9 million lb/yr) facility.
