The sales department’s primary {{objective is to}} sell the bank’s products and generate revenue through new business acquisition, while the credit department’s objective is to balance risk and reward by ensuring that capital is deployed in the most effective manner. In the private bank department of the bank that was studied, these divergent objectives have led to inefficiencies in the business processes and have promoted the silo-based operations, which impact the customer experience negatively. Several strategies for future implementation were identified in order to optimise the alignment between the sales and credit functions of the private banking department of the bank. The strategies were categorised into customer centricity, relationship <b>pricing,</b> <b>alignment</b> of personal key performance indicators, addressing of system inefficiencies and exploring various alternate strategies (e. g. strategies that aim to achieve {{a better understanding of}} each others’ roles and work pressures better; improving communication; aligning their goals; working towards supporting the success of each department).

40|$|Trade {{uncertainty}} {{occurs when}} quality changes or when Administrative Trade Barriers (ATBs) cause {{a chance that}} a commodity will not enter the import market. Trade uncertainty adversely affects marketing firms and commodity trade. But arbitrage still precludes the distribution of rents to middlemen. An exporter subsidy may correct price distortions and expand trade towards the highest world welfare. The case for intervention appears strongest in thin markets with a low number of trade transactions and perishable commodities. Nonetheless, promoting trade liberalization before other interventions may still make sense when ATBs are present because reduced trade uncertainty also improves world welfare. Key words: agricultural trade, margins, nontariff trade barriers, uncertainty. Marketing firms seek profits from commodity arbitrage by exploiting the margin, or differ-ence, between the exporter price and the im-porter price. Competitive marketing firms sometimes cause <b>price</b> <b>alignment</b> between countries by increasing shipments under free trade (Samuelson, Takayama and Judge). But several factors may preclude <b>price</b> <b>alignment</b> in agricultural markets. For instance, trade policies such as quotas or variable levies limit price adjustment in importing countries (McCalla). Also, local supply and demand conditions may sometimes be a barrier to trade (Sexton, Kling, and Carman). Third, oli-gopoly pricing occasionally restricts price equalization (Ohno and Gallagher). Uncertainty may also complicate marketing firm behavior and margins for internation-ally traded agricultural products. Some di-mensions of marketing firm uncertainty have been studied (Goodwin, Grennes, and Wohlgenant; Hennessy; Fraser). But trade (volume) uncertainty, which exists when ac-cess to the import market is not assured, has received less attention. Paul Gallagher {{is associate professor of}} agricultural economic...|$|E

Using a global CGE model, we show that the initial world price rise was largely due to higher world oil prices and demand for biofuels as opposed to other factors, especially in maize and soybeans. China’s response to this shock has kept domestic grain prices low relative to world grain markets and to domestic soybean prices.

To motivate the case I analyze a simple model with complete and perfect information that implies a positive relation between managers’ incentive compensation and preference toward bank debt. Using firm-level data over the period 1992 - 2005, I empirically examine the relation between managerial incentives and financing decisions. Specifically, I examine whether managers whose compensation is tied to firm performance choose bank over public debt as a commitment mechanism {{to reduce the cost}} of debt. Consistent with a monitoring role of banks, I find that the probability of choosing bank over public debt is positively related to the level of incentive compensation. Further, I find that public lenders <b>price</b> the incentive <b>alignment</b> between manager and shareholders by increasing the cost of debt, while the overall cost of bank loan does not depend on the manager’s incentive compensation. Finally, I find that banks are more likely to include a collateral provision in the debt contract if the manager’s compensation is tied to firm performance...|$|R

For phylogenies with very short branches, the running time of our algorithm is close to linear. For example, if all branch lengths correspond to a mutation probability of less than 0. 02, the running time of our algorithm is roughly O(n^ 1. 2 ^ 2 n). Via a prototype and a sequence of large-scale experiments, we show that many large phylogenies can be reconstructed fast, without compromising reconstruction accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the output losses caused by disinflation {{and the role}} of credibility in a model where pricing mIes are optimal and individual prices are rigid. Individual nominal rigidity is modeled as resulting from menu costs. The interaction between optimal pricing mIes and credibility is essential in determining the inflationary inertia. A continued period of high inflation generates an asymmetric distribution of price deviations, with more prices that are substantially lower than their desired leveIs than prices that are substantially higher than the optimal ones. When disinflation is not credible, inflationary inertia is engendered by this asymmetry: idiosyncratic shocks trigger more upward than downward adjustments. A perfect 1 y credible disinflation causes an immediate change of pricing rules which, by rendering the price deviation distribution less asymmetric, practically annihilates inflationary inertia. An implication of our model is that stabilization may be sucessful even when credibility is low, provided that it is preceded by a mechanism of <b>price</b> <b>alignment.</b> We also develop an analytical framework for analyzing imperfect credibility cases...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} studies investigating various aspects of the interplay between the markets for derivative securities and their respective underlying assets in the presence of market imperfections. The classic theory of derivative pricing and hedging hinges on three rather unrealistic assumptions regarding the market for the underlying asset. Markets are assumed to be perfectly elastic, complete and frictionless. This thesis studies some effects of relaxing {{one or more of these}} assumptions. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the thesis, details the structure of what follows, and gives a selective review of the relevant literature. Chapter 2 focuses on the effects that the implementation of hedging strategies has on equilibrium asset prices when markets are imperfectly elastic. The results show that the feedback effect caused by such hedging strategies generates excess volatility of equilibrium asset prices, thus violating the very assumptions from which these strategies are derived. However, it is shown that hedging is nonetheless possible, albeit at a slightly higher price. In Chapter 3, a model is developed which describes equilibrium asset prices when market participants use technical trading rules. The results confirm that technical trading leads to the emergence of speculative price "bubbles". However, it is shown that although technical trading rules are irrational ex-ante, they turn out to be profitable ex-post. In Chapter 4, a general framework is developed in which the optimal trading behaviour of a large, informed trader can be studied in an environment where markets are imperfectly elastic. It is shown how the optimal trading pattern changes when the large trader is allowed to hold options written on the traded asset. In Chapter 5, the results of the preceding chapter are used to study the interplay between options markets and the markets for the underlying assets when prices are set by a market maker. It turns out that the existence of the option creates an incentive for the informed trader to manipulate markets, which implies that equilibrium on both markets can only exist when option prices are adjusted to reflect this incentive. This requirement of <b>price</b> <b>alignment</b> explains the "smile" pattern of implied volatility, an empirically observed phenomenon that has recently been the focus of extensive research. Chapter 6 finally addresses recent proposals by some researchers suggesting that central banks should issue options in order to stabilise exchange rates. The argument, in line with the findings of Chapter 2, is based on the fact that hedging a long option position requires countercyclical trading that would reduce volatility. However, the results of Chapter 6 show that the option creates an incentive for market manipulation which, rather than protecting against speculative attacks, in fact creates an additional vehicle for such attacks. Chapter 7 concludes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is very {{important}} to minimize the risk in portfolio selection. For minimizing risk of portfolio at a given expected returns, it is efficient to compose portfolio with stocks which have low cross-correlation among them. In this regard, forecasting the cross-correlations among stock prices has attracted much interest among investors and financial market researchers. Most of studies investigating crosscorrelations among stock prices assume that the cross-correlations are static. But the cross-correlations in real stock markets are changing over time. Thus the dynamic clustering property and ensemble average can provide very useful methodology to calculate the time-dependent cross-correlations. In this paper, we investigated the dynamics of cross-correlations among stock <b>prices</b> using local <b>alignment</b> technique. Local alignment technique of bioinformatics can be applied to analyzing stock market and detect similar patterns in the fluctuation of stock prices during a certain time period. This information can be utilized in analyzing and forecasting the timedependent cross-correlations. This paper applied local alignment technique to the time series data of Korean stock market and found that an investor can forecast the risk of his asset portfolio and manage it optimally...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{the operation}} of seed cotton and wheat marketing systems in Sindh. Analysis of marketing margins indicates {{that the private sector}} cotton marketing chain appears to be working efficiently, given the many adverse aspects of its socioeconomic environment. There is evidence that higher domestic <b>prices</b> resulting from <b>alignment</b> with world markets have been transmitted through the marketing chain to producers, and that production has increased. In contrast to cotton, the government continues to be heavily involved in wheat procurement and storage, with private traders usually acting as intermediaries between the Food Department and the grower. Despite expensive involvement of the same private traders as in cotton, the wheat market is characterised by bureaucratic failure and rent-seeking behaviour, leading to stagnation of incentives and production. For cotton, the primary recommendations are to sustain liberalisation of the market and to support the developing beneficial model of private competition through improvements in communications and transport infrastructure. The practical means to improve the grading of cotton lint and seed cotton should also be developed and promoted to provide incentives for higher quality output. For wheat, the main recommendations are to liberalise farmgate prices, reduce the state’s role in procurement, and privatise government godowns. Research is needed on how this might best be achieved, with attention to the conditions necessary for private financing of storage activities, and to ways of minimising price and supply fluctuations. The impact of higher flour prices on poor consumers also needs to be addressed. ...|$|R
40|$|States support higher {{education}} affordability by providing direct funding to {{higher education}} institutions (i. e., state appropriations) and students (i. e., financial aid). However, research examining {{the effectiveness of these}} state expenditures on higher education – and which types students receive the greatest benefit from these expenditures – is sparse. In this study, I examine the relationship between state higher education student financial aid policy and institutional pricing behaviors, focusing on pricing differences across student need and academic ability. Drawing on concepts from the principal-agent framework, resource dependence theory, and previous research on this state-institution relationship (i. e., Doyle, Delaney, & Naughton, 2009), I hypothesize that institutional pricing behaviors respond to changes in state aid in one of three ways: comply with, compensate for, or absorb state financial aid expenditures. Using a combination of state-, institutional-, and student-level data for the academic years 2003 - 04, 2007 - 08, and 2011 - 12, I examine the interactive effects of state financial aid expenditures and student characteristics on institutional pricing behaviors. In addition, I explore the possibility that the direction and magnitude of these interactive effects differ depending on the degree of institutional dependence on state appropriations. I find that institutions respond to changes in state need-based and non-need-based student financial aid expenditures in systematic ways. Findings indicate that institutional aid and net <b>price</b> shift toward <b>alignment</b> with changes in state need- and non-need-based aid expenditures. Moreover, in the analyses that examined differences by institutional appropriation dependence, results suggest that less appropriation dependent institutions are most responsive to state financial aid changes. As public higher education tuition levels continue to rise (Baum, 2013) and affordability among the neediest students declines (Burd, 2014), state higher education finances will continue play central role in the future of higher education access and student success. Findings from this study highlight the importance of continued state investment in need-based student financial aid to promote higher education affordability...|$|R

Full details of the Commission's proposals for reform of the tobacco regime, alongside a summary assessment of the current situation, can be found in the text of the Commission's communication to the Council and European Parliament on 'Accomplishing a sustainable agricultural model for Europe through the reformed CAP: the tobacco, olive oil, cotton and sugar sectors'. It is envisaged that the reform process will 'bring better market orientation and income growth for producers, in addition to the positive impact on producer income development from the increased transfer efficiency of decoupled payments'. This is especially the case for small scale producers who will receive a larger part of their income through the single farm payments. The reform process will also lead to the cessation of production of less profitable varieties of tobacco and the conversion of land to other uses. By the end of the reform period it is anticipated that EU prices will be aligned with world market <b>prices.</b> Comment: The <b>alignment</b> of EU <b>prices</b> with world market prices which the reform process is intended to bring about is likely to reduce the income to ACP suppliers of tobacco to the EU market.
