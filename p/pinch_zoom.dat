40|$|Global {{gestures}} on touch devices need to {{be detected}} so that this information can later {{be used to create}} checkpoints in a screen recording of the touch device. Currently, there is no uniform and legal solution to do so on devices like the iPad. We propose a system with two cameras (RGB cameras) which will be able to detect global gestures performed on any touch device (or in fact, any surface like a book). The system will be able to track all touch gestures performed on a surface and either associate live actions with it or store the metadata for later use. The system will detect the following: 1. Type of gesture – single tap, multiple taps, long press, left/right/down/top swipe, <b>pinch,</b> <b>zoom.</b> 2. Location of gesture – start and end. 3. Duration of gesture. 1. SETU...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the user experience evaluation of Squeeze Me, an interactive cover for tablet and smartphone that enables continuous and expressive interaction with electronic devices. The cover {{is made of}} a soft rubbery material that embeds pressure sensors and electronics. It can be squeezed with both hands. The intensity of the input {{is reflected in the}} output. So far, two applications of Squeeze Me have been implemented: an interface to control the movements of a domestic robot in a smart environment, and a mobile application that makes it possible to zoom in and out while taking a photograph, without removing the hands from the tablet. Both applications have been evaluated with users. This paper focuses on testing the zooming application. The test was conducted involving 67 people. Their experience of use was evaluated using AttrakDiff [1], a questionnaire that measures hedonic stimulation and identity, as well as pragmatic qualities of software products. Users were asked to try out three interaction modalities for comparison: squeeze to <b>zoom,</b> <b>pinch</b> to <b>zoom</b> and slide to zoom. Results reveal that Squeeze to zoom is significantly more appreciated for its hedonic qualities. The paper concludes with a reflection on the potential and possible applications of Squeeze Me technology...|$|R

40|$|The multi-touch-based <b>pinch</b> to <b>zoom,</b> {{drag and}} flick to pan metaphor has gained wide {{popularity}} on mobile displays, {{where it is}} the paradigm of choice for navigating 2 D docu-ments. But is finger-based navigation really the gold stand-ard? In this paper, we present a comprehensive user study with 40 participants, in which we systematically compare the Pinch-Drag-Flick approach with a technique that relies on spatial manipulation, such as lifting a display up/down to zoom. While we solely considered known techniques, we put considerable effort in implementing both input strate-gies on popular consumer hardware (iPhone, iPad). Our results show that spatial manipulation can significantly outperform traditional Pinch-Drag-Flick. Given the careful-ly optimized prototypes, we are confident to have found strong arguments that future generations of mobile devices could rely much more on spatial interaction principles...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{navigation}} on {{a mobile}} touchscreen is usually performed using finger gestures: drag and flick to scroll or pan, <b>pinch</b> to <b>zoom.</b> While easy {{to learn and}} perform, these gestures cause significant occlusion of the display. They also require users to explicitly switch between navigation mode and edit mode to either change the viewport’s position in the document, or manipulate the actual content displayed in that viewport, respectively. SidePress augments mobile devices with two continuous pressure sensors co-located {{on one of their}} sides. It provides users with generic bidirectional navigation capabilities at different levels of granularity, all seamlessly integrated to act as an alternative to traditional navigation techniques, including scrollbars, drag-and-flick, or pinch-to-zoom. We describe the hardware prototype, detail the associated interaction vocabulary for different applications, and report on two laboratory studies. The first shows that users can precisely and efficiently control SidePress; the second, that SidePress can be more efficient than drag-andflick touch gestures when scrolling large documents...|$|R
50|$|The X10 was {{released}} {{at the start}} of 2010. It was the first in the Xperia line to feature the Android operating system, where previous models ran on the Windows Mobile OS. The phone was praised on its design, but its downfall was the outdated version of Android which was 1.6 at a time when competitors were on 2.1. There was a great delay in the update of the firmware, due to the heavily skinned OS, as well as Timescape and Mediascape which needed to be reprogrammed every time an update was made. The phone also lacked <b>pinch</b> to <b>zoom,</b> but this was added later as well as HD video recording. The X10 Mini and the X10 Mini Pro were, as the name suggests, miniature versions of the X10. These were welcomed with good response and proved to be very popular as there were no other smartphones on the market at that time which were as small as the two.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed from August 20 to August 22, 2010, and was {{directed}} by British pop-culture and video director Sarah Chatfield. The full completed video debuted on the Vevo network, and was added to UK music channels on September 15, 2010. It was released in other territories on September 25, 2010. The scenes were put together with superimposed images of the workings and interface of the iPad. It was released through the US iTunes Store on September 21, 2010. Video Static's Steven Gottlieb provided clarity on how the interface is integrated into the video. He said, [...] "Logos get tapped to trigger various edits; <b>pinching</b> makes things <b>zoom</b> in and out, etc, etc." [...] A video set to the Antoine Clamaran dance remix of the song premiered on Clamaran's official YouTube page on December 8, 2010.|$|R
5000|$|During WWDC 2008, it was {{announced}} that an iOS version of Enigmo was in development and would be available for purchase for the price of US$9.99 at the launch of the App Store. The game makes use of the iPhone's multi touch interface and is controlled entirely via touch. Players can use the swiping and <b>pinching</b> actions to <b>zoom</b> and pan and use their fingers to position the puzzle pieces. The game has been a success; it was voted the [...] "Best iPhone Game" [...] at WWDC '08 and has been met with very positive reviews in the App Store. Originally including only 50 levels, Enigmo has been updated to allow user designed levels created on the desktop versions of the game; the price was dropped to US$4.99 at that time. It was then dropped to US$1.99 on October 8, 2008 and later to US$0.99 for Black Friday. It is currently on sale for $0.99.Enigmo for iPhone and iPod Touch are now available in Dutch, German, Spanish, Japanese, Italian, and French.

5000|$|In early 2009, Rovio staff began {{reviewing}} {{proposals for}} potential games. One such proposal came from senior game designer Jaakko Iisalo {{in the form}} of a simulated screenshot featuring some angry-looking birds with no visible legs or wings. While the picture gave no clue as to what type of game was being played, the staff liked the characters, and the team elected to design a game around them. In early 2009, physics games, such as Crush the Castle, were popular flash-based web games, so the Rovio team was inspired by these games. During the development of Angry Birds, the staff realized the birds needed an enemy. At the time, the [...] "swine flu" [...] epidemic was in the news, so the staff made the birds' enemies pigs. Angry Birds was the studio's 52nd produced game and on its initial release, the game didn't sell many copies. After Angry Birds was a featured app on the UK App Store in February 2010 and quickly reached No.1 there, it reached the No. 1 spot on the paid apps chart in the US App Store in the middle of 2010 and then stayed there for 275 days. The initial cost to develop Angry Birds was estimated to exceed €100,000, not including costs for the subsequent updates. For the iOS version, Rovio partnered with distributor Chillingo to publish the game to the App Store.Chillingo claimed to have participated in final game polishing, such as adding visible trajectory lines, <b>pinch</b> to <b>zoom,</b> pigs' grunts, birds' somersaults on landing.Since then Rovio has self-published almost all of the later ports of the game, with the exception of the PSP version, which was produced under license by Abstraction Games.|$|R
40|$|Modern mobile devices allow a {{rich set of}} {{multi-finger}} {{interactions that}} combine modes into a single fluid act, for example, one finger for panning blending into a two-finger <b>pinch</b> gesture for <b>zooming.</b> Such gestures {{require the use of}} both hands: one holding the device while the other is interacting. While on the go, however, only one hand may be available to both hold the device and interact with it. This mostly limits interaction to a single-touch (i. e., the thumb), forcing users to switch between input modes explicitly. In this paper, we contribute the Fat Thumb interaction technique, which uses the thumb’s contact size as a form of simulated pressure. This adds a degree of freedom, which can be used, for example, to integrate panning and zooming into a single interaction. Contact size determines the mode (i. e., panning with a small size, zooming with a large one), while thumb movement performs the selected mode. We discuss nuances of the Fat Thumb based on the thumb’s limited operational range and motor skills when that hand holds the device. We compared Fat Thumb to three alternative techniques, where people had to pan and zoom to a predefined region on a map. Participants performed fastest with the least strokes using Fat Thumb.
