5|$|The LPF {{decided to}} {{maintain}} Fortuyn's candidacy, and delayed naming {{a new leader}} until after the election. The 2002 general election proved a great success for the LPF, yielding 17% of the votes and 26 seats in the House of Representatives—by far {{a record number of}} seats in the Netherlands for a new party—to become the second largest party. LN also made it into Parliament, with two seats. The Labour Party (PvdA) and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) saw their largest-ever losses, while the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) won large gains. CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende had earlier announced that his party would follow a tougher line towards asylum seekers, and he later agreed with much of Fortuyn's criticism of the <b>purple</b> <b>coalition</b> and Holland's multicultural society. As leader of the strongest party, Balkenende became the leading candidate for Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|In Western Europe, liberal {{parties have}} often cooperated with socialist and social {{democratic}} parties, {{as evidenced by}} the <b>Purple</b> <b>Coalition</b> in the Netherlands during the late 1990s and into the 21st century. The <b>Purple</b> <b>Coalition,</b> one of the most consequential in Dutch history, brought together the progressive left-liberal D66, the economic liberal and centre-right VVD, and the social democratic Labour Party – an unusual combination that ultimately legalised same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and prostitution while also instituting a non-enforcement policy on marijuana.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{election}} of 1994, in which the Christian democratic CDA lost a considerable portion of its representatives, the social-liberal Democrats 66 (D66) doubled in size and formed a coalition with the labour party (Netherlands) (PvdA), and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). This purple (government) coalition marked the first absence of the CDA in government in decades. During the <b>Purple</b> <b>Coalition</b> years, a period lasting until {{the rise of the}} populist politician Pim Fortuyn, the government addressed issues previously viewed as taboo under the Christian-influenced cabinet. At this time, the Dutch government introduced unprecedented legislation based on a policy of official tolerance (gedoogbeleid). Abortion and euthanasia were decriminalized, but stricter guidelines were set for their implementation. Drug policy, especially with regard to the regulation of cannabis, was reformed. Prostitution was legalised, but confined to brothels where {{the health and safety of}} those involved could be properly monitored. With the 2001 Same-Sex Marriage Act, the Netherlands became the first country to legalise same-sex marriage. In addition to social reforms, the <b>Purple</b> <b>Coalition</b> also presided over a period of remarkable economic prosperity.|$|E
50|$|Kok {{was highly}} praised for his Third Way and polder model philosophies {{and for the}} success of leading his <b>Purple</b> <b>Coalitions.</b> During his premiership, his {{cabinets}} were responsible for implementing several social reforms, stimulating the economy for more employment and privatization and further reducing the deficit. As a result of this, and because of his skills as manager and negotiator, Kok obtained the status of a statesman by his fellow European leaders.|$|R
500|$|The {{ideology}} {{or political}} style that {{is derived from}} Pim Fortuyn, and in turn the LPF, is often called Fortuynism. Observers variously saw him as a political protest targeting the alleged elitism and bureaucratic style of the Dutch <b>purple</b> <b>coalitions</b> or as offering an appealing political style. The style was characterized variously as one [...] "of openness, directness and clearness", populism or simply as charisma. Another school holds Fortuynism as a distinct ideology, with an alternative vision of society. Some argued that Fortuynism was not just one ideology, but contained liberalism, populism and nationalism.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was founded}} on December 5, 1997 {{by members of the}} PRO AUTO {{transport}} advocacy organization out of dissatisfaction with the policies of the <b>Purple</b> Kok <b>coalition</b> cabinet. Led by Jan Holsteijn and primarily concentrated in Spijkenisse, Mobile Netherlands primarily advocates for improvement of government-owned or regulated mobility and transport facilities.|$|R
25|$|Verhofstadt led the VLD {{into the}} 2007 general election. Already with the 2006 {{municipal}} elections, the VLD {{showed signs of}} fatigue with the Flemish voter, {{who seem to have}} had enough of eight years of Verhofstadt, and the <b>purple</b> <b>coalition</b> governments. In an evening speech on election day, Verhofstadt conceded defeat and asked for a new generation to lead the VLD; he was to step down as prime minister after formation of a new government. However, the formation of a new government was complicated, and in the end, CD politician Yves Leterme failed to bring about a new government.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, federal {{elections}} {{were held in}} Belgium. In Flanders, the ruling <b>purple</b> <b>coalition</b> - the liberal Open VLD and the centre-left electoral list of Socialist Party – Different (SP.a) and Spirit - lost the most seats, while the electoral coalition CD/N-VA gained the most and the CD became the largest party in Flanders and Belgium. The CD/N-VA had an electoral program that emphasized the need for far-reaching state reform. Yves Leterme of the CD personally gained 800,000 votes and {{was considered to be}} the prospective prime minister. The SP.a, the party that lost the most seats, declared it would prepare itself for a role in the opposition, and would support state reform from that position.|$|E

5000|$|In the 2010 Dutch cabinet {{formation}} {{the possibilities}} for a Purple-plus cabinet (the original [...] "purple" [...] coalition of PvdA, VVD, D66 plus GreenLeft) was investigated. Since 5 November 2012, following the 2012 Dutch general election, the VVD has been the senior partner in the second Rutte cabinet, a grand <b>coalition</b> <b>Purple</b> government with the PvdA.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1998 {{election}} the <b>Purple</b> <b>Coalition</b> {{consisting of}} Social Democrats, and {{left and right}} wing Liberals, increased its majority. Both the social-democratic PvdA and the conservative liberal VVD grew {{at the cost of}} their junior partner in cabinet, the progressive liberal D66. [...] The voters rewarded the Purple Coaliation for its economic performance, which had included reduction of unemployment and the budget deficit, steady growth and job creation combined with wage freezes and trimming of the welfare state, together with a policy of fiscal restraint. [...] The result was the second Kok cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{power of}} the {{coalition}} waned {{with the introduction of}} List Pim Fortuyn in the Dutch general election of 2002, a populist party, which ran a distinctly anti-immigration and anti-purple campaign, citing [...] "Purple Chaos" [...] (Puinhopen van Paars) as the source of the countries social woes. In the first political assassination in three centuries, Fortuyn was murdered with little over a week left before the election. In the wake of its leader's death, LPF swept the elections, entering parliament with one sixth of the seats, while the PvdA (Labour) lost half of its seats. The ensuing cabinet was formed by CDA, VVD and LPF, led by Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende. Though the party succeeded in displacing the rival <b>Purple</b> <b>Coalition,</b> without the charismatic figure of Pim Fortuyn at its helm, it proved to be short-lived lasting 87 days in power.|$|E

50|$|In the 1994 general election, the Christian {{democratic}} CDA {{lost nearly}} half its seats, while the social liberal D66 doubled their size. For {{the first time}} in eighty years, a coalition was formed without the Christian democrats. The <b>Purple</b> <b>Coalition</b> was formed between PvdA, D66, and VVD. The colour purple symbolised the mixing of socialist red with liberal blue. During the Purple years, which lasted until 2002, the government introduced legislation on abortion, euthanasia, and gay marriage. The <b>Purple</b> <b>coalition</b> also marked a period of remarkable economic prosperity.|$|E

50|$|In 1994 the Christian {{democratic}} CDA {{lost its}} traditional electoral power base. The VVD and D66 won considerably. A progressive purple cabinet {{was formed by}} D66, the VVD and the PvdA. The cabinet managed a thriving Dutch economy, implemented progressive social legislation on euthanasia, gay marriage and prostitution. In the 2002 election campaign the <b>purple</b> <b>coalition</b> came under heavy criticism of the populist politician Pim Fortuyn for mismanaging the public sector, migration and the integration of migrants. The two liberal parties lost considerably in the elections.|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s socialists and social-democrats renewed themselves. In 1989 the PSP and CPN {{merged with}} two small Christian left parties (the Evangelical People's Party and the Political Party of Radicals) to form GreenLeft. In the 1994 general {{election}} Wim Kok, {{the new leader}} of the PvdA, lost {{a considerable number of}} seats, but still emerged as leader of the largest party. He forms an unprecedented <b>purple</b> <b>coalition</b> with progressive and conservative liberals which implements a Third Way policy, including privatisation of public companies, legalisation of prostitution and euthanasia and some institutional reforms. In 1994 a small formerly Maoist party, the Socialist Party (SP) also entered parliament.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Purple</b> <b>coalition</b> parties {{together}} {{lost their}} {{majority in the}} 2002 elections due {{to the rise of}} Pim Fortuyn List, the new political party led by the flamboyant populist Pim Fortuyn. He campaigned on an anti-immigration programme and spoke of the [...] "Purple Chaos" [...] (Dutch: Puinhopen van Paars). Fortuyn was shot dead a week before the elections. Nevertheless, the LPF entered parliament with one-sixth of the seats, while the PvdA (Labour) lost half its seats. A cabinet was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, led by Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende. It proved short-lived: after only 87 days in power, the coalition fell apart as a result of consecutive conflicts within the LPF and between LPF ministers.|$|E
50|$|After the election, it took 127 days {{to form a}} new government, {{with both}} the VVD and PvdA hoping to have a leading role. Talks with the PvdA and other left-wing parties (trying to form a {{so-called}} <b>Purple</b> <b>Coalition</b> without Christian parties) broke down and Rutte was able to form a right-wing coalition of the VVD and CDA, with the PVV formally making an agreement (gedoogakkoord) to support the government but without holding any cabinet seats. It was the first coalition government not to be led by a Christian democratic or socialist party in 92 years, as well as the first to be led by the VVD. Rutte was sworn in as Prime Minister on 14 October, becoming the first liberal to hold that post since 1918.|$|E
