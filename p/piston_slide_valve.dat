50|$|The {{first seven}} {{locomotives}} had <b>slide</b> <b>valves,</b> while the remainder had <b>piston</b> <b>valves.</b> The <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> engines were later fitted with piston valves. Schmidt superheaters were fitted between 1913 and 1925.|$|R
50|$|An {{official}} {{test was}} conducted in 1938 to compare the steam consumption of the poppet valve Class 19C with the piston valve Class 19D. The Class 19D performed slightly better. However, the valve travel of the Class 19D is 7+1/2 in compared to a valve travel of about 4+3/4 in in all previous engines fitted with <b>piston</b> or <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b> It was concluded that, had the valve travel of the Class 19D been retained at 4+3/4 in, the test would have shown an advantage for the poppet valves.|$|R
5000|$|Steam was {{supplied}} {{by a pair}} of Admiralty pattern 3-drum water-tube type boilers, working at 225 pounds per square inch. The main engines were of the 4-cylinder triple expansion 4-crank type, balanced on the Yarrow-Tweedy-Slick system, the cylinders being as follows:The common stroke was 30 in. The <b>piston</b> and <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> rods were all fitted with metallic packing to the stuffing boxes, and all pistons fitted with packing rings and springs. The high-pressure valve was of the piston type, whilst the remaining ones were of the balanced type. The main engines were designed to develop [...] at 185 rpm continuously.|$|R
50|$|Valve gear was {{a fertile}} field of invention, with {{probably}} several hundred variations devised over the years. However, {{only a small}} number of these saw any widespread use. They can be divided into those that drove the standard reciprocating valves (whether <b>piston</b> <b>valves</b> or <b>slide</b> <b>valves),</b> those used with poppet valves, and stationary engine trip gears used with semi-rotary Corliss valves or drop valves.|$|R
50|$|Sun :The Sun was {{launched}} in 1927 as a direct replacement for the 1b MTB engine. Like the Star, the bevel drive was moved inside the crankcase, and banjo drive was used {{with a choice of}} either <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> or <b>slide</b> <b>valve.</b> Bore and stroke were 0.75 inches. While the <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> variant was only available as a kit, the piston valve version was available as a complete engine or kit. The Sun continued after the war as a piston valve kit only and last appeared in the Stuart catalogue in 1989/1990.|$|R
25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the <b>piston</b> <b>valve,</b> the <b>slide</b> <b>valve,</b> and the graduating valve.|$|R
40|$|This paper fully {{describes}} the working principle of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> in single-screw expanders (SSEs). A geometric analysis of suction and volume ratio <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{is presented to}} determine the relations between volume ratio, suction closure volume, discharge opening volume and <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) thermodynamic model with SSE integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> is developed to analyze the power output of SSE and the net power output of ORC system and variation law of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. Analysis of a typical ORC system under changing operating conditions shows that the power output of the expander and the net output power of the ORC system with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> are much better than those without <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b> When the condensing temperature is 40 Â°C and the waste availability is 80 kW, the increase in output power and net output power are approximately 3. 4 kW and 5 kW, respectively. The presented geometric analysis of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> and the thermodynamic model integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{can be used to}} provide a theoretical and technical basis for designing the <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> of SSEs and the control strategies of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> under varied operating conditions...|$|R
