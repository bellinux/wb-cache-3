5|$|While the Leslie {{speaker is}} still made and sold, similar effects {{can now be}} {{obtained}} via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> devices can give an approximation of the sounds produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage <b>phase</b> <b>shifter,</b> was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a foot-operated fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend {{not to be in}} good condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although the sound of a Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones have become increasingly better at emulating it.|$|E
25|$|The {{microwave}} bridge contains {{both the}} microwave source and the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves however modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after the microwave source {{there is an}} isolator which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the microwave frequency. The microwave power from the source is then passed through a directional coupler which splits the microwave power into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control {{of the flow of}} microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.|$|E
500|$|In October 1967, {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the second Jimi Hendrix Experience album [...] began at Olympic Studios in London. [...] On October 25, after recording the strongly R [...] "Wait Until Tomorrow", the Experience recorded an instrumental version of [...] "Little Wing". [...] It followed the same chord progression as the later master recording, but had a more forceful rock feel. After another take in the same vein, Chandler called for a different approach. [...] Recording engineer Eddie Kramer explained, [...] "Chas knew right away what was needed. [...] He had Jimi slow the tempo down and try it again". [...] After the basic track was completed, Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28, 1967. [...] For his recordings, Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks. [...] For his rhythm guitar, he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a [...] "hollow" [...] tone, sometimes mistakenly referred to as [...] "out-of-phase". [...] However, for the lead, Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift Leslie speaker, which was normally used for electric organs. By rotating the sound, Leslie speakers produce vibrato- and tremolo-like effects, i.e., a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound (Hendrix later popularized {{the use of the}} Univibe <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> effects pedal, which can be set to get a roughly similar effect). [...] Next, Hendrix added a straight ("dry, without any effects") glockenspiel to underscore his vocal and guitar. [...] According to Kramer, [...] "Jimi always kept an eye out for odd instruments that would be lying about the studio" [...] and found the glockenspiel in Studio A. [...] Last to be recorded was his vocal, which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound. [...] These have been variously described as artificial double tracking (ADT), phasing, Pultec filter equalization, and processing with a Leslie speaker.|$|E
50|$|The {{usage of}} true-time-delay TTD <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> instead of RF MEMS <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> allows UWB radar {{waveforms}} with associated high range resolution, and avoids beam squinting or frequency scanning. TTD <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> are designed using the switched-line principle or the distributed loaded-line principle. Switched-line TTD <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> outperform distributed loaded-line TTD <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> {{in terms of}} time delay per decibel NF, especially at frequencies up to X-band, but are inherently digital and require low-loss and high-isolation SPNT switches. Distributed loaded-line TTD <b>phase</b> <b>shifters,</b> however, can be realized analogously or digitally, and in smaller form factors, which is important at the subarray level. Analog <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> are biased through a single bias line, whereas multibit digital <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> require a parallel bus along with complex routing schemes at the subarray level.|$|R

500|$|The mix of {{improvisation}} and R/funk elements {{is evident in}} [...] "Who Knows", which was the opening number for the second (after the brief [...] "Auld Lang Syne") and third shows. It is a loose jam rather than a structured song and during the performance for second show Hendrix teases the audience with [...] "I hope you don't mind us jamming a little bit, we're just messing around... seeing what we're gonna play next". [...] Built on Hendrix's guitar figure, [...] "Who Knows" [...] is framed by Cox's economical funk-blues bass line and Miles' steady drum beat, which Murray describes as [...] "a thick, lazy twitch". [...] Hendrix explores guitar phrases using different tones and effects between vocal sections. [...] According to Cox, Hendrix used a new combination of effects for the first time. [...] These included a Uni-Vibe <b>phase</b> <b>shifter,</b> an Octavia harmonizer (developed for him by Roger Mayer during the recording of his first album), a Fuzz Face distortion box, and a wah-wah pedal. [...] One mixture of them produces a [...] "whistling, shimmering, ring-modulated tone so rich with upper harmonics" [...] in the higher range, while in the lower range [...] "it almost sounds like 'Froggy Went a-Courtin''... all these [...] oct-intervals give it such a dramatic effect". [...] His use of the wah-wah employs [...] "rapid foot movement and wide sweeps [...] tend to make the melody fade in and out". [...] Also, by using a triplet rhythm with the pedal, a polyrhythm with the prevailing 4/4 beat is created. [...] The lyrics, some which borrow from other R songs, are also improvised and show considerable {{differences between the two}} renditions. [...] As it unfolds, there is an R vocal call and response section between Hendrix and Miles, then separate vocal sections for each, which Miles follows with scat singing. [...] During the middle section, most of the instrumentation drops out and returns with more Hendrix guitar tonal explorations before winding down at 8:23 (second show) and 9:32 (third show). [...] While McDermott feels that the jam is underdeveloped and biographer Harry Shapiro criticizes Miles' vocals, Shadwick and writer David Henderson focus on the [...] "easy groove" [...] and [...] "lilting flow". [...] Besides adding a fresh rhythmic element to his music, it also gives Hendrix more room to experiment with different approaches and sounds on guitar.|$|E
2500|$|To {{retrieve}} the phase shift {{out of the}} interference patterns; a technique called phase-stepping or fringe scanning is used: a <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> (with {{the shape of a}} wedge) is introduced in the reference beam. The <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> creates straight interference fringes with regular intervals; so called carrier fringes. When the sample is placed in the other beam, the carrier fringes are displaced. The phase shift caused by the sample corresponds to the displacement of the carrier fringes. Several interference patterns are recorded for different shifts of the reference beam and by analyzing them the phase information modulo 2 can be extracted. This ambiguity of the phase is called the phase wrapping effect and can be removed by so-called [...] "phase unwrapping techniques". These techniques can be used when the signal-to-noise ratio of the image is sufficiently high and phase variation is not too abrupt.|$|E
2500|$|Each array is {{a circle}} 72.5ft (22.1 m) in {{diameter}} consisting of 2,677 crossed dipole antenna elements, of which 1,792 are powered {{and serve as}} both transmitting and receiving antennas, with the rest functioning as receiving antennas. [...] Due to the phenomenon of interference the radio waves from the separate elements combine {{in front of the}} antenna to form a beam. [...] The array has a gain of 38.6dB, and the width of the beam is only 2.2°. [...] The drive current for each antenna element passes through a device called a <b>phase</b> <b>shifter,</b> controlled by the central computer. [...] By changing the relative timing (phase) of the current pulses supplied to each antenna element the computer can instantly steer the beam to a different direction.|$|E

2500|$|Discovery was {{recorded}} in the duo's own studio Daft House, located at Bangalter's home in Paris, France. Daft Punk started work on the album {{in the spring of}} 1998, and produced it over the course of two years. Bangalter and Homem-Christo made music together and separately, in a similar process to their debut album Homework. Although they used the same equipment as they had for Homework, the duo sought to record tracks that were more concise than their previous work. For Discovery, the group used different samplers and synthesizers, including Akai MPC, E-mu SP-1200, Oberheim DMX and LinnDrum. [...] "Short Circuit", which features a Sequential Circuits drum pattern, was previously heard in Daft Punk's 1997 live sets. For vocoders, the group used a Roland SVC-350, Auto-Tune, and a DigiTech Vocalist. Production on the album also incorporated a PC with an early version of Logic. Every track on Discovery uses a different <b>phase</b> <b>shifter.</b> The album was mastered by Nilesh Patel, who also had mastered Homework.|$|E
2500|$|Keyboard players {{also used}} phasing: in the 1970s, {{keyboard}} instruments like the Fender Rhodes electric piano, the Eminent 310 electronic organ, and the Clavinet were commonly {{treated with a}} phaser, especially in avant-garde jazz. Bill Evans, for instance, used a Maestro phaser on Intuition (1974). The phaser {{is also used to}} [...] "sweeten" [...] their sounds. Examples can be heard in Billy Joel's [...] "Just The Way You Are", Styx's [...] "Babe", and Jean Michel Jarre's Oxygène (1976) on which he used an EHX Small Stone phaser extensively. Tony Banks (Genesis) used an MXR Phase 100 on his RMI 368x Electra piano from 1974 (later he will insert this effect, as well as the fuzzbox, into the Electra's panel); from late 1977 he will also use the phaser (with a Boss CE-1 too) on his Hammond organ, for replacing the Leslie's rotating effect. Daft Punk helped to re-popularize the effect in the 21st century, utilizing it on a number of tracks on their Discovery album in 2001. Richard Tee also used a <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> hooked up to his Fender Rhodes.|$|E
