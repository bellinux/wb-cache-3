40|$|Practically every {{engineering}} {{product with}} {{any degree of}} complexity uses threaded fasteners. Although threaded fasteners are generally considered a mature technology, significant problems exist with their use. This study has investigated a number of issues with the tightening and self-loosening of threaded fasteners. - It was found that upon repeated tightening of electro-zinc plated fastners significant wear of the contact surfaces of the bolt/nut thread and nut face occured. This wear was accompanied by an increase in the friction coefficient causing a reduction in the clamp force provided for an assembly when tightened to a specific torque value. - The self-loosening characteristics of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> <b>nuts</b> were also investigated. It was found that there was a significant loss of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> when a fastner self-loosened when compared to the <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> when being deliberately disassembled. The current standard test for <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> <b>nuts</b> on re-use does not reflect this surprising result and leads to a significant over-estimate of the capability of this class of nut to resist self-loosening. This is a contribution to knowledge on this topic. - A further major original finding of this study has been that if an axial load is also acting on a joint which is experiencing transverse slip, <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> <b>nuts</b> can continue to self-loosen leading to their possible detachment from bolts. A number of accidents have been caused by such detachments, but the cause was not understood partly because this detachment could not be reproduced on the standard loosening test. Work reported in this thesis has been found that if an external axial load is acting whilst the joint is experiencing transverse slip, under the approprioate conditions, the loosening process will continue until nut detachment occurs. - A series of tests has been completed in which the forces needed to tighten and loosen threaded fastners were measured whilst the joint was being subjected to transverse slip/vibration. Measurements were made of the frictional resistance forces in the circumfrential direction and the loosening torque acting on a fastner under transverse slip conditions. It was found that the loosening torque range varied between two positive limits rather than between zero and an upper limit as anticipated by the theory. It was also found that the friction coefficient in the circumfrential direction in the threads is greated than that on the nut face bearing surface during conditions of transverse slip...|$|R

Test procedures are developed and tests are performed on three fastener materials, four anaerobic adhesives, and both unseated assembly conditions. Five to ten samples are tested for each combination. Tests for initial use, reuse without additional adhesive, and reuse with additional adhesive are performed for all samples. A 48 -hour cure time was used for all initial use and reuse tests.

In total, 191 threaded fasteners of different material and coatings were tested in the unseated and seated states with various strengths and varieties of anaerobic adhesive.

40|$|In {{aerospace}} design, where minimizing {{weight is}} always a priority, achieving the full capacity from fasteners is essential. To do so, the initial bolt preload must be maximized. The benefits of high preload are well documented and include improved fatigue resistance, a stiffer joint, and resistance to loosening. But many factors like elastic interactions and embedment tend to lower the initial preload placed on the bolt. These factors provide additional motivation to maximize the initial preload. But, to maximize bolt preload, you must determine what torque to apply. Determining this torque is greatly complicated by the large preload scatter generally seen with torque control. This paper presents a detailed methodology for generating limit torques for threaded fasteners. This methodology accounts for the large scatter in preload found with torque control, and therefore, addresses the statistical nature of the problem. It also addresses <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque,</b> a feature common in aerospace fasteners. Although <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> provides a desired locking feature, it can also increase preload scatter. In addition, it can {{limit the amount of}} preload that can be generated due to the torsion it creates in the bolt. This paper discusses the complications of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> and how best to handle it. A wide range of torque-tension bolt testing was conducted in support of this research. The results from this research will benefit the design engineer as well as analyst involved in the design of bolted joints, leading to better, more optimized structural designs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods to}} statistically quantify data from fastener vibration life tests. Data from fastener vibration life tests with secondary locking features of threaded inserts is used. Threaded inserts {{in three different}} configurations are examined: no locking feature, <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature, and adhesive locking feature. Useful composite plots were developed by extracting minimum preloads versus cycles from test data. Minimum preloads were extracted due to the overlapping of varying test data and because the minimum preload is of most interest in such tests. In addition to composite plots, descriptive statistics of the samples were determined including mean, median, quartiles, and extents. These descriptive statistics were plotted to illustrate variability within a sample as well as variability between samples. These plots also reveal that characteristics of loosening for a sample, such as preload loss and rates of preload loss, are preserved when summarizing such tests. Usually fastener vibration life tests are presented and compared with one test sample, which is why statistically quantifying them is needed and important. Methods to predict the sample population have been created as well. To predict populations, tests to determine {{the distribution of the}} sample, such as probability plots and probability plot correlation coefficient, have been conducted. Once samples were determined to be normal, confidence intervals were created for test samples, which provides a range of where the population mean should lie. It has been shown that characteristics of loosening are preserved in the confidence intervals. Populations of fastener vibration life tests have never before been presented or created. The evaluation of loosening has been conducted for fastener vibration life tests in the past with plots of one test sample; however, in this work statistically quantified results of multiple tests were used. This is important because evaluating loosening with more than one test sample can determine variation between tests. It has been found that secondary locking features do help reduce the loss of preload. The <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> secondary locking feature is found to be more effective as preload is lost.

40|$|Phase I: The use of {{adhesive}} locking features or liquid locking compounds (LLCs) (e. g., Loctite) as a {{means of}} providing a secondary locking feature has been used on NASA programs since the Apollo program. In many cases Loctite was used as a last resort when (a) self-locking fasteners were no longer functioning per their respective drawing specification, (b) access was limited for removal & replacement, or (c) replacement could not be accomplished without severe impact to schedule. Long-term use of Loctite became inevitable in cases where removal and replacement of worn hardware was not cost effective and Loctite was assumed to be fully cured and working. The NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) and United Space Alliance (USA) recognized the need for more extensive testing of Loctite grades to better understand their capabilities and limitations as a secondary locking feature. These tests, identified as Phase I, were designed to identify processing sensitivities, to determine proper cure time, the correct primer to use on aerospace nutplate, insert and bolt materials such as A 286 and MP 35 N, and the minimum amount of Loctite that is required to achieve optimum breakaway torque values. The. 1900 - 32 was the fastener size tested, due to wide usage in the aerospace industry. Three different grades of Loctite were tested. Results indicate that, with proper controls, adhesive locking features can be successfully used in the repair of locking features and should be considered for design. Phase II: Threaded fastening systems used in aerospace programs typically have a requirement for a redundant locking feature. The primary locking method is the fastener preload and the traditional redundant locking feature is a self-locking mechanical device that may include deformed threads, non-metallic inserts, split beam features, or other methods that impede movement between threaded members. The self-locking resistance of traditional locking features can be directly verified during assembly by measuring the dynamic <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque.</b> Adhesive locking features or LLCs are another method of providing redundant locking, but a direct verification method has not been used in aerospace applications to verify proper installation when using LLCs because of concern for damage to the adhesive bond. The reliability of LLCs has also been questioned due to failures observed during testing with coupons for process verification, although the coupon failures have often been attributed to a lack of proper procedures. It is highly desirable to have a direct method of verifying the LLC cure or bond integrity. The purpose of the Phase II test program was to determine if the torque applied during direct verification of an adhesive locking feature degrades that locking feature. This report documents the test program used to investigate the viability of such a direct verification method. Results of the Phase II testing were positive, and additional investigation of direct verification of adhesive locking features is merited...|$|R
40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an externally knurled, internally threaded, round cable connector. The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking sleeve, a collet-locking nut, and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely.

This mechanism differs somewhat from mechanisms used in conventional friction stir welding, as described below.

Self-reacted friction stir welding has become popular in the solid-state welding community as a means of reducing the complexity of tooling and to reduce costs.

Temperature measurements at the tips of Schanz screws in the 1. 5 T MR scanner showed a rise of 0. 7 degrees C for a pelvic frame and of 2. 1 degrees C for a diamond knee bridge frame when normalized to a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 2 W/kg. The normalized temperature increases in the 3 T MR scanner were 0. 9 degrees C for the pelvic frame and 1. 1 degrees C for the knee bridge frame. Large external fixation frames assembled with the newly designed clamps (390 Series Clamps), carbon fiber reinforced rods, and implant quality 316 L stainless steel Schanz screws met <b>prevailing</b> force and <b>torque</b> limits when tested in a 3 -T field, and demonstrated temperature increase that met IEC- 60601 guidelines for extremities. The influence of frame-induced eddy currents on the risk of peripheral nerve stimulation was not investigated...|$|R
30|$|As {{the designs}} for timber {{structures}} grow larger and larger, contractors are increasingly using lag screw connectors in their projects [1]. The benefits of lag screw joints include less loosening and slippage when a load is first applied than bolted timber joints; however, they also require more caution, making construction management {{an important consideration}} [2]. For example, screwing in a lag screw without first drilling a pilot hole can cause the timber member to crack, or driven in using a hammer. In addition, overtightening beyond a lag screw’s pullout strength risks damaging the joint, weakening it compared with its original performance. One potential solution to prevent the latter scenario is to apply a torque control method to provide suitable torque {{by means of a}} torque wrench or other tool. However, no one has yet developed a torque control method for lag screw timber joints: contractors today rely on their own experiences and intuition when tightening lag screw connectors, an arbitrary judgment. Torque control methods involve different tightening speeds, because tools such as <b>torque</b> wrenches and <b>nut</b> runners are turned manually to provide torque. For metallic bolted joints, differences in tightening speed are known to result in different coefficients of friction and torque, important factors that determine the feasibility of a given torque control method as well as in variation in axial force (“clamp force” below) [3]. In a previous study on bolted timber joints, we discovered that the torque coefficient decreases at higher tightening speeds and were able to reduce fluctuations in the clamp force by setting the tightening speed to 20  rpm [4]. For lag screw timber joints, however, {{there appears to be no}} research that has clarified the effects of tightening speed on the torque coefficient. This point needs to be clarified, since construction management is more important for lag screw timber joints than for bolt joints, and because no torque control method has been established for lag screw timber joints. In a previous study, we developed a high damping shear wall in which timber members were joined together, or to steel plates, with lag screws or bolts. Tightening generates a clamp force, which in turn generates a frictional resistance force between two timber members, or between one and a steel plate [5]. Our later research investigated how to apply torque control methods to control this clamp force, a serious issue that must be addressed to control the expression of this frictional resistance force [6, 7]. One of the resulting challenges we faced in developing our high damping shear wall was how to determine the effects of lag screw tightening speed on the joint’s torque coefficient.|$|R
