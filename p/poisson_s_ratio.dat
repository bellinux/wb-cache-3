40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with modeling the non-linear response of fiber reinforced polymer laminates. Recent experimental data suggests that the non-linearity is not only caused by matrix cracking but also by matrix plasticity due to shear stresses. To capture the effects of those two mechanisms, a model combining a plasticity formulation with continuum damage has been developed to simulate the non-linear response of laminates under plane stress states. The model is {{used to compare the}} predicted behavior of various laminate lay-ups to experimental data from the literature by looking at the degradation of axial modulus and <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> of the laminates. The influence of residual curing stresses and in-situ effect on the predicted response is also investigated. It is shown that predictions of the combined damage/plasticity model, in general, correlate well with the experimental data. The test data shows that there are two different mechanisms that can have opposite effects on the degradation of the laminate <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> which is captured correctly by the damage/plasticity model. Residual curing stresses are found to have a minor influence on the predicted response for the cases considered here. Some open questions remain regarding the prediction of damage onset...|$|E

In this thesis, attention {{has been placed on}} the underpinning relations between molecular structure and properties of one type of soft matter - main chain liquid crystalline elastomers (MCLCEs), which may have application as shape memory or as auxetic materials. In this work, a number of siloxane-based MCLCEs and their linear polymer analogues (MCLCPs) with chemical variations were synthesized and examined. Among these chemical variations, rigid p-phenylene transverse rod and flat-shaped anthraquinone (AQ) mesogenic monomers were specifically incorporated. Thermal and X-ray analysis found a smectic C phase in most of our MCLCEs, which was induced by the strong self-segregation of siloxane spacers, hydrocarbon spacers and mesogenic rods. The smectic C mesophase of the parent LCE was not grossly affected by terphenyl transverse rods. Mechanical studies of MCLCEs indicated the typical three-region stress-strain curve and a polydomain-to-monodomain transition. Strain recovery experiments of MCLCEs showed a significant dependence of strain retentions on the initial strains but not on the chemical variations, such as the crosslinker content and the lateral substituents on mesogenic rods. The MCLCE with p-phenylene transverse rod showed a highly ordered smectic A mesophase at room temperature with high stiffness. Mechanical properties of MCLCEs with AQ monomers exhibit a strong dependence on the specific combination of hydrocarbon spacer and siloxane spacer, which also strongly affect the formation of ð-ð stacking between AQ units. <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> measurement over a wide strain range found distinct trends of <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> {{as a function of the}} crosslinker content as well as terphenyl transverse rod loadings in its parent MCLCEs.

40|$|Spray-on foam {{insulation}} {{is applied to}} the exterior of the Space Shuttle s External Tank to limit propellant boil-off and to prevent ice formation. The Space Shuttle foams are rigid closed-cell polyurethane foams. The two foams used most extensively on the Space Shuttle External Tank are BX- 265 and NCFI 24 - 124. Since the catastrophic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia, numerous studies have been conducted to mitigate the likelihood and the severity of foam shedding during the Shuttle s ascent to space. Due to the foaming and rising process, the foam microstructures are elongated in the rise direction. As a result, these two foams exhibit a non-isotropic mechanical behavior. In this paper, a detailed microstructural characterization of the two foams is presented. The key features of the foam cells are summarized and the average cell dimensions in the two foams are compared. Experimental studies to measure the room temperature mechanical response of the two foams in the two principal material directions (parallel to the rise and perpendicular to the rise) are also reported. The measured elastic modulus, proportional limit stress, ultimate tensile stress and the <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratios</b> for the two foams are compared. The generalized elongated Kelvin foam model previously developed by the authors is reviewed and the equations which result from this model are presented. The resulting equations show that the ratio of the elastic modulus in the rise direction to that in the perpendicular-to-rise direction as well as the ratio of the strengths in the two material directions is only a function of the microstructural dimensions. Using the measured microstructural dimensions and the measured stiffness ratio, the foam tensile strength <b>ratio</b> and <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratios</b> are predicted for both foams.

40|$|A {{micromechanics}} {{model has}} been constructed to study the mechanical behavior of spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) for the external tank. The model was constructed using finite elements representing the fundamental repeating unit of the SOFI microstructure. The details of the micromechanics model were based on cell observations and measured average cell dimensions discerned from photomicrographs. The unit cell model is an elongated Kelvin model (fourteen-sided polyhedron with 8 hexagonal and six quadrilateral faces), which will pack to a 100 % density. The cell faces and cell edges are modeled using three-dimensional 20 -node brick elements. Only one-eighth of the cell is modeled due to symmetry. By exercising the model and correlating the results with the macro-mechanical foam behavior obtained through material characterization testing, the intrinsic stiffness and <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>Ratio</b> of the polymeric cell walls and edges are determined {{as a function of}} temperature.

The elastic constants, as calculated via the polynomials and linear interpolation of the tabular data in ASTM C 1259 and E 1876, were found comparable for engineering purposes, with the differences typically being less than 0. 5 percent. Calculation of additional v values at t/R between 0 and 0. 2 would allow better curve fits.

40|$|Mesh {{deformation}} {{in response}} to redefined boundary geometry is a frequently encountered task in shape optimization and analysis of fluid-structure interaction. We propose a simple and concise method for deforming meshes defined with three-node triangular or four-node tetrahedral elements. The mesh deformation method is suitable for large boundary movement. The approach requires two consecutive linear elastic finite-element analyses of an isotropic continuum using a prescribed displacement at the mesh boundaries. The first analysis is performed with homogeneous elastic property and the second with inhomogeneous elastic property. The fully stressed design is employed with a vanishing <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> and a proposed form of equivalent strain (modified Tresca equivalent strain) to calculate, from the strain result of the first analysis, the element-specific Young s modulus for the second analysis.

It is being investigated here {{as a replacement for}} aircraft grade glass fiber and has a number of attractive functional attributes, {{not the least of which}} is its high fire resistance. The test configuration studied here consisted of two 1 mm (0. 04 in.) thick, flat aluminum panels separated by 12. 7 cm (5. 0 in.) with a 7. 6 cm (3. 0 in.) thick layer of foam centered in that space. Random incidence transmission loss measurements were conducted on this buildup, and conventional poro-elastic models were used to predict the performance of the lining material. Results from two densities of foam are considered. The Biot parameters of the foam were determined by a combination of direct measurement (for density, flow resistivity and Young s modulus) and inverse characterization procedures (for porosity, tortuosity, viscous and thermal characteristic length, <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> and loss factor). The inverse characterization procedure involved matching normal incidence standing wave tube measurements of absorption coefficient and transmission loss of the isolated foam with finite element predictions.

40|$|High Q {{resonators}} are {{a critical}} component of stable, low-noise communication systems, radar, and precise timing applications such as atomic clocks. In electronic resonators based on Si integrated circuits, resistive losses increase {{as a result of the}} continued reduction in device dimensions, which decreases their Q values. On the other hand, due to the mechanical construct of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators, such loss mechanisms are absent, enabling higher Q-values for both BAW and SAW resonators compared to their electronic counterparts. The other advantages of mechanical resonators are their inherently higher radiation tolerance, a factor that makes them attractive for NASA s extreme environment planetary missions, for example to the Jovian environments where the radiation doses are at hostile levels. Despite these advantages, both BAW and SAW resonators suffer from low resonant frequencies and they are also physically large, which precludes their integration into miniaturized electronic systems. Because there is a need to move the resonant frequency of oscillators to the order of gigahertz, new technologies and materials are being investigated that will make performance at those frequencies attainable. By moving to nanoscale structures, in this case vertically oriented, cantilevered carbon nanotubes (CNTs), that have larger aspect ratios (length/thickness) and extremely high elastic moduli, it is possible to overcome the two disadvantages of both bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators. Nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) that utilize high aspect ratio nanomaterials exhibiting high elastic moduli (e. g., carbon-based nanomaterials) benefit from high Qs, operate at high frequency, and have small force constants that translate to high responsivity that results in improved sensitivity, lower power consumption, and im - proved tunablity. NEMS resonators have recently been demonstrated using topdown, lithographically fabricated ap - proaches to form cantilever or bridgetype structures. Top-down approaches, however, rely on complicated and expensive e-beam lithography, and often require a release mechanism. Reso - nance effects in structures synthesized using bottom-up approaches have also recently been reported based on carbon nanotubes, but such approaches have relied on a planar two-dimensional (2 D) geometry. In this innovation, vertically aligned tubes synthesized using a bottom- up approach have been considered, where the vertical orientation of the tubes has the potential to increase integration density even further. The simulation of a vertically oriented, cantilevered carbon nanotube was performed using COMSOL Multi - physics, a finite element simulation package. All simulations were performed in a 2 D geometry that provided consistent results and minimized computational complexity.

40|$|The pumping {{potential}} (PP) of {{a structure}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of the relative volume change to a relative input stroke. It is introduced to evaluate the volumetric efficiency of a pump. The value of the PP is related to the geometric characteristics and the material properties of the pump structure. A single-layer hyperbolic shell-of-revolution flexible matrix composite (FMC) structure was investigated by Ghoneim and Noor. When under torsion, the rotation of the hyperbolic shell structure causes the throat diameter and the characteristic length to simultaneously decrease, rendering a substantial volumetric decrease and consequently a high PP. Some fibrous composite materials can have negative Effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio.</b> One of their most distinguished characteristics is that they laterally expand under stretching and contract under compression, while for an isotropic material having positive Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio,</b> it expands under compression and contracts under stretching. Therefore, when subjected to axial loading, the relative volume change of a structure made of negative Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> materials would be larger than the corresponding one made of a conventional material. When applied to a pump structure, this characteristic (negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio)</b> is expected to increase the pumping potential due to the larger relative volume change. For FMC laminates, when fiber orientation angles are properly set up, a high negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> can be obtained. As a result, structures made of these FMC laminates could engender a larger PP. Our work attempts to improve upon the PP of the single-layer hyperbolic shell structure by using multi-layer FMC materials with negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio.</b> The study is conducted both analytically and experimentally.

In order to qualify a polymer matrix composite (PMC) material as a candidate aeroshell structural material, its performance must be evaluated under realistic environments.

Recently, a strong lightweight crosslinked silica aerogel has been developed by encapsulating the skeletal framework of amine-modified silica aerogels with polyureas derived by isocyanate.

Characterization has been conducted on the thermal, physical properties and the mechanical properties under quasi-static loading conditions. In this paper, we present results on the dynamic compressive behavior of the crosslinked silica aerogel (CSA) using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). A new tubing pulse shaper was employed to help reach the dynamic stress equilibrium and constant strain rate. The stress-strain relationship was determined at high strain rates within 114 - 4386 /s.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Original analytical theories are developed for partitioning mixed-mode fractures on rigid interfaces in laminated orthotropic double cantilever beams (DCBs) based on 2 D elasticity by using some novel methods. Note that although the DCB represents a simplified case, it provides a deep understanding and predictive capability for real applications and does not restrict the analysis to a simple class of fracture problems. The developed theories are generally applicable to so-called 1 D fracture consisting of opening (mode I) and shearing (mode II) action only with no tearing (mode III) action, for example, straight edge cracks, circular blisters in plates and shells, etc. A salient point of the methods is to first derive one loading condition that causes one pure fracture mode. It is conveniently called the first pure mode. Then, all other pure fracture modes can be determined by using this pure mode and the property of orthogonality between pure mode I modes and pure mode II modes. Finally, these 2 D-elasticity-based pure modes are used to partition mixed-mode fractures into contributions from the mode I and mode II fracture modes by considering a mixed-mode fracture as the superposition of pure mode I and mode II fractures. The partition is made {{in terms of the}} energy release rate (ERR) or the stress intensity factor (SIF). An analytical partition theory is developed first for a DCB composed of two identical linear elastic layers. The first pure mode is obtained by introducing correction factors into the beam-theory-based mechanical conditions. The property of orthogonality is then used to determine all other pure modes in the absence of through-thickness-shear forces. To accommodate through-thickness shear forces, first two pure through-thickness-shear-force pure modes (one pure mode I and one pure mode II) are discovered by extending a Timoshenko beam partition theory. Partition of mixed-mode fractures under pure through-thickness shear forces is then achieved by using these two pure modes in conjunction with two thickness-ratio-dependent correction factors: (1) a shear correction factor, and (2) a pure-mode-II ERR correction factor. Both correction factors closely follow a normal distribution around a symmetric DCB geometry. The property of orthogonality between all pure mode I and all pure mode II fracture modes is then used to complete the mixed-mode fracture partition theory for a DCB with bending moments, axial forces and through-thickness shear forces. Fracture on bimaterial interfaces is an important consideration in the design and application of composite materials and structures. It has, however, proved an extremely challenging problem for many decades to obtain an analytical solution for the complex SIFs and the crack extension size-dependent ERRs, based on 2 D elasticity. Such an analytical solution for a brittle interfacial crack between two dissimilar elastic layers is obtained in two stages. In the first stage the bimaterial DCB is under tip bending moments and axial forces and has a mismatch in Young s modulus; however, the Poisson s ratios of the top and bottom layers are the same. The solution is achieved by developing two types of pure fracture modes and two powerful mathematical techniques. The two types of pure fracture modes are a SIF-type and a load-type. The two mathematical techniques are a shifting technique and an orthogonal pure mode technique. In the second stage, the theory is extended to accommodate a <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> mismatch. Equivalent material properties are derived for each layer, namely, an equivalent elastic modulus and an equivalent <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio,</b> such that both the total ERR and the bimaterial mismatch coefficient are maintained in an alternative equivalent case. Cases for which no analytical solution for the SIFs and ERRs currently exist can therefore be transformed into cases for which the analytical solution does exist. It is now possible to use a completely analytical 2 D-elasticity-based theory to calculate the complex SIFs and crack extension size-dependent ERRs. The original partition theories presented have been validated by comparison with numerical simulations. Excellent agreement has been observed. Moreover, one partition theory is further extended to consider the blister test and the adhesion energy of mono- and multi-layered graphene membranes on a silicon oxide substrate. Use of the partition theory presented in this work allows the correct critical mode I and mode II adhesion energy to be obtained and all the experimentally observed behaviour is explained...|$|E

Nanoporous polymer fibres are currently attracting increasing interest due to their unique characteristics. Increased specific surface area, improved mechanical properties and improved cellular growth are amongst the advantages that set porous fibres as ideal candidates in applications like catalysis, separation and tissue engineering. This work explores the single step production of porous poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) fibres through combinative electrospinning and Non-solvent Induced Phase Separation (NIPS) technique. Theoretical models, based on three different contact models (Hertzian, DMT, JKR), correlating the fibrous network specific surface area to material properties (density, surface tension, Young s modulus, <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio)</b> and network physical properties (density) and geometrical characteristics (fibre radius, fibre aspect ratio, network thickness) were developed in order to calculate the surface area increase caused by pore induction. Experimental results proved that a specific surface area increase of up to 56 % could be achieved, compared to networks composed of smooth surfaced fibres. The good solvent effect on electrospun fibre surface morphology and size was examined through experimental investigation of four different good solvent (chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran and formic acid) based solutions at various good/poor solvent ratios. Chloroform was proven {{to be the most}} suitable solvent for good /poor solvent ratios varying from 75 - 90 % v/v, whereas alternative mechanisms leading to different fibre morphologies were identified, interpreted and discussed. Evaporation rate of the good solvent was identified as the key parameter of the process. Second order polynomial equations, derived from the experimental data, correlating the feed solution physical parameters (viscosity, conductivity, surface tension) to the fibre average diameter produced were developed and validated. Response surface methodology was implemented for the design and conduction of electrospinning experiments on a 12. 5 % w/v Chloroform/DMSO solution 90 / 10 % v/v {{in order to determine the}} individual process parameters (spinning distance, applied voltage, solution flow rate) effect in fibre surface morphology and size. The increase in any of these parameters results in increase of both the fibre size and the tendency for pore generation, whereas applied voltage was the parameter with the strongest effect. Findings from this thesis expand the knowledge about both phenomena occurring during the production process and end product properties, and can be used for the production of controlled morphology and size porous poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) fibres...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis is concerned with (a) the development of full-field, multi-axis and phase contrast wavelength scanning interferometer, using an electronically tuned CW Ti:Sa laser {{for the study of}} depth resolved measurements in composite materials such as GFRPs and (b) the development of temporal phase unwrapping algorithms for depth re-solved measurements. Item (a) was part of the ultimate goal of successfully extracting the 3 -D, depth-resolved, constituent parameters (Young s modulus E, <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> v etc.) that define the mechanical behaviour of composite materials like GFRPs. Considering the success of OCT as an imaging modality, a wavelength scanning interferometer (WSI) capable of imaging the intensity AND the phase of the interference signal was proposed as the preferred technique to provide the volumetric displacement/strain fields (Note that displacement/strain fields are analogous to phase fields and thus a phase-contrast interferometer is of particular interest in this case). These would then be passed to the VFM and yield the sought parameters provided the loading scheme is known. As a result, a number of key opto-mechanical hardware was developed. First, a multiple channel (x 6) tomographic interferometer realised in a Mach-Zehnder arrangement was built. Each of the three channels would provide the necessary information to extract the three orthogonal displacement/strain components while the other three are complementary and were included in the design in order to maximize the penetration depth (sample illuminated from both sides). Second, a miniature uniaxial (tensile and/or compression) loading machine was designed and built for the introduction of controlled and low magnitude displacements. Last, a rotation stage for the experimental determination of the sensitivity vectors and the re-registration of the volumetric data from the six channels was also designed and built. Unfortunately, due to the critical failure of the Ti:Sa laser data collection using the last two items was not possible. However, preliminary results at a single wavelength suggested that the above items work as expected. Item (b) involved the development of an optical sensor for the dynamic monitoring of wavenumber changes during a full 100 nm scan. The sensor is comprised of a set of four wedges in a Fizeau interferometer setup that became part of the multi-axis interferometer (7 th channel). Its development became relevant due to the large amount of mode-hops present during a full scan of the Ti:Sa source. These are associated to the physics of the laser and have the undesirable effect of randomising the signal and thus preventing successful depth reconstructions. The multi-wedge sensor was designed so that it provides simultaneously high wavenumber change resolution and immunity to the large wavenumber jumps from the Ti:Sa. The analysis algorithms for the extraction of the sought wavenumber changes were based on 2 -D Fourier transform method followed by temporal phase unwrapping. At first, the performance of the sensor was tested against that of a high-end commercial wavemeter for a limited scan of 1 nm. A root mean square (rms) difference in measured wavenumber shift between the two of ∼ 4 m- 1 has been achieved, equivalent to an rms wavelength shift error of ∼ 0. 4 pm. Second, by resampling the interference signal and the wavenumber-change axis onto a uniformly sampled k-space, depth resolutions that are close to the theoretical limits were achieved for scans of up to 37 nm. Access of the full 100 nm range that is characterised by wavelength steps down to picometers level was achieved by introducing a number of improvements to the original temporal phase unwrapping algorithm reported in ref [1] tailored to depth resolved measurements. These involved the estimation and suppression of intensity background artefacts, improvements on the 2 -D Fourier transform phase detection based on a previously developed algorithm in ref [2] and finally the introduction of two modifications to the original TPU. Both approaches are adaptive and involve signal re-referencing at regular intervals throughout the scan. Their purpose is to compensate for systematic and non-systematic errors owing to a small error in the value of R (a scaling factor applied to the lower sensitivity wedge phase-change signal used to unwrap the higher sensitivity one), or small changes in R with wavelength due to the possibility of a mismatch in the refractive dispersion curves of the wedges and/or a mismatch in the wedge angles. A hybrid approach combining both methods was proposed and used to analyse the data from each of the four wedges. It was found to give the most robust results of all the techniques considered, with a clear Fourier peak at the expected frequency, with significantly reduced spectral artefacts and identical depth resolutions for all four wedges of 2. 2 μm measured at FWHM. The ability of the phase unwrapping strategy in resolving the aforementioned issues was demonstrated by successfully measuring the absolute thickness of four fused silica glasses using real experimental data. The results were compared with independent micrometer measurements and showed excellent agreement. Finally, {{due to the lack of}} additional experimental data and in an attempt to justify the validity of the proposed temporal phase unwrapping strategy termed as the hybrid approach, a set of simulations that closely matched the parameters characterising the real experimental data set analysed were produced and were subsequently analysed. The results of this final test justify that the various fixes included in the hybrid approach have not evolved to solve the problems of a particular data set but are rather of general nature thereby, highlighting its importance for PC-WSI applications concerning the processing and analysis of large scans...|$|E

The ratio decreased from 8 on March 15, 2011, to 0.8 on May 18, 2011, then stayed between 0.8 and 3.3 with gradual fluctuation. In a gas phase, the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> changes by reaction (1), whose equilibrium constant {{is given by}} the Eq. (2). If the H 2 /H 2 O ratio, therefore the oxygen fugacity, is constant in the gas phase, a decrease of the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> {{can be caused by}} a temperature decrease. Hydrogen, however, is a minor species compared with SO 2 and H 2 S, and the H 2 /H 2 O ratio commonly decreases with temperature as a result of reaction (1) under a constant SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> (gas buffer; Giggenbach, 1987). The H 2 /H 2 O ratio of the Shimoedake gas is 5 × 10 − 5, that is three orders of magnitude lower than that controlled by a QFM buffer, a common rock buffer, and {{it is unlikely that the}} SO 2 /H 2 S decrease is caused by a temperature decrease under a constant H 2 /H 2 O ratio. A pressure increase at a constant temperature and the H 2 /H 2 O ratio results in the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> increase (Eq. (2)). The temperature and the oxygen fugacity is likely to be constant at the magma degassing condition, whereas the pressure can be variable. The ten times decrease of the ratio can be caused by a ten times increase of the degassing pressure. The gradual variation of the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratios</b> between 0.8 and 3.3 can be similarly caused by a variation of the degassing pressure by four times.
