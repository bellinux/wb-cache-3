50|$|Baosbheinn has one {{noteworthy}} geological feature: {{it being}} {{the site of}} the largest and most impressive <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> in Great Britain. The rampart is situated at the NW end of the ridge below the crags of Creag an Fithich at an height of around 450 m. It formed in post-glacial times when a massive rockslide or series of rockslides involving failure of approximately 200,000 m³ of rock over-rode a former snowbed and accumulated as a boulder ridge. The north west end of Baosbheinn where the <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> is situated has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest over an area of 39,000,000 m².|$|E
50|$|Aonach Mòr has a corrie {{known to}} hold snow from {{one year to}} the next: Coire an Lochain. One of these patches, sitting behind a <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> , {{sometimes}} survives longer than the patch slightly higher up against the tall cliffs.|$|E
50|$|A <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> (or pronival rampart) is a depositional landform of {{periglacial}} origin. It {{forms as}} rock debris falls onto a steep snow slope from a cliff above and slides down the snow surface {{to come to}} a rest {{at the foot of the}} slope. Over a long period of time, sufficient material can accumulate in this way to produce a distinct bank of stony material which, long after the snowbed has melted away, remains as a rampart (a bank or mound similar to a manmade rampart). The debris may also accumulate through avalanching or landslide. Protalus ramparts may be distinguished from glacial moraines by their lack of rock fragments with glacial abrasion or striations. The morphology of the site may also suggest it being unfavourable for the development of a glacier, but suitable for this mechanism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protalus</b> <b>ramparts</b> are {{recorded}} in the Cairngorms and northwest Highlands of Scotland. An especially large example {{on the north side}} of Baosbheinn measures 1 km in length and reaches a height of 55 m. It is thought to result from a major rock slope failure, however evidence leads some to class it as a protalus rock glacier. Several features amongst the mountains of the Brecon Beacons National Park have been interpreted by some authors as <b>protalus</b> <b>ramparts</b> but as moraines by others. The depositional ridge of Fan Fechan beneath Fan Hir, formerly thought to be a rampart due to its linear nature paralleling the line of the cliff above is now considered to be a moraine.|$|R
40|$|Rock glaciers and <b>protalus</b> <b>ramparts</b> are {{characteristic}} landforms of the periglacial domain {{often used as}} markers for the occurrence of permafrost in mountain terrains. As such, relict rock glaciers {{can be used for}} paleoclimate reconstructions. We present here the first previously unreported rock glacier inventory of the south-eastern Alps (including the north-eastern-most region of Italy and Slovenia), interpreted from high resolution orthophotos and a high resolution digital terrain model interpolated from airborne laser scanning (LiDAR). We mapped 53 rock glaciers covering a total area of 3. 45  km 2. The majority of rock glaciers are classified as relict and distributed between 1708 and 1846  m a. s. l. with slope ranging between 19 ° and 27 °. In addition to rock glaciers we observed 66 <b>protalus</b> (pronival) <b>ramparts,</b> having median elevation of 1913  m a. s. l. and covering 0. 48  km 2. More than half of the inventoried <b>protalus</b> <b>ramparts</b> are located in the more maritime area of the Alps with higher precipitation compared to the location of rock glaciers. Using paleoclimate reconstruction based on the 1981 – 2010 climatological record of the area, we infer that the rock glaciers formed during one of the dry and cold periods of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Possible evolution of the active pronival forms observed in the most maritime area of this alpine sector is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{classification}} of landforms denominated as "protalus ramparts" {{in the scientific}} literature {{is a problem that}} is far from being resolved. The main objective of this contribution is to support a permafrost-related definition of protalus ramparts. If we consider the Alpine framework, protalus ramparts are generally very rare landforms; by contrast, the Alpine periglacial belt is characterised by a large diffusion of talus slopes and talus rock glaciers. The investigations carried out in six sites of the Valais Alps (Switzerland) allow eight major "diagnostic criteria" to be presented that help to define protalus ramparts in Alpine environments and that support the permafrost-related genesis of most of them. The major source of controversy is related {{to the use of the}} term <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> to designate both a nivo-gravitational landform (also called "pronival ramparts") and a permafrost-related landform. All the considerations presented here allow an active <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> to be defined simply as a (small) active talus rock glacier...|$|E

40|$|Little Ice Age (LIA) {{deposits}} {{are recognized}} on Mt. Tbielsen, southern Oregon Cascades (43 ° 92 ̆ 7 N, 122 ° 32 ̆ 7 W), based on particle morphology and relative position. The initial advance, Lathrop 1, created a sharp-crested moraine and a <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> within 200 m of the headwall. The retreat of the glacier and recent ice movement, Lathrop 2, is {{recognized by the}} deformation of the moraine and a mantle of 2 ̆ 2 protalus till 2 ̆ 2 creating a polygenetic 2 ̆ 2 push-deformation 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 moraine. Both the moraine and the <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> have sparse vegetation, no lichens, and a lightly weathered Cox/C soil. This sequence is correlative with LIA Phase 1 and Phase 2 on Mt. Jefferson, central Oregon Cascades, and is broadly correlated with LIA deposits throughout the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains. There is no evidence for pre-LIA deposits at Mt. Thielsen. The ELA on Lathrop Glacier (2450 m) is lower than ELAs on nearby glaciers. The glacier probably exists because of its preferential topographic position and extensive debris cover; thus, if annual snowfall decreases the glacier will persist longer than a similar sized bare ice glacier. Conversely, a growing <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> may indicate an increase in annual snowfall but not necessarily a decrease in annual temperatures. The lack of older Neoglacial deposits on Mt. Thielsen may {{be a result of}} insufficient snowfall to maintain or advance the Lathrop Glacier. As such, the LIA may represent a period when climatic conditions were more severe {{than at any other time}} in the Neoglacial. Boulder size, shape, and orientation proved useful for classifying geomorphic features and assessing the relative ages of slopes. However, soils are the best method for correlating deposits in the cirque with other locations. Soils beyond the moraine are developed in Mazama ash and have moderately developed Bw horizons, depth to weathering over 70 cm, and Harden 2 ̆ 7 s PDI for B horizons of 2. 10 - 3. 64.

50|$|Discrete debris {{accumulation}} (DDA) is a non-genetic term {{in mountain}} glacial geology to aid identification of non-lithified sediments on a valley or mountain slope or floor. It is intended that the debris accumulation is discrete {{such that it}} can be mapped, in the field and/or from aerial or satellite imagery. The origin or formative process may well not be known clearly or be changed by subsequent investigators it is advisable to have a non-genetic field reference so that discussion can then be used to ascertain, if possible, the origin. Mountain areas may currently have glaciers (glacierized) or have had glaciers (glaciated) or be subject to forms of periglacial activity. A moraine would be an easily identified DDA as would an esker. Although scree (talus) is generally easily identified and mapped, these deposits may be modified by ice, avalanches or downlope movement to create essentially new landforms. Many small slope failures and landslides can give the appearance of moraines or <b>protalus</b> <b>ramparts</b> on slopes. After mapping as a DDA, further investigation might draw light on the origin of the feature.|$|R

Six sediment-landform assemblages are described and interpreted for Ulu Peninsula, James Ross Island, NE Antarctic Peninsula: (1) the Glacier Ice and Snow Assemblage; (2) the Glacigenic Assemblage, which relates to LGM sediments and comprises both erratic-poor and erratic-rich drift, deposited by cold-based and wet-based ice and ice streams respectively; (3) the Boulder Train Assemblage, deposited during a Mid-Holocene glacier readvance; (4) the Ice-cored Moraine Assemblage, found in front of small cirque glaciers; (5) the Paraglacial Assemblage including scree, pebble-boulder lags, and littoral and fluvial processes; and (6) the Periglacial Assemblage including rock glaciers, <b>protalus</b> <b>ramparts,</b> blockfields, solifluction lobes and extensive patterned ground.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that pronival (<b>protalus)</b> <b>ramparts</b> can be formed by a snow-push mechanism and need not accumulate {{in the conventional}} manner {{as a result of}} supranival processes. Ridges in pronival positions up to 1. 2 m high and of unequivocal snow-push origin are described from two sites in Smørbotn cirque, Romsdalsalpane, southern Norway. The seven lines of evidence are: (1) parallel abrasion tracks on large boulders embedded in the substrate; (2) displaced surface and embedded clasts with proximal furrows; (3) corrugated (flute-like) substrate surfaces; (4) the sickle-shaped plan-form of the ridges; (5) generally asymmetrical ridge cross-profiles (shallow, concave proximal; steep, convex distal); (6) strong preferred orientations and dips of surface-embedded clasts on ridge proximal slopes; and (7) a subnival/pronival ridge comprising loosely packed diamicton forming along the contact zone between the snowbed and substrate. This evidence indicates ridge formation by snow sliding involving bulldozing of the substrate. Factors considered important in favouring snow push producing distinct pronival ramparts at the sites include: a maritime periglacial climate with heavy winter snowfall and rapid snow-firn conversion producing snow densities of up to 900 kg m– 3; a deformable substrate with relatively small inputs of rockfall or avalanche debris; and a steep headwall susceptible to snow avalanching and hence enhanced snow supply. Consideration is given to the prospect that larger pronival ramparts can form incrementally by a snow-push mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Moraine sequences, protalus ramparts, rock glaciers {{and various}} slope {{deposits}} in seven separate glacier basins provide lichenometric ages for glacier retreat in an upland area of Sogn-og-Fjordane, southern Norway. Geomorphological mapping, relative dating based on section Rhizocarpon size-frequency distributions, observations on vegetation cover, and numeric dating {{based on a}} regional lichen dating curve for section Rhizocarpon, place moraines into three groups: Stage 1 moraines of likely Preboreal or Younger Dryas age; Stage 2 moraines of pre- or early ’Little Ice Age ’ but post-Preboreal age (thirteenth-fourteenth centuries); and Stage 3 moraines of fifteenth-century age and younger. The occurrence of thirteenth-sixteenth century (pre- or early ’Little Ice Age’) moraines at low altitudes in the Sandane area is thought to relate to greater availability of moisture and to the capture of wind-drifted snow.

40|$|Possible {{periglacial}} and relict glacial landforms in {{the ancient}} mountain range of the Thaumasia Highlands, Mars, are described.

40|$|Landform {{transitions}} {{are defined}} as intermediate forms that represent transient developmental stages between conventional landform types. This study evaluates possible cases of landform transitions from pronival (<b>protalus)</b> <b>ramparts</b> to moraine ridges, and from pronival ramparts to lobate rock glaciers (protalus lobes) {{at the foot of}} the headwall of Smørbotn cirque in southern Norway. The five landforms had been previously classified as pronival ramparts. We conclude that only two (Smørbotn 2 and 3) are undisputed, active pronival ramparts, which developed under the seasonal-freezing regime of the Holocene. It is inferred that a third (Smørbotn 1) represents the transition to a moraine ridge formed during the ‘Little Ice Age’ of the last few centuries as a semi-permanent snowbed grew into a small temperate glacier. The two others (Smørbotn 7 and 8) appear to be relict embryonic rock glaciers that developed between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Younger Dryas Stadial under a permafrost regime and benefited from enhanced debris supply as a result of rock-slope instability affected by glacier debuttressing and permafrost degradation. Variable landscape settings and distinctive environmental histories contribute to the differences in the morphology of these landforms. We highlight continuing controversies over the modes of formation and diagnostic characteristics of pronival ramparts by positioning them, together with push/dump moraines, ice-cored moraines and rock glaciers, in a conceptual model of the periglacial–glacial landform continuum. The model links snow, ice and debris fluxes under seasonal-freezing and/or permafrost climatic regimes to the process thresholds between landform types...|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} Lyngen Peninsula in Troms, northern Norway, {{displays a}} suite of glacial and periglacial landforms that describe both a complex interaction of geomorphological processes and its history of deglaciation during the Late Weichselian and Holocene. These features include: cirque and valley glacier moraines, relict ice-cored moraines, rock avalanches, rock glaciers, a <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart,</b> and other talus-derived landforms. Morphological relationships of landforms within the three valleys of Strupskardet, Veidalen and Reindalen were studied in detail; {{using a combination of}} geographic information systems (GIS), aerial photograph interpretation, and field research. Seven distinctive glacial stages (comprised of up to 13 minor phases) were identified, and presented as a series of maps that describe the chronology of deglaciation within the study area. Relative-age dating of moraines was performed with a Schmidt hammer, which measured the rebound value (R-value) from boulder surfaces. This technique was found to be an effective tool that offered additional insight into the age of moraines and other landforms.

40|$|In {{the area}} of Piz Corvatsch (Upper Engadin, Grisons, Switzerland), the actual {{vegetation}} on active and inactive rock glacier surfaces has been mapped. The floristic composition (vascular plants and lichens) of the different rock glacier surfaces has been mapped and compared with photogrammetrical measurements of surface movements of the active rock glaciers. In general, the active rock glacier surfaces show a very low cover of vascular plants. Most of them are located at the edge and {{at the front of}} the rock glacier where fine-grained soil material occurs in small pokkets. Lichenometry has been used as an additional method on Murtèl rock glacier and on the <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart.</b> Measurements of Rhizocarpon geographicum thalli revealed increasing sizes from the root zone of the rock glacier to its front.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and preservation of}} ground ice over the typical time scales (millennia) involved with the steady flow over long time intervals of large and well-developed rock glaciers require the existence of peren-nially negative ground temperatures, i. e., permafrost by definition (Haeberli, 2001). This climatically deter-mined ground thermal condition makes rock glaciers interesting in view of quantitative paleoclimatic recon-structions (Frauenfelder et al., 2001). Moreover, the debris accumulated in rock glaciers reflects centuries and millennia of past frost weathering and rock-fall activity (Barsch, 1977; Olyphant, 1987). In order to decipher the corresponding information, rock glaciers must be dated. The following briefly outlines a strategy which com-bines a variety of applicable methods. It uses a basic concept of permafrost creep, which relates to results from extensive drilling, borehole observation, geo-physical soundings, photogrammetric analyses, perma-frost mapping etc., at Murtèl rock glacier (Figure 1; Haeberli et al., 1998). The initial condition is a talus cone with characteristic vertical sorting of grain sizes. Frost heave and creep of the ice-supersaturated finer material originally deposited on {{the upper part of}} the talus cone then forms a bulge (<b>protalus</b> <b>rampart)</b> which steadily develops into a larger rock glacier. Coarse blocks continue to accumulate at the base of the talus cone and are carried along on the back of the further advancing rock glacier until reaching its front. There, they fall down the oversteepened scree of re-exposed and thawed fine material. These coarse blocks from the rock-glacier surface are subsequently overriden by the creeping ice-super-saturated fine material. In contrast to the latter with ages increasing along flow paths, they form a stiff basal layer in which age decreases towards the rock glacier-front. The age distribution at depth in rock-glacier permafrost, therefore, is likely to contain sharp time inversions...|$|E

Mapping the glacial landforms associated with this period has been undertaken for over a century, but in a non-systematic nature and at specific locations. In this paper, glacial geomorphology associated with the LLS in Britain has been compiled from the published literature into a glacial map and accompanying geographical information system database that is available electronically as supplementary information. A variety of scales have been used to best represent the evidence in the database. Map A is at 1 : 310 000; B, C, D, E, F, J, L, M and O are at 1 : 175 000; K, N, P are at 1 : 100 000 and G, H and I are at 1 : 50, 000.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} mountain ranges in Africa which carry evidence of Quaternary glaciation, though few have glaciers now {{and these are}} rapidly disappearing. The best studied sites are in East Africa and Ethiopia. In East Africa, the three highest mountains, Kilimanjaro, Kenya and the Rwenzori, each have evidence of 3 – 5 major glaciations dating back to an estimated 400, 000 BP, {{one of which is}} dated to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) by radiocarbon or cosmogenic radionucleide (CRN) methods; two other mountains have similar large moraine systems inferred to date to the LGM. In Ethiopia, three mountains have clear evidence of glaciation and on two of them radiocarbon dates give minimum ages which suggest that these are LGM features. In North Africa, the Atlas and other groups of mountains have evidence of glaciation but, {{in the absence of any}} dating, it is unclear whether these sites were glaciated at the LGM. Although geomorphic features resembling moraines and <b>protalus</b> <b>ramparts</b> have been described from the Drakensberg Mountains, South Africa, it is still unclear whether these features indicate glaciation and can be attributed to the LGM. Thus, although circumstances for fieldwork on African mountains are very difficult in many cases, investigations for more than a century provide an extensive picture of Quaternary glaciation. In some cases, there has been an increasingly detailed mapping of field evidence and the first CRN dates were carried out recently, thus improving the global picture considerably. Particularly in East Africa and Ethiopia there is sufficiently reliable field information to make useful estimates of equilibrium line altitude changes at the provisionally identified LGM, but this age needs confirmation by further CRN dating. By making some hypothetical assumptions, inferences can be drawn that indicate a temperature lowering of 5 – 6 °C during the LGM.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} present and past geomorphological processes {{in an area}} of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines near Abetone was achieved in this study, also by elaborating a geomorphological map at a 1 : 10, 000 scale. In this territory, prevalently characterised by arenaceous rock types and, secondarily, by argillaceous and silty ones, the landforms listed below were recognised. - Structural landforms: the most evident are located near the mountain crest, where the slope face corresponds to the stratum surface of the Macigno Sandstones and where there are structural scarps more than 30 m high. - Glacial landforms and deposits: they include cirques, overdeepened hollows, roches moutonnées and moraine ridges. - Cryogenic and nivation landforms and deposits: among these, block fields, nivation hollows, avalanche tracks and cones, <b>protalus</b> <b>ramparts,</b> block streams and gelifluction deposits should be mentioned. - Gravity-induced slope landforms and processes: besides the presence of particularly developed scree slopes, various types of mass movements have been recognised, such as earthflows, falls and topples, translational slides, rotational and roto-translational slides, as well as deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (Dgsd), the latter characterised by a dominant structural control (NW-SE and SW-NE oriented faults). - Landforms, processes and deposits due to running waters: slopes affected by rill wash, colluvial and alluvial fans, related to concentrated running waters, are present together with swampy deposits filling small structural depressions; moreover, two orders of alluvial terraces, badland forms, debris flows and small waterfalls have been surveyed. Since the hydrographic network is in a deepening stage, present alluvial deposits are found only upstream of the numerous wiers that dam the courses of the Pozze and Motte torrents. - Anthropogenetic landforms and deposits: among Man's activities which modify the landscape, the construction of large parking areas and ski pistes should be mentioned; these kinds of activities have produced slope cuts and filling of some small swampy areas. The data acquired allowed geomorphological events to be reconstructed starting from late Upper Pleistocene. In particular, in this sector of the Northern Apennines glacial traces ascribable only to the glaciation known in the Alps as Würm III were found. An attempt to reconstruct a relative chronology of the stadial phases was also carried out, thus identifying forms related to Apennines Stage I, which was characterised by two distinct stages with snow limits respectively of 1, 611 and 1, 663 m a. s. l., and Apennines Stage II, also characterised by two phases with a snow limit ranging between 1, 770 and 1, 836 m. Apennines Stage III did not leave any trace since, according to the previous authors, its permanent snow limit would be found at heights superior to those of the Apennine peaks of this area. In general, the action of the various morphogenetic agents in the evolutive history of these valleys was strictly conditioned by the structural characteristics of the area...|$|R
40|$|Rock glaciers play a {{significant}} role in the alpine debris transport system. For practical and engineering considerations, identifying the internal structure and its relationship to surface characteristics is significant in terms of how a rock glacier settles during periods of melting, and the mode of deformation. A better understanding of these factors is important for engineers, engineering geologists and geomorphologists who must make prudent evaluations of rock glaciers as potential sites for human development and uses. It is equally important for evaluating potential stores for water on other planets such as Mars. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) shows that the internal structure of a lobate rock glacier located in the San Juan Mountains of southwest Colorado consists of continuous to semi-continuous horizontal layers of ice-supersaturated sediments and coarse blocky rockslide debris which likely formed through catastrophic episodes of rockfall from the cirque headwall. Folds in the uppermost layers correspond to the surface expression of ridges and furrows, indicating that compressive stresses originating in the steep accumulation zone are transmitted downslope through the rock glacier. The rock glacier is a composite feature that formed by a process involving the development and overlap of discrete flow lobes that have overridden older glacial moraine and <b>protalus</b> <b>rampart</b> materials. The latter materials have been incorporated into the present flow structure of the rock glacier. The discovery of rock glacier-like features on Mars suggests the presence of flowing, or once-flowing ice-rock mixtures. These landforms, which include lobate debris aprons, concentric crater fill and lineated valley fill, hold significant promise as reservoirs of stored water ice that could be used as fuel sources for human exploration of Mars and provide a frozen record of the climatic history of the planet. To this end, the rock glacier in this study was used as a surrogate for similar Martian landforms. Liquid water, found to be abundant in this rock glacier, occurs within a network of interconnected channels that permeate throughout the landform. In terms of water storage within Martian analogs, consideration must include the possibility that some water ice may be stored in relatively pure form within lenses and vein networks that are supplied by seasonal frost accumulation and/or water influx from below...|$|E
40|$|A pronival (<b>protalus)</b> <b>rampart</b> is a ridge, {{series of}} ridges or ramp of unconsolidated debris formed at the {{downslope}} margin of a perennial or semi-permanent snowbed overlooked by an exposed bedrock cliff. These landforms were traditionally regarded as simple and easily understood since {{the mechanisms of}} debris transport were intuitively considered to include supranival debris transport whereby clasts dislodged from the exposed cliffs above roll, bounce and slide over a snowbed {{under the influence of}} gravity. However, most studies focus on relict examples and few accounts document debris transport, or investigate rampart genesis, at actively-accumulating sites. This has led to circular reasoning and assumptions about rampart morphology, site characteristics, constituent material, genesis and palaeo-environmental significance. A review of existing literature reveals that rampart development was conventionally thought to extend downslope or outward below snowbeds of increasing thickness and extent but not all actively-accumulating ramparts fit this model. Given the over-reliance of research on relict pronival ramparts, this thesis focusses on actively–accumulating examples in order to improve our understanding of their genesis, clarify rampart identification and re-evaluate their palaeo-environmental significance. Rampart genesis is addressed by focussing on active sites on sub-Antarctic Marion Island and at Grunehogna, Western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica as well as all other actively-accumulating ramparts documented across the globe. An alternative model for genesis in the form of retrogressive (upslope) development under fluctuating, and possibly declining, snowbed volumes is presented and relative-age dating techniques are recognised as being particularly useful in aiding with the assessment of rampart genesis. It is also found that ramparts which exhibit a distal slope at repose do not necessarily develop below snowbeds which are increasing in extent and thickness. The different modes of rampart genesis demonstrate that environmental conditions may change during their development and maintenance. The morphology and position of pronival ramparts on a slope are found to closely resemble glacial moraines, rock-slope failures and other discrete talus-derived landforms such as protalus rock glaciers, protalus lobes, avalanche deposits as well as morphologically similar geological structures. As such, their identification can be difficult. In the past, studies have used the characteristics of relict pronival ramparts to develop diagnostic criteria to distinguish ramparts from glacial moraines, rock-slope failures and other talus-derived landforms. These diagnostic criteria are assessed against information gathered from actively-accumulating pronival ramparts and a focus is placed on site characteristics, rampart morphology and sedimentology. Evidence presented in this thesis shows that several of the previously suggested ‘diagnostic criteria’ are invalid and a new set of criteria, with an emphasis on using a multiple-working hypothesis, are proposed to facilitate the identification of relict (as well as actively-accumulating) ramparts in the field. Classification of several landforms as pronival ramparts in southern Africa has been scrutinised in the past. The proposed diagnostic criteria are used to clarify their identification. Based on the criteria presented here, none of the landforms previously recognised as pronival ramparts in southern Africa should be regarded as pronival ramparts. The most morphologically compelling examples in southern Africa are the landforms at Mount Enterprise in the Eastern Cape Province though the site characteristics and the constituent material of the ridge do not suggest a rampart origin. Alternative origins which should be investigated for these landforms range from scree deposits and rock-slope failures to stone-banked lobes. As is the case in southern Africa, relict pronival ramparts are typically used to infer palaeo-environmental conditions. The absence of pronival ramparts at ideal topographic sites in southern Africa questions the persistence of late-lying snow along and on the Lesotho-Drakensberg escarpment during the Late Quaternary. This observation is in contrast with the notion of niche glaciation in preferential locations above 3000 m a. s. l. and demonstrates that, although pronival ramparts can typically only be used to infer more snowy conditions, their presence or absence can, in certain contexts, be useful in palaeo-environmental reconstructions.

40|$|Periglacial landforms on Earth reflect cold-climate {{conditions}} and are intimately related to processes {{due to the}} presence of ground ice and perennially frozen ground, permafrost. The overall objective of this thesis is to investigate the potential of Svalbard as an analogue to Mars cold-climate landforms, and explore past and present processes and surface conditions on Mars by inference from morphological counterparts in Svalbard. Svalbard has unique advantages that make it a very useful study area. Svalbard is easily accessible and offers a periglacial landscape where many different landforms can be encountered in close spatial proximity. These landforms include thermal contraction cracks, slope stripes, rock glaciers, gullies, debris flows, solifluction lobes, <b>protalus</b> <b>ramparts,</b> and pingos, all of which are close morphological analogues to landforms on Mars. An approach of integrated landscape analysis, inferred from landform assemblages in Svalbard, is aimed to explore modeling landscape evolution on Mars. Key datasets include visual remote sensing data of similar resolution (20 – 25 cm/pxl) from Svalbard (High Resolution Stereo Camera–Airborne Extended [HRSC-AX]) and Mars (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment [HiRISE]). Additional data are digital elevation models over both Svalbard and Mars and remote sensing data from Mars, such as Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and Context Camera (CTX) images. Field work was done in combination with remote sensing to acquire ground-truth data. In Svalbard, fluvial and debris-flow processes are evident in the formation of gullies, but the morphological characteristics clearly show that the transport and sedimentation of eroded material are predominated by debris flows. Most investigated gullies on Mars lack clear evidence for debris-flow processes. The Martian gully fan morphology is more consistent with the deposition of small overlapping fans by multiple fluvial flow events. Clear evidence for debris flows on Mars was only found in two new locations, in addition to a few previously published examples. Detailed studies on debris-flow deposits in a young mid-latitude crater on Mars suggest the action of liquid water after Mars’ last ice age (0. 4 – 2. 1 Ma ago). It may represent the most recent morphological indication of water induced mass wasting on Mars. An investigation of small-scale lobes on Mars northern high-latitudes and their morphological counterparts in Svalbard (solifluction lobes) further suggests widespread thawing and the presence of transient liquid water in the recent past on Mars. Finally, different qualitative scenarios of landscape evolution on Mars to better understand the action of periglacial processes on Mars in the recent past are proposed. The results show that field work is a suitable approach in analogue studies and facilitates acquisition of first-hand experience with permafrost environments. Based on the morphological ambiguity of certain landforms, it is concluded that Martian cold-climate landforms should not be investigated in isolation, but as part of a landscape system in a geological and spatial context. Analogous landforms in Svalbard occur in strikingly similar proximity as on Mars, which makes them useful to infer the spatial and chronological evolution of Martian cold-climate surface processes. The analysis of the morphological inventory of analogous landforms and landform systems in Svalbard and on Mars give substantial information to constrain the processes operating on the surface of Mar...|$|R
