5|$|A {{month later}} the villagers {{said they felt}} cheated by the UP {{government}} since permission to build it was still not given; they blamed the Samajwadi <b>Party</b> <b>leaders</b> for unnecessarily punishing her. They said that the <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> should have got them permission to build the mosque at that time, preventing this incident from happening.|$|E
5|$|As his {{four-year}} term as executive neared its end, Agnew {{knew that his}} chances of re-election were slim, given that the county's Democrats had healed their rift. Instead, in 1966 he sought the Republican nomination for governor, and {{with the backing of}} <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> won the April primary by a wide margin.|$|E
5|$|By 1966, <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> viewed Thatcher as a {{potential}} Shadow Cabinet member. Jim Prior suggested her as a member after the Conservatives' 1966 defeat, but party leader Edward Heath and Chief Whip William Whitelaw eventually settled on Mervyn Pike as the Shadow Cabinet's sole woman member.|$|E
50|$|After {{leading his}} party for 20 years, in July 2010 he was succeeded as <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> by Vasyl Tsushko. However, Moroz was again elected as <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> in August 2011. In April 2012 Petro Ustenko was elected as Moroz's {{successor}} as <b>party</b> <b>leader.</b>|$|R

Millard Tawes, Governor of Maryland, and Daniel Brewster, the other U.S. Senator from Maryland. Despite {{the support of the}} <b>party</b> <b>leaders,</b> Goldstein was trounced by Tydings in the primary, losing by nearly a two-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|Labor and the Coalition each won 72 {{seats in}} the 150-seat House of Representatives, four short of the {{requirement}} for majority government, resulting in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election. Labor suffered an 11-seat swing, even though it won a bare majority of the two-party vote. Both major <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> sought to form a minority government.|$|E
5|$|State Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>leaders</b> accused Daniels and the Republicans {{of passing}} {{controversial}} legislation only to enhance Daniels' image {{so he could}} seek the presidency. Daniels, however, denied the charges, saying he would have enacted the same agenda years earlier had the then-Democratic majority permitted him to do so.|$|E
50|$|Following this, she {{was invited}} to get active in the party at {{management}} level, and was appointed deputy <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> in 2009.

5|$|Becoming {{popular among}} the party {{leadership}} during his {{two years as}} commissioner, Minton was encouraged by <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> {{to run for the}} United States Senate in 1934.

With the support of McNutt, Minton won the nomination on the third ballot with 827 votes to Peters' 586.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, it would be impossible for them to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated {{that they were going to}} pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{the delegates}} rarely discuss issues at length at the National Congresses. Most {{substantive}} discussion takes {{place before the}} congress, in the preparation period, {{among a group of}} top <b>party</b> <b>leaders.</b> In between National Congresses, the Central Committee is the highest decision-making institution. The CCDI is responsible for supervising party's internal anti-corruption and ethics system. In between congresses the CCDI is under the authority of the Central Committee.|$|E

50|$|Sant {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} as <b>party</b> <b>leader.</b> He did, however, stand for election for <b>Party</b> <b>leader</b> again which was contested by two other {{candidates for the}} post, John Attard Montalto and Angelo Farrugia. Sant was re-elected <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> with 66% of votes cast by Labour Party delegates and returned to lead the Party.|$|R
5|$|It {{was clear}} that Harrison would not be re-nominated unanimously. Many of Harrison's detractors persisted in pushing for an {{incapacitated}} Blaine, though {{he announced that he}} was not a candidate in February 1892. Some <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> still hoped to draft Blaine into running, and speculation increased when he resigned at the 11th hour as Secretary of State in June. At the convention in Minneapolis, Harrison prevailed on the first ballot, but encountered significant opposition.|$|E
5|$|Local Republican <b>Party</b> <b>leaders</b> invited Garfield {{to enter}} {{politics}} upon {{the death of}} Cyrus Prentiss, the presumptive nominee for the local state senate seat. He was nominated by the party convention on the sixth ballot, and was elected, serving until 1861. Garfield's major effort {{in the state senate}} was a bill providing for Ohio's first geological survey to measure its mineral resources, though it failed.|$|E
5|$|Long was {{promoted}} {{as a potential}} vice presidential candidate by the Massachusetts delegation to the 1900 Republican National Convention, and was a personal favorite of McKinley's for the position. However, <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> objected to him on geographic grounds, and Lodge (with whom Long continued to feud) disingenuously wore a Long banner, even though he supported Roosevelt, who easily won the nomination. The McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won the election, and Long decided to stay on for McKinley's second term.|$|E
50|$|On 28 August 2015 UDAR and Petro Poroshenko Bloc officially {{merged into}} Petro Poroshenko Bloc. UDAR <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> Vitali Klitschko became so the new <b>party</b> <b>leader.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for {{president on the}} fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral. The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> saw the Republicans' choice {{as an opportunity to}} win the White House {{for the first time since}} 1856 if the right candidate could be found.|$|E
5|$|The term {{coronation}} {{is sometimes}} {{used in a}} semi-ironic sense to refer to uncontested party leadership elections, with all potential <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> choosing to back a single candidate or to stay silent, rather than stand in an election {{they are likely to}} lose. This typically happens where there has been a protracted behind-the-scenes attempt to remove the outgoing leader, leading to a significant amount of time to determine who has the most party support before the election proper.|$|E
5|$|Tătărescu {{returned}} to the PNL later in 1944 — after the Soviet Red Army had entered Romania and the country had become an Allied state, political parties were again allowed to register. Nevertheless, Tătărescu was again opposed to the <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> Dinu and Gheorghe I. Brătianu, and split to form his own group in June–July 1945. Dinu Brătianu convened the PNL leadership and formally excluded Tătărescu and his partisans, citing their support for dictatorial regimes.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the death}} of the <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> Arthur Lieutenant, as his deputy, took over his duties. Sources are {{nevertheless}} ambiguous on whether he can strictly be counted as <b>party</b> <b>leader.</b> [...] Some commentators thought that if there had been an election of members, Lieutenant would have been voted in as <b>party</b> <b>leader,</b> but, possibly mindful of this possibility, the Soviet Military Administration did not permit such an election. [...] Lieutenant's position in the party is accordingly sometimes described as that of [...] "acting" [...] <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> between April and October 1948.|$|R
5|$|Agnew {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office in 1956, when he sought to be a Republican candidate for Baltimore County Council. He was turned down by local <b>party</b> <b>leaders,</b> but nevertheless campaigned vigorously for the Republican ticket. The election resulted in an unexpected Republican majority on the council, and in recognition for his party work, Agnew was appointed for a one-year term to the county Zoning Board of Appeals, at a salary of $3,600 per year. This quasi-judicial post provided an important supplement to his legal practice, and Agnew welcomed the prestige connected with the appointment. In April 1958 he was reappointed to the Board for a full three-year term, and became its chairman.|$|E
5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Coldwell {{suffered}} from a heart condition, and undertook a much less ambitious schedule than the major <b>party</b> <b>leaders.</b> The party leader left Ottawa for his riding, Rosetown—Biggar in Saskatchewan, on April 26, and remained there until May 10. He spent three days campaigning in Ontario, then moved west to the major cities of the prairie provinces and British Columbia, before returning to his riding for the final days before the June 10 election. Other CCF leaders took charge of campaigning in Quebec and the Maritimes.|$|E
50|$|The term House Leader {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} a <b>party's</b> parliamentary <b>leader,</b> who leads a political party in the House of Commons or a provincial legislature due to their either not being a <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> or the <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> not having a seat.|$|R
50|$|When the Labor Party is in government, the <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> {{becomes the}} Prime Minister and the deputy leader becomes the Deputy Prime Minister. If a Labor prime {{minister}} resigns or dies in office, the deputy <b>leader</b> becomes <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> and is {{sworn in as}} prime minister on an interim basis until a party successor is elected. This was the case upon the death in office of John Curtin on 5 July 1945. Frank Forde, the deputy <b>party</b> <b>leader,</b> {{was sworn in as}} interim prime minister until Ben Chifley was elected by Caucus as <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> on 13 July. If the leader is out of the country or is on leave, the deputy <b>leader</b> acts as <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> and prime minister, without being sworn into the office.|$|R
