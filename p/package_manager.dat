5|$|FreeBSD version 10.0 {{introduced}} the <b>package</b> <b>manager</b> pkg {{as a replacement}} for the previously used package tools. It is functionally similar to apt and yum in Linux distributions. It allows for installation, upgrading and removal of both ports and packages.

5|$|The Debian project {{released}} the 0.9x versions in 1994 and 1995. During {{this time it}} was sponsored by the Free Software Foundation for one year. Ian Murdock delegated the base system, the core packages of Debian, to Bruce Perens and Murdock focused on the management of the growing project. The first ports to non-IA-32 architectures began in 1995, and Debian 1.1 was released in 1996. By that time and thanks to Ian Jackson, the dpkg <b>package</b> <b>manager</b> was already an essential part of Debian.|$|E

Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side <b>package</b> <b>manager.</b> The popular Twitter Bootstrap web design library was also started at Twitter and is the second most popular repository on GitHub.|$|E

40|$|<b>Package</b> <b>managers</b> are a privileged, {{centralized}} {{mechanism for}} software update and {{are essential to}} the security of modern computers. This work studies the security of ten popular <b>package</b> <b>managers.</b> These <b>package</b> <b>managers</b> use different mechanisms to provide security including signatures embedded in the package, signatures on metadata detached from the packages, or a signature on the root metadata (a file that contains the secure hashes of the package metadata). The security models used by these <b>package</b> <b>managers</b> are compared and contrasted. The threat model used to evaluate security in this paper is an attacker that controls a mirror (a copy of the main repository’s contents for a distribution).

25|$|Installing, {{updating}} {{and removing}} software in Linux is typically done {{through the use}} of package managers such as the Synaptic <b>Package</b> <b>Manager,</b> PackageKit, and Yum Extender. While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands of packages, not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.|$|E
