5|$|Commissioned as {{a second}} {{lieutenant}} in the Infantry Branch, Schwarzkopf spent October 1956 to March 1957 at United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he earned his <b>Parachutist</b> Badge. His first assignment was as platoon leader, later executive officer, of E Company, 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1958. In July 1959, Schwarzkopf was assigned his first overseas assignment; as a staff officer alternating with duties as a platoon leader, liaison officer, and reconnaissance platoon leader with the 6th Infantry Division in West Germany. In July 1960, Schwarzkopf was assigned as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Charles Johnson, who commanded the Berlin Brigade in West Berlin.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, and with the dissolution of her third marriage, Kalep began a new business venture in the American toy market. She designed a doll named Patsie Parachute which, when thrown into the air, would fall down slowly as a <b>parachutist</b> would. The dolls were produced in a New York factory where Kalep herself was forced to work to sustain the business. Her health deteriorated, however, and her profits from the business were spent almost entirely on medical costs; {{she was forced to}} close the factory in 1946. She had recovered by 1950 and made a living by selling patents for toy designs to larger businesses. One of her successful designs was Scribbles Dolls—toy dolls with blank faces that could be individually decorated by children—which was inspired by the 50,000 doll heads she had left over from the closure of the Patsie Parachute factory.|$|E
5|$|Schwarzkopf was {{promoted}} to captain in July 1961 and reassigned for Advanced Infantry School at Fort Benning for eight months. He also earned his Master <b>Parachutist</b> Badge in that time. In June 1962, Schwarzkopf enrolled at the University of Southern California in a Master of Science in Engineering course studying missile mechanics. He graduated in June 1964, having earned a Master of Science in mechanical and aerospace engineering. He then returned to West Point {{to serve as an}} instructor in the Department of Mechanics. He was originally intended to teach at the Military Academy for three years, but after his first year he volunteered for service in South Vietnam because he thought that career advancement could be most quickly earned in combat. West Point approved his request in early 1965 with the stipulation that he return and teach the remaining two years after his tour.|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{injuries}} and symptoms were studied in 109 ex-military <b>parachutists</b> and 112 sport (free fall) <b>parachutists</b> {{by means of}} postal questionnaires. 46 ex-military <b>parachutists</b> aged 50 years or over had a radiological examination of the lumbar spine and 58 sport <b>parachutists</b> had a radiological examination of the cervical spine {{as part of the}} survey. A history of back pain was significantly (P< 0. 01) associated with body weight in sport <b>parachutists</b> but not with the number of descents or with the subject's age. In the older ex-military group neither age, weight, nor the number of descents was significantly associated with backache...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{features of the}} excretion of catecholamines in <b>parachutists</b> at various stages of preparation for and after performing the jump have been studied. It was revealed that the beginners engaged in parachuting, i. e. <b>parachutists</b> inexperienced in jumps react with a significant release of epinephrine and cortisol before boarding during the jump. At the same time, the excretion of norepinephrine in these athletes under the same conditions does not change significantly {{in comparison with the}} initial data. Mass class <b>parachutists,</b> i. e. athletes having a certain experience in jumping during preparation for and in the process of the jump react with a significant release of epinephrine, cortisol and norepinephrine. At the same time, these athletes had significantly higher level of excreted norepinephrine than adrenaline and cortisol. Highly skilled <b>parachutists</b> (masters of sports and masters of sports of the international class) react with a significant release of only norepinephrine during the preparation for and performance of the jump. Consequently, the excretion of catecholamines in sportsmen regularly engaged in parachuting depends on the level of athletes' qualification. The higher the level of training of <b>parachutists</b> is, the less changes occur in the values of excretion of catecholamines.

40|$|SUMMARY 112 {{actively}} parachuting sport (free fall) <b>parachutists</b> {{with more}} than 200 descents each and 109 veteran military <b>parachutists</b> no longer active returned a postal questionnaire about their parachuting activities, injuries, and current and past musculoskeletal symptoms. A high frequency of fractures and injuries was reported by each group, both in relation to parachuting and to other activities. 58 sport <b>parachutists</b> aged 23 to 57 years (mean 33 - 3 years) had weight-bearing antero-posterior and lateral radiographs taken of each knee. These showed a prevalence of radiological osteoarthrosis of 10 - 4 % which was mild in degree {{in all but one}} knee in one subject. 46 ex-military <b>parachutists</b> aged 50 to 70 years (mean 5 2 years) had weight-bearing anteroposterior radiographs taken of both knees and showed a prevalence of radiological osteroarthrosis of 41 - 3 %. Moderate and severe changes were found in 10 - 9 %. In both groups of <b>parachutists</b> six of the eight knee joints showing either moderate or severe radiological osteroathrosis had been subjected to a previous meniscectomy. Forty ex-military <b>parachutists</b> had anteroposterior radiographs of the ankles (talotibial articula-tion) and showed a prevalence of osteoarthrosis of 17 - 5 %, with the majority showing mild changes. There was a poor correlation between radiological osteoarthrosis, ankle symptoms, and previou...|$|R
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States after the war, Juskalian had an appointment with the regular army where he was ultimately promoted to lieutenant colonel. He reported to the Pentagon for duty in the Office of the Secretary of the Army Chief of Staff from 1945–1948.

His responsibilities included supporting the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combined Chiefs of Staff of the British and Americans and preparing briefs for Eisenhower. After his tour of duty at the Pentagon, he attended the Army's Command and General Staff College's regular ten-month course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 1948 to 1949. His next assignment was with the staff and faculty of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he remained from 1949 until the summer of 1952. While at the school, he took airborne training and became a qualified <b>parachutist.</b>|$|E
