40|$|In the {{hippocampus}} in vivo, both synaptic plasticity and network activity are closely interdependent. We {{have found that}} immediately after an attempt to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), changes in theta (5 – 10 [*]Hz) and gamma (30 – 100 [*]Hz) activity correlate tightly with the occurrence of LTP, suggesting that tetanisation-driven activation of sensory inputs synchronises the activity of granule cells and interneurons, and thus, facilitates the encoding of acquired stimuli. This results in increase of theta and gamma power, and elevates the probability that afferent stimuli both coincide with the peak of theta cycle and reach their post-synaptic target within the gamma time-window (of 10 – 30 [*]ms). Both these mechanisms can effectively shift the direction, of tetanisation-induced changes in synaptic weight, towards potentiation and induction of LTP.

40|$|Loss-of-function {{mutations}} in the lipoxygenase (LOX) genes ALOX 12 B and ALOXE 3 are {{the second most}} common cause of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis. The encoded proteins, 12 R-LOX and epidermal LOX- 3 (eLOX- 3), act in sequence to convert fatty acid substrates via R-hydroperoxides to specific epoxyalcohol derivatives and have been proposed to operate in the same metabolic pathway during epidermal barrier formation. Here, we show that eLOX- 3 deficiency in mice results in early postnatal death, associated with similar but somewhat less severe barrier defects and morphological changes than reported earlier for the 12 R-LOX-knockout mice. Skin lipid analysis demonstrated that the severity of barrier failure is related to the loss of covalently bound ceramides in both 12 R-LOX- and eLOX- 3 -null mice, confirming a proposed functional linkage of the LOX pathway to ceramide <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>formation</b> of the corneocyte lipid envelope. Furthermore, analysis of free oxygenated fatty acid metabolites revealed strongly reduced levels of hepoxilin metabolites in eLOX- 3 -deficient epidermis, indicating an additional function of eLOX- 3 in mammalian skin as a hepoxilin synthase linked to the 12 S-LOX pathway...|$|E

40|$|B cell {{receptor}} (BCR) -mediated antigen processing is a mechanism that allows class II–restricted presentation of specific antigen by B cells at relatively low antigen concentrations. Although BCR-mediated antigen processing and class II peptide loading may occur within {{one or more}} endocytic compartments, the functions of these compartments and their relationships to endosomes and lysosomes remain uncertain. In murine B cells, at least one population of class II– containing endocytic vesicles (i. e., CIIV) has been identified and demonstrated to be distinct both physically and functionally from endosomes and lysosomes. We now demonstrate the delivery of BCR-internalized antigen to CIIV within the time frame during which BCR-mediated antigen <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>formation</b> of peptide–class II complexes occurs. Only {{a fraction of the}} BCR-internalized antigen was delivered to CIIV, with the majority of internalized antigen being delivered to lysosomes that are largely class II negative. The extensive colocalization of BCR-internalized antigen and newly synthesized class II molecules in CIIV suggests that CIIV may represent a specialized subcellular compartment for BCR-mediated antigen processing. Additionally, we have identified a putative CIIV-marker protein, immunologically related to the Ig � subunit of the BCR, which further illustrates the unique nature of these endocytic vesicles...|$|E
40|$|The mRNA is co-transcriptionally {{bound by}} a number of RNA-binding {{proteins}} (RBPs) that contribute to its <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>formation</b> of an exportcompetent messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP). In the last few years, increasing evidence suggests that RBPs {{play a key role in}} preventing transcription- associated genome instability. Part of this instability is mediated by the accumulation of co-transcriptional R loops, which may impair replication fork (RF) progression due to collisions between transcription and replication machineries. In addition, some RBPs have been implicated in DNA repair and/or the DNA damage response (DDR). Recently, the Npl 3 protein, one of the most abundant heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) in yeast, has been shown to prevent transcription-associated genome instability and accumulation of RF obstacles, partially associated with R-loop formation. Interestingly, Npl 3 seems to have additional functions in DNA repair, and npl 3 Δ mutants are highly sensitive to genotoxic agents, such as the antitumor drug trabectedin. Here we discuss the role of Npl 3 in particular, and RBPs in general, in the connection of transcription with replication and genome instability, and its effect on the DDR. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

40|$|Proinsulin C-peptide, {{released}} in equimolar amounts with insulin by pancreatic β cells, since its discovery in 1967 has been {{thought to be}} devoid of biological functions apart from correct insulin <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>formation</b> of disulfide bonds between A and B chains. However, {{in the last two}} decades research has brought a substantial amount of data indicating a crucial role of C-peptide in regulating various processes in different types of cells and organs. C-peptide acts presumably via either G-protein-coupled receptor or directly inside the cell, after being internalized. However, a receptor binding this peptide has not been identified yet. This peptide ameliorates pathological changes induced by type 1 diabetes mellitus, including glomerular hyperfiltration, vessel endothelium inflammation and neuron demyelinization. In diabetic patients and diabetic animal models, C-peptide substitution in physiological doses improves the functional and structural properties of peripheral neurons and protects against hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis, promoting neuronal development, regeneration and cell survival. Moreover, it affects glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles. In vitro C-peptide promotes disaggregation of insulin oligomers, thus enhancing its bioavailability and effects on metabolism. There are controversies concerning the biological action of C-peptide, particularly with respect to its effect on Na /K -ATPase activity. Surprisingly, the excess of circulating peptide associated with diabetes type 2 contributes to atherosclerosis development. In view of these observations, long-term, large-scale clinical investigations using C-peptide physiological doses need to be conducted in order to determine safety and health outcomes of long-term administration of C-peptide to diabetic patients...|$|E

40|$|Intrusive {{memories}} and associated symptoms of {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) represent a significant public health problem, often leading to persistent physical and psychological difficulties experienced by victims long after the traumatic event, contributing to healthcare costs and loss of productivity. Research examining etiological {{factors that contribute to}} PTSD is needed in order to expand basic knowledge and to inform the development of prevention and intervention strategies. Although acute alcohol intoxication has the potential to impact established risk factors for the development of intrusive memories (e. g., via stress response, cognitive processing), and trauma—particularly sexual assault—often occurs under the influence of alcohol, the influence of peritraumatic (i. e., at the time of assault) alcohol intoxication on post-assault trauma symptoms is not well understood. To address this issue, the current study utilized an experimental design, including lab-based alcohol administration (high dose of. 72 g/kg, low dose of. 36 g/kg, and a placebo beverage), a well-accepted analog trauma exposure paradigm (a film with distressing or “traumatic” content), and ecological momentary assessment of intrusive memories. Results from 98 community women (ages 21 to 30, without a personal history of victimization) revealed peritraumatic intoxication did impact the occurrence of intrusive memories. Specifically, a marginally significant indirect effect showed that alcohol myopia disrupted cognitive <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>formation</b> of trauma memories, resulting in increased intrusive memories at high levels of intoxication. At the same time, those who consumed high or low doses of alcohol displayed a dampened stress response, which reduced intrusive memories. Findings highlight the influence of peritraumatic cognitive impairment and stress response on the development of intrusive memories. Though alcohol influenced these risk factors simultaneously and in opposite directions, overall, participants in the high dose condition reported more intrusive memories than those in the placebo and low dose conditions. These findings reflect the importance of prevention and intervention programs aimed at reducing alcohol-involved victimization. ...|$|E
40|$|The capsid of {{infectious}} bursal disease virus (IBDV), with a size of 60 - 65 nm, is formed by an initial processing of polyprotein (pVP 2 -VP 4 -VP 3) by VP 4, subsequent assemblage of pVP 2 and VP 3, and the maturation of VP 2. In Sf 9 cells, the processing of polyprotein expressed was restrained in the stage of VP 2 maturation, leading to a limited production of capsid, i. e., IBDV-like particles (VLPs). In the present study, another insect cell line, High-Five (Hi- 5) cells, was demonstrated to efficiently produce VLPs. Meanwhile, in this system, polyprotein was processed to pVP 2 and VP 3 protein and pVP 2 was further processed to the matured form of VP 2. Consequently, Hi- 5 cells are better in terms of polyprotein <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>formation</b> of VLPs than Sf 9. In addition to the processing of pVP 2, VP 3 was also degraded. With insufficient intact VP 3 protein present {{for the formation of}} VLPs, the excessive VP 2 form subviral particles (SVPs) with a size of about 25 nm. The ratio of VLPs to SVPs is dependent on the multiplicity of infections (MOIs) used, and an optimal MOI is found for the production of both particles. VLPs were separated from SVPs with a combination of ultracentrifugation and gel-filtration chromatography, and a large number of purified particles of both were obtained. In conclusion, the insect cell lines and MOIs were optimized for the production of VLPs, and pure VLPs with morphology {{similar to that of the}} wild-type viruses can be effectively prepared. The efficient production and purification of VLPs benefits not only the development of an antiviral vaccine against IBDV but also the understanding of the structure of this avian virus that is economically important...|$|E

40|$|A new way {{to perform}} space {{missions}} utilizes the concept of clusters of satellites that cooperate to perform the function of a larger, single satellite. Each smaller satellite communicates with the others and shares the processing, communications, and payload or mission functions. The required functionality is thus spread across the satellites in the cluster, the aggregate forming a 2 ̆ 2 virtual satellite 2 ̆ 2. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) initiated the TechSat 21 program to explore the basic technologies required to enable such distributed satellite systems. For this purpose, Space Based Radar (SBR) was selected as a reference mission to help identify technology requirements and to allow an easy comparison to a conventional approach. A summary of the basic mission and the performance requirements is provided. The satellite cluster approach to space missions requires science and technology advances in several key areas. Each of these challenges is described in some detail, with specific stressing requirements driven by the SBR reference mission. These TechSat 21 research and technology areas are being studied in a coordinated effort between several directorates within AFRL and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. In support of TechSat 21, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency are jointly funding 10 universities with grants of 50 k/year over two years to design and assemble 10 – 12 nanosatellites (approx 10 kg each) for launch in November 2001. The universities are conducting creative low-cost space experiments to explore the military usefulness of nanosatellites {{in such areas as}} formation flying, enhanced communications, miniaturized sensors and thrusters, and attitude control.

40|$|Abstract Background The p 51 subunit of the HIV- 1 reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) p 66 /p 51 heterodimer arises from proteolytic cleavage of the RT p 66 subunit C-terminal ribonuclease H (RNH) domain during virus maturation. Our previous work showed that mutations in the RT p 51 ↓RNH cleavage site resulted in virus with defects in proteolytic processing of RT and significantly attenuated infectivity. In some cases, virus fitness was restored after repeated passage of mutant viruses, due to reversion of the mutated sequences to wild-type. However, in one case, the recovered virus retained the mutated p 51 ↓RNH cleavage site but also developed an additional mutation, T 477 A, distal to the cleavage site. In {{this study we}} have characterized in detail {{the impact of the}} T 477 A mutation on intravirion processing of RT. Results While the T 477 A mutation arose during serial passage only with the F 440 V mutant background, introduction of this substitution into a variety of RT p 51 ↓RNH cleavage site lethal mutant backgrounds was able to restore substantial infectivity and normal RT processing to these mutants. T 477 A had no phenotypic effect on wild-type HIV- 1. We also evaluated the impact of T 477 A on the kinetics of intravirion Gag-Pol polyprotein processing of p 51 ↓RNH cleavage site mutants using the protease inhibitor ritonavir. Early processing intermediates accumulated in p 51 ↓RNH cleavage site mutant viruses, whereas introduction of T 477 A promoted the completion of <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>formation</b> of the fully processed RT p 66 /p 51 heterodimer. Conclusions This work highlights the extraordinary plasticity of HIV- 1 in adapting to seemingly lethal mutations that prevent RT heterodimer formation during virion polyprotein maturation. The ability of T 477 A to restore RT heterodimer formation and thus intravirion stability of the enzyme may arise from increased conformation flexibility in the RT p 51 ↓RNH cleavage site region, due to loss of a hydrogen bond associated with the normal threonine residue, thereby enabling proteolytic cleavage near the normal RT p 51 ↓RNH cleavage site. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Semiconductor Industry Association 2 ̆ 7 s (SIA) current National Technological Roadmap {{calls for}} the {{development}} of a suitable dielectric material for use in gate oxide for the 0. 18 |micrometers generation of chips and beyond. Some of the key challenges identified are resistance to oxide trapped charge generation from higher levels of tunneling currents and/or plasma <b>processing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>formation</b> of an effective barrier to dopant penetration during the gate processing. One promising material to meet these challenges is nitrided thermal oxide. Development of a growth process that yields high quality, lOnm thick, thermally grown Si 02 films at RJT for use as a gate dielectric is described. Thin oxides (8 nm - 20 nm) were grown by thermal oxidation followed by inert anneals in Ar and N 2. Nitrided oxides were created by implanting N 2 (dose range: 5 el 3 - lei 5 /cm 2) into the substrate prior to gate oxidation. Test equipment was setup to study Fowler Nordheim (FN) tunneling and dielectric breakdown. Test structures consisted of conventional and novel MOS capacitor structures with aluminum and poly-silicon gate electrodes. Scaling RJT 2 ̆ 7 s existing, 20 nm oxidation process to lOnm resulted in degradation of dielectric strength from 3 ̆e lOMV/cm to 6 - 7 MV/cm for Al-gate MOS capacitors. Replacing the Al gate material with poly-silicon restored the dielectric strength to lOMV/cm. Performing an N 2 implant through a screening oxide, prior to gate oxidation, was investigated as a means of obtaining a nitrided thermal oxide. For certain doses (5 el 3 - 5 el 4 /cm 2), Al-gate MOS capacitors exhibited an improved dielectric strength as the mean value increased from 6 - 7 MV/cm to 9 MV/cm. Poly-Si gate MOS capacitors showed a similar improvement for the nitrided oxides, exhibiting mean dielectric strength values in the 10 - 12 MV/cm range. Fowler- Nordheim (FN) tunnel current measurements showed that the nitrided films exhibit lower leakage levels and less charge trapping than their thermal Si 02 counterparts. Results indicate that a 12 nm nitrided oxide, for a certain dose (5 el 4 /cm 2), exhibited equivalent electrical performance to a 20 nm thermally grown Si 02 oxide. In conclusion, a process was developed for yielding reliable thin gate oxides (10 nm) in a university fab...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims at {{exploring}} the shoppers’ evaluation of service quality {{and its impact}} on shopping centre management. For shopping centre management team, understanding their customers’ perceptions of the centre’s service quality is an important issue as shoppers’ evaluations and perceptions is believed to be highly related to their patronage behaviors and purchase intention. Through a case study of a shopping centre, this research will try to offer some insights on the relationships between evaluations of service quality and the shoppers’ patronage behaviors which may derive some implications for contemporary shopping centre management. Literatures tell us that people elicit behavior after cognitive <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>formation</b> of emotions. Adopting similar concept, marketing scholars found that customer behaviors are affected by their evaluations of service quality and satisfaction level through their perceptions on product or service attributes in cognitive processing. This study will follow the direction with reference to this model of behavior formation. In the case study, personal interviews had been conducted with selected shoppers at a shopping centre. They were asked to rate the performance of 36 sub-attributes of the shopping centre under 5 shopping centre attributes, namely “accessibility”, “merchandise”, “retail environment & design”, “services of centre’s staff” and “promotions”. They were also asked about their patronage behaviors at the shopping centre such as frequency of visits, duration of visits, amount of spending etc. It was found that the shoppers generally had positive evaluations on the centre’s performance on the 5 shopping centre attributes as a whole, especially had high evaluations on “accessibility”, “merchandise” and “services of centre’s staff”. Importance-performance analysis (IPA) was conducted to evaluate the service quality of 36 sub-attributes by comparing shoppers’ perceived actual performance and the importance level. It was found that only 8 sub-attributes, such as “access by public transportation”, “variety of stores” and “quality of stores” were found with high perceived service quality with high perceived actual performance and high importance level to the shoppers compared with other sub-attributes. These sub-attributes with high perceived service quality were tested with occurrence tendency of patronage behaviors in the correlation analysis. It was found that high perceived service quality on merchandises, facility management and organization of promotion activities to certain extend had influence on manipulating patronage behaviors. However, some results showed that sub-attributes with high perceived service quality showed minimal or even no correlation on any measure patronage behavior parameters. With reference to the model of purchase behavior regarding perceptions of service quality, the study may reveal that many possible antecedents of formation of shopping centre patronage behaviors may be still unreached in the contemporary studies. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} an initial attempt at {{studying}} evolution as a multilevel process, in which interactions of different space/time scales mutually determine the evolutionary potential. Side effects of processes on one scale may form a substrate for evolution at another scale. We study the generation and maintenance of diversity in a multilevel replicator system {{and focus on the}} role of local information <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> pattern <b>formation.</b> We show how the conflicting requirements of the generation and maintenance of diversity are met in different ways in completely mixed (stirred) and poorly mixed (diffusive) systems. In the former diversity is maintained primarily by non-invadability, and operates at the lowest level; in the latter case diversity is maintained by locally contained invasions which are subsequently eliminated by higher level processes. 1...|$|R

SLM of Waspaloy® powder was performed using a high power pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The laser parameters pulse energy (J), pulse width (ms), repetition rate (Hz) and scan speed (mm/min) were varied. Process parameter optimization was achieved using factorial analysis {{to investigate the}} relationship between specific <b>processing</b> parameters <b>and</b> the <b>formation</b> of Waspaloy® specimens.

40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{production}} continuity and optimal {{utilization of the}} Shipbuilding enterprises during multi-period, a multi-object dynamic mixed integer programming model of virtual cell is proposed to complete the resource selection and batch assignment of routes by minimizing the processing cost, transportation cost, scheduling factors and load balance. The factors including constraints on the processing capacity equipment redundancy and the influences of batch <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> cellular <b>formation</b> on scheduling are considered in the model design. This paper proposed improved multi-object genetic algorithm to obtain optimal pareto solution set and introduced TOPSIS {{to determine the best}} resource group. The model and algorithm presented is applied in a job shop of pipe in a shipyard. The robust resource selection strategy during multi-period can greatly balance the working load of all shops, and achieve more superior structure of virtual cell formation...|$|R
40|$|Retailers with {{physical}} stores that {{also have an}} online presence (one form of multi-channel retailers) have unique challenges. Consumers bringing their prior attitudes towards the retailer to the site is one such challenge. However, researchers studying website issues focus only on consumers' evaluations of website characteristics, failing to account for how prior attitudes towards the firm and congruity of the website with the retailer's physical store image might affect information <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> attitude <b>formation.</b> The current study draws on categorization theory, by proposing that increases in the congruity between the retailer's known offline and their online presence should decrease the emphasis new visitors place on website characteristics (a piecemeal process) and increase the influence of their prior attitudes towards the firm (an attitude transfer process). Results support predictions and provide guidance for multi-channel retailers. Multi-channel retailing Image congruity Piecemeal process Attitudinal transfer...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{importance}} attached to memory in everyday life, {{the inability to}} recall items on demand can be problematic. An apparently ironic phenomenon has been identified, however, which suggests {{that in addition to}} retrieving desired memories, the act of remembering inhibits or suppresses related memories. We show here that a competitive model, designed to investigate the development of the cortical visual system, provides an explanation for the suppression of some memories as a consequence of remembering others. We confirm a number of specific predictions based on our model as to when retrieval-induced forgetting effects should or should not occur. The model suggests that the mechanisms by which memories are formed and adapted may also underlie retrieval-induced forgetting effects. In addition to having important practical implications, the model provides a theoretical base for the transfer of theories and ideas between two separate levels (cortical <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> memory <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> adaptation) of understanding brain function...|$|R
