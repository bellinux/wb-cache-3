5|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{harassment}} of coyotes practiced by rural people, urban coyotes are losing their fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding coyotes. In such situations, some coyotes have begun to act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting <b>people</b> <b>walking</b> their dogs, and stalking small children. Non-rabid coyotes in these areas sometimes target small children, mostly under the age of 10, though some adults have been bitten.|$|E

By morning, 61 police officers and 100 rioters and gay residents of the Castro had been hospitalized. City Hall, police cruisers, and the Elephant Walk Bar suffered damages in excess of $1,000,000.|$|E

5|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot {{for the single}} by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, respectively. Hernandez's version opens with busy streets and the dawn of Los Angeles, California. Hamasaki begins singing the song {{on top of a}} skyscraper, whilst several intercut scenes of <b>people</b> <b>walking</b> around Los Angeles during a time lapse are shown. She is then seen {{painting}} a picture of an unidentified man, who raps Verbal's part. It then shows intercut scenes of traffic, a carosuel and couple standing near a bridge. Several parts of these scenes are revised throughout the entire video, which ends with Hamasaki again on top of the skyscraper. For Yokoyama's video, only shots featuring Verbal were only filmed, alongside scenes of him walking through a city in Japan, and residing in a neon-lit club. Parts of Hernandez's version, with the scenes of Hamasaki painting a man and scenes of Los Angeles city and public, were removed in order to merge the first video and Verbal's appearance together. This version premiered one week before the album's release on July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{had four}} main objectives: 1) to examine older <b>people's</b> <b>walking</b> {{experiences}} {{in the context of}} their daily lives; 2) to investigate how key informants, at both neighbourhood and municipal levels, describe the socio-political process of creating walkable neighbourhoods; 3) to examine how neighbourhood SES and urban form may inter-relate to affect older <b>people's</b> <b>walking</b> experiences and; 4) to examine differences among neighbourhood key informant perspectives on the socio-political processes that shape the walkability of neighbourhood environments. Objectives were addressed using a comparative embedded case study design. Four neighbourhoods were purposefully selected to vary on SES and urban form. The study was conducted in three phases. During phase one, interviews and focus groups were conducted with older people in order to describe their walking {{experiences in the}}se four neighbourhoods. In the second phase, these results provided a platform for interviewing key informants about the municipal and neighbourhood-level socio-political processes of creating walkable neighbourhoods. In the third phase, qualitative data from phases one and two, in combination with publicly available quantitative indicators were compared across neighbourhoods using a matrix strategy consisting of SES and urban form axes. Analysis of phase one qualitative data revealed four themes common to older <b>people's</b> <b>walking</b> experiences: 1) multidimensional personal meanings; 2) navigating hostile walking environments; 3) experiencing ambiguity; and 4) getting around. Five dimensions of the socio-political process of creating walkable neighbourhoods were identified in phase two: 1) political context; 2) access channels; 3) resources; 4) actors and; 5) opportunities. These dimensions and their inter-relationships elucidated insights on how neighbourhoods and municipalities interact on walkability issues. Examining the inter-relationship of neighbourhood SES and urban form characteristics on older <b>people's</b> <b>walking</b> experiences in phase three indicated that urban form differences were accentuated positively in higher SES neighbourhoods and negatively in lower SES neighbourhoods. Key informant descriptions of the socio-political processes indicated that differences in these processes can affect neighbourhood capacity to influence decisions at a municipal level. Together, both sets of findings along with quantitative indicator comparisons provided evidence of inequitable walking environments. This research provides new insights on older <b>people's</b> <b>walking</b> experiences by revealing multi-layered meanings affected by intersecting dimensions of the physical and social environment. The experiences are further understood within a socio-ecologic context. An integration of the study data is presented in a theoretical model, which conceptualizes how dynamic community socio-political structures and processes at the individual, neighbourhood and municipal levels inter-relate to affect the production of neighbourhood walkability. The model also depicts four sets of influences operating at various stages in the cycle of local production, which create different conditions for neighbourhood action and which can lead to inequitable walking conditions. This study signals the need for a fundamental shift in thinking about walkability. It calls upon us to re-examine the notion of walkability as an array of historically-determined built environment characteristics and to consider how walkability is shaped by dynamic socio-political processes that can be challenged and influenced. This research highlights the need for municipal policies that promote walking as a legitimate form of transportation and that guarantee equitable access for older people. Municipal governments must monitor and address differences in walkability that exist between socially advantaged and disadvantaged neighbourhoods, ensuring that walking improvements in one neighbourhood do not exacerbate walking problems in another. These approaches may help to support independent living, particularly among older people who rely on walking for transportation. Future population health interventions must aim to reduce inequitable walking conditions among socially advantaged and disadvantaged groups, and must do so in a way that harnesses the dynamic properties of municipal systems.

40|$|Abstract. The {{movement}} {{processes of}} the older <b>people</b> during <b>walking</b> on level ground were captured by the high-speed video camera {{with the speed of}} 500 frames per second. The gait parameters of the older <b>people</b> during <b>walking</b> on level ground were obtained by the quantitative analysis of the successive photographs captured by the high-speed video camera. Kinematics features of the older <b>people</b> during <b>walking</b> on level ground were discussed. Along with the growth of the age, step velocity, step frequency and step length were reduced, and gait cycle was rising. According to the morphology of the older <b>people</b> during <b>walking</b> on level ground, a mechanical model was put forward to aid the design of the exoskeleton walking robot. The couple walking characteristics between the older wearer and the exoskeleton walking robot was studied. In the single support phase of the exoskeleton walking robot, the change of the hip joint was gradually decreased to provide the driving force for the stable walk, the change of the knee joint was increased and following decreased and then increased to forward the older people's body center of gravity, and the change of the ankle joint was gradually increased to reduce the impact force of the ground. The results would provide the basic theory to bionic references for improving the reasonable properties of the exoskeleton walking robot. This work would provide certain theoretical and practical base in developing the exoskeleton walking robot on bionic structural design...|$|R
