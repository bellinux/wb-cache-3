50|$|Universalâ€™s Autonomy is {{motion control}} {{software}} that automates robot programming for moving a robot {{at high speed}} {{using a variety of}} sensor inputs. It provides real-time autonomous reaction for robots as well as motion planning and collision avoidance. Autonomy couples Spatial Vision Robotics with robot kinematics to allow a robot to react dynamically to changes in object positioning. For example, the software will allow a <b>paint-spraying</b> <b>robot</b> to maintain a consistent distance from an assembly line part swaying on a moving cable, which reduces over-spray.|$|E
