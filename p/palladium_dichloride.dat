Allergic reactions to palladium are rarely diagnosed with patch testing, even when positive results would be expected.

Objective: The aim {{of the study was}} to test whether or not mono-nuclear sodium tetrachloropalladate (Na- 2 [PdCl 4]) in petrolatum is a better test salt for diagnosing palladium allergy. Positive reactions to the investigated test salt are compared not only with PdCl 2 (aq.), but also to NiSO 4 (aq.) and NiSO 4 (pet.). Patients/Methods: Concentration series of Na- 2 [PdCl 4] were carried out. 164 consecutive patients were patch tested. Results: 3 % of Na- 2 [PdCl 4]((pet.)) was found to be the highest non-irritative concentration.

40|$|Abstract — Fundamental {{studies on}} reductive {{elimination}} reactions of organonickel and palladium complexes {{of the types}} MR 2 L 2 and M(COR) (OAr) L 2 revealed the parallel trend between the reductive eliminations involving the C—C and C—O bond formation. The reaction of organonickel complexes proceeds mainly via associative mechanism whereas reductive eliminations from many square planar palladium complexes take dissociative pathways. Based on the fundamental studies on reactions of organopalladium complexes with carbon monoxide a new reaction to introduce two CO groups into an organic compound has been developed. Aryl halides and alkenyl halides are catalytically converted into a—keto amides promoted by tertiary phosphine— coordinated palladium complexes in the reaction with CO and basic secondary anines. o—Keto amides produced in the reaction {{can be used as}} precursors for syntheses of useful organic compounds including ct—amino acids, ct—hydroxy acids, indole and quinoline derivatives. Mechanism for production of Gt—keto amides from aryl halides, CO and secondary amines has been established to comprise several steps, i. e., oxidative addition of aryl halide to Pd(O) species, CO insertion into the Ar—Pd bond, CO coordination to palladium, and nucleophilic attack of amine on the coordinated CO ligand to give carbamoyl—aroyl species which reductively eliminates ct—keto amides. Steric bulkiness of the secondary amines in attacking on the CO ligand was found to be decisive in determining the selectivity for ct—keto amide formation.

The rate of {{oxidation}} and {{the catalyst}} {{stability in the}} oxidation of 1 -alkenes with O 2 using [PdCl(NO 2) (MeCN) 2] as catalyst is considerably improved {{by the use of}} amides as ligands or solvents. Transition metal catalyzed oxidation of olefins with molecular oxygen has attracted considerable attention from a synthetic, mechanistic, and industrial point of view 1. Environmental constraints with commonly used oxidants and the formation of stoichiometric amounts of co-products are important incentives to develop selective nonradical oxidations with O 2. Various transition-metal dioxygen complexes and studies of oxygen activation have recently been described. 2, 3. The Wacker process, based on <b>palladium</b> <b>dichloride</b> is extremely useful for the conversion of vinyl-substituted compounds into methylketones although there are severe limitations for higher α-olefins due to olefin isomerization or low catalyst stability 1, 4. It has been demonstrated that catalysts based on palladium (II) nitro complexes in some cases offer an excellent alternative to the Wacker oxidation 5. We reported that [PdCl(NO 2) (MeCN) 2], modified with CuCl 2 as co-catalyst and t-BuOH or i-PrOH as ligand or solvent, is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of α-olefins to aldehydes (60 - 70 % selectivity) or methylketones (> 90 % selectivity) using molecular oxygen 6. The proposed catalytic cycle for the oxidation of 1 -alkenes to aldehydes, which involves a palladium-nitro-nitrosyl redox couple, 7, 8 is shown in scheme I. Scheme I.

40|$|A {{range of}} {{different}} heterogeneous catalysts for the isomerisation of ortho-xylene {{have been prepared}} and evaluated. These included commercially-available samples, supported metal catalysts and zirconia-based catalysts. The greatest activity was seen for the former, which was found also to be active {{for a number of}} related reactions. Zirconia-based catalysts, in particular sulphated zirconia, gave significant activity. It was possible to prepare a catalyst to give 9. 5 % conversion of ortho-xylene per gram of catalyst with good selectivity to the meta isomer. The catalyst was prepared in two ways, either by the action of ammonium sulphate on "zirconium hydroxide", a hydrated zirconia precursor, or by precipitation from a sulphuric acid-containing solution of zirconium (IV) propoxide. The factors in the synthesis procedure which affect the catalytic performance of the catalyst were investigated. These included choice of reagents, preparative method and calcination procedure. This information was used to prepare an 'idealised' catalyst, which showed activity for a number of reactions of commercial interest. A range of different aminophosphine complexes based on the reaction of a N,N'- substituted diamine with chlorodiphenylphosphine have been prepared for subsequent study as ligands in complexes active in homogeneous catalysis. Palladium and platinum complexes of the type [(diaminodiphosphine) MCl(_ 2) ] have also been prepared and characterised. A number of x-ray diffraction analyses have been performed, which along with other data has allowed the solid state and solution structures to be discussed. The relative reactivities of the ligands have been determined by reactions with manganese pentacarbonyl bromide and also with <b>palladium</b> <b>dichloride</b> complexes. This depends largely on the steric requirements of the ligand in question. The potential of these ligands in catalysis has been evaluated by the performance of their platinum dichloride complexes in the tin (II) -promoted hydroformylation of styrene, and their palladium acetate complexes for the methoxycarbonylation of ethene...|$|E

Subsequent oxidation of mixed phosphinoyl and phosphanyl substituted imidazole- 2 -thione (5 d,e) with H 2 O 2 -urea gives the bis(phosphinoyl) substituted imidazole- 2 -thiones (7 d,e), and the oxidation of mixed thiophosphinoyl and phosphanyl substituted imidazole- 2 -thione (6 a-c,e) using H 2 O 2 -urea, elemental sulfur or elemental selenium gives {{a set of}} mixed P(V) -chalcogenide substituted imidazole- 2 -thiones (8 b,c), (9 a,b,e) and 10 a, respectively.

Mono- and disubstituted alkynes and conjugated dienes can be hydrosilated in high yields and high regio and stereoselectivity with diphenylsilane and a catalyst generated in situ by treatement of titanocene dichloride with two molar equivalents of isobutylmagnesium chloride.

The zirconium-catalyzed carboalumination and the Negishi 2 ̆ 7 s hydrozirconation of metallated terminal alkynes containing a hydroxyl group can be achieved when this metal is aluminum and lead to the formation of 1, 1 -dimetallo-alkenoxide intermediates. ...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{introduction}} explaining phosphine ligand properties, Pd catalysed cross-coupling reactions; {{the importance}} of the steps involved in the catalytic cycle (oxidative addition, transmetalation & reductive elimination), mechanistic studies and a comparison of various reactions will give an overview of important cross-coupling reactions and their limitations. The development of a “super-concentrated” (5 M) Pd catalysed Kumada type coupling reaction has been developed for coupling a range of aryl bromide and chloride substrates with the Grignard reagents ((p-CF₃-C₆H₄) MgBr)) and PhMgBr in methyl-tetrahydrofuran (Me-THF). Using a range of bidentate ligands such as bis-phosphinoferrocenyl ligands, good conversions were achieved using small amounts of solvent; up to 10 times less than typical procedures in THF. The unsymmetrical Pt complexes of the form [Pt(P-P) Br₂], [Pt(P-P) (Ph) Br] and [Pt(P-P) Ph₂] have been synthesised and characterised. The variations of substituents on the ligand system and the steric bulk have been shown to have a dramatic effect on the rate of transmetalation. The results provide one explanation why 1, 1 ’-bis(di tert-butylphosphino) ferrocene (dtbpf), an excellent ligand for certain Suzuki reactions, is quite poor in reactions where transmetalation is more difficult. <b>Palladium</b> <b>dichloride</b> complexes of the ferrocenylphosphine based ligands 1, 1 ’-bis- (diphenylphosphino) ferrocene (dppf), 1, 1 ’-bis-(diisopropylphosphino) ferrocene (dippf) and 1, 1 ’-bis-(di-tert-butylphosphino) ferrocene (dtbpf) {{have been shown to be}} active in the Hiyama cross-coupling of p-bromoacetophenone and vinyltrimethoxysilane (CHCH₂Si(OMe₃)) in the presence of TBAF under thermal heating and microwave conditions. Ligands with the optimum balance for promoting the transmetalation, oxidative addition and reductive elimination steps along the reaction pathway have been identified. Competition experiments are consistent with slow transmetalation being an issue with the Hiyama reaction relative to the Suzuki coupling. A novel protocol has been developed for the synthesis of aryl-alkyl ethers via C-O bond activation under Pd catalysed conditions. Utilising the unsymmetrical 1 -bis-(ditertbutyl- 1 ’- bis-diphenylphosphino) ferrocene (dtbdppf) under optimised conditions with silicon based nucleophiles and NaOH or TBAF as an activator, the formation of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl ethers with a range of aryl halides was achieved in good yield...|$|E
40|$|Chapter I {{includes}} {{a summary of}} the chemistry of phosphines and bidentate phosphorus-nitrogen ligands of relevance to this thesis, and highlights their application in transition metal-based catalysis. In addition, a review of the characteristic properties and reactivity of iminophosphoranes and phosphenium cations is presented in preparation for work outlined later in this manuscript. The synthesis and coordination studies of a range of N-phosphino-pyridyl imines with the general structure (C 5 H 5 N) (Ar) C=NPR 2 (1) {R = alkyl or aryl and Ar = aryl} are reported in chapter II. The molecular structures of their <b>palladium</b> <b>dichloride</b> complexes are presented, highlighting the effect of differing substituents on framework 1 upon the geometry of the complexes. The chemistry surrounding a novel equilibrium between two valence tautomers prepared from reaction of N-lithio pyridyl imine with bis(diisopropylamino) chlorophosphine is presented in chapters III and IV. The tautomers 1, 1 -bis(diisopropylamino) - 3 -phenyl- 1 λ 5 -[1, 3, 2]diazaphospholo [1, 5 -a]pyridine (2 c) and bis(diisopropylamino) phosphino(phenyl-pyridin- 2 -yl methylene) amine (2 o) exist in a ratio of 95 : 5, respectively, at ambient temperature. Investigations of the thermodynamic properties, the rate of interconversion and the possible mechanistic pathways of interconversion for 2 o/ 2 c have been conducted. The synthesis and characterisation of another equilibrium mixture, that of the tautomers 1, 1 -bis(diisopropylamino) - 3 -anthracenyl- 1 λ 5 -[1, 3, 2]diazaphospholo [1, 5 -a]pyridine (3 c) and bis(diisopropylamino) phosphino(anthracenyl-pyridin- 2 -yl methylene) amine (3 o), which exist in a ratio of 30 : 70, respectively, at ambient temperature is reported. Chapter V describes the reaction of bis(diisopropylamino) phosphenium triflate with 1, 1 -bis(diisopropylamino) - 3 -phenyl- 1 λ 5 -[1, 3, 2]diazaphospholo[1, 5 -a]pyridine, which affords 1, 1, 1 ', 1 '- tetrakis(diisopropylamino) - 3, 3 '-diphenyl- 1 H, 1 'H-[5, 5 '-bi- 1 λ 5 -[1, 3, 2]diazaphospholo[1, 5 -a]pyridinylidene]- 1, 1 '-diium bis(triflate) (4) via a homo-bimolecular coupling process. This apparent ‘oxidative’ coupling by a phosphenium cation has no literature precedent and hence a detailed exploration of the possible mechanism of the reaction is outlined. Comparative reactions involving established oxidants, for example ferrocenium triflate, are examined and also give the diphosphonium salt 4. Chapter VI outlines an exploration of the behaviour of N-dialkyl- and diaryl-phosphino-pyridyl imines in the coordination sphere of low valent palladium species. The isolation and characterisation of a novel dimeric palladium(I) complex is reported, which is found to undergo reactions with chlorobenzene and triphenylphosphine, acting as a source of ‘masked’ palladium(0). These reactions are consistent with redox processes occurring to give palladium(0) or palladium(II) species. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
