40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} <b>pirarucu's</b> (Arapaima gigas) ability {{to trigger a}} self-feeding system to regulate protein intake between two standard diets that contained 39 % and 49 % of crude protein. The same system allowed the evaluation of daily feeding and locomotor activity rhythms. Eighteen fish (654. 44 ± 26. 85 g) were distributed into six 250 L tanks (3 fish/tank). Fish had free access to both diets (39 % vs. 49 % protein) by feeders (2 per tank), adapted to be activated by fish themselves. This system was connected to a computer system. After an adaptation period, fish learned to activate feeders and the mean food intake recorded was 2. 14 % of their body weight on a daily basis. Fish showed feeding (72. 48 %) and locomotor (72. 49 %) activity predominantly during the daytime, and daily variations of choice between diets, but fixed a protein intake feeding target at 44. 53 %. These results should be considered when discussing feeding behavior, feeding schedules and diet intake regulations...|$|R

5000|$|The arapaima, <b>pirarucu,</b> or paiche are {{any large}} species of bonytongue in the genus Arapaima {{native to the}} Amazon and Essequibo basins of South America. Genus Arapaima is the type genus of the family Arapaimidae. They are among the world's largest {{freshwater}} fish, reaching as much as 3 m. They are an important food fish. They have declined in the native range due to overfishing and habitat loss. In contrast, arapaima have been introduced to several tropical regions outside the native range (within South America and elsewhere) where they are sometimes considered invasive species. Its local name, <b>pirarucu,</b> derives from the indigenous words for [...] "pira" [...] meaning [...] "fish" [...] and [...] "urucum" [...] meaning [...] "red".|$|E

5000|$|The Amazonian {{fish fauna}} {{is the center}} of {{diversity}} for neotropical fishes. 5,600 species are currently known, and approximately fifty new species are discovered each year. The arapaima, known in Brazil as the <b>pirarucu,</b> is a South American tropical freshwater fish, one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, with a length of up to 15 ft. Another Amazonian freshwater fish is the arowana (or aruanã in Portuguese), such as the silver arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum), which is a predator and very similar to the arapaima, but only reaches a length of 120 cm. Also present in large numbers is the notorious piranha, an omnivorous fish that congregates in large schools and may attack livestock and even humans. There are approximately 30 to 60 species of piranha. However, only a few of its species are known to attack humans, most notably Pygocentrus nattereri, the red-bellied piranha. The candirú, native to the Amazon River, is a species of parasitic fresh water catfish in the family Trichomycteridae, just one of more than 1200 species of catfish in the Amazon basin. Other catfish 'walk' overland on their ventral fins, while the kumakuma (Brachyplatystoma filamentosum), aka piraiba or [...] "goliath catfish", can reach 3.6 m in length and 200 kg in weight. The electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) and more than 100 species of electric fishes (Gymnotiformes) inhabit the Amazon basin. River stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) are also known. The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) has been reported 4000 km up the Amazon River at Iquitos in Peru.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —The giant and obligate {{air-breathing}} fish <b>pirarucu</b> Arapaima gigas (also {{known as}} arapaima) is a species endemic to the Amazon Basin {{that is increasingly}} managed by artisanal fishers because of government failure to control the fishery. In this study the ability of experienced artisanal fishers to {{count the number of}} <b>pirarucu</b> at the moment of aerial breathing was assessed. Counts were strongly correlated (r 5 0. 98) with mark–recapture abundance estimates calculated for the same populations. The potential for trained fishers to train other fishers to count <b>pirarucu</b> without slow and expensive mark–recapture work was also assessed and confirmed. Not only are the counts a cost-effective method for assessing <b>pirarucu</b> populations, they also allow fisher par-ticipation in decision making and contribute to effective management. The increasing number of community-based management schemes can now be matched with the training of fishers to count <b>pirarucu.</b> The <b>pirarucu</b> Arapaima gigas (also known as arapaima) is a giant, obligate air-breathing fish that can grow up to 3 m in length and 200 kg in weight endemic to the Amazon Basin (Bard and Imbirib...|$|E
40|$|The Giant of Amazon basin, <b>pirarucu,</b> Arapaima gigas, is {{the largest}} scaled {{freshwater}} fish in the world. <b>pirarucu</b> cultivation has recently started, driven by the decline in natural populations and high market value. Currently, there are no reliable methods for sexual differentiation in this species other than direct examination of gonads, which requires dissection of specimens. A non-lethal and less invasive method for sexual identification is highly desirable in order to properly group broodstock for mating and offspring production. We utilized laparoscopic examination in anesthetized <b>pirarucu</b> to differentiate {{between male and female}} individuals.

40|$|<b>Pirarucu</b> (Arapaima gigas) is an {{obligatory}} air-breathing {{fish from}} the Amazon basin. Previous study showed that <b>pirarucu</b> juveniles present a latency period in their response to moderate stress (transportation). Therefore {{the objective of this}} study was to verify the effects of a prolonged air exposure stress in lactate, glucose, cortisol, haematocrit, haemoglobin, and liver glycogen in <b>pirarucu.</b> Thirty-six fish were handled by netting and subjected to air exposure for 75 -min. Six fish were sampled before handling and at 0, 6, 24, 48, and 96 h after handling. Fish cortisol, lactate and haematocrit rose after handling, returning to previous unstressed values on the following sampling (6 h after handling). Glucose increased significantly after handling and that was maintained for 24 h. There were no changes in haemoglobin and liver glycogen as a consequence of handling. The results demonstrate a quick response when exposed to an acute stressor and a fast recovery, suggesting that <b>pirarucu</b> does not use their glycogen reserves during an acute stress. The results suggest that <b>pirarucu</b> exhibit physiological stress responses to handling similar in magnitude to those previously documented for many teleostean fishes, including salmonids...|$|E
40|$|The {{skeletal}} muscle {{of the species}} Arapaima gigas (<b>pirarucu)</b> constitutes the major edible part of the fish and is, therefore, an important protein source for human consumption. Post-natal muscle growth is regulated by the expression of myostatin {{as well as the}} Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs) MyoD and myogenin. Once <b>pirarucu</b> reaches large size, we assume that the control of muscle growth by MRFs and myostatin occurs differentially at the initials life stages. In the present work we evaluated the morphological aspects and expression of MRF genes in {{skeletal muscle}} of <b>pirarucu</b> during early juvenile stage (Group A, up to 50 g, n= 7), and post juvenile stages (Groups B, from 50 to 400 g, n= 7; C, from 400 g to 5 kg, n= 7, and D, from 5 to 9 kg, n= 7). Transverse sections of red and white muscles were obtained to evaluate muscle fiber morphological and morphometric characteristics. MyoD, myogenin and myostatin genes and protein expressions were determined after quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. <b>Pirarucu</b> skeletal muscle exhibited similar morphologies at different life stages. It was possible to conclude that both hyperplasia and hypertrophy occur during muscle growth in early and postjuvenile stages. As regard as expression, both mRNA and protein levels were similar among all groups for MyoD and myogenin. Myostatin presented lower mRNA levels and higher protein levels in early-juvenile stage, compared with the other groups. The levels of MRFs and myostatin might be involved in a balance that controls hyperplasia and hypertrophy occurring during post-natal muscle growth. Myostatin does not appear to play a crucial role during <b>pirarucu</b> early-juvenile stages. Since this species represents an interesting model for aquaculture programs due to high growing rates, our data suggest that the best phase to improve muscle growth in <b>pirarucu</b> is at post-juvenile stage and this will turn the employment of <b>pirarucu</b> farming economically better...|$|E
