This mystery has deepened with the results of the Stardust sample return mission, which captured particles from Comet Wild 2.

2500|$|Over time, there {{developed}} in the French colony a relatively large group of Creoles of Color (gens de couleur libres), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix,</b> {{as well as some}} Native Americans.) Often the French would free their concubines and mixed-race children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term [...] "Creole" [...] became associated with this class of Creoles of Color, many of whom achieved freedom long before the Civil War.|$|E

40|$|Based on the KP {{hierarchy}} reduction method, <b>the</b> general bright-dark <b>mixed</b> multi-soliton solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-component Maccari {{system is}} constructed. The multi-component Maccari system considered comprised of multiple (say M) short-wave components and one long-wave component with all possible combinations of nonlinearities including all-focusing, all-defocusing and mixed types. We firstly derive the two-bright-one-dark (2 -b- 1 -d) and one-bright-two-dark (1 -b- 2 -d) mixed multi-soliton {{solutions to the}} three-component Maccari system in detail. For the interaction between two solitons, the asymptotic analysis shows that inelastic collision can {{take place in a}} M-component Maccari system with M ≥ 3 only if <b>the</b> bright <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixed</b> solitons appear at least in two short-wave components.
