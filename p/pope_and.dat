5|$|The {{government}} {{in exile in}} London, unrecognized {{since the end of}} World War II, ridiculed by the communists, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance. Under President Edward Raczyński it overcame years of internal squabbles, and, after the election of the Polish <b>pope</b> <b>and</b> {{at the time of the}} increasingly assertive Polish opposition, improved its image and standing.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the break}} with Rome, {{it was the}} <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> general councils of the Church that decided doctrine. Church law was governed by canon law with final {{jurisdiction}} in Rome. Church taxes were paid straight to Rome, and the Pope had the final word in the appointment of bishops.|$|E
5|$|After an inauspicious {{start as}} an actor, Cibber {{eventually}} became a popular comedian, wrote and adapted many plays, and rose {{to become one of}} the newly empowered businessmen-managers. He took over the management of Drury Lane in 1710 and took a highly commercial, if not artistically successful, line in the job. In 1730, he was made Poet Laureate, an appointment which attracted widespread scorn, particularly from Alexander <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> other Tory satirists. Off-stage, he was a keen gambler, and was one of the investors in the South Sea Company.|$|E

5|$|Anxious {{to protect}} the Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> granted Momolo's request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single meeting, as the first sign that the Mortara case would take on a special significance.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} send an apology to the <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{knowledge}} of the region helped him to become {{an expert on the}} West's natural history. Over the years he welcomed travelers, including those interested in natural history, to his home overlooking the Ohio River. Clark supplied details on the area's plant and animal life to John <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> John James Audubon, and hosted his brother, William, and Meriweather Lewis, prior to their expedition to the Pacific Northwest. Clark also provided information on the Ohio Valley's native tribes to Allan Bowie Magruder and archaeological evidence related to the Mound Builders to John P. Campbell.|$|E

5|$|Having finally embraced film-making, Gielgud {{appeared}} in six films in 1967–69. His most substantial role was Lord Raglan in Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade. His other roles, in films including Michael Anderson's The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) as a fictional <b>pope</b> <b>and</b> Richard Attenborough's Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) as Count Leopold Berchtold, were cameo appearances in character roles.|$|E
5|$|He {{left for}} Italy in October 1222 {{to attend a}} conference about a new crusade. At John's request, Pope Honorius {{declared}} that all lands conquered during the crusade should be united with the Kingdom of Jerusalem. To plan the military campaign, the <b>pope</b> <b>and</b> Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II met at Ferentino in March 1223; John attended the meeting. He agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Frederick II after the emperor promised that he would allow John to rule the Kingdom of Jerusalem {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{complicated}} marital {{situation and}} his high-handed {{dissolution of the}} monasteries angered the <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> Catholic rulers throughout Europe, which increased England's diplomatic isolation. In 1544 Henry had agreed to attack France together with Emperor CharlesV, and English forces captured Boulogne at great cost in September, but soon England {{was left in the}} lurch after Charles had achieved his objectives and brokered a separate peace.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} restore the glory of his empire and to regaining superpower status. His foreign policy was both ambitious and expansive, reaching out to {{all corners of the}} Mediterranean world. He made several alliances with the <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> Western Christian kingdoms, and successfully handled the passage of the potentially dangerous Second Crusade through his empire, establishing a Byzantine protectorate over the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant {{to take on the}} work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. The pope was adamant, leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept. But a war with the French broke out, diverting the attention of the <b>pope,</b> <b>and</b> Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting. The tomb sculptures, however, were never to be finished because in 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work on the ceiling. The contract was signed on 10 May 1508.|$|E

5|$|Nothing more {{is known}} of Cragh after his {{testimony}} to the papal commission in 1307. Thirty-eightposthumous miracles attributed to Thomas de Cantilupe were examined by the commissioners and submitted for consideration by the <b>pope</b> <b>and</b> his advisors. Twelve were rejected after further analysis, including Cragh's resurrection, but no reasons were recorded. Pope John XXII formally announced Cantilupe's canonisation on 17 April 1320, thirty-eight years after the new saint's death.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 1386 Corfu became {{once more}} a Venetian {{possession}} {{and this time}} Venetian rule would last {{until the end of}} the Republic. This was accomplished voluntary by the people of Corfu. On 10 May, the Corfiotes appointed five ambassadors to submit to the Venetian senate. The Ottomans made several attempts to capture Corfu, the first of which was in 1537. This attack led Venice to an alliance with the <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> Emperor Charles V, known as the Holy League, against the Ottoman Empire. Another major unsuccessful Ottoman attack was that of July 1716.|$|E
5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the <b>Pope,</b> <b>and</b> captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E
