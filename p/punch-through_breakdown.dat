30|$|An {{ultra-low}} specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) lateral double-diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor (LDMOS) with enhanced dual-gate {{and partial}} P-buried layer is proposed and investigated in this paper. On-resistance analytical {{model for the}} proposed LDMOS is built to provide an in-depth insight into {{the relationship between the}} drift region resistance and the channel region resistance. N-buried layer is introduced under P-well to provide a low-resistance conduction path and reduce the resistance of the channel region significantly. Enhanced dual-gate structure is formed by N-buried layer while avoiding the vertical <b>punch-through</b> <b>breakdown</b> in off-state. Partial P-buried layer with optimized length is adopted under the N-drift region to extend vertical depletion region and relax the electric field peak in off-state, which enhances breakdown voltage (BV) with low drift region resistance. For the LDMOS with enhanced dual-gate and partial P-buried layer, the result shows that Ron,sp is 8.5  mΩ·mm 2 while BV is 43 [*]V.|$|E
30|$|We {{found that}} the device {{performance}} is greatly influenced by the electric field distribution. To maintain the high gain and small dark current, the proper control of the electrical field in the multiplication and absorption layers is important. From the ref. [32], a suitable field distribution in InGaAs/InAlAs APD should comply with those rules. The guarantee Vpt (<b>punch-through</b> voltage)[*]<[*]Vbr (<b>breakdown</b> voltage) and Vbr-Vpt should have a safety margin for processing variations in temperature fluctuations and operation range. At breakdown voltage, the multiplication gain goes toward infinity and the current sudden increase [32]. When the dark or photo current reached 50  μA, the corresponding voltage is called breakdown voltage Vbr. In the absorption layer, the electric field should be larger than 50 – 100  kV/cm to ensure enough velocity for the photo-induced carriers. Concurrently, the electric field must be less than 180  kV/cm to avoid the tunneling effect in the absorption layer. Electric field distribution greatly influences the device performance. The choice of electric field in the absorption layer has a balancing of the trade-off between small transit time, dark current, and high responsivity for the practical requirement.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of mesa-processed InGaAs/InAlAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging applications with demand for high gain and low breakdown voltage. Devices are designed with separate absorption, grading, charge, and multiplication (SAGCM) layers. Special {{attention has been paid to}} the charge layer in order to optimize the structure for low band discontinuities and an appropriate electric field distribution. Hereof, a combination of a p-type grading layer and charge layer is presented. Band-edge profile calculations as well as electro-optical characterization results of the APDs will be discussed in this article. Our optimized APD structures reveal low <b>punch-through</b> and low <b>breakdown</b> voltage of V-pt approximate to 8. 5 V and V-bd approximate to 2. 3 V, respectively. A maximum gain of M > 300 in the linear operation mode is demonstrated at room temperature and M = 10 has been measured at 20 V bias...|$|R
30|$|Studies on InGaAs/InAlAs APDs have {{mainly focused}} on {{increasing}} the single-photon detection efficiency (SPDE) and decreasing the DCR in SPADs. Karve et al. demonstrated the first InGaAs/InAlAs SAPDs, {{which has a}} SPDE of 16 % at 130  K [18]. Nakata et al. improved the temperature performance of SPADs, which achieves a SPDE of 10 % at 213  K [19]. Zhao et al. designed a self-quenching and self-recovering InGaAs /InAlAs SPAD with a SPDE of 11.5 % at 160  K; concurrently, a DCR of 3.3  M[*]Hz has been observed [20]. Meng et al. designed a mesa structure InGaAs/InAlAs SPAD, which achieves a SPDE of 21 % at 260  K [21]. Then, they applied a thick absorption and multiplication layer in a similar structure, which improves the SPDE to 26 % at 210  K and decreases the DCR to 1 [*]×[*] 108  Hz [22]. However, in these studies, the DCRs of InGaAs/InAlAs SPADs are too high compared with InGaAs/InP SPADs (in recent InP SPADs, DCRs are typical <[*] 104  Hz) [23]. The high DCRs in InGaAs/InAlAs SPADs are attributed to tunneling currents, which {{is caused by the}} high field at the over bias voltage [21, 22, 24]. Thus, decreasing tunneling-related mechanisms is significant for InGaAs/InAlAs SPADs, and these mechanisms are related to the electric-field distribution in SAPDs. From literatures [1. 9], the tunneling threshold electric field is 2.0 [*]×[*] 105  V/cm in the absorption layer (InGaAs) and 6.8 [*]×[*] 105  V/cm in the multiplication layer (InAlAs). Thus, a suitable electric-field distribution is significant for InAlAs SPADs, which is determined by the charge-layer and multiplication-layer thickness. Considering the charge layer of InAlAs APDs, Kleinow et al. studied the influence of doping concentration in this layer and found that doping concentration is more important for the performance of InGaAs/InAlAs APDs [25, 26]. Chen et al. studied the influence of the charge and multiplication layers on <b>punch-through</b> and <b>breakdown</b> voltages by theoretical analysis and simulation [27]. These studies have focused on the performance of InAlAs APDs under the linear model. However, the performance of InAlAs SPADs has not yet been fully understood under the Geiger mode.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation's research was to develop single-photon detectors with high detection efficiencies for photodetection application, as well as solar cells with high conversion efficiencies and radiance resistance for photovoltaic space applications. Hetero-PN-junctions, which can provide unique material combinations, were utilized {{in order to accomplish}} these goals. One of research focuses is on the high efficient four-junction solar cells using AlAsSb, InP, InGaAsP and InGaAs materials for space applications. The temperature and radiation effect on these solar cells performance were discussed. The effect of cell structure on the radiation response was studied. We fabricated the 1. 0 eV InGaAsP cell, which is critical for this four-junction solar cell. A heterojunction AlInAs/InP tunnel diode, which interconnects the cells, was designed, fabricated and tested with low zero-bias resistivity of 4. 76 × 10 - 3 ? cm 2 and high peak tunnel current of 147 A/cm 2. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with the structure of a single-avalanche-stage were proposed to achieve high gain, high speed, and low noise operation for telecommunication applications. Simulation results show {{that it is possible to}} realize such a device with the InGaAs/InGaAlAs/InAlAs/InGaAsP/InGaAs materials system by combing the high doping with the heterojunction band discontinuity. Mesa-terminated N = 1 APDs were fabricated with the procedure developed using the equipment and facilities available at UMBC cleanroom. Multiplication gains were demonstrated at low bias voltages of ~ 7 V. The results show the dark current decreased a factor of 10 at a gain of 10 by changing the p-dopant from Zn to carbon. We believe that the high performance device can be obtained by carefully controlling the doping profile. Photon counting (PC) detection devices in the 1. 0 - 1. 6 µm wavelength range are important for LIDAR image, remote sensing, standoff chemical detection, and deep-space communications. Lacking of sufficient single photon detection efficiency (SPDE), one of the most important performance metrics, has been a primary issue for PC devices operating at the near infrared wavelength range. A method to improve single photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) performance was proposed by reducing the voltage difference between the <b>punch-through</b> and <b>breakdown</b> voltages of APDs. SPADs based on the proposed structure were fabricated. Results demonstrate the improvement in the leakage current and the I-V characteristics of APDs. Device's dark count probability (DCP) and SPDE were measured using our innovative gated current bias scheme under different operating conditions to obtain a maximum SPDE. We found that the SPDE can be enhanced with the proposed structure and a SPDE of ~ 25 % was achieved...|$|R
40|$|Part I The {{physical}} phenomena {{which will}} ultimately limit {{the packing density}} of planar bipolar and MOS integrated circuits are examined. The maximum packing density is obtained by minimizing the supply voltage {{and the size of}} the devices. The minimum size of a bipolar transistor is determined by junction <b>breakdown,</b> <b>punch-through</b> and doping fluctuations. The minimum size of a MOS transistor is determined by gate oxide <b>breakdown</b> and drain-source <b>punch-through.</b> The packing density of fully active bipolar or static non-complementary MOS circuits becomes limited by power dissipation. The packing density of circuits which are not fully active such as read-only memories, becomes limited by the area occupied by the devices, and the frequency is limited by the circuit time constants and by metal migration. The packing density of fully active dynamic or complementary MOS circuits is limited by the area occupied by the devices, and the frequency is limited by power dissipation and metal migration. It is concluded that read-only memories will reach approximately the same performance and packing density with MOS and bipolar technologies, while fully active circuits will reach the highest levels of integration with dynamic MOS or complementary MOS technologies. Part II Because the Schottky diode is a one-carrier device, it has both advantages and disadvantages with respect to the junction diode which is a two-carrier device. The advantage is that there are practically no excess minority carriers which must be swept out before the diode blocks current in the reverse direction, i. e. a much faster recovery time. The disadvantage of the Schottky diode is that for a high voltage device it is not possible to use conductivity modulation as in the p i n diode; since charge carriers are of one sign, no charge cancellation can occur and current becomes space charge limited. The Schottky diode design is developed in Section 2 and the characteristics of an optimally designed silicon Schottky diode are summarized in Fig. 9. Design criteria and quantitative comparison of junction and Schottky diodes is given in Table 1 and Fig. 10. Although somewhat approximate, the treatment allows a systematic quantitative comparison of the devices for any given application. Part III We interpret measurements of permittivity of perovskite strontium titanate as a function of orientation, temperature, electric field and frequency performed by Dr. Richard Neville. The free energy of the crystal is calculated as a function of polarization. The Curie-Weiss law and the LST relation are verified. A generalized LST relation is used to calculate the permittivity of strontium titanate from zero to optic frequencies. Two active optic modes are important. The lower frequency mode is attributed mainly to motion of the strontium ions with respect to the rest of the lattice, while the higher frequency active mode is attributed to motion of the titanium ions with respect to the oxygen lattice. An anomalous resonance which multi-domain strontium titanate crystals exhibit below 65 °K is described and a plausible mechanism which explains the phenomenon is presented. ...|$|R
