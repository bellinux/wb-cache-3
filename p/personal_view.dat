5|$|While many documentaries {{maintain}} an emotional distance from their subjects, Meerkat Manor – {{due to its}} extended length, soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more <b>personal</b> <b>view</b> of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and disturbing to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre {{and the nature of}} reality TV.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{government}} {{agreed to}} pay compensation for the damaged property {{but not for the}} actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a <b>personal</b> <b>view</b> that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated indemnity. At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.|$|E

A student may have taken teachings from many {{authorities}} and revere them all as lamas in this general sense. However, he will typically have one held in special esteem as his own root guru and is encouraged to view the other teachers who are less dear to him, however more exalted their status, as embodied in and subsumed by the root guru. Often the teacher the student sees as root guru is simply the one who first introduced him to Buddhism, but a student may also change his <b>personal</b> <b>view</b> of which particular teacher is his root guru any number of times.|$|E
25|$|Ellis {{was careful}} to state that REBT was {{independent}} of his atheism, noting that many skilled REBT practitioners are religious, including some who are ordained ministers. In his later days, he significantly toned down his opposition to religion. While Ellis maintained his firm atheistic stance, proposing that thoughtful, probabilistic atheism was likely the most emotionally healthy approach to life, he acknowledged and agreed with survey evidence suggesting that belief in a loving God can also be psychologically healthy. Based on this later approach to religion, he reformulated his professional and <b>personal</b> <b>view</b> {{in one of his}} last books The Road to Tolerance, and he also co-authored a book, Counseling and Psychotherapy with Religious Persons: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach, with two religious psychologists, Stevan Lars Nielsen and W. Brad Johnson, describing principles for integrating religious material and beliefs with REBT during treatment of religious clients.|$|E

[...] In a similar vein, he was skeptical of the effects produced by the recording industry on the culture of music-making. In Szigeti’s opinion, the allure of the recording contract and the instant [...] "success" [...] that it implied led many young artists to record works before they were musically ready, and thus contributed to the problem of artificially fast development and resulting musical immaturity.|$|E
500|$|Unlike its {{real-time}} strategy predecessor StarCraft, Ghost {{was to be}} a third-person shooter, {{and intended}} to give players a closer and more <b>personal</b> <b>view</b> of the StarCraft universe.

Very little of the game's storyline has been released; however, in November 2006 after the game's postponement, a novel was published called , which covers the backstory of the central character.|$|E

After her death, Poe altered his <b>personal</b> <b>view</b> of fictional heroines who were sick and idealized sick women while wishing for their death.

Meyszner had a diametrically opposed <b>personal</b> <b>view</b> and throughout his time in Belgrade refused to support or work with the Serb authorities, except at a purely tactical level. His dislike of Serbs was so great that he is said to have remarked, [...] "I like a dead Serb better than a live one".

500|$|The {{multiplayer}} mode in StarCraft: Ghost {{differs from}} the stealth-based mechanics of the single-player portion. It aims to give players a <b>personal</b> <b>view</b> of the battles from the real-time strategy games of the series. Accordingly, Ghosts multiplayer is structured around class-based team gameplay and fighting {{in a variety of}} game modes. Ghost incorporates traditional game modes from multiplayer video games such as deathmatch, capture the flag, and king of the hill, but also introduces two game modes specifically designed for the StarCraft universe. The first is [...] "Mobile Conflict", which requires two teams to fight for control of a single Terran military factory with the ability of atmospheric flight. Using vehicles and team tactics, both teams must first board the structure and then capture its control room to fly it to the team's starting point. The structure must then land and be defended from capture by the opposing team for a set amount of time.|$|E
500|$|The {{discrepancies}} regarding Poison {{have been}} addressed {{more than once in}} interviews with former and current Capcom employees. Nishitani stated that he supposed the character [...] "could be male", but added it was up to the viewer to decide. He later clarified in a discussion on Twitter that in his <b>personal</b> <b>view</b> Poison was a woman. Street Fighter IVs producer Yoshinori Ono, when asked in an interview about the matter, stated: [...] "Let's set the record straight: In North America, Poison is officially a post-op transsexual woman. But in Japan, she simply tucks her business away to look female." [...] He later emphasized it again when asked about what female characters could be included in the game Street Fighter IV, stating that it would be too confusing to include her due to the region-specific gender. However, in a 2011 interview with Electronic Gaming Monthly at the Tokyo Game Show, he stated that Capcom [...] "doesn't have a stance technically", and while they wouldn't give an official answer, felt it was up to the viewer to decide. He added that his intent was to please all fans and that the mystery behind her gender was the core of the character. During the same interview, a Capcom representative further added that they worked closely with GLAAD, an organization concerned with the portrayal of LGBT people in media, to ensure [...] "anything that might be offensive has been very tailored to not be" [...] for Poison's portrayal in Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E
