The method of "regression with autocorrelated errors" is {{used to examine the}} implications of alternative development paths of urban growth on <b>paper</b> <b>consumption.</b> The simulation results confirm a hypothesis that the urbanization process in China strongly affects <b>paper</b> <b>consumption.</b> Since more rapid urbanization is possible, it would have correspondingly larger effects. Comparing demographic variables with economic variables, the effect of urban household economic factors is relatively more pronounced. According to the simulation results, we expect that pressure for environmental aggravation will increase in association with the <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> growth in the medium term future...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{paperless}} office (PLO) management {{system has been}} established {{with the goal of}} paper usage reduction, demand for paper has still showed an uptrend over the years. Given the substantial pressure on forest ecosystems due to a continued increase of <b>paper</b> <b>consumption,</b> understanding the behavioral aspects of <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> is, therefore, required. This present paper aims at exploring the factors underlying <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> behavior. Empirical data was acquired through a survey of 266 Indonesian students, involving both undergraduate and postgraduate students. A theoretical model, based on the Comprehensive Action Determination Model (CADM), was tested against the empirical data. It was found that the model received reasonable support from the data. Results indicate that reducing <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> behavior is strongly influenced by habit and, marginally significant, by intention. Furthermore, habit formation is influenced by both normative processes and situational influences. The results, to some extent, explain the PLO paradox {{in a way that the}} PLO program should have focused on breaking the habit of paper usage instead of promoting the benefits of PLO. Introducing a paper quota and rationing (fee) to new students, as the main target, is a potential policy intervention implied from the results...|$|R

This retrospective study examined all applications to a single REC {{in the south of}} England over one year. It estimated the mass of paper used, comparing the proportional <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> of different trial types and during different stages of the research process, quantifying the consumption in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. In 2009, 68 trials were submitted to the REC. Total <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> for the REC process and study conduct was 176, 150 sheets of A 4 paper (879 kg), equivalent to an estimated 11. 5 million sheets (88 tonnes, 2100 trees) a year for the U.

40|$|The {{idea of the}} {{paperless}} office was foreseen almost forty years ago, {{but even with the}} growing ubiquity of PC technologies the {{paperless office}} has not yet become a reality. However new tablet devices, such as the Apple iPad offer the potential to make this prediction come true. This is particularly relevant for higher education establishments who are traditionally heavy users of paper, which forms a large part of their carbon footprint. One of the strategies to reduce <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> has been to promote the use of tablets. This paper reports on an exploratory study that examines the use of tablet devices to determine whether they can make a significant impact on <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> and the reasons behind that impact, by interviewing academic staff who regularly use Apple iPads. It was found that though tablets do reduce <b>paper</b> <b>consumption,</b> they have not yet made the paperless office a reality. Tablets have affordances that enable the reduction of <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> {{to a greater extent than}} other digital technologies, but their limitations caused participants to resort to paper for many tasks, which meant that devices were not used to their full potential. This research provides guidelines for organisations planning to adopt tablets on how to address their limitations, for example by providing training, to ensure that the use of tablets maximises paper reduction...|$|R

40|$|As {{awareness}} of the current unsustainable state of our society increases, it has become evident that immediate action is needed to change this state. Many of the ecological changes that threaten the long-term survival of humans and of other species have anthropogenic origins. Industry 2 ̆ 7 s impact {{and its role in}} mitigating these impacts is the focus of much discussion and debate. Two industries that are working to deal with these issues are the printing and paper industries. The environmental impacts associated with the entire life-cycle of paper are significant, yet the socially redeeming value of the content printed can be equally as significant. A curious paradox is that advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have long been predicted to lead to a reduction in media use, resulting in the so-called paperless office, but this has not been the case. Until recently, the observed trends worldwide demonstrate that in most countries <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> has been on the rise, however in some developed countries there is some suggestion that this trend may be reversing. The work of Sellen and Harper (2002) provides a qualitative explanation of why <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> is on the rise. Nonetheless, there is little research that develops quantitative models to explain <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> patterns. This thesis leverages Sellen and Harper 2 ̆ 7 s qualitative models to develop a system dynamics model to explain the effects and interactions between ICT, the affordances of paper and paper-like technologies, and knowledge work flows. Specifically, the Bass Diffusion technology adoption model and the path dependence patterns of behavior are modified in an attempt to reproduce the <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> patterns observed in the United States (US).

40|$|Introduction: Today, {{the growing}} amount of <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> and {{consequently}} deforestation and environmental destruction have imposed financial burden on different {{countries around the}} world. This study aimed to determine the level of knowledge, attitude, and performance of Yazd health volunteers on cutting down the <b>consumption</b> of <b>paper.</b> Materials and Methods: This descriptive-cross sectional study was conducted on 120 health volunteers of Shahid Sadoughi university of Medical Sciences and Health Services in 2015. A self-made questionnaire containing demographic, knowledge, attitude, and performance questions was applied as the data collection tool. The data was imported into SPSS software V. 18 and analyzed with t-test and ANOVA statistical tests. Results: The participants' knowledge about importance of <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> was 80. 03 %. The {{mean and standard deviation}} scores of knowledge, attitude, and performance of health volunteers were 11. 09 ± 2. 90, 59. 82 ± 2. 23, and 41. 11 ± 9. 50 respectively. The results suggested that the average scores of knowledge and attitude among those with academic degrees were higher than that of other participants and this relation was statistically significant (p ≤ 0. 001). The attitude of married subjects compared to single volunteers' was more positive and {{there was a significant difference}} between their attitude and income levels. According to the results, there was a positive and significant correlation between knowledge and attitude as well as attitude and performance (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Educating Australians on {{sustainable}} living {{is becoming increasingly}} important and is the primary discussion topic in this article.  Clothes will often automatically be washed without too much consideration because it involves little effort and because the environmental effects of that washing process remain unseen and consequently unconsidered. Reducing <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> in the College {{has been identified as}} a sustainability challenge because of the associated economic and environmental costs related to the depletion of natural resources. However it is in examining the various social dimensions embedded in the attitudes, systems and structures within the school that we find the barriers to, and opportunities for, a reduction in <b>paper</b> <b>consumption</b> as part of a range of sustainability gains. The College is a non-government high school in Canberra, with students from year 7 to 12. A study conducted by The Australia Institute in 2005 revealed that there is a correlation between a higher level of disposable income and levels of waste in Canberra, with its young people being the most wasteful in the country (Hamilton, Denniss & Baker 2005, p. viii). Drawing on this contextual study, we can assume that the students at the College are generally from a demographic that has a high level of consumption and waste. In addition, the school can be regarded as an institution that perpetuates what Illich described as “the Myth of Unending Consumption. This modern myth is grounded in the belief that process inevitably produces something of value and, therefore, production necessarily produces demand” (1970, p. 38).
