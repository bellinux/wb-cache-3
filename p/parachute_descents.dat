50|$|In spring 1890, he {{made two}} <b>parachute</b> <b>descents</b> from a balloon {{floating}} above the town. He {{made his first}} balloon ascent from a field in Westoe on 5 April 1890 and after a successful flight (reaching, it is said, the height of 6000 feet) came down at Cleadon. On 5 April he made a particularly rash jump, descending from (so it is said) 15,000 feet. Shipley, dressed showily in dark velvet, landed {{on the roof of}} a house in John Williamson Street.|$|E
50|$|The {{team was}} {{established}} in 1971 with Major John Hasek as its first commander. The SkyHawks have appeared in more than 4,200 shows, performing for over 75 million spectators. Other than Canada and the United States, they have also made appearances around the world including Japan, France and Australia. The SkyHawks have demonstrated parachuting at a Rolling Stones concert in 2003, at the Juno Beach Centre opening celebrations in Normandy, and at the 60th anniversary of the Liberation of Holland. The team conducts over 3,400 <b>parachute</b> <b>descents</b> at training camp each year in order to prepare for their show season, which runs from March until October.|$|E
50|$|Goodden {{returned}} to England in January 1911 {{and settled in}} Oxford, making several balloon flights {{and a number of}} <b>parachute</b> <b>descents,</b> before turning to heavier-than-air flying machines. Using a 35 h.p. J.A.P. engine recovered from a crashed aircraft he built his own monoplane in 1912, making several flights until lack of money obliged him to take a position as a flying instructor at the Caudron School at Hendon Aerodrome. He was granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 506 on 3 June 1913 after soloing a Caudron bi-plane at the W. H. Ewen School at Hendon, where he then became an instructor, and was a regular participant in the popular air shows, demonstrations and races of the time.|$|E
50|$|In the Second World War, Macintosh {{held the}} rank of Air Commodore and trained anaesthetists for the armed services.

50|$|In 1919, Irvin {{successfully}} {{tested the}} parachute by jumping from an airplane. The Type-A parachute {{was put into}} production and over time saved a number of lives. This was the first premeditated freefall <b>parachute</b> <b>descent.</b> With Smith flying the plane and Irvin making the jump, the new chute performed flawlessly, though Irvin broke his ankle on landing.|$|R
50|$|In May 1966, Thorn {{ejected from}} his {{aircraft}} following a mid-air collision with 4 other aircraft {{in which two}} aircraft crashed onto the outskirts of Nottingham. Thorn represented Great Britain in the bobsleigh at the 1968 Winter Olympics, Grenoble, France. At the European Championships {{just prior to the}} Olympics he won bronze in the event. On completion of his flying instructors tour he started his succession of fighter squadron tours commencing in January 1968. Four Hawker Hunter tours followed: No. 8 Squadron based at RAF Muharraq, Bahrain (1968-69), No. 4 Squadron and No. II(AC) Squadron based at RAF Gutersloh, Germany (1969-71) and No. 234 Squadron based at RAF Chivenor, SW England, where he graduated from the Pilot Attack Instructors Course. Promoted to squadron leader in July 1972, having turned down the opportunity to become a Queen's Equerry, he was seconded to the British Army and joined the Parachute Regiment with 16 Parachute Brigade where he completed over one hundred <b>parachute</b> <b>descents,</b> one of which the parachute failed to open on an exercise parachuting into Schleswig-Holstein. The tour was shortened to attend the Indian Defence Services Staff College, in South India for a year in 1975.|$|E
50|$|After he had prematurely {{retired from}} the RAF having {{achieved}} over 8,000 single seat flying hours {{and a total of}} 123 <b>parachute</b> <b>descents,</b> Thorn joined De Beers as the Head of Security for the Diamond Company with worldwide responsibility. At the same time he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training) Branch in December 1995 with the rank of flying officer. In December 1997 he was awarded a Green Endorsement for an instance of Exceptional Flying Skill and Judgement when flying with an Air Training Corps (ATC) cadet in a RAF Tutor aircraft he successfully completed a forced landing back onto the airfield from 350 feet after the engine had failed and the propellor stopped. He was promoted to the rank of flight lieutenant in 2003. After 13 years service in the RAFVR he was awarded the Cadet medal in 2008. In November 2000, together with the Metropolitan Police Flying Squad he was heavily involved in successfully denying an attempt to steal £350 million display of De Beers diamonds (the Millennium Star and 11 unique Blue Diamonds) from the Millennium Dome, Greenwich, London. In 2005, he retired from De Beers at the age of 60 years and formed his own Security Consultancy Company dealing with the Jewellery Retail Trade and Diamond/Gold Mines. As a consequence of a change of RAF policy on the maximum age of RAF pilots he was forced to cease flying on 31 January 2010 but he continues to run his consultancy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{explore the}} injury {{mechanism}} and prevent injuries {{for the military}} parachuting of cadet pilots, this paper investigated the injury risk factors. A prospective study of 59, 932 static line <b>parachute</b> <b>descents</b> by Chinese People’s Liberation Army cadet pilots (CPLACP), including 186 female cadet pilots with 391 jumps, was performed. Injury risk factors from administrative records included mental qualities, parachuting movements, surface wind speed, protective boots, and gender. Injury data were obtained from emergency room and hospital records. The study indicates that 153 CPLACP were injured, {{with a total of}} 168 injuries. The overall injury incidence on basic courses was 2. 6 / 1000 jumps. About 79. 7 % of the injuries were located in the lower limbs. The most commonly injured sites were ankle and knee, which was 39. 3 % and 19. 0 %, respectively, of all injuries occurred. Although the parachuting injury incidence of cadet pilots is smaller than paratroopers’, the potential risk for career-threatening or life-threatening injury is great. This risk can be reduced by appropriate training and attention to detail...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 27 - 29, 1971 / Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington, D. C. 15 - and 9 -channel FM/FM physiological/force-field {{telemetry}} {{data acquisition}} systems utilizing microminiaturized signal conditioning modules, IRIG subcarrier oscillators and 220 or 1485. 5 MHz transmitters have been utilized {{to monitor the}} responses of military test parachutists throughout intentional free-fall parachuting and continuously during highspeed (110 - 150 KIAS) through-the-air-tow by C- 130 aircraft. No in-depth physiological studies of parachutists have previously been conducted and no reference to intentional aerial tow of humans {{was found in the}} literature. The objective is to provide better human engineered egress and retardation equipment for the aircrewmember, to describe parachutists physiologically, and to assess biomedical response to aerial tow so that mid-air retrieval systems can be developed for rescuing ejectees over enemy territory. Mean heart rate profile to parachuting exhibits a double peaked curve with the highest values near parachute deployment (157. 7 BPM) and second highest rates near landing (155. 7 BPM) compared with baseline values of 77. 4 BPM one hour pre-jump. Respiratory rate more than doubles during the jump (32. 1 BrPM) at deployment when compared with baseline conditions (15. 6 BrPM). Total riser forces at parachute deployment average 1632 lbs (8. 34 +G(z)), Preliminary air tow data indicate that heart rate increases linearly with speed to 150 KIAS. One subject, who averaged 131. 5 BPM at landing during nine <b>parachute</b> <b>descents,</b> had heart rates of 128 BPM at egress during tow, 171 BPM at 110 KIAS, and 182 BPM at 150 KIAS.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features in the incidence of rheumatic diseases in the recent war has been the number of cases of spondylitis which have been met with in all branches cf the Forces. At the time of the Great War of 1914 - 18 spondylitis was a rare disease, though the conditions to which it has often been attributed by its victims-fatigue, exhaustion, and exposure to cold and damp-were certainly no less common. The history of minor degrees of trauma within a few months prior to the onset of symptoms has been noted, and it is likely that jar-ring of the spine in travel in lorries over rough country, in <b>parachute</b> <b>descents,</b> or airplane crashes may be worth investigating as a contributory factor, but in a large proportion of cases no definite history of anything of the kind can be obtained. The incidence in the male sex, not less than 90 %, and the tendency to attack robust and virile types rather than the weakly has been well marked. It is easy to overlook this last feature, since by the time the disease has become established the constant pain and disability may have reduced the patient's strength and vigour considerably. Gilbert Scott advocated the name " adolescent spondylitis, " as the most severe and typical cases begin within a few years after puberty; the im-portance of this age period will be discussed later. The cases met with in the Services usually dated the onset in the early twenties or before and {{it must be noted that}} the first symptoms may be slight and intermittent and thus overlooked. There are cases which never develop beyond a very early stage, the evidences being discovered years later under examination for other conditions. The pains in the back and limbs may be slight at first with intervals of complete freedom before the nature of the disease becomes manifest. Scott's advice that all cases of indefinite rheumatic pains appearing soon after puberty should be submitted to x-ray examination of the sacro-iliac region is sound. The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis may, how-ever, be made on the basis of such an examination and prove erroneous in the light of the clinical features and the progress of the patient, therefore the x-ray examination should always be accom-panied by estimation of the sedimentation rate...|$|E
