5|$|Anarchism is a <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> {{that advocates}} self-governed {{societies}} based on voluntary institutions. These are {{often described as}} stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>political</b> <b>philosophy,</b> one-nation {{conservatism}} {{reflects the}} belief that societies exist and develop organically, and that members within them have obligations towards each other. There is particular emphasis on the paternalistic obligation {{of those who are}} privileged and wealthy to the poorer parts of society.|$|E
5|$|Despite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has {{influenced}} proponents of control theory, {{and is often}} mentioned as a classic sociological study. The book pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and <b>political</b> <b>philosophy.</b>|$|E

5|$|The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, {{established}} {{the first major}} American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders {{in the development of}} pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of <b>political</b> <b>philosophy.</b> Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and <b>political</b> <b>philosophy.</b>|$|E
5|$|This line of {{argument}} follows the <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> of John Locke in the Two Treatises on Government (1689). Locke wrote that the people {{had the right to}} resist their government when their property rights were violated, and that nations have the same sovereign rights even when they have been conquered by another.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} years {{following}} Anarky's creation, Grant rarely incorporated the character into Batman stories, being reserved for stories {{in which the}} author wished to make a philosophical point. Originally, Grant created Anarky as an anarchist with socialist and populist leanings. In this early incarnation, Anarky was designed as an avatar for Grant's personal meditations on <b>political</b> <b>philosophy,</b> and specifically for his burgeoning sympathy for anarchism.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's <b>political</b> <b>philosophy.</b>|$|E
5|$|At her new job, Goldman met {{a fellow}} worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared {{her love for}} books, dancing, and traveling, {{as well as her}} {{frustration}} with the monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the fallout of the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> of anarchism.|$|E
40|$|In recent centuries Christians {{of various}} {{denominations}} have endorsed many different <b>political</b> <b>philosophies</b> {{that they see}} as being truly biblical in their approach. Over this time {{there has been an}} increasing hostility, by some Christians, towards free markets and <b>political</b> <b>philosophies</b> that hold human liberty as the highest goal such as libertarianism and classical liberalism. This criticism is unwarranted and misplaced as libertarianism and free markets are not only compatible with Christianity, they are also the most biblically sound of all economics systems and <b>political</b> <b>philosophies</b> endorsed by Christians today. Therefore, this paper will argue that Christians of all denominations should endorse free markets and libertarianism if they wish to create a world that follows biblical principles and the teachings of Jesus...|$|R

5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley {{as a symbol of}} oppression, Czolgosz was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E
5|$|Friedman was an {{advisor to}} Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. His <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> extolled {{the virtues of}} a free market {{economic}} system with minimal intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating U.S. conscription was his proudest accomplishment. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and school vouchers. His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice.|$|E
5|$|On {{moving into}} , Thatcher {{introduced}} {{a series of}} political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles {{in the wake of the}} Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt in 1984.|$|E

The Manifesto of the Province of Flanders (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration; others include the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence (1811), the Liberian Declaration of Independence (1847), the declarations of secession by the Confederate States of America (1860–61), and the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence (1945). These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> of the original.|$|E
5|$|Parts of New Labour's <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> linked crime {{with social}} {{exclusion}} and pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower crime rates. Other areas of New Labour's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime; {{the prison population}} in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences. Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter-terrorism measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, Labour introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).|$|E

The volume addresses {{the emergence of}} academic animal ethics informed by <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> (as opposed to moral philosophy), {{and was the first}} edited collection to be published on the topic, as well as the first book-length attempt to explore the limits of the literature. As well as a substantial introduction by the editors, it features ten sole-authored chapters split over three parts, with contributions from Wissenburg, Schlosberg, Manuel Arias-Maldonado, Chad Flanders, Christie Smith, Clemens Driessen, Simon Otjes, Kurtis Boyer, Per-Anders Svärd and Mihnea Tanasescu.|$|E

5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> book by Meira Levinson that {{establishes}} a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on <b>political</b> <b>philosophy.</b> Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Between 1910 and 1916, Hand {{tried to}} {{translate}} his <b>political</b> <b>philosophy</b> into political action. Having read Croly's The Promise of American Life and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in {{economic and social}} issues, he joined the Progressive Party. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with {{his role as a}} judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.|$|E
