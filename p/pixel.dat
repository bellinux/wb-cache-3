5|$|Set every <b>pixel</b> with {{numerical}} value less than 1/2 to 0, and every <b>pixel</b> with {{numerical value}} greater than 1/2 to 1, thresholding the image {{back to its}} original values in new positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} this scheme to be accurate, the time step must {{be large enough}} to cause the curve to move by at least one <b>pixel</b> even at points of low curvature, but small enough to cause the radius of {{blurring}} to be less than the minimum radius of curvature. Therefore, the size of a <b>pixel</b> must be , small enough to allow a suitable intermediate time step to be chosen.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each <b>pixel.</b> It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, a version of this method that uses an image whose <b>pixel</b> values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E
50|$|Common display resolutions for {{contemporary}} (as of 2012) portable projectors include SVGA (800×600 <b>pixels),</b> XGA (1024×768 <b>pixels),</b> 720p (1280×720 <b>pixels),</b> and 1080p (1920×1080 <b>pixels).</b>|$|R
30|$|The block formula {{performs}} a subtraction between the expectation {{value of the}} highest <b>pixels</b> (target) and the expectation value {{of the rest of}} the <b>pixels</b> (background), divided by the standard deviation of block <b>pixels.</b> Since the probability matrices of the DPA introduce the influence of target <b>pixels</b> on adjacent <b>pixels,</b> these influenced <b>pixels</b> might accumulate higher values than unaffected <b>pixels</b> (background), and can be regarded as target <b>pixels.</b> This might lower the expectation value of the target, but will also lower the standard deviation of the background, since these high <b>pixels</b> are higher than the statistics of the background.|$|R
30|$|The {{density of}} {{foreground}} <b>pixels</b> in a binary image {{refers to the}} proportion of foreground <b>pixels</b> in the image. Thus, if all <b>pixels</b> in a binary image are background <b>pixels,</b> {{the density of the}} image will be 0. On the other hand, if all the <b>pixels</b> are foreground <b>pixels,</b> the density will be 1.|$|R
5|$|Once the 342 {{individual}} {{images were}} cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, {{they had to}} be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each <b>pixel</b> on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final <b>pixel</b> sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Optical imaging {{inside the}} crater {{was done for}} the first time by the Japanese lunar orbiter {{spacecraft}} Kaguya in 2007. It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice, down to the image resolution of 10 m per <b>pixel.</b>|$|E

50|$|For example, 1920×1080p25 {{identifies}} progressive scanning format with 25 frames per second, each frame being 1,920 <b>pixels</b> {{wide and}} 1,080 <b>pixels</b> high. The 1080i25 or 1080i50 notation identifies interlaced scanning format with 25 frames (50 fields) per second, each frame being 1,920 <b>pixels</b> wide and 1,080 <b>pixels</b> high. The 1080i30 or 1080i60 notation identifies interlaced scanning format with 30 frames (60 fields) per second, each frame being 1,920 <b>pixels</b> wide and 1,080 <b>pixels</b> high. The 720p60 notation identifies progressive scanning format with 60 frames per second, each frame being 720 <b>pixels</b> high; 1,280 <b>pixels</b> horizontally are implied.|$|R

30|$|The {{width and}} height of images after size {{normalization}} are fixed to 100 by 100 <b>pixels.</b> The selection of 100 by 100 <b>pixels</b> for size normalization achieve lowest error rate in our experiments {{as compared to}} selections of 28 by 28 <b>pixels,</b> 56 by 56 <b>pixels,</b> 84 by 84 <b>pixels</b> and 112 by 112 <b>pixels.</b> The Figs.  1 and 2 presents original image and its conversion to size normalized binary image.|$|R
5|$|The HDMI {{specification}} {{defines the}} protocols, signals, electrical interfaces and mechanical {{requirements of the}} standard. The maximum <b>pixel</b> clock rate for HDMI 1.0 is 165MHz, which is sufficient to allow 1080p and WUXGA (1920×1200) at 60Hz. HDMI 1.3 increases that to 340MHz, which allows for higher resolution (such as WQXGA, 2560×1600) across a single digital link. An HDMI connection can either be single-link (type A/C/D) or dual-link (type B) and can have a video <b>pixel</b> rate of 25MHz to 340MHz (for a single-link connection) or 25MHz to 680MHz (for a dual-link connection). Video formats with rates below 25MHz (e.g., 13.5MHz for 480i/NTSC) are transmitted using a pixel-repetition scheme.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} vision, {{digital images}} are partitioned into small square pixels, {{each of which}} has its own color. The dual graph of this subdivision into squares has a vertex per <b>pixel</b> and an edge between pairs of pixels that share an edge; it is useful for applications including clustering of pixels into connected regions of similar colors.|$|E

30|$|Since {{all of the}} {{discarded}} <b>pixels</b> {{are classified}} into five categories: horizontal, 45 ° diagonal, vertical, 135 ° diagonal, and undefined direction, the directional interpolated frames V_i^l and V_i^r are generated based on this classification. The horizontal <b>pixels</b> are the average of corresponding four nearest corner <b>pixels,</b> and the undefined directional <b>pixels</b> are recovered by vertical interpolation, since the vertical neighbors are the closest to the discarded <b>pixels.</b> For the other three directions’ <b>pixels,</b> they are recovered by linearly interpolation along the pattern direction. In the fourth stage of the proposed upsampling algorithm, the discarded <b>pixels</b> are recovered by fusing the interpolated <b>pixels</b> with the virtual view <b>pixels</b> in order to exploit the advantages of both types of approach and to compensate the compression distortion.|$|R

5|$|Space was {{a popular}} setting for video games at the time, and Jarvis felt the {{abstract}} setting would help obscure simple graphics that lacked realism. Initially, Jarvis spent 3–4months developing color variations of Taito's Space Invaders and Atari's Asteroids. First inspired by Space Invaders, he created a similar game with new gameplay mechanics. After spending a few weeks on the design, however, the team abandoned the idea, believing it lacked enjoyment. Development then shifted to emulating Atari's Asteroids, but hardware differences between Asteroids and Defenders proposed specifications were problematic. Asteroids displays vector graphics on a special monitor, while the staff planned to use <b>pixel</b> graphics on a conventional monitor. The team experimented with recreating the game with <b>pixel</b> graphics, but also abandoned it because they felt the gameplay lacked enjoyment and visual appeal.|$|E

30|$|All the <b>pixels</b> can be {{predicted}} {{in a single}} pass with original <b>pixels</b> as context. This is beneficial to avoid the the distortion problem due to part of the <b>pixels</b> predicted by the modified <b>pixels,</b> such as the predictor in [15].|$|R
50|$|During any drawing operation, {{there is}} a source (the <b>pixels</b> being {{produced}} by the paint) and a destination (the <b>pixels</b> already onscreen).

25|$|For information, the {{uncompressed}} 24-bit RGB {{bitmap image}} below (73,242 pixels) would require 219,726 bytes (excluding all other information headers). The filesizes indicated below include the internal JPEG information headers and some metadata. For highest quality images (Q=100), about 8.25 bits per color <b>pixel</b> is required. On grayscale images, {{a minimum of}} 6.5 bits per <b>pixel</b> is enough (a comparable Q=100 quality color information requires about 25% more encoded bits). The highest quality image below (Q=100) is encoded at nine bits per color <b>pixel,</b> the medium quality image (Q=25) uses one bit per color <b>pixel.</b> For most applications, the quality factor should not go below 0.75 bit per <b>pixel</b> (Q=12.5), {{as demonstrated by the}} low quality image. The image at lowest quality uses only 0.13 bit per <b>pixel,</b> and displays very poor color. This is useful when the image will be displayed in a significantly scaled-down size. A method for creating better quantization matrices for a given image quality using PSNR instead of the Q factor is described in Minguillón & Pujol (2001).|$|E
