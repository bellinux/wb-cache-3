50|$|<b>Plinthite</b> is a redoximorphic {{feature in}} highly {{weathered}} soil. The product of pedogenesis, it commonly occurs as dark red redox concretions that usually form platy, polygonal, or reticulate patterns. <b>Plinthite</b> changes irreversibly to an ironstone hardpan or to irregular soil aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying, {{especially if it}} is also exposed to heat from the sun. The lower boundary of a zone in which <b>plinthite</b> occurs generally is diffuse or gradual, {{but it may be}} abrupt at a lithologic discontinuity. Generally, <b>plinthite</b> forms in a soil horizon that is saturated with water for some time during the year. Initially, iron is normally segregated in the form of soft, more or less clayey, red or dark red redox concretions. These concretions are not considered <b>plinthite</b> unless there has been enough segregation of iron to permit their irreversible hardening on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. <b>Plinthite</b> is firm or very firm when the soil moisture content is near field capacity and hard when the moisture content is below the permanent wilting point.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plinthite</b> {{does not}} harden irreversibly {{as a result}} of a single cycle of drying and rewetting.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the distribution and nature of Fe oxides in plinthic soils on the sediments of Barreiras Group (in the state of Piauí) and Itapecuru Formation (in the state of Maranhão) in Northeastern Brazil. Four pedons were selected: a "plinthic, dystrophic, epieutrophic Gray Podzolic with low activity clay" and a "dystrophic Plinthosol with low activity clay" (both Plinthic Kandiustalfs) on the Barreiras sediments, as well as an "eutrophic Plinthosol with low activity clay" and an "allic Plinthosol with low activity clay" (both Plinthustalfs) on the Itapecuru sediments. Soil samples were fractionated into > 2 mm (pisoliths), water-stable aggregates (<b>plinthite)</b> and matrices; the aggregates and matrices were further fractionated into sand, silt and clay sizes. Dithionite extractable iron (Fe d) and aluminum (Al d), as well as oxalate extractable iron (Fe o), were determined for all fractions, and X-ray diffraction analyses were performed on the pisoliths. It was observed that the Plinthustalfs contain more iron oxides, exhibit more extensive <b>plinthite</b> development and have a greater potential for further <b>plinthite</b> development than the Kandiustalfs. The distribution of values for the Fe d indicates that <b>plinthite</b> formation and induration in all soils were accompanied by an enrichment of Fe oxides in all particle size fractions. This Fe segregation was accompanied by aggregation of particles leading to a greater degree of crystallinity, as indicated by analysis of the ratios of Al d:Fe d. Larger ratios of goethite to hematite, and relatively smaller amounts of silicates in the more mature pisoliths were revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Ratios of Al d:Fe d were larger in the Kandiustalfs than in the Plinthustalfs, and also larger than expected for Al-substituted Fe oxides.

Three well-drained soil profiles at high elevations were studied (P 1, Plinthic Vetic Ferralsol; P 2 and P 3, Vetic Endopetric Plinthosol) and a contrasting poorly drained soil (P 4 Haplic Plinthosol), located at low elevation. After profile descriptions, soil samples were collected from each horizon, air-dried, sieved (2 mm), and analyzed for particle-size distribution, pH, exchangeable cations (Al 3 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+, and Na+), as well as available P and total organic carbon (TOC) content. The minerals present in the clay and sand fractions, {{as well as in}} the ferruginous materials were identified by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The weathering stage of these soils was assessed by means of Ki and Kr indexes, and the amounts of free and amorphous Fe and Al oxides by using dithionite citrate bicarbonate (DBC) and ammonium oxalate dissolution procedures, respectively. The results showed that all soils were extremely unfertile, with pH levels ranging between strong and moderate acidity, very low sum of bases and organic matter content, and of available P. The mineralogy of the soil profiles was very similar, mainly of the well-drained soils, with predominance of kaolinite and quartz in the clay and sand fractions, respectively. In the poorly-drained P 4, 2 : 1 clay particles were also observed. These profiles can be considered highly developed according to the Ki index, however, the Ki value of P 4 was higher, indicating that this soil was less developed than the others.

40|$|The morphologic {{development}} of soils on marine terraces {{is a function}} of terrace age and geomorphic evolution. In this study, interrelationships between terrace landscape evolution and pedogenic silica cementation were investigated. Soil morphology, micromorphology, selective dissolution, penetration resistance, and hydraulic conductivity were used to determine {{the nature and extent of}} the cementation and evaluate the effect of cementation on soil properties. Soils on the interior part of the terrace (coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Epiaquolls) contain <b>plinthite,</b> continuous throughout the entire terrace, cemented to the extent that it is only slowly permeable. A seasonally perched water table develops above the <b>plinthite,</b> and water seeps out ofsoils at the terrace edges. Some ofthese soils are cemented by opaline silica, in both channels and interstitial voids. The silica cementation extends inward into the terrace soils only 4 m, but at the terrace edge is strong enough to result in block fall as the predominant mechanism ofscarp retreat. Redoximorphic Fe depletions are prominent in deeper horizons at the edge, but are absent from the interior. These depletions are formed through seasonal saturation and Fe reduction, by water seeping laterally through preferential flow paths in and adjacent to shrinkage cracks above the regolith-bedrock contact. Contrasting morphology and chemistry between terrace interior and edge both result from, and cause, the interaction of pedogenic processes and landscape evolution.

40|$|Topography {{has been}} {{reported}} to be the major factor ruling the spatial distribution of Acrisols, Plinthosols and Gleysols on the seasonally flooded, low elevation plateaux of the upper Amazon basin occupied by Tertiary (Ica & Solimoes) sediments. In this study, detailed morphological and mineralogical investigations conducted in a representative 25 -ha site were combined with hydro-geochemical data to relate the vertical and lateral soil differentiations observed to the hydro-geological history of that part of the basin. As a result of the uplift of the Andes, several cuts in the extensive Tertiary marshlands have formed, at first, slightly incised plateaux of low elevation. There, weathering under hot and humid climates would have generated a reddish, freely drained and bioturbated topsoil layer and the vertical differentiation in subsoil sediments of a <b>plinthite</b> over an iron-depleted mottled clay. The second episode of soil differentiation is linked to the replacement of the forest by a savannah under the drier climates of the late Pleistocene, which favours surface runoff and the infill of the incisions by fine particles. This infill, combined with the return to the present humid climate, has then enabled the local groundwater to rise on the plateaux and to generate episaturation at the topsoil/subsoil transition close to the depressions. Nowadays, ferrous iron is released from the partly iron-depleted topsoil weathering front at high water levels during the rainy seasons. It moves from footslope to low-lying positions and from top to bottom in the soil profile according to the groundwater dynamics. The present general trend is thus to the lateral export of iron at high water levels due to subsurface and overland flows, its vertical transfer during the recession of the groundwater and accumulation in a nodular <b>plinthite.</b> In the latter, ferrous iron is adsorbed onto its softest iron masses where it feeds the neoformation of ferrihydrite that rapidly dehydrates into haematite...|$|E

S. and ·its influence on the production of maize are discussed. Morphologic characteristics, typically associated with soils are grey matrix colours, soft <b>plinthite,</b> yellow brown apedal B-horizons and E-horizons. Observations in piezometers, installed at various localities in the research area, suggest that the free water accumulates on paleo-surfaces. The paleo-surfaces, covered by solums derived from aeolian sand, consists of gleyed clayey paleosols or the weathering products of underlying rocks. The free water is phreatic and its presence over long periods can be inferred from the morphology of the soil. High concentrations of cations and anions in the free water reach the root zones and influence the nutrition of plants. The height of capillary rise to the rootzone for different flood densities was calculated to evaluate the influence of fluctuating water tables on the supply of water to plants. The maximum height of capillary rise in clay, calcrete, hard <b>plinthite</b> and sand was measured. A · technique was developed for this purpose. Various implements used by farmers in the area for tillage of sandy soils, were evaluated. A threetine ripper gave the best results. Experiments to evaluate the influence of water content and various implements on the compaction of soils were used to set guidelines for tillage-practices in the area investigated. Collapse settlement took place with saturation, causing consolidation which eliminate the positive effect of tillage; In oedometer tests, the internal resistance against compaction exceeded matrix potential at void ratios of 0, 71 and less. The pore diameter, where the internal resistance against compression equals matrix potential, was calculated experimentally as 0, 0327 mm. Extremely high water tables are unfavourable for the cultivation of maize. Water tables that reach the roots, through capillary action, but fluctuates deeper than the depth of tillage, will supply water to plants during dry periods, without resulting in harmful anaerobic conditions. Soils with water tables fluctuating within this reach during the growth season, could be advantageous for the cultivation of maize. Soil in which water tables are too deep for capillary water to reach the root zone, may regarded be as high risk soils. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|The geomorphic {{evolution}} of the south-eastern Brazilian landscape is attributed to climatic changes coupled with tectonic activity.

The combination of stable landscapes (with continuously exposed soils) and neo-Cenozoic graben zones (episodically filled with sediments that may have undergone soil formation) offers the possibility to unravel {{the history of the}} soils that are found at the present day surface. Soil-sediment sequences {{in the southern part of}} the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil were investigated by micromorphology and mineralogy in order to understand the genesis of the soils. Erosion (profile thinning), weathering, biological activity, clay accumulation and iron translocation are the main soil forming processes imprinted in the various pedosedimentary layers. Strong weathering is shown by dissolution of quartz and weathering of ilmenite. Bioturbation is ubiquitous even in older and deeper buried layers. Clay accumulation is observed as illuviation and precipitation features which were micromorphologically differentiated. Accumulation and movement of iron are represented by gley and pseudogley features, related to groundwater and surface-water saturation processes. These features and the layering of sediments and soils play key roles in understanding the evolutionary phases undergone by the soils and sediments. As main soil formation episodes, the graben fillings show two phases of clay formation and illuviation, separated by a phase of ferralitization, interrupted by various episodes of erosion.

Those plots, however, do not comprise the whole diversity of forest types in the Amazon. The complex effects of soil, climate and hydrology on the productivity of seasonally waterlogged interfluvial wetland forests are still poorly understood. The presented study is the first field-based estimate for tree ages and wood biomass productivity in the vast interfluvial region between the Purus and Madeira rivers. We estimate stand age and wood biomass productivity by a combination of tree-ring data and allometric equations for biomass stocks of eight plots distributed along 600 km in the Purus-Madeira interfluvial area that is crossed by the BR- 319 highway. We relate stand age and wood biomass productivity to hydrological and edaphic conditions. Mean productivity and stand age were 5. 6 ± 1. 1 Mg ha − 1 yr − 1 and 102 ± 18 yr, respectively. There is a strong relationship between tree age and diameter, as well as between mean diameter increment and mean wood density within a plot. Regarding the soil hydromorphic properties we find a positive correlation with wood biomass productivity and a negative relationship with stand age. Productivity also shows a positive correlation with the superficial phosphorus concentration. In addition, superficial phosphorus concentration increases with enhanced soil hydromorphic condition. We raise three hypotheses to explain these results: (1) the reduction of iron molecules on the saturated soils with <b>plinthite</b> layers close to the surface releases available phosphorous for the plants; (2) the poor structure of the saturated soils creates an environmental filter selecting tree species of faster growth rates and shorter life spans and (3) plant growth on saturated soil is favored during the dry season, since there should be low restrictions for soil water availability...|$|E

The set of evidence shows that the studied transect originated from Pleistocene sediments due to the activity of the São Lourenço fluvial fan. The following soil-landform element relationships developed: Quartzipsamments in the paleo-channel; Plinthaquults in the paleo-levee and paleo-floodplain and; Natrustalfs in the mound. Evidences of pedogenic processes in the transect are: a) clay eluviation and illuviation, resulting in formation of the Bt horizon in the soils at the lower part of the transect and mound; b) gleization and plinthization, mainly at the lower part of the transect, resulting in formation of mottles, reduced soil matrix, and nodules (<b>plinthite</b> and petroplinthite); c) bioturbation, responsible for addition of materials at the soil surface, assisting in the formation/maintenance of the mound; and d) the sodium concentration, observed in soils that have higher clay contents, which are highest in the mound has the highest levels. 201...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Nine Gray Podzolic soils from {{different}} physiographic regions of Thailand were studied {{to determine their}} characteristics and genesis {{in relation to their}} parent materials, land form, pedogenic environment, classification and management. The clay was characterized by X-ray diffraction and standard chemical and physical analyses were performed. Mineralogy of the light ana heavy minerals from the fine sand to coarse silt fractions was determined by randomized grain counts. Micromorphological study was made of thin sections from selected horizons in each profile. Field and laboratory study showed that Gray Podzolic soils formed under distinctly different climatic zones and vegetation have quite similar characteristics. They occupy similar low terraces with nearly level topography and are associated closely with Low Humic Gley soils. Parent materials and topography are the two most important factors influencing the genesis of these soils. Mineral assemblages in the profiles indicate the parent materials were preweathered sediments from acidic rocks. They are quartz rich, with very few if any weatherable minerals, ubiquitous heavy minerals and with dominantly kaolinitic clay. The few lower stability minerals found in several profiles can be traced to some rocks rich in those minerals in the catchment areas. Climatic variations between the soils are not consistent with the weathering stages found and differences in soil age are not enough to account for mineralogical variation through differential in situ, weathering. Therefore, differences in composition and preweathering of parent materials most logically account for the presence of minor amounts of relatively unweathered feldspar and hornblende in some of these soils. Soil development has resulted in a loosely bound, clay poor, s-matrix with low degree of orientation in the upper horizons, and illuvial B horizons with more oriented plasma, illuviated cutans and vughs in {{the lower part of the}} profiles. Pedoplasmation activity by termites and other soil dwellers is partially responsible for the high porosity and mixing of the soil materials and, possibly, for the addition of lime. <b>Plinthite</b> formation in the lower part of some profiles relates directly to iron mobility and accumulation associated with fluctuations of the water table. Cation exchange capacities of the soils were low and the base saturation was generally less than 20...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Two sites were established in Harris County, Texas, to relate seasonal saturation to soil morphology, micromorphology, soil reduction potential (Eh), and iron phases; and to test a,a'-dipyridyl dye for field identification of iron-reduction. The Wockley soil is a Plinthic Paleudalf and the Katy soil is an Aquic Paleudalf. Both soils have shallow fine sandy loam surface soils, and clay loam subsoils, overlying buried clayey soils. Field evidence of saturation consisted of low-chroma soil colors, mottling, and iron and manganese segregations. Ironstone nodules are plentiful in upper Bt horizons of the Wockley soil, and <b>plinthite</b> occurs. The Katy soil has distinct sand-silt coats on ped faces of Btg horizons. Micromorphology shows iron being actively reduced in the upper profiles of both soils, through destruction of nodules, the presence of cuffent pore and void linings; and some fine soft agglomerations in the Katy soil. Some iron nodules are not being reduced, having sharp boundaries to the matrix, or clay coatings or plugs covering the nodules. Active and inactive features can occur in the same horizons. Pore and void linings were the most indicative field characteristics of saturation in the Wockley soil, while the sand-silt coats on ped faces were convincing evidence of saturation and reduction in the Katy soil. Micromorphology showed that field evidence in these soils must be interpreted cautiously. The incidence of high rainfalls over the study period exceeded the expected probabilities, implying that rare high rainfall events or sequences of events promote saturation and reduction, but continuing high rainfalls suggest that climatic probabilities need to be more thoroughly documented. Manganese was reduced when soils were at or above field capacity. Iron reduction could not be checked when the Wockley soil was saturated. The E horizon of the Katy soil seems prone to reduction of iron when water tables are present. Poorly crystalline free iron was very low in both soils. Highly crystalline free iron was more prevalent in high-chroma segments of the soils. The cl,a'-dipyridyl dye could not be fully tested; however it did not give false positive readings...|$|E

Em Cerrado, zona de ecótono com o Pantanal (1543 S; 5604 W), o solo é constituído por características inerentes tanto ao solo de Cerrado do Planalto Central como da Planície do Pantanal. Diante da variabilidade de características edáficas e da pluviosidade, a hipótese é que o crescimento clonal apresente-se como o parâmetro demográfico que mais contribua para a taxa de crescimento populacional (&# 61548;) de cinco espécies lenhosas nesta zona de ecótono. O estudo foi realizado em cinco remanescentes de Cerrado. Identificou-se quatro classes de solo, sendo que três destas Plintossolo Pétrico Litoplíntico típico, Latossolo Amarelo distrófico típico e Latossolo Amarelo distrófico com plintita ainda não haviam sido descritas para a região em estudo. Saturação por alumínio, magnésio, cálcio, pH e manganês explicaram 38, 7 % da variabilidade de solos. Houve heterogeneidade na distribuição espacial dos atributos edáficos. Tais atributos diferiram entre os remanescentes e entre solos de Cerrado do Planalto e da Planície do Pantanal. A dinâmica populacional de Curatella americana, espécie dominante e de ampla distribuição geográfica, foi avaliada em Plintossolo Pétrico (FF) e em Latossolo Amarelo (LAd), nas estações seca e chuvosa. A reprodução sexuada e o crescimento de plântulas foram maiores em FF, enquanto o crescimento clonal foi maior em LAd. A taxa de sobrevivência de adultos exerceu maior efeito sobre &# 61548;&# 61472;para as duas classes de solo e estações seca e chuvosa. A interação entre classe de solo e pluviosidade exerceu maior efeito sobre &# 61548;&# 61486;&# 61472;&# 61472;Também foi avaliada a dinâmica das populações de Bowdichia virgilioides e Roupala montana, Curatella americana e Caryocar brasiliense, para determinar quais parâmetros demográficos caracterizam espécies lenhosas clonais com diferentes tamanhos populacionais. A taxa de reprodução sexuada e a densidade de todos os estádios foram menores, enquanto o crescimento clonal foi maior para pequenas populações de espécies lenhosas. Pequenas populações foram mais suscetíveis às variações de solo e de pluviosidade. As taxas que mais contribuíram para &# 61548;&# 61472;de B. virgilioides e R. montana em LAd e em FF foram a sobrevivência de rametas jovens; na estação seca foi a sobrevivência de rametas jovens e de imaturos para as respectivas espécies e na estação chuvosa foi a sobrevivência de adultos para ambas as espécies. Para C. americana e C. brasiliense, a sobrevivência de adultos foi o parâmetro que mais contribuiu para &# 61548;&# 61472;independente da classe de solo e da estação do ano. O estudo comprovou a heterogeneidade da camada superficial do solo e das classes de solo que constituem esta área. Solos de características contrastantes exercem importante efeito sobre a dinâmica de espécies lenhosas clonais. A sobrevivência de indivíduos jovens e de imaturos, provenientes do crescimento clonal, foi a taxa que mais contribuiu para &# 61548;&# 61472;de populações pequenas de lenhosas clonais B. virgilioides e R. montana - ao passo que a sobrevivência de adultos contribuiu para &# 61548;&# 61472;de populações grandes C. americana e C. brasiliense. The aims of {{this thesis}} were: {{to investigate the}} heterogeneity of soils and to evaluate the contribution of clonal growth to the population dynamics of woody species under contrasting soil conditions. In the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone (1543 S; 5604 W), the soil possesses typical features from both the soil of Cerrado in the Central Plateau and the soil of the Pantanal Plain. Given the variability of soil and pluviosity, our hypothesis is that clonal growth is the demographic parameter that most contributes to the population growth rate (&# 61548;) of five woody species in this ecotone area. This study {{was carried out in}} five Cerrado areas. We identified four soil categories; three of them typic Litoplinthic Petric Plintosol, typic Dystrophic Yellow Latosol and Dystrophic Yellow Latosol with <b>plinthite</b> had not yet been described for the study site. The chemical attributes aluminum saturation, magnesium, calcium, pH and manganese explained 38. 7 % of the variability of the soils in the study sites. The spatial distribution of the edaphic attributes was heterogeneous. These attributes differed between the soils in the CerradoPantanal ecotone and the soils of Cerrado in the Central Plateau and of the Pantanal Plain. The population dynamics of Curatella americana, a dominant species with wide geographical distribution, was evaluated in Petric Plintosol (P) and in Yellow Latosol (L), in the dry and rainy seasons. Sexual reproduction and seedling growth were higher in P, whereas clonal growth was higher in L. The population growth rate (&# 955;) was higher in P. The adult survival rate exerted the strongest effect on &# 955; for the two soil categories and the dry and rainy seasons. The interaction between soil category and pluviosity exerted the strongest effect on &# 955;. We also analyzed the dynamics of species with small populations (Bowdichia virgilioides and Roupala montana) and large populations (Curatella americana and Caryocar brasiliense), to determine which demographic parameters characterize woody clonal species with different sizes. For the species with small populations, the rate of sexual reproduction and the density of all life stages were smaller, whereas the clonal growth was higher. Small populations were more susceptible to variations in soil and pluviosity. The rates that most contributed to the &# 955; of Bowdichia virgilioides and Roupala montana in L and P were: respectively, the survival of young ramets and immatures, in the dry season; and for both species, the survival of adults, in the rainy season. For C. americana and C. brasiliense, the survival of adults was the parameter that most contributed to &# 955;, independently of soil category and season. The study indicated an heterogeneity of the superficial layer of the soil and of the soil categories that occur in this area. Soils with contrasting attributes exerted an important effect on the dynamics of woody clonal species. The survival of young and immature individuals, originated from clonal growth, was the rate that most contributed to the &# 955; of the small-sized populations of woody clonal species B. virgilioides and R. montana, whereas the survival of adults was the rate that most contributed to the &# 955; of the large-sized populations C. americana and C. brasiliense...|$|E
