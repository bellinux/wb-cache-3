5|$|Butterflies of the Parnassinae (family <b>Papilionidae)</b> {{and some}} Acraeini (family Nymphalidae) add a post-copulatory plug, called the sphragis, to the abdomen {{of the female}} after {{copulation}} preventing her from mating again.|$|E
5|$|Radius (R2-R5) – radius divides into {{branches}} {{beyond the}} middle of the wing up to five branches in <b>Papilionidae.</b> On forewing, the last R is stalked in all butterflies except Hesperiidae is separated.|$|E
5|$|Some caterpillars, {{especially}} {{members of}} <b>Papilionidae,</b> contain an osmeterium, a Y-shaped protrusible gland {{found in the}} prothoracic segment of the larvae. When threatened, the caterpillar emits unpleasant smells from the organ {{to ward off the}} predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{caterpillars}} of many butterflies attach {{themselves by}} a button of silk to {{the underside of}} a branch or stone or other projecting surface. They remain attached to the silk pad by a hook-like process called a cremaster. Most chrysalids hang head downward, but in the families <b>Papilionidae,</b> Pieridae, and Lycaenidae, the chrysalis is held in a more upright position by a silk girdle around {{the middle of the}} chrysalis.|$|E
5|$|From Boston, Edwards {{moved to}} New York {{to stay for}} some ten years, {{performing}} on stage and participating in insect studies. He {{was active in the}} Brooklyn and New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled Papilio, named for the genus Papilio in the swallowtail butterfly family, <b>Papilionidae.</b> Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia. Papilio was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into the more general Entomologia Americana, published by the Brooklyn Entomological Society.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the <b>Papilionidae).</b>|$|E

25|$|Lamproptera curius, {{the white}} dragontail, is {{a species of}} {{swallowtail}} butterfly native to parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the dragontails genus, Lamproptera, of the swallowtail (<b>Papilionidae)</b> family. It is not rare.|$|E
25|$|The Pieridae {{have the}} radial vein on the forewing {{with three or}} four {{branches}} and rarely with five branches. The forelegs are well developed in both sexes, unlike in the Nymphalidae, and the tarsal claws are , unlike in the <b>Papilionidae.</b>|$|E
25|$|Swallowtail {{butterflies}} are large, colorful butterflies in {{the family}} <b>Papilionidae,</b> and include over 550 species.

25|$|Losaria coon, {{the common}} clubtail, is a {{butterfly}} {{belonging to the}} swallowtail (<b>Papilionidae)</b> family. The butterfly belongs to the clubtail genus, Losaria.

25|$|The {{first three}} instars of the {{caterpillar}} are bird dropping mimics, coloration that helps {{protect it from}} predators. In later instars, the eyespots on the thorax serve to deter birds. Like {{all members of the}} family <b>Papilionidae,</b> the caterpillar of P. glaucus possesses an osmeterium, an orange, fleshy organ that emits foul-smelling terpenes to repel predators. Normally hidden, the osmeterium is located on the first segment of the thorax, and can be everted when the caterpillar feels threatened. The combination of eyespots and osmeterium makes the caterpillar resemble a snake.|$|E
25|$|Of the 178 {{recorded}} {{species of}} birds, 10 are endemic to Buru and nearby islands: Buru racket-tail (Prioniturus mada), black-lored parrot (Tanygnathus gramineus), blue-fronted lorikeet (Charmosyna toxopei), Buru honeyeater (Lichmera deningeri), Buru cuckooshrike (Coracina fortis), streaky-breasted jungle-flycatcher (Rhinomyias addita), madanga (Madanga ruficollis), Buru white-eye (Zosterops buruensis), tawny-backed fantail (Rhipidura superflua) and black-tipped monarch (Monarcha loricatus). Among those, the rufous-throated white-eye {{is regarded as}} endangered and the black-lored parrot and vulnerable (threatened) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; both species were observed only in very limited areas of Buru island. There are another 19 birds that are near-endemic to Buru: rufous-necked sparrowhawk (Accipiter erythrauchen), dusky megapode (Megapodius forstenii), Moluccan megapode (Megapodius wallacei), white-eyed imperial pigeon (Ducula perspicillata), long-tailed mountain pigeon (Gymnophaps mada), red lory (Eos bornea), Moluccan hawk-owl (Ninox squamipila), Moluccan masked owl (Tyto sororcula), Wakolo myzomela (Myzomela wakoloensis), black-faced friarbird (Philemon moluccensis), drab whistler (Pachycephala griseonota), white-naped monarch (Monarcha pileatus), dark-grey flycatcher (Myiagra galeata), black-eared oriole (Oriolus bouroensis), pale cicadabird (Coracina ceramensis), Buru thrush (Zoothera dumasi), cinnamon-chested flycatcher (Ficedula buruensis), chestnut-backed bush-warbler (Bradypterus castaneus) and flame-breasted flowerpecker (Dicaeum erythrothorax). Among butterflies, 25% of the Pieridae and 7% of the <b>Papilionidae</b> found on Buru are endemic to the island.|$|E

500|$|Forelegs in the Papilionoidea exhibit {{reduction}} of various forms: the butterfly family Nymphalidae, or [...] "brush-footed butterflies" [...] {{as they are}} commonly known, have only the rear two pairs of legs fully functional with the forward pair strongly reduced and not capable of walking or perching. In the Lycaenidae, the tarsus is unsegmented, as the tarsomeres are fused, and, tarsal claws are absent. The aroliar pad ( [...] a pad projecting between the tarsal claws of some insects) and pulvilli (singular: pulvillus, a pad or lobe beneath each tarsal claw) are reduced or absent in the <b>Papilionidae.</b> The tarsal claws are also absent in the Riodinidae.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Hy. Edw." [...] {{designation}} appended to some butterfly species names indicates first description by Henry Edwards. This {{is not to}} {{be confused}} with the [...] "Edw." [...] designation which stands for William Henry Edwards, an unrelated contemporary and correspondent of Edwards'. At least two specimens were designated [...] "Mrs. Hy. Edwards." [...] because they were collected and identified by his wife. Edwards named many butterflies in the families Theclinae, Nymphalidae, <b>Papilionidae</b> and Lycaenidae, but his largest contribution was in the description of moth species in North America including Mexico: Arctiidae, Bombycidae, Hepialidae, Sesiidae, Noctuidae, Sphingidae, Lasiocampidae, Dalceridae, Dysderidae, Geometridae, Pyralidae, Saturniidae, Thyatiridae, Urodidae and Zygaenidae. In choosing names, Edwards favored female characters from the plays of William Shakespeare, such as Ophelia from Hamlet, Hermia from A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Desdemona from Othello. For example, Edwards collected, classified and named the moth species Catocala ophelia and Catocala hermia in 1880, and Catocala desdemona in 1882.|$|E
