40|$|As the {{efficiency}} of silicon solar cells increases continuously, recombination at the metal contacts {{becomes more and more}} limiting, unless the contacts are <b>passivated.</b> <b>Passivating</b> contact layers on the front side, however, usually lead to parasitic absorption. To prevent this we develop a new self-aligned deposition process to implement a <b>passivating</b> layer only under the metal contacts. As <b>passivating</b> layer for the contacts on an optically highly transparent boron emitter we use PEDOT:PSS, which can be electro-polymerized at an anodic surface in an aqueous electrolyte.
