For commercially available porous glasses, the terms porous VYCOR-Glass (PVG) and Controlled Pore Glass (CPG) are used. The pore structure is formed by a syndetic channel system and has a specific surface from 10 to 300 m²/g. Porous glasses can be generated by an acidic extraction of <b>phase</b> <b>separated</b> alkaliborosilica glasses, or by a sol-gel-process. By regulating the manufacturing parameters, {{it is possible to}} produce a porous glass with a pore size of between 0.4 and 1000 nm in a very narrow pore size distribution.

The resulting solution is evaporated to give a mixture of ferulic acid moieties that can be separated by column chromatography. Identification is often by high performance liquid chromatography with a UV detector or by LC-MS. Alternatively they can be derivatised to make them volatile and therefore suitable for GC-MS.

50|$|Block or graft {{copolymers}} {{are commonly}} used as compatibilizing agents. The copolymer used is made of the two components in the immiscible blend. The respective portions of the copolymer are able {{to interact with the}} two phases of the blend to make the phase morphology more stable. The increased stability is caused by reducing the size of the phase-separated particles in the blend. The size reduction comes from the lower interfacial tension, due to accumulating block copolymers at the many interfaces between the two copolymers. This helps the immiscible blends break up into smaller particles in the melt phase. In turn, these <b>phase</b> <b>separated</b> particles will not be as inclined to consolidate and grow because the interfacial tension is now much lower. This stabilizes the polymer blend to a usable product. An example of this are Ethylene/propylene copolymers. They are able to act as good compatibilizing agents for blends of polypropylene and low density polyethylene. In this specific application, longer ethylene sequences are preferred in the copolymer. This is because cocrystallization also factors into this case, and the longer ethylene sequences will retain some residual crystallinity.|$|E
50|$|In a zero {{magnetic}} field, {{there are}} two distinct superfluid phases of 3He, the A-phase and the B-phase. The B-phase is the low-temperature, low-pressure phase which has an isotropic energy gap. The A-phase is the higher temperature, higher pressure phase that is further stabilized by a magnetic field and has two point nodes in its gap. The presence of two phases is a clear indication that 3He is an unconventional superfluid (superconductor), since the presence of two phases requires an additional symmetry, other than gauge symmetry, to be broken. In fact, it is a p-wave superfluid, with spin one, S=1, and angular momentum one, L=1. The ground state corresponds to total angular momentum zero, J=S+L=0 (vector addition). Excited states are possible with non-zero total angular momentum, J>0, which are excited pair collective modes. Because of the extreme purity of superfluid 3He (since all materials except 4He have solidified andsunk {{to the bottom of}} the liquid 3He and any 4He has <b>phase</b> <b>separated</b> entirely, this is the most pure condensed matter state), these collective modes have been studied with much greater precision than in any other unconventional pairing system.|$|E

The discrete model is formulated by following a discretization procedure given by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method within the thermodynamically consistent general equation for the nonequilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling (GENERIC) framework. Each fluid particle carries information on the mass, momentum, energy, and the mass fraction of the different components. The discrete model allows one to simulate nonisothermal dynamic evolution of <b>phase</b> <b>separating</b> fluids with surface tension effects while respecting {{the first and second}} laws of thermodynamics exactly...|$|R

We show that a fluid <b>phase</b> <b>separated</b> (FPS) state is formed at intermediate temperatures similar to the strain-liquid state in bulk compounds, which can be converted to a metallic state by applying an external electric field. In contrast to bulk compounds, at low temperatures a strain stabilized ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) state is formed in the $y$ = 0. 4 and 0. 5 samples.

40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} are increasingly important, both in {{portable electronic devices}} and as grid stabilization for intermittent renewable sources. The varied applications involve varying requirements for safety, lifetime, and energy/power density. The broad requirement space leads to a large design space, requiring either extensive and costly experimentation or effective models. To be predictive enough to facilitate design, models {{must be based on}} underlying physics. However, battery models commonly make assumptions known to be false, such as describing <b>phase</b> <b>separating</b> materials with Fickian diffusion. In this thesis, we build on existing battery models by modifying key parts to better capture fundamental phenomena including transport and reactions in <b>phase</b> <b>separating</b> materials. First, we introduce a model of lithium transport and surface reactions within particles of graphite, which has phase separation and is the most common anode material in lithium-ion batteries. We demonstrate key features of the model, including a sensitivity to its electrochemical reaction kinetics as well as its ability to capture both single particle and porous electrode experimental data. Second, we connect a model of electrochemical kinetics that is well-established in the chemistry community to nonequilibrium thermodynamics and apply it to materials with <b>phase</b> <b>separating</b> electrodes. We demonstrate that, although it shares some characteristics with a commonly used phenomenological model, it makes distinct predictions which agree with certain experimental results. Finally, we unify these single-particle models within a volume-averaged model to describe battery behavior at the scale of full porous electrodes. The developed model and simulation software have already been applied by other researchers to help explain behavior of batteries with <b>phase</b> <b>separating</b> materials. by Raymond Barrett Smith.
