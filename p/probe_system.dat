40|$|The {{continued}} {{trends of}} product miniaturisation and increased part complexity {{have led to}} a requirement for highly accurate coordinate metrology, suitable for small parts. Coordinate metrology of such parts is performed on a micro-coordinate measurement machine (micro-CMMs), for which a specialised micro-scale <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> is required. These <b>probing</b> <b>systems</b> consist of a probe onto which a stylus is mounted. The probe provides significant flexibility allowing the stylus tip to be easily deflected during contact with a surface. Achieving an optimum stiffness for the probe represents a significant design challenge, and often leads to undesirable compromises. For example, as stylus tip size reduces the contact pressure for a given load increases, requiring the probe stiffness to be kept as low as possible to prevent damage to the part surface; however, for a more robust <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> the stiffness should be increased. This thesis presents an improved tactile micro-probing system that makes use of an active suspension structure that can be tuned to have either low or high stiffness as required for each phase of a measurement. Development of the probe includes analytical and numerical modelling for a range of solutions as well as empirical investigations into the manufacture of a smart suspension structure for a prototype <b>probing</b> <b>system.</b> Modelling results demonstrate significant stiffness reduction is possible by using the concept of adjusting the internal strain of suspension beam elements. In principle stiffness may be reduced down to zero at the point of beam buckling. It is also shown that such a <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> can provide isotropic stiffness for a range of different styli lengths. A prototype of the suspension structure was fabricated using a chemical etching process and 6. 6 mm long stylus. The stiffness of the structure was assessed by measuring the modal frequencies of the suspension structure that correspond to vertical and lateral probe motion. Using this method, results show it is possible to reduce the frequency of the vertical mode and the torsional mode by 70...|$|R

These <b>probing</b> <b>systems</b> typically comprise of a small stylus {{of only a few}} mm in length, with a spherical tip of around 100 μm in diameter or less. The stylus is mounted to a flexible suspension structure which is designed to deflect during measurement, and defines the stiffness of the <b>probing</b> <b>system.</b> Stiffness is of critical importance for optimum measurement performance, and selection of the correct stiffness involves a difficult trade-off. Stiff probes are needed to overcome surface attraction forces which are significant for the small stylus tips, while flexible probes are needed for contact with delicate parts to reduce contact stress and ensure no damage is caused. To eliminate the need for compromise a novel micro tactile <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> with active stiffness control using a novel suspension structure has been designed. This paper presents the initial fabrication and the test of the suspension structure. The stiffness of the structure is assessed by measuring the modal frequencies of the suspension structure that correspond to vertical and lateral probe motion.

5000|$|... Singaram was {{developing}} a glucose sensor based on boronic acids which {{might lead to}} an implantable diagnostic tool for continuous glucose detection for persons afflicted with diabetes mellitus. [...] Carbohydrates and their derivatives, including saccharides, phosphosugars, and nucleotides, are ubiquitous metabolites in every organism. Sensitive probes for monitoring {{the presence of these}} metabolites provide researchers a powerful tool to elucidate biological processes. Diabetics monitor glucose by testing blood four or more times a day, obtained from finger pricks or other sampling method. Glucose levels can fluctuate widely throughout the day, making it difficult to determine when it is important to test the blood. There has been no way to continuously monitor those fluctuations over long periods. Our group has extensively developed fluorescent probes for metabolites including glucose, phosphosugars, and nucleotides. We have developed a two-component optical probe with a modular receptor scaffold. This small molecule probe is water-soluble, and operates in the blue-green region of the spectrum. Saccharide recognition in our <b>probe</b> <b>system</b> is achieved with a boronic acids appended viologen that serves as an analyte responsive fluorescence quencher. We used an anionic dye which forms a weakly fluorescent complex with the cationic viologen receptor. At and near physiological pH, saccharide binding by the receptor results in a partial charge neutralization of the viologen. This produces an increase in the fluorescent signal dependent on glucose concentration. Incorporating the probe into a hydrogel polymer allowed for continuous monitoring of glucose concentrations in the physiological range in vivo. In another application, an array of probes with differential selectivity was used to discriminate important carbohydrate metabolites in water in multiwell plates.|$|E
