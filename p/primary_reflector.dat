40|$|AbstractThe {{wind effect}} on the Fresnel {{technology}} {{is one of the}} main design stresses for the metallic structure, <b>primary</b> <b>reflectors,</b> receivers and solar tracking system. Therefore,in order to quantify its impact and compare it to a more mature technology(the Parabolic Trough),a first study of the wind load on a Linear Fresnel Reflector(LFR) collector with an air-stable absorber tube receiver (with protective cover glass) has been undertaken. The drag, lift and momentum coefficients of the receiver and <b>primary</b> <b>reflectors</b> have been calculated using a bi-dimensional CFD model based on the COMSOL Multiphysics® software. The impact of the transversal wind speed has been studied. Moreover, the interaction between the receiver and the <b>primary</b> <b>reflectors</b> has been quantified. Finally, a comparison to Parabolic Trough collectors has been made, which confirms the much lower windload of LFR technology for an equal mirror aperture area, and thus the much lighter structures required for resisting these wind loads and/or the larger operation range with respect to wind speed...|$|R

Both are fixed <b>primary</b> <b>reflectors</b> {{installed}} in natural hollows, made of perforated aluminum panels with a movable receiver suspended above. And both have an effective aperture smaller than the physical size of the primary. There are, however, five significant differences in addition to the size.|$|R
25|$|The telescope's primary {{reflecting}} mirrors are {{a pair of}} Gregorian 1.4m × 1.6m dishes (facing opposite directions), {{that focus}} the signal onto a pair of 0.9m × 1.0m secondary reflecting mirrors. They are shaped for optimal performance: a carbon fibre shell upon a Korex core, thinly-coated with aluminium and silicon oxide.

50|$|Third, Arecibo {{can receive}} higher frequencies. The finite {{size of the}} {{triangular}} panels making up FAST's <b>primary</b> <b>reflector</b> limit the accuracy with which it can approximate a parabola, and thus the shortest wavelength it can focus. Arecibo's more rigid design allows it to maintain sharp focus down to 3 cm wavelength (10 GHz); FAST is limited to 10 cm (3 GHz). Improvements in position control of the secondary {{might be able to}} push that to 6 cm (5 GHz), but then the <b>primary</b> <b>reflector</b> becomes a hard limit.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>reflector</b> is a paraboloid, {{while the}} shape of the convex {{secondary}} reflector is a hyperboloid. The geometrical condition for radiating a collimated, plane wave beam is that the feed antenna is located at the far focus of the hyperboloid, while the focus of the <b>primary</b> <b>reflector</b> coincides with the near focus of the hyperboloid. [...] Usually the secondary reflector and the feed antenna are located on the central axis of the dish. However, in offset Cassegrain configurations, the primary dish reflector is asymmetric, and its focus, and the secondary reflector, are located {{to one side of the}} dish, so that the secondary reflector does not partially obstruct the beam.|$|E
50|$|Liquid mirror telescopes have {{rotating}} mirrors that {{consist of}} a liquid metal such as mercury or a low-melting alloy of gallium.

50|$|A {{secondary}} reflector is {{a structure}} with a mirrored surface placed {{directly into the}} path of the beam of light as it exits the parabolic <b>primary</b> <b>reflector</b> of the lamp.

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the Cassegrain {{is that the}} feed horn(s) must have a narrower beamwidth (higher gain) to focus its radiation on the smaller secondary reflector, instead of the wider <b>primary</b> <b>reflector</b> as in front-fed dishes. The angular width the secondary reflector subtends at the feed horn is typically 10° - 15°, as opposed to 120° - 180° the main reflector subtends in a front-fed dish.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{theoretical}} approach for {{the classification of}} multiple reflections in time-domain e. m. inverse scattering of multi-layered media is presented. The existence of multiples limits the capabilities of inversion algorithms, thus suitable identification and suppression techniques should be applied to reduce this undesired effect. Assuming a scenario composed of loss-less and non-dispersive media, and providing an accurate time delay estimation (TDE) of backscattered signals, the proposed method allows not only to evaluate the presence of multiples and discriminate them from primary reflections, but also to determine their propagation paths. Preliminary tests performed on FDTD simulated data have shown its potentialities to effectively handle multiple reflections and therefore to enhance the e. m. signals backscattered by <b>primary</b> <b>reflectors.</b> 1...|$|R
