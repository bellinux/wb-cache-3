40|$|Once the {{exclusive}} domain of teacher education, {{physical education in}} Australian tertiary institutions has during {{the last twenty years}} evolved into a series of discipline‐based fields concerned with human movement studies, leisure studies and sport science that have begun to feed new vocational opportunities in the sport, exercise and leisure industries. Concomitant with these changes in the social organization of knowledge in tertiary physical education has been a realignment of school physical education programmes, particularly in the senior school curriculum. Inevitably, the once sole focus of physical education in tertiary institutions on teacher education is now being forced to reinvent itself in light of these dynamic changes in the social organization of school and university knowledge.

Nevertheless, there is a relatively little research outlining how <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> or <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> programmes can effectively orient young people towards regular leisure-time physical activity outside of school.
