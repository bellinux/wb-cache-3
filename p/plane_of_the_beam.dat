40|$|Abstract. Micron sized, neutral, non-dielectric {{particles}} {{immersed in}} a viscous fluid can be trapped in the focal plane of a Gaussian beam. A particle can absorb energy from such a beam with a large radial intensity gradient, resulting in substantial temperature gradients and a radiometric torque which causes it to spin rapidly about an axis perpendicular to the flux of radiant energy. The particles are also observed to orbit about the optical axis. Here we investigate the fundamental physics of this system, the Radiometric Particle Trap, and discuss its force laws using gas-kinetic theory. 1.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the propagation of}} a tilted high order paraxial vortex-beam through a homogeneous anisotropic medium of a uniaxial crystal. We found that the initially circularly polarized beam bearing the l-order optical vortex splits into ordinary and extraordinary beams with a complex vortex structure. After a series of dislocation reactions the vortices gather together at the axis of the partial beam with the initial circular polarization shaping the l-order optical vortex. However, only l- 1 vortices gather together on the axis of the partial beam with the orthogonal circular polarization. One optical vortex is shifted along the direction perpendicular to the inclination <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam.</b> Such a vortex displacement induces the transverse shift of the partial beam.

30|$|Doppler {{effect and}} {{collision}} induced alignment The most straightforward {{effects in the}} images are those that originate from a mere velocity-dependent detection efficiency. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most well-known <b>of</b> these is <b>the</b> Doppler effect. Since the scattered molecules are distributed according to Newton spheres, a large range of post-collision laboratory velocities are present. Ideally, the detection laser ionizes all scattered molecules with equal efficiency, i.e., all Doppler-shifted absorption frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> REMPI transitions are excited with equal probability. This can either be achieved by choosing a laser with sufficiently large bandwidth, by choosing sufficient laser power to broaden the transitions, by continuously scanning the laser frequency over the Doppler profile, or by choosing an optimal laser propagation direction that minimizes Doppler shifts. Like in most experiments, such free choices are not available in our experiments. The laser propagation direction is fixed in <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams,</b> laser power must be chosen very low to prevent (1 + 1) REMPI transitions of NO, and spectral congestion {{in combination with the}} need to perform state-selective detection force us to use a dye laser with narrow bandwidth. In the experiments, the laser wavelength was fixed to the Doppler-free molecular absorption frequencies. This thus results in a detection bias for recoil velocities that is orthogonal to the laser propagation direction.|$|R

40|$|Orbital angular {{momentum}} {{associated with the}} helical phase-front of optical beams provides an unbounded space for both classical and quantum communications. Among the different approaches to generate and manipulate orbital {{angular momentum}} states of light, coupling between spin and orbital angular momentum allows a faster manipulation of orbital angular momentum states because it depends on manipulating the polarisation state of light, which is simpler and generally faster than manipulating conventional orbital angular momentum generators. In this work, we design and fabricate an ultra-thin spin-to-orbital angular momentum converter, based on plasmonic nano-antennas and operating in the visible wavelength range {{that is capable of}} converting spin to an arbitrary value of OAM ℓ. The nano-antennas are arranged in an array with a well-defined geometry in the transverse <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> possessing a specific integer or half-integer topological charge q.
