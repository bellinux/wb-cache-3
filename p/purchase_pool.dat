40|$|Although Wisconsin {{has one of}} {{the highest}} rates of employer-sponsored {{coverage}} in the country, small employers have been increasingly concerned about often unprecedented escalation in their health care premiums. Given these escalating costs and the inherent fragmentation among small employers, the small group market in Wisconsin and other states is increasingly characterized by administrative inefficiencies, wide variation in premium costs, and wildly-fluctuating premium increases. Policymakers often are drawn to <b>purchasing</b> <b>pools</b> as a potential means to stabilize small employer premiums through increased administrative economies of scale and purchasing clout with health plans. In addition, by aggregating a large number of small firm employees, <b>purchasing</b> <b>pools</b> can offer those employees something not normally available in the small employer market—specifically, choice of competing health plans. Such choice is typically available only to the employees of very large employers, and to state and federal employees. But to date, voluntary, unsubsidized consumer choice pools have not gained enough market share to realize lower costs for small employers. And, health plans would generally not be serving their own interests if they were to offer lower rates that would allow a start-up or smal...|$|R

30|$|Findings {{from the}} {{literature}} (Llewellyn, 1992; White, 1997; Tufano, 2003; Mishra, 2008; Sánchez, 2010; Delimatsis, 2011; Gubler, 2011; Lerner and Tufano, 2011) suggest poor characterisation of the financial innovation landscape with no overall descriptive model for how it occurred. In line with this finding, I observed a largely unstructured innovation process {{in the development of}} ATMs. Meanwhile, the CDO case showed the use of some structure comprising a process of <b>purchasing,</b> <b>pooling,</b> tranching, and selling. This suggests the use of both structured and unstructured product development processes in the creation and popularisation of innovations associated with monetary financial institutions. I observed that innovation was largely framed in both case studies as a ‘new’ product, with limited explicit framing of innovation in the position-paradigm dimensions, as presented by Tidd et al. (2005) and Tidd and Bessant (2009). Nevertheless, {{it can be argued that}} while the ATM represented a paradigm shift from established mental modes of products through automation, CDOs repositioned risk in the marketplace.|$|R
40|$|No. 96 {{requires}} that firms rescind stock repurchase plans to receive pooling {{treatment for a}} business acquisition. In this study, we document the additional opportunity cost to pooling imposed by SAB No. 96 and revisit the <b>purchase</b> vs. <b>pooling</b> question with the additional consideration. Specifically, we examine whether firms should rescind or forgo stock repurchase plans to qualify to pool or simply accept purchase accounting treatment for mergers. We begin by establishing why firms choose to pool. We find that, consistent with anecdotal evidence in the financial press, firms pool to avoid the decreased earnings caused by amortization of goodwill that is recorded in a purchase. Next, given this motivation for pooling, we examine the <b>purchase</b> vs. <b>pooling</b> decision with the additional consideration imposed by the prohibition of stock repurchases. Our results suggest that forgoing stock repurchases to pool {{may not be in}} the best interest of shareholders.

40|$|When we {{look into}} the future for {{strategies}} {{on health care and}} to finance retiree benefits, a good starting point is with the country’s most thoughtful and responsible employers, many of whom are state and local governments. Governments have assumed leadership in finding ways to contain costs and to promote healthier lifestyles. Disease management programs have helped avoid costly health care for those with chronic illnesses. Wellness programs are growing, too, especially in state governments. Although it may seem obvious that keeping people healthy can reduce health care costs, wellness programs are still relatively modest, especially in local governments. Nearly all states have created a health care pool, providing uniform benefit levels for their active workforce and for their retirees. Some states have opened these pools to city and county governments as well, allowing them to reap the financial benefits of a large <b>purchasing</b> <b>pool</b> to negotiate lower prices. Making health care accessible for routine and preventive medicine is another strategy gaining traction. On-site health clinics are expected to save $ 575, 000 a year for Maricopa County, Arizona’s 12, 500 employees and dependents. Although these programs are encouraging, state and local governments face significant challenges to addressing escalating retiree health care costs. The unfunded liabilities vary widely, as do the strategies to address them. This comprehensive report by the North Carolina State University research team o...|$|R
