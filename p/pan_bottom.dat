40|$|The main {{advantage}} of induction cooking is the pan heating without thermal inertia. However to obtain best efficiency, {{it is essential}} to have an inductor geometry that gives a homogeneous temperature on the <b>pan</b> <b>bottom.</b> In this paper, we will first model the magneto thermal phenomena of the system by a finite element method (FEM) {{in order to determine the}} distribution of temperature on the <b>pan</b> <b>bottom</b> taking into consideration the nonlinearity of the system. This study shows that the temperature is not homogeneously distributed. Then, in the aim to have homogeneous temperature distribution in the <b>pan</b> <b>bottom,</b> we propose an inductor structure with four throats containing the coils and we will use Neural Networks to determine the optimal throats distribution and their dimensions. The optimized structure permits us to achieve our goal. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As for the {{phenomenon}} of the bottom thermal inward convex distortion of the Composite <b>Bottom</b> <b>Pan</b> (CBP) on the condition of heating, the mechanism of the bottom distortion was researched on the basis of ANSYS 10. 0 considering the structural characteristic and the heating conditions of the composite <b>bottom</b> <b>pan.</b> The results showed that the thicker the bottom of the composite <b>bottom</b> <b>pan,</b> the smaller its thermal deformation amount. The thicker the junction of the pot and wall was, the smaller its deformation. And it was helpful for reduction of deformation to use a big rounded transition. The increase of rings number of magnetic conductive sheet would lead to a less bottom thermal inward convex distortion of the CBP. The larger the area of the additional stainless steel sheet (or ring), the smaller the deformation amount. Consequently, the research laid a solid theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of the structure of composite <b>bottom</b> <b>pan...</b>|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{reported}} for the bulk motion induced in a bed of granular matter contained in a cylindrical pan with a flat bottom subjected to simultaneous vertical and horizontal vibrations. The motion in space of the moving pan is quantified. A number of distinct bulk dynamical modes are observed in which the particle bed adopts different shapes and motions. At the lowest pan excitation frequency ω, the bed forms a "heap," and rotates about the cylinder axis. As ω is increased, a more complex "toroidal" mode appears in which the bed takes {{the shape of a}} torus; in this mode, circulation occurs both about the cylinder axis, and also radially, with particles moving from {{the outer edge of the}} pan to the centre on the top surface of the bed, and back to the outer edge along the <b>pan</b> <b>bottom.</b> At the highest ω, surface modulations ("surface waves" and "sectors") of the toroidal mode occur. The origin of this family of behavior in terms of the pan motion is discussed. Comment: 11 pages, 16 figure...|$|E
50|$|The Opti-Clean system {{optimize}} the strike and the throwing angles {{of each of}} the main components in CR9000 Elevation models. The grain pan is not coupled with the pre-sieve and top sieve so that each element can operate as its optimum efficiency. The cascade distance between the grain pan and the pre-sieve is increased for greater capacity, while a long sieve stroke and a steep throwing angle keep more material airborne, for even a higher cleaning efficiency. The opposing motion of the grain <b>pan</b> and <b>bottom</b> sieve to the pre-sieve reduces overall machine vibrations and increases operator comfort.|$|R

5000|$|The {{advance of}} {{technology}} has made {{part of the}} story opaque to the modern reader. [...] "On Sunday we jellygraph it", writes Wodehouse without explanation. Jellygraph was a method of making a limited number of copies, about 20 to 80, from a master copy written with a special type of pencil containing jellygraph pigment. These special pencils are referred to in the story: [...] "How many jelly machine things can you raise?" [...] The master copy—on paper—was placed face down in a <b>pan</b> whose <b>bottom</b> was covered in a special gelatin, to which the pigment was transferred as a mirror image. The copies were then made one at a time by placing blank sheets of paper onto the gelatin after the master copy was removed. Although a reasonably simple, if slow, method, the copy produced had text (and figures) in a pale coloured ink that was hard to read.|$|R

30|$|Heat pump {{performance}} is dependent primarily upon outside temperature. As the temperature becomes lower, heat pump performance declines. At temperatures near to 0 ^∘C, {{there is a}} tendency for water in the air to freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. Some heat pumps employ a small heating coil to prevent water from collecting and freezing in the <b>bottom</b> <b>pan</b> of the outdoor unit, and all heat pumps can periodically reverse the direction heat is pumped to defrost the outdoor unit. Defrosting reduces the overall system performance, especially within about 5 ^∘C of 0 ^∘C [58]. Specific ASHPs monitored in Alaska were found to both exceed, and fail to meet, manufacturer specifications, depending upon circumstance and performance of the particular heat pump [61].|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} the failure of the collaboration, Norbert Rillieux {{remained}} focused on improving the sugar refining process, developing his machine between 1834 and 1843, when he patented it. The multiple-effect evaporation system that he invented addressed both the spillage that resulted from transfer and the uneven application of heat, as well as making the process safer for workers. The system utilizes a vacuum chamber or a container with reduced air to lower the boiling point of the liquids. Inside this several pans are stacked to contain the sugarcane juice. As the <b>bottom</b> <b>pans</b> heat, they release steam to transfer heat to the pans above. The heat is more easily controlled than in the Jamaican Train method, because one source is needed, at a lower temperature, for multiple pans of sugarcane juice. This prevents the sugar from being burned and discolored. As the workers do not have to transfer the liquid, sugarcane is not spilled, and they are at a reduced risk for burns.|$|R
5000|$|The wok's most {{distinguishing}} feature is its shape. Classic woks have a rounded bottom. [...] Hand-hammered woks are sometimes flipped inside out after being shaped, giving the wok a gentle flare {{to the edge}} {{that makes it easier}} to push food up onto the sides of the wok. Woks sold in western countries are sometimes found with flat bottoms—this makes them more similar to a deep frying <b>pan.</b> The flat <b>bottom</b> allows the wok to be used on an electric stove, where a rounded wok {{would not be able to}} fully contact the stove's heating element. A round bottom wok enables the traditional round spatula or ladle to pick all the food up at the bottom of the wok and toss it around easily; this is difficult with a flat bottom. With a gas hob, or traditional pit stove, the bottom of a round wok can get hotter than a flat wok and so is better for stir frying.|$|R
40|$|Smoke spread {{tests were}} carried out in a two-plane compartment. The size of each plane was 5. 6 x 5. 6 x 3. 0 m high. The fuel was {{kerosene}} burnt in square steel <b>pans</b> in the <b>bottom</b> plane. The parameters varied were the fire size, ceiling vent and the open-ing between the planes. Experimental data measured were the smoke-free height, temperature, mass flow, optical density and the oxygen concentration. Calculated data by zone and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were compared with the measured data from some test runs. 1. Background In multi-level buildings, composed {{of two or more}} planes, there are in many cases hori-zontal openings between the planes. Such buildings are, for example, atriums and shopping malls but also garages, basements, hydro-electric stations and other under-ground facilities.

If a fire occurs at the bottom of such a building the smoke and hot gases spread upward through the planes and fill the building wit...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} the ME content of TMR samples for lactating dairy cows based on 24 h gas production (GP) measured in two TMR fractions obtained by sieving that were considered proxy representations of their forage and concentrate contents. Samples of TMR for lactating cows, collected at 15 Italian dairy farms, were dried and fractionated using an apparatus composed of four sieves (mesh diam. of 6. 00, 2. 36, 1. 18, 0. 60 mm) and a <b>bottom</b> <b>pan.</b> The particles retained by the 6. 00, 2. 36 and 1. 18 mm sieves were bulked to create a fraction named “Long” (L), while particles retained by the 0. 60 mm sieve and the <b>bottom</b> <b>pan</b> created a fraction named “Fine”(F). Samples of whole TMR and of F and L fractions were fermented in rumen fluid (220 mg of dried sample into graduated 100 ml glass syringes with 30 ml of diluted rumen fluid) to measure GP at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation, and GP at 24 h was used in multiple equations to predict the ME content. The L fraction was {{the main part of}} the TMR (633 ± 61. 7 g/kg DM) and contained more aNDFom (391 vs 185 g/kg DM; P < 0. 01), less starch (213 vs 394 g/kg DM; P < 0. 01) and less CP (132 vs 181 g/kg DM; P < 0. 01) than the F fraction. The 24 h GP measured on the F fraction was 17 % higher (P < 0. 01) than in the L fraction lending to a 25 % increase in the predicted ME content of the F fraction (12. 1 vs 9. 7 MJ/kg DM, P < 0. 01). When the GP of the two fractions were summed on the basis of their relative weights in each TMR to obtain a calculated GP of the whole TMR, this did not differ from that directly measured on the original TMR sample. The ME values of the TMR had substantial variability among samples and the highest ME values measured for the F and L fractions were 13. 23 and 10. 82 MJ/kg DM, respectively. The inclusion of these F and L fraction values in TMR samples that had the lowest ME concentrations (e. g. 10. 0 – 10. 4 MJ/kg DM), as an hypothetical consequence of an improvement in nutritive quality of the dietary feed components, resulted in a calculated ME increment of about 0. 5 – 0. 6 and 0. 8 – 1. 0 MJ/kg DM, respectively. These simulations suggest appreciable ME variations in cases of substituting nutritionally extreme forages and/or concentrates with corresponding feeds of different nutritive quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to describe the feed sorting, feeding behavior, and feed intake of cows consuming a close-up ration and to determine if these behaviors are affected by competition {{for access to the}} feed bunk. Thirty-six dry Holstein cows, consuming a close-up total mixed ration diet, were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: 1) noncompetitive (1 cow/feed bin) or 2) competitive (2 cows/feed bin). Dry matter intake, feed-ing behavior, and sorting behavior were monitored for each feed bin on 4 separate days during wk 2 and 3 before the anticipated calving dates of the cows. Fresh feed and orts were sampled daily from each bin and were subjected to particle size analysis. The particle size separator consisted of 3 screens (18, 9, and 1. 18 mm) and a <b>bottom</b> <b>pan</b> resulting in 4 fractions (long, medium, short, and fine). Sorting was calculated as the actual intake of each particle size fraction expressed {{as a percentage of the}} predicted intake of that fraction. Regardless of treatment, the cows sorted against long particles and for short and fine particles. Competition at the feed bunk had no effect on the sorting behavior, dry matter intake, or feeding time of the cows, but did dramatically increase the feeding rate of the cows. The competitively fed cows also had fewer meals per day, and tended to have larger and longermeals. Our results suggest that increased competition at the feed bunk promotes feeding behavior patterns that will likely in-crease the between-cow variation in composition of total mixed ration consumed. Key words: competition, sorting, dry co...|$|R

The stream rapidly narrowed, and its aspect became wilder. Dead trees, anchored by the bole-base, cumbered the bed, and dykes and bars of slate, overlaid by shales of recent date, projected from either side. The land {{showed no sign of}} hills, but the banks were steep at this season, in places here and there based on ruddy sand and exposing strips of rude conglomerate, the cascalho of the Brazil. This pudding is composed of waterworn pebbles, bedded in a dark clayey soil which crumbles under the touch.

It is a wretched split heap of huts on the left bank, one patch higher pitched than the other, to avoid the floods; the tenements are mere cages, the bush lying close to the walls, and supplies are unprocurable. In fact, the further we go the worse we fare as regards mere lodgings; yet the site of our present halt is a high bank of yellow clay, which suggests better things. There is no reason why this miserable hole should not be made the river-depôt.|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} production system, Verti-GroTM, is {{an excellent}} system to grow many herbs and specialty leafy green vegetables. The system uses a tower of interlocking stackable pots. The styrofoam pots have drainage holes and are filled with soilless media. Standard hydroponic nutrient solutions and irrigation systems are used. Each tower is supplied with emitters in the top pot and additional emitters half-way down the tower, if needed. Nutrient solution is collected in a drainage <b>pan</b> under the <b>bottom</b> pot. This solution can be recirculated, but in this trial the excess nutrient solution was not recirculated. Six soilless media and media combinations were used in this trial. One tower each was filled {{with one of the}} various media treatments (Table 1). Basil, cultivar ‘Genovese compact’, was planted to each tower on August 17, 1998. Each tower had eight pots and four plants were planted in each pot resulting in 32 plants per tower. All towers were fertigated on the same schedule with several fertigations per day depending on crop demand. Irrigation scheduling was set to assure leaching after each irrigation. Leaching rates were generally 10 - 25 %. Irrigation events ranged from 2 to 6 times daily as growth increased. The University of Florida hydroponic fertilizer recommendations for tomato (Hochmuth, 1990) was used for the basil crop as a guideline. A nitrogen level of 150 - 160 ppm N was adequate for excellent growth. The only change made from the published tomato recommendation was an increase in magnesium from 40 to 80 ppm Mg to eliminate magnesium deficiency symptoms seen early in the cropping season. Basil was harvested from each tower eight times fro...|$|R
