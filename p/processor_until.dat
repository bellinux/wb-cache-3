30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a three-stage AFSP with blocking times and sequence dependent setup times. To make {{this type of}} assembly flowshop more realistic our research added the blocking times limitation (buffer[*]=[*] 0) to the model presented in [5]. Sequence-dependent setup time says that setup time of a job in position i on machine j depends on the current job and the previous job on this machine. Once its processing is completed on a processor in {{the first or second}} stage, a product is transferred directly to either an available processor in the next stage (or another downstream stage depending on the product processing route), or a buffer ahead of that stage when such an intermediate buffer is available. However, when an intermediate buffer is unavailable, the product remains blocking the <b>processor</b> <b>until</b> a downstream processor becomes available [6]. In general, blocking scheduling problems arise in modern manufacturing environments with limited intermediate buffers between processors, such as just-in-time production systems or flexible assembly lines, and those without intermediate buffers, such as surface mount technology (SMT) lines in the electronics industry for assembling printed circuit boards, which includes three different stages in the following sequence: solder printing, component placement and solder reflow [7].|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of a distributed system which is subject to hardware failures and subsequent repairs. A special type of scheduling called gang scheduling is considered, under which jobs consist of a number of interacting tasks which are scheduled to run simultaneously on distinct processors. The distribution for the number of parallel tasks per job varies with time. Two gang scheduling policies used to schedule parallel jobs are examined in two cases: In the blocking case, a job that is blocked due to processor failure keeps all of its assigned <b>processors</b> <b>until</b> the failed <b>processor</b> is repaired. In the non-blocking case, the remaining operable processors can serve other jobs. System performance is analysed for different workload parameters. ...|$|R
