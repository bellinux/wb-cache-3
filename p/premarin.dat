5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's milk, used {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for {{extended periods of time}} without stopping to eat. The drug <b>Premarin</b> is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{specific}} dangers of conjugated equine estrogens were well understood, standard therapy was 0.625mg/day of conjugated equine estrogens (such as <b>Premarin).</b> There are, however, {{risks associated with}} conjugated equine estrogen therapy. Among the older postmenopausal women studied {{as part of the}} Women's Health Initiative (WHI), an orally administered conjugated equine estrogen supplement was found to be associated with an increased risk of dangerous blood clotting. The WHI studies used one type of estrogen supplement, a high oral dose of conjugated equine estrogens (<b>Premarin</b> alone and with medroxyprogesterone acetate as PremPro).|$|E
25|$|Coagulation {{dysfunction}} {{is not a}} {{cause of}} EIPH, and anticoagulatory agents, including carbazochrome salicylate, aspirin, <b>Premarin,</b> Amicar, and vitamin K, are not effective in reducing EIPH, {{and in some cases}} may worsen it.|$|E
25|$|Urine from {{pregnant}} women contains enough human chorionic gonadotropins for commercial extraction and purification to produce hCG medication. Pregnant mare urine {{is the source}} of estrogens, namely <b>Premarin.</b> Urine also contains antibodies, which can be used in diagnostic antibody tests for a range of pathogens, including HIV-1.|$|E
25|$|One {{portion of}} the {{parallel}} studies followed over 16,000 women {{for an average of}} 5.2 years, half of whom took placebo, while the other half took a combination of the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) and conjugated equine estrogen (<b>Premarin).</b> The combination of hormones is referred to as Prempro.|$|E
25|$|Bioidentical hormones {{were first}} used for menopausal symptom {{relief in the}} 1930s, after Canadian {{researcher}} James Collip developed a method to extract an orally active estrogen from the urine of pregnant women and marketed it as the active agent in a product called Emmenin. It was supplanted on the market when its manufacturer, Ayerst (later Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), began producing the more easily manufactured conjugated equine estrogens in 1941 under the brand name Premarin; by 1992, <b>Premarin</b> was the most widely prescribed drug in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Ethinylestradiol (EE) is a {{more potent}} {{synthetic}} analogue of estradiol that is used widely in hormonal contraceptives. Mestranol, moxestrol, and quinestrol are derivatives of EE used clinically. A related drug is methylestradiol, which is also used clinically. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), such as <b>Premarin,</b> a commonly prescribed estrogenic drug produced from the urine of pregnant mares, include the natural steroidal estrogens equilin and equilenin, as well as, especially, estrone sulfate (which itself is inactive and becomes active upon conversion into estrone). A related and very similar product to CEEs is esterified estrogens (EEs).|$|E
25|$|The estrogen-alone substudy of the WHI {{reported}} {{an increased risk}} of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and {{an increased risk of}} dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using 0.625mg of <b>Premarin</b> conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). The estrogen-plus-progestin substudy of the WHI {{reported an}} increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli and DVT in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and an increased risk of dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using PremPro, which is 0.625mg of CEE with 2.5mg of the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{is one of}} the {{two major}} sex hormones in XX chromosomed {{individuals}} (the other being progesterone), and is responsible for the development and maintenance of feminine secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, wide hips, and a feminine pattern of fat distribution. Estrogens act by binding to and activating the estrogen receptor (ER), their biological target in the body. A variety of different forms of estrogen are available and used medically. The most common estrogens used in transgender women include estradiol (which is the predominant natural estrogen in women) and estradiol esters such as estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate (which are prodrugs of estradiol). Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), marketed as <b>Premarin,</b> and ethinylestradiol are also sometimes used, but this is becoming less common. Estrogens may be administered orally, sublingually, transdermally (via patch), topically (via gel), by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, or by an implant.|$|E
25|$|The {{extraction}} of conjugated estrogens from the urine of pregnant mares {{led to the}} marketing in 1943 of the first HRT treatment, <b>Premarin.</b> From that time until 1975, estrogen was administered without supplemental progesterone or progestin. A study from Kaiser Permanente by Dr. Harry Ziel demonstrated that {{in the absence of}} progesterone, patients were at increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen therapy. After this, progestin was supplemented in women who had not received surgical hysterectomy, to reduce the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. This was followed by the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in 2002. However, the arm of the WHI receiving combined Estrogen and Progesterone therapy was closed prematurely by its Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) due to perceived health risks, although the trial arm was stopped only a full year after the data suggesting increased risk became manifest. In 2004, the arm of the WHI in which post-hysterectomy patients were being treated with estrogen alone was also closed by the DMC.|$|E

2500|$|In 1938, British {{scientists}} {{obtained a}} patent on a newly formulated nonsteroidal estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), that was cheaper and {{more powerful than the}} previously manufactured estrogens. Soon after, concerns over the side effects of DES were raised in scientific journals while the drug manufacturers came together to lobby for governmental approval of DES. It was only until 1941 when estrogen therapy was finally approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. <b>Premarin</b> (conjugated equine estrogens) was introduced in 1941 and succeeded Emmenin, the sales of which had begun to drop after 1940 due to competition from DES. Ethinylestradiol was synthesized in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg at Schering AG in Berlin and was approved by the [...] in the [...] on June 25, 1943 and marketed by Schering as Estinyl.|$|E

50|$|Equilin, {{also known}} as 7-dehydroestrone, as well as estra-1,3,5(10),7-tetraen-3-ol-17-one, is an {{estrogen}} from horses. Equilin {{is one of the}} estrogens present in the mixture of estrogens isolated from horse urine and marketed as <b>Premarin.</b> <b>Premarin</b> became the most commonly used form of estrogen for hormone replacement therapy in the United States of America. Estrone is the major estrogen in <b>Premarin</b> (about 50%) and equilin is present as about 25% of the total. Estrone is a major estrogen that is normally found in women. Equilin is not normally present in women, so there has been interest in the effects of equilin on the human body.|$|E
50|$|<b>Premarin</b> {{consists}} of conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), or, more exactly, the sodium salts of the sulfate esters of equine estrogens.

There are many different steroids in <b>Premarin,</b> even androgens and progestogens, but only the above-mentioned estrogens are present in sufficient amounts to produce clinically-relevant effects.|$|E

50|$|Oral <b>Premarin,</b> at a daily dosage of 0.625 mg, {{achieves}} estrone and estradiol {{levels of}} 150 pg/mL and 30-50 pg/mL, respectively, while a daily oral dosage of 1.25 mg achieves levels of 120-200 pg/mL and 40-60 pg/mL of estrone and estradiol, respectively. The oral ingestion of 10 mg <b>Premarin,</b> which contains about 4.5 mg sodium estrone sulfate and 2.5 mg sodium equilin sulfate, produces maximal plasma concentrations of estrone and equilin of 1400 pg/mL and 560 pg/mL within 3 and 5 hours, respectively.
