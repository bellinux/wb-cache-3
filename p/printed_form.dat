5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances. Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube. There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that they represent the oldest extant star maps in <b>printed</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E

25|$|Sedition, {{which is}} {{committed}} when spoken or written words are published with seditious intent, {{was a criminal}} offence under English common law. It emerged in an era where political violence threatened the stability of governments. The Star Chamber, {{in the case of}} De Libellis Famosis (1572), defined seditious libel (that is, sedition in a <b>printed</b> <b>form)</b> as the criticism of public persons or the government, and established it as a crime. The crime of sedition was premised on the need to maintain respect for the government and its agents, for criticism of public persons or the government undermines respect for public authorities. Even though the Star Chamber was later dissolved, seditious libel had become established as a common law offence.|$|E
25|$|Around the 9th century neumes {{began to}} become {{shorthand}} mnemonic aids {{for the proper}} melodic recitation of chant. A prevalent view is that neumatic notation was first developed in the Eastern Roman Empire. This seems plausible given the well-documented peak of musical composition and cultural activity in major cities of the empire (now regions of southern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Israel) at that time. The corpus of extant Byzantine music in manuscript and <b>printed</b> <b>form</b> is far larger {{than that of the}} Gregorian chant, {{due in part to the}} fact that neumes fell into disuse in the west after the rise of modern staff notation and with it the new techniques of polyphonic music, while the Eastern tradition of Greek orthodox church music and the reformed neume notation remains alive until today.|$|E
25|$|From 1836 to 1838, {{as deputy}} (non-stipendiary assistant) for Professor Palkovič, Chair of the Czechoslovak Language and Literature Department at the Lýceum {{where he was}} {{previously}} a student, he taught History of Slavic Literature. He continued to write poetry and under his leadership, the number {{of members of the}} Czech-Slav Society continuously increased. In this year, a poem of Štúr's was published in <b>printed</b> <b>form</b> for the first time: Óda na Hronku ("An ode to Hronka"). In April 1837, the Czech-Slav Society was banned due to a commotion between students at the Lýceum. One week later, Štúr founded the Institute of the Czechoslovak Language and Literature, within which the activities of the Czech-Slav Society continued. In that year, he continued to write articles for newspapers and journals, including Tatranka, Hronka, Květy (Czech), Časopis českého musea, Danica (Croatian) and Tygodnik literacki (Polish).|$|E

500|$|Galileo {{published}} {{a description of}} sunspots in 1613 entitled Letters on Sunspots suggesting the Sun and heavens are corruptible. The Letters on Sunspots also reported his 1610 telescopic observations of the full set of phases of Venus, and his discovery of the puzzling [...] "appendages" [...] of Saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance. In 1615, Galileo prepared a manuscript known as the [...] "Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina" [...] which was not published in <b>printed</b> <b>form</b> until 1636. This letter was a revised version of the Letter to Castelli, which was denounced by the Inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating Copernicanism both as physically true and as consistent with Scripture. In 1616, after the order by the inquisition for Galileo not to hold or defend the Copernican position, Galileo wrote the [...] "Discourse on the Tides" [...] (Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare) based on the Copernican earth, {{in the form of}} a private letter to Cardinal Orsini. In 1619, Mario Guiducci, a pupil of Galileo's, {{published a}} lecture written largely by Galileo under the title Discourse on the Comets (Discorso Delle Comete), arguing against the Jesuit interpretation of comets.|$|E
500|$|Geometry was {{essential}} to surveying and cartography. The earliest extant Chinese maps date to the 4th century BCE, yet {{it was not until}} the time of Pei Xiu (224–271) that topographical elevation, a formal rectangular grid system, and use of a standard graduated scale of distances was applied to terrain maps. Following a long tradition, Shen Kuo created a raised-relief map, while his other maps featured a uniform graduated scale of 1:900,000. A [...] squared map of 1137—carved into a stone block—followed a uniform grid scale of 100 li for each gridded square, and accurately mapped the outline of the coasts and river systems of China, extending all the way to India. Furthermore, the world's oldest known terrain map in <b>printed</b> <b>form</b> comes from the edited encyclopedia of Yang Jia in 1155, which displayed western China without the formal grid system that was characteristic of more professionally made Chinese maps. Although gazetteers had existed since 52 CE during the Han dynasty and gazetteers accompanied by illustrative maps (Chinese: tujing) since the Sui dynasty, the illustrated gazetteer became much more common in the Song dynasty, when the foremost concern was for illustrative gazetteers to serve political, administrative, and military purposes.|$|E
