30|$|The {{breakdown}} {{in the number of}} passengers into its four constituent categories is shown in Additional file 1 : Table S 2 for EaP countries and for all nationalities.

However, the numbers entering via this route have fallen for this group of countries, especially since 2007.

40|$|The role of {{population}} {{movement on the}} persistent transmission of malaria in Rameswaram Island was studied. Majority of {{the inhabitants of the}} island are fisherman, who engage in perennial fishing. They move {{from one to the other}} for fishing and stay in temporary camps depending on season and fish availability. Such seasonal fishing camps attract fisherman from the mainland coastal villages also. The parasitological and entomological studies carried out in these places reveal that some of the camps are highly vulnerable to the movement of individuals with malaria infection and highly receptive. Rameswaram being a holy place, receives pilgrims from all over India and Nepal. Plasmodium falciparum cases recorded from the pilgrims of North India indicate the danger of the possible introduction of chloroquine-resistant parasite in the island. Also, a large number of <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> from various countries, many of which are at risk of malaria transmission, stay in the island before or after visiting Sri Lanka. Such population movements being a continuous and regular feature are significant and result in failures in the operational programmes. ...|$|R

From 1 February to 30 April 2014, 33 measles cases with a unique measles virus strain of genotype B 3 were detected in the UK and the Netherlands, of which nine secondary cases were epidemiologically linked to an infectious measles case travelling from the Philippines. Through a combination of epidemiological investigation and sequence analysis, we found that measles transmission occurred in flight, airport and household settings. The secondary measles cases included airport workers, <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> at the same airport or travelling on the same flight as the infectious case and also household contacts. This investigation highlighted the particular importance of measles genotyping in identifying transmission networks {{and the need to}} improve vaccination, public health follow-up and management of travellers and airport staff exposed to measles. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} the port of Cartagena de Indias, the city with the most {{extensive}} fortifications in South America, has rewarded the efforts made by the national Government {{and the private sector}} to bring the major cruise companies back to Colombia. This study aims to expand cruise tourism research by analyzing cruisers’ experience and the economic impact of cruise tourism in the specific case of a home port destination. Survey data were collected from 402 <b>passengers</b> that embarked <b>in</b> Cartagena de Indias during the 2009 – 2010 season. A factor-cluster analysis was developed to segment cruisers and identify the factors that influence their perception and expenditure pattern. Three clusters were obtained, reflecting the differences in length of stay at the destination: <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit,</b> long and short stay passengers. Although the total impact for a homeport is expected to be higher than that for a port of call, in this study the evidence shows that most <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> Cartagena stay {{for a short period of}} time before embarking and their contribution to the local economy is fairly negligible. Findings from an OLS and a censured-Tobit analysis on the same data highlight that first time cruisers, with a high education level and belonging to the “long stay” cluster, have a higher than average spending capacity. The findings have several policy, marketing and management implications...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality and}} extent of traffc {{infrastructure}} has an immense infuence {{on the development of}} tourist destinations and on tourism <b>in</b> gener-al. <b>Transit</b> tourism is a unique form of movement and represents a link between generating zones and destinations. The subject of this study is the planning and spatial organization along the route of Highway Е- 75 thorough northern Serbian province of Vojvodina. The goal of the study is to scientifcally assert that the route of highway is inadequately equipped as it lacks adequate hospitality services considering its signifcance and the needs of <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> The pa-per intends to analyze the growing tourists’ de-mands perceived <b>in</b> <b>passenger</b> numbers and the passenger vehicles turnover with existing tourist products. The spatial extent of the research comprises the section of Highway Е- 75 through Vojvodina (Horgoš – Subotica – Bačka Topola – Vrbas – Novi Sad – Beška – Indjija – Stara Pazova). The study utilizes mixed quantitative and qual-itative methods, and employs preliminary desk research, feld work, comparative analysis, and a description to establish a critical synthetic narrative. The statistical method of Pearson cor-relation was used for quantitative data analysis and to assess the relationship between overnight stays in places along the highway and the num-ber of passengers travelling the highway.

The six factors are independent and selected as follows: 1 st: O-D Length; 2 nd: Curvature of routes; 3 rd: Overlap ratio of routes to main roads; 4 th: Friday or not; 5 th: Morning or Afternoon; 6 th: UW-Students or not. By both Lenth and Dong Method in a 26 factorial experimental design, one main effect together with one interaction effects significantly influences commuters? transfer behavior <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> commuting trips <b>in</b> 90 % confidence interval (CI). The main effect is ?Overlap ratio of main roads? and the interaction effect is ?Curvature of routes & Overlap ratio of main roads?. One interaction effect of ?Curvature of routes & UW-Students or not? is significant only by Dong method in 90 % CI. When CI is adjusted to 80 % or narrower, one other interaction effect of ?O-D Length & Overlap ratio of main roads & UW-Students or not? becomes significant by Dong method.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mesoscopic transit assignment model suitable for real-time prediction of on-board <b>passenger</b> numbers <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> networks with real-time individual predictive information on travel time components and also including on-board crowding. The path choice modelling framework {{is based on}} the reproduction of a travel strategy using random utility models that simulate both choices of departure time at origin and first access stop, and en-route choices of vehicle to board at stops. Such choices are based on attributes anticipated through a learning mechanism, which considers previous experiences and provides real-time predictive information. Within-day dynamic network loading considers vehicle capacity constraints, which allows the explicit modelling of fail-to-board events. Finally, results of an application on a real-size test network show the ability of the model to capture effects of providing individual predicted information on vehicle crowding...|$|R
