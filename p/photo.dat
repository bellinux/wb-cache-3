40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the extent to which young women post sexualized <b>photos</b> of {{themselves}} on Instagram and Facebook, whether these <b>photos</b> garner positive feedback in the form of “likes” and friends/followers, explore individual differences that predict which women post self-sexualized <b>photos,</b> and test whether posting self-sexualized <b>photos</b> on social media actually relate to feelings of sexual agency (i. e., control over one 2 ̆ 7 s own sexuality). Undergraduate women (N = 61) downloaded the ten most recent photographs of themselves posted on Instagram and/or Facebook and completed a variety of survey measures. Systematic coding of the resulting 1060 <b>photos</b> revealed that rates of self-sexualization were relatively low, though participants posted more sexualized <b>photos</b> to Instagram than to Facebook. Wanting attention on social media was the strongest predictor of posting self-sexualized <b>photos,</b> and indeed, more sexualized <b>photos</b> garnered more likes on Instagram than less sexualized <b>photos,</b> and women who post more sexualized <b>photos</b> tend to get more likes in general and more friends/followers on both Instagram and Facebook. Interestingly, posting self-sexualizing <b>photos</b> was not associated with actual sexual agency in offline encounters. These findings suggest the importance of cultural differences between platforms and of understanding women 2 ̆ 7 s desire for attention on social media...|$|R
