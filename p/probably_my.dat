I found it really easy to follow and kind of energetic, and I really loved filming that." [...] In reference to Trini Alvarado, the other actress in their fight scene, Torv also mentioned when shooting it [...] "We had so much fun!

500|$|Villanova coach Jay Wright {{considered}} redshirting Hilliard in {{his freshman}} season, but Wright {{decided against it}} after a rash of injuries to his players. He had 13 points in back-to-back games against Penn and Missouri in December 2011. As a freshman, Hilliard averaged 4.8 points, 2.5 rebounds and 18.1 minutes per game in 29 games and shot 29.2 percent from behind the 3-point arc. During the season, {{he reached out to}} his family and friends to see if he made the right decision to come to Villanova. He said, [...] "Freshman year was <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> toughest year of basketball", due to difficulties in adjusting to a new coach and teammates. He described himself as a mentally unstable 17-year-old.|$|E
500|$|American {{pop culture}} critic Chuck Klosterman later cited Spin Alternative Record Guide {{as one of}} his five {{favorite}} books, saying in 2011, [...] "I fear this might be out of print, but it's <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> favorite music book of all time. Since its 1995 publication, I doubt a year has passed when I didn't reread at least part of it." [...] Robert Christgau, who contributed to the book, wrote that while most music guides and encyclopedia books he has consulted were unremarkable, Spin Alternative Record Guide {{was one of the few}} [...] "useful exceptions" [...] because of what he felt was the [...] "sharpest writing" [...] from contributors such as Weisbard and Sheffield. Maura Johnston, on the other hand, said in retrospect that the book's list of the 100 best albums catered to [...] "hipper, Gen-Xier tastes".|$|E

500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{have been}} {{critical}} of Hail to the Thief. In a 2006 interview with Spin, Yorke said: [...] "I'd maybe change the playlist. I think we had a meltdown when we put it together ... We wanted to do things quickly, and I think the songs suffered." [...] In 2008, O'Brien told Mojo he felt Radiohead should have cut the album to ten tracks and that its length had alienated some listeners. In the same interview, Colin Greenwood said he felt several songs were unfinished and that the album was [...] "more of a holding process". In 2013, Godrich told the NME: [...] "I think there's some great moments on there - but too many songs... As a whole I think it's charming {{because of the lack of}} editing. But personally it's <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> least favourite of all the albums ... It didn't really have its own direction. It was almost like a homogeny of previous work. Maybe that's its strength." ...|$|E

On June 1, 2011, Warren revealed in an interview for the New York Posts PopWrap that she wrote [...] "the best [...] ever written" [...] {{a week and a}} half ago and that Beyoncé had already recorded it for her fourth studio album 4. She described it as [...] "a career song and <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> favorite thing I've ever written". The development of [...] "I Was Here" [...] was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Warren wanted to work with Beyoncé since the Destiny's Child eras, but admitted that [...] "I Was Here" [...] was the ideal timing, [...] "I thought that the one artist who would be my dream to sing [...] would be Beyoncé. This is one of those magical stories where what is meant to be actually happens." ...|$|E

500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said the episode is a [...] "convincing {{portrait}} of young marriage and hardship in the days of Reaganomics—and the biggest name to guest voice gets the littlest, but the most significant, to say". When asked to pick his favorite season out of The Simpsons seasons one through twenty, Paul Lane of the Niagara Gazette picked season four and highlighted [...] "the sweetly funny" [...] "Lisa's First Word". David Johnson at DVD Verdict named it [...] "one of the greatest flashback episodes". Dave Manley at DVDActive said in a review of The Simpsons: Greatest Hits DVD that it is [...] "one of the better episodes and <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> personal favourite on the disc, although most Simpsons connoisseurs would probably go for the previous episode [...] ", and added that there are [...] "some great parodies in the episode too". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the fourteenth best episode of the show with a sports theme (the Olympics in this case).|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Turn Up the Music" [...] {{was directed by}} Godfrey Taberez and Brown, and filmed in Los Angeles, California on February 1–2, 2012. It was produced by Andrew Listermann of Riveting Entertainment. On February 2, 2012, Brown revealed details about the video via his official Twitter account, tweeting [...] "I'll let you guys judge but this Turn Up the music video hands down is <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> best video by far!!!". Several images from the shoot were leaked online the same day, showing Brown {{in the passenger seat}} of a classic car, and standing shirtless on top of a vehicle with a group of people. Another image showed one of the dancer's face covered with a [...] "wild mask". A behind-the-scenes video clip was posted online on February 14, 2012. The video showed Brown, dressed in a black suit, performing dance routines with several backup dancers in a club, surrounded by people wearing animal heads. Another scene showed Brown dancing in the rain and in the streets. The music video premiered online on February 17, 2012, and features a cameo appearance by hip hop trio The Rej3ctz.|$|E
500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till you see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E

500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be with my friends. Out of everything in this whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E

2500|$|On day 2, Allan's 1984 diary was {{delivered}} to Carman's junior counsel and used against Allan in cross examination. The notebook contained details of Allan's sexual fantasies about a married Italian airline pilot named Ricardo and it cast doubt on her professed celibacy. Allan told the court that her relationship with Ricardo only included [...] "a degree of sexual foreplay". The judge said that any finding that Allan had lied {{about the extent of}} this relationship did not mean she had an affair with Terre'Blanche, whom she described as [...] "a very different man". The diary's disappearance was investigated by the police, but {{it was found that the}} diary had been left in the home of an English couple with whom Allan had resided in 1989. Allan revealed [...] "I was in a traumatic state and I wrote down my worst fears and <b>probably</b> <b>my</b> worst desires," [...] continuing [...] "It was a way of dealing with my sexual problems. [...] This notebook is deeply embarrassing. I wrote it when I was under psychiatric care." [...] Later her former husband Gordon Schachat provided evidence supporting claims Allan had made about her disinterest in sex and citing it as a reason for the breakdown of their marriage. Schachat also rebuffed perceptions in the media about her image: [...] "her sexy public image is totally at odds with her real personality", continuing to describe her as [...] "shy".
