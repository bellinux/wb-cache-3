To empower <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> counselors in promoting improved academic performance the American School Counseling Association (ASCA, 2003) revised its national model. Now more than ever, <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> counselors are expected to advocate {{on behalf of all}} students to facilitate their optimal academic development. One student demographic in particular—African American males—has experienced chronic academic difficulties. In the position of advocate, <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> counselors can promote improved academic performance in African American adolescent males through school/community collaboration.

40|$|Developing honors {{opportunities}} for students in <b>professional</b> <b>schools</b> can be difficult, as noted by, for example, Giazzoni (2007), Bishop and Sittason (2007) and Noble and Dowling (2007) and also as demonstrated by honors program statistics at Texas Christian University (TCU). Despite the difficulty, high achieving students in <b>professional</b> <b>schools</b> should {{have the opportunity to}} benefit from an honors education. According to Bruce (2008), “honors education looks different from other types of education.... Honors pushes our comfort zones... [and]... challenges us to... be open to new ideas” (19 – 29). This paper shows that applying these principles to the design of honors programs in <b>professional</b> <b>schools</b> leads to increased retention rates of <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> students in honors. We advocate honors programs for <b>professional</b> <b>schools</b> that are administered separately from but collaborate closely with university honors programs, enabling their students to graduate with both traditional university honors and <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> honors. The equal importance put on membership in both honors programs affords students the best education and the best university experience...|$|R

40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{cheating}} in higher education, business school students have often {{been accused of being}} the worst offenders; if true, this may be a contributing factor in the kinds of fraud that have plagued the business community in recent years. We examined the issue of cheating in the business school by surveying 268 students in business and other <b>professional</b> <b>schools</b> on their attitudes about, and experiences with, cheating. We found that while business school students actually cheated no more or less than students in other <b>professional</b> <b>schools,</b> their attitudes on what constitutes cheating are more lax than those of other <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> students. Additionally, we found that serious cheaters across all <b>professional</b> <b>schools</b> {{were more likely to be}} younger and have a lower grade point average.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop and {{validate}} a perceptual instrument to measure the ethical climate of an institution 2 ̆ 7 s graduate and <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> programs, the Ethical Climate Index (ECI). The theoretical framework of the ECI involved the application of five ethical principles to three major environments within graduate and <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> programs. Items for the ECI were developed by meeting informally with graduate and <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> students and reviewing related environmental instruments and sources pertaining to the ethical principles and graduate and <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> environments. The content validity of the items was evaluated by an expert in the university ethical climate area and two item review panels. As a result of the item reviews, a 122 -item ECI was formed that contains items related to each of the three graduate and <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> environments and five ethical principles. ^ For further validation, the ECI was distributed, along with the CUES Community Scale (Pace, 1969), to 852 graduate and <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> students from 10 major areas and programs within a large midwestern university. Of the 852 students surveyed, 527 responded, providing a return rate of 62...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the alignment between Arizona {{public high school}} Administrators' expectations of <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> counselors, the ASCA National Model (2005), and the instruments used in Arizona to evaluate <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> counselors. Participants included ten principals and assistant principals, and 103 of the 111 public school districts {{with at least one}} high school in Arizona. Data was obtained through semistructured interviews, document, and content analysis. Organizational Role Theory and Leader-Member Exchange Theory guided the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Findings indicate that administrators' expectations of <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> counselors align 62 % with the ASCA National Model, while the instruments used in Arizona to evaluate <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> counselors align 13 % with administrators' expectations of <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> counselors and 21 % with the ASCA National Model. The best predictor of alignment was school district use of a school counselor-specific evaluation instrument. Recommendations focused on the need for clearer communication of role expectations between administrators and counselors, and for more meaningful evaluation practices that align with counseling standards...|$|R
