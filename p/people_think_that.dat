25|$|In the {{political}} philosophy of healthcare, {{the debate between}} universal healthcare and private healthcare is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives {{by the federal government}} to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a giant step in the direction of socialized medicine, many <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage. Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that already exists in the United States.|$|E

The official Yang Dao (羊衜) wrote a memorial to Sun Quan, urging the emperor to lift the ban on his sons interacting with the outside world. He pointed out that both Sun He and Sun Ba held considerable prestige among the literati and scholar-gentry, who were eager to meet the two princes, so they {{should be allowed to}} interact with the outside world. Yang Dao also explained to Sun Quan that isolating the two princes from the outside world might make <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Eastern Wu was experiencing internal instability and allow rumours to breed and spread.
