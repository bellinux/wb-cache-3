50|$|With {{liquid and}} hybrid rockets, {{immediate}} ignition of the <b>propellant(s)</b> <b>as</b> they first enter the combustion chamber is essential.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{a lack of}} {{understanding}} of this effect led investigators to conclude that interplanetary travel would require completely impractical amounts of <b>propellant,</b> <b>as</b> without it, enormous amounts of energy are needed.|$|R
50|$|The University of Bristol, UK, has {{recently}} successfully tested gaseous Hydrogen/Air <b>propellants</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} STERN project. They are also involved in developing knowledge of the in-flight behaviour of the E-D nozzle using a hybrid rocket motor.|$|R
50|$|Quadricyclane is a strained, multi-cyclic {{hydrocarbon}} {{with potential}} uses as an additive for rocket <b>propellants</b> <b>as</b> well in solar energy conversion. These uses are limited, however, by the molecule's decomposition at relatively low temperatures (less than 400 °C).|$|R
50|$|PBAN {{was to be}} used in the Constellation program, later canceled, as this {{copolymer}} was {{to be used in}} {{the first}} stage of the Ares I rocket in five segments. However future versions of Ares I were discussed using liquid <b>propellants</b> <b>as</b> a potential alternative.|$|R
5000|$|RD-0207 (GRAU Index: 8D67): A small gas {{generator}} rocket vernier engine {{using the same}} <b>propellants</b> <b>as</b> the RD-0206 and bundled {{with it in the}} RD-0205 propulsion module. It has four combustion chambers that can gimbal 45 degrees in a single plane and allow the UR-200 second stage to have vector control.|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} use of perchlorates is <b>as</b> oxidizers in <b>propellants</b> for {{rockets and}} fireworks. Of particular value is ammonium perchlorate composite <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> {{a component of}} solid rocket fuel. In a related but smaller application, perchlorates are used extensively within the pyrotechnics industry and in certain munitions and for the manufacture of matches.|$|R
50|$|The Soyuz-U2 (GRAU index 11A511U2) was a Soviet, later Russian, carrier rocket. It {{was derived}} from the Soyuz-U, {{and a member of the}} R-7 family of rockets. It {{featured}} increased performance compared with the baseline Soyuz-U, due to the use of syntin <b>propellant,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to RP-1 paraffin, used on the Soyuz-U.|$|R

50|$|Intelsat 2 {{was removed}} from {{geostationary}} orbit in February 2011, being placed into graveyard orbit on 28 February. Manoeuvring into graveyard orbit did not fully deplete the satellite's <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> had been expected, so engineering operations continued until July 2011 in order to exhaust the remaining supply. The satellite was then decommissioned and powered down.|$|R
50|$|Composite {{modified}} double base propellants {{start with}} a nitrocellulose/nitroglycerin double base <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> a binder and add solids (typically ammonium perchlorate (AP) and powdered aluminium) normally used in composite propellants. The ammonium perchlorate makes up the oxygen deficit introduced by using nitrocellulose, improving the overall specific impulse. The aluminium improves specific impulse as well as combustion stability. High performing <b>propellants</b> such <b>as</b> NEPE-75 used to fuel the Trident II D-5, SLBM replace most of the AP with polyethylene glycol-bound HMX, further increasing specific impulse. The mixing of composite and double base propellant ingredients has become so common as to blur the functional definition of double base propellants.|$|R
50|$|The idea is {{that when}} using local {{material}} <b>as</b> <b>propellant,</b> the amount of <b>propellant</b> is not <b>as</b> important {{as the amount of}} power, which is likely to be limited.|$|R
25|$|About 90 {{seconds before}} the second stage cutoff, the center engine shut down to reduce {{longitudinal}} pogo oscillations. At around this time, the LOX flow rate decreased, changing the mix ratio of the two propellants, ensuring {{that there would be}} <b>as</b> little <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> possible left in the tanks at the end of second stage flight. This was done at a predetermined delta-v.|$|R
50|$|A {{tripropellant}} rocket is {{a rocket}} that uses three <b>propellants,</b> <b>as</b> {{opposed to the}} more common bipropellant rocket or monopropellant rocket designs, which use two or one fuels, respectively. Tripropellant rockets appear to offer fairly impressive gains for single stage to orbit designs, although to date no tripropellant rocket design has been developed {{to the point of}} testing that would prove the concept.|$|R

5000|$|One {{method is}} to use small {{thrusters}} to continually nudge the spacecraft back and forth within a deadband of allowed attitude error. Thrusters may also {{be referred to as}} mass-expulsion control (MEC) systems, or reaction control systems (RCS). The space probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 employ this method, and have used up about three quarters of their 100 kg of <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> of July 2015.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the mission benefits and technology requirements of electric propulsion thrusters designed to use oxygen (O 2) <b>as</b> <b>propellant,</b> and an overview of the status of current research in this area. Such engine technology, when used in solar or nuclear electric propulsion transfer vehicles, could enable the use of lunar-produced oxygen <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> a means of dramatically reducing the mass of vehicles and propellants required to support the build-up of a lunar base. It is found that there are mass benefits, but these benefits are countered somewhat by long trip times due to the low electric-to-jet power efficiency of O 2 -propellant electric thrusters...|$|R
25|$|The Delta 183 program used a {{satellite}} known as Delta Star to test several sensor related technologies. Delta Star carried a thermographic camera, a long-wave infrared imager, an ensemble of imagers and photometers covering several visible and ultraviolet bands {{as well as}} a laser detector and ranging device. The satellite observed several ballistic missile launches including some releasing liquid <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> a countermeasure to detection. Data from the experiments led to advances in sensor technologies.|$|R
50|$|CARDE {{then looked}} into {{using the new}} <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> {{the basis for a}} new motor for {{existing}} 2.75-inch air-to-ground rockets. The result was the CRV-7 rocket, which had roughly twice the speed of the existing US design, and with enough energy to be able to puncture Warsaw Pact aircraft hangars. Production started at Bristol Aerospace in 1974, and the CRV-7 has been used by the Canadian and other air forces since that time.|$|R
50|$|Another use of {{cryogenics}} is cryogenic fuels for rockets {{with liquid}} hydrogen {{as the most}} widely used example. Liquid oxygen (LOX) is even more widely used but as an oxidizer, not a fuel. NASA's workhorse space shuttle used cryogenic hydrogen/oxygen <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> its primary means of getting into orbit. LOX is also widely used with RP-1 kerosene, a non-cryogenic hydrocarbon, such as in the rockets built for the Soviet space program by Sergei Korolev.|$|R

50|$|SuperDraco {{is derived}} from Draco, and {{utilizes}} the same storable (non-cryogenic) <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> the small Draco thrusters, but are over 100 times larger in terms of delivered thrust. The much larger SuperDraco engines will be used on later versions of the Dragon spacecraft to provide launch-escape capability on crew transport flights to low Earth orbit, as well as entry, descent and landing control of the proposed Red Dragon robotic probe to Mars.|$|R
50|$|The rocket {{operated}} perfectly {{through the}} first 100 seconds of the flight, when the No. 5 engine shut off as planned. The rocket then continued to operate properly, the propellant system rerouting the fuel to the other engines. The No. 5 engine did not disintegrate because of heat caused {{by the lack of}} cooling <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> some had predicted. This was an important test proving an important feature of the clustered engine design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Studies on Thermal {{decomposition}} of ammonium perchlorate (AP) -polysty-rene (PS) propellant and burning rate of PSlAP propellant {{have been carried}} out as a function of oxidizer particle size. Therbal {{decomposition of}} AP and AP/PS <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> a function of AP particle size shows a maximum rate around 100 micron particle size which has been explained on the basis of Mample's theory. No such maxima is observed in the case of PS/AP propellant burning rate. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of emission thermophotometry (ETP) is discussed briefly from the viewpoints of general principles, instrumentation, and application to various chemical substances. ETP detects and records the light emitted by a chemical reaction that is thermally initiated, {{usually in the}} temperature range of 20 O 0 - 30 O 0 C. Perhaps the most important application of ETP is in the thermal degradation of polymers, although {{it can be used}} to study explosives and <b>propellants</b> <b>as</b> well...|$|R
5000|$|Composed of {{powdered}} zinc metal and powdered sulfur (oxidizer), ZS or [...] "micrograin" [...] is another pressed propellant {{that does not}} find any practical application outside specialized amateur rocketry circles due to its poor performance (as most ZS burns outside the combustion chamber) and fast linear burn rates {{on the order of}} 2 m/s. ZS is most often employed <b>as</b> a novelty <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> the rocket accelerates extremely quickly leaving a spectacular large orange fireball behind it.|$|R
50|$|The L-301 HGV was {{intended}} to be a follow-on to the X-15 and X-24 (specifically the X-24B) programs, to take lessons learned from both and integrate them into an airframe capable of at least reaching Mach 8 and engaging in hypersonic skip-glide maneuvers for long range missions. While the NASA program, one of several to use the tentative X-24C designator, was ostensibly canceled in 1977, it was only canceled at the time because of USAF disclosures of duplicate black programs with the same contractors for similar vehicles. The vehicle used both air breathing ram or scramjet propulsion as well as a rocket engine, carrying both RP-1 and LH2 <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> well as on board stores of LOX.|$|R
50|$|The {{plausibility}} of thrusters that emit no <b>propellant,</b> such <b>as</b> the EmDrive are controversial, {{primarily because}} their operation {{would violate the}} conservation of momentum.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{decomposition}} of ammonium perchlorate-polystyrene <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> {{a function of}} oxidizer loading {{has been found to}} behave in a fashion analogous to the thermal {{decomposition of}} ammonium perchlorate as a function of precompression pressure. It has been argued that the above behaviour of the propellant is due to the strain caused by the binder film on ammonium perchlorate contained in the propellant matrix. The presence of strain has been demonstrated independently by x-ray diffraction peak and infrared peak broadening and strain energy measurements...|$|R
5000|$|The launch was {{initially}} scheduled for 24 February 2016 at 6:46pm local time, with a backup launch window {{the next day}} at the same time. [...] Neither day produced a launch however as both attempts were scrubbed: on 24 February, prior to propellant loading [...] "out of an abundance of caution, {{in order to get the}} rocket’s liquid oxygen <b>propellant</b> <b>as</b> cold as possible"; and on 25 February, just two minutes prior to launch “citing a last-minute problem with propellant loading.” ...|$|R
