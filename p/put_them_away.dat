5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is off to}} Philadelphia to {{interview}} at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) new company, Athlead, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) decides to come along, since office manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is still not back from his sailboat excursion. She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>away</b> for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E
25|$|Although Elway's {{performance}} in the AFC Championship Game was widely considered his best ever, many sports writers and fans believed that the Broncos' best effort would not {{be good enough to}} beat the 49ers. After all, Denver had barely defeated the Steelers, who only had a 9–7 regular season record, while the 9–6–1 Cleveland Browns had almost overcome a 17-point second half deficit before Denver <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>away</b> in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the Elway-led Broncos had already lost two Super Bowls. On the other hand, the Montana-led 49ers, with their powerful offense, had already won three Super Bowls.|$|E

50|$|After all {{the guests}} have taken tea, the host cleans the {{utensils}} {{in preparation for}} <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> <b>away.</b> The guest of honour will request that the host allow the guests to examine some of the utensils, and each guest in turn examines each item, including the tea caddy and the tea scoop.

Even more popular in Peru than gift giving is the custom of the Bajada de Reyes when parties are held in honor of the taking down of family and public nativity scenes, and carefully <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> <b>away</b> until the next Christmas.|$|R

And in contrast to earlier episodes in which the Turtles would {{spend most of their}} time training, relaxing, or partying, and only countering a threat when it arose, they devoted most of their time and energy to tracking down Shredder, Krang, or Lord Dregg, and <b>putting</b> <b>them</b> <b>away</b> for good.|$|R
