If a coast is {{in much the same}} {{condition}} as it was when sea level was stabilised after the last ice age, it is called a <b>primary</b> <b>coast.</b> [...] "Primary coasts are created by erosion (the wearing away of soil or rock), deposition (the buildup of sediment or sand) or tectonic activity (changes {{in the structure of the}} rock and soil because of earthquakes). Many of these coastlines were formed as the sea level rose during the last 18,000 years, submerging river and glacial valleys to form bays and fjords." [...] An example of a <b>primary</b> <b>coast</b> is a river delta, which forms when a river deposits soil and other material as it enters the sea.|$|E
