5000|$|The Dictabelt, {{in early}} years {{and much less}} {{commonly}} also called a Memobelt, is an analog audio recording medium commercially introduced by the American Dictaphone company in 1947.

The belt is loaded onto a pair of metal cylinders, put under tension, then rotated like a tank tread. It is inscribed with an audio-signal-modulated helical groove by a stylus which is slowly moved across the rotating belt. Unlike the stylus of a record cutter, the Dictabelt stylus is blunt and in recording mode it simply impresses a groove into the plastic rather than engraving it and throwing off a thread of waste material.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, having {{relied on}} wax-cylinder {{recording}} {{to the end}} of World War II, Dictaphone introduced their Dictabelt technology. This cut a mechanical groove into a Lexan <b>plastic</b> <b>belt</b> instead of a wax cylinder. The advantage of the Lexan belt was that recordings were permanent and admissible in court. Eventually IBM introduced a dictating machine using an erasable belt made of magnetic tape which enabled the user to correct dictation errors rather than marking errors on a paper tab. Dictaphone in turn added magnetic recording models while still selling the models recording on the Lexan belts. Machines based on magnetic tape recording were introduced in the late seventies, initially using the standard compact (or [...] "C") cassette, but soon, in dictation machines, using mini-cassettes or microcassettes instead. The size of the cassette was important as it enabled the manufacturer {{to reduce the size of}} portable recorders.|$|R

After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months.

Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every seven days. The cheese is also turned at this time.|$|R

The induced currents and charges in the phase conductors and earth screen upon a PD not only depend on the discharge site, but also become phase angle dependent.

Finally, the PD propagation in a multi-conductor cable also alters the signals measured at the cable terminals. In this paper, induced charges and PD distributions are studied by means of computer simulation. The cable propagation characteristics are verified by measurements...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to design a device to clean fish solids and plaque from <b>plastic</b> {{conveyor}} <b>belts</b> {{after they have been}} taken off fishing ships. This project involved a systematic design study along with an experimental investigation into the effectiveness of cleaning methods. While fishing factory ships are at sea, the <b>plastic</b> conveyor <b>belts</b> that are used to transport fish become tainted with a biological plaque that some bacteria create to protect themselves, and fish residue. A brief was evolved that required the development of a land based cleaning device to reduce the non-productive cleaning time at sea. A systematic design procedure was adopted for the design of the belt-cleaning device. Research showed that strongly alkaline solutions were the best method of cleaning protein-based biofilms. This research led to the most promising cleaning mechanism concepts being tested to quantitatively evaluate their cleaning effectiveness. The development of the final concept considered the requirements of New Zealand legislation and a professional code of ethics, materials issues due to the aggressive environment, structural design using finite element methods, and a heat and mass transfer analysis. The final design solution consisted of two units. Firstly, a tank to receive the coiled belt, another insulated tank to store the sodium hydroxide cleaning solution, an overhead crane to load/unload the belt, and a transfer pump and control system to control the flow of fluids. The second unit was a separate rinser to perform the water blasting. This study resulted in the final manufacturing information for the belt washer.

50|$|Rigid belt {{actuators}} can {{be thought}} of as rack and pinion devices that use a flexible rack. Rigid belt actuators use two reinforced <b>plastic</b> ribbed <b>belts,</b> that engage with pinions mounted on drive shafts within a housing. The belts have evenly spaced load bearing blocks on the non-ribbed face. As the pinions spin, the belts are rotated 90 degrees through the housing, which interlocks the blocks like a zipper into a rigid linear form. The resulting beam or column is effective at resisting tension and compression (buckling). Because the actuating member can fold on itself, it can be stored relatively compactly in a storage magazine, either in an overlapping or coiled arrangement. The actuator is driven by an electric motor.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBitumen-aggregate {{adhesion}} {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} characteristics related to an asphalt mix. It affects the mix durability mainly in terms of its moisture susceptibility. Wide range of adhesion promoters is available to the market and can be used in regular practice, nevertheless usually only limited attention is paid to the long term activity (mainly the effective substances) and stability of the additives in the bitumen and the asphalt mix. Research done at the Czech Technical University in Prague is focused on studying the impact of differently aged asphalt mix using selected procedures defined in prEN 12697 - 52 as well as developing a self-defined procedure by applying the PAV equipment used since many years for long-term bitumen ageing. The results of aged mixtures were always compared to unaged control mixes. In parallel use of aged bitumen was assessed as well. The results were further compared to a simple adhesion test to get a more complex understanding of the activity of selected additives. In total more than 5 additives were selected and tested on one type of asphalt concrete with the application on a more hydrophilic aggregate type. Results gained during this experimental study are presented in the paper using as a criterion indirect tensile strength ratio determined either by EN 12697 - 12 or by modified procedure according to AASHTO T 283. In parallel because of elevated temperatures used during ageing suitable covering of cylindrical test specimens was analyzed as well to avoid unnecessary deformations or even disintegration of the tested specimens. For this reason two types of protective collar were chosen – PVC and thin steel mash – in both cases fixed by <b>plastic</b> <b>belts.</b> It is assumed that steel mash can better simulate the effect of ageing keeping the envelope partly free for direct contact with hot air and pressure.
