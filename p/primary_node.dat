From the results of surgical findings, 4 metastatic types of the testicular tumors to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes were classified. Type I : Involvement of the <b>primary</b> <b>nodes</b> of the testis which were located at the renal pedicle and/or periaortocaval area superior to the bifurcation of aorta. Type II : Involvement of the testis with secondary metastasis to the non-primary periaortocaval nodes of the testis and the iliac nodes.

Type IV: Involvement of the <b>primary</b> <b>nodes</b> of the epididymis. Of the 19 patients who had the retroperitoneal involvements; 11 patients (58 %) were in type I; 5 patients (26 %) were in type II; 2 patients (10 %) were in type III; one patient (5 %) was in type IV. In all cases with metastasis to the <b>primary</b> <b>nodes</b> of epididymis, the invasion of tumor to the epididymis was found and the stage of primary tumor was T 3.

30|$|This paper investigates a new {{transmission}} technique for cognitive access in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink channels with waterfilling power allocation- (WPA-) based primary transmission. The proposed technique allows a cognitive node {{to access the}} common destination simultaneously with the <b>primary</b> <b>node,</b> without affecting the MIMO primary performance. By using an appropriate precoding design, the cognitive node aligns its transmitted signal to the unused primary eigenmodes and ensures an orthogonality between the primary and the cognitive links. In order to overcome the limitation of the conventional WPA at high signal-to-noise ratios, a modified WPA enables the <b>primary</b> <b>node</b> to release some eigenmodes {{in order to provide}} a positive cognitive rate for all the cases.|$|E
