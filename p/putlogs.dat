50|$|All that survives of {{the castle}} are a few wall remains, {{numerous}} <b>putlog</b> holes and rock chambers.|$|R
25|$|From {{the line}} of the walls, there may have been another {{entrance}} on the west side, but this is uncertain. A bank of earth appears to have been erected some distance away {{to the north of the}} castle, either as a form of defence, or perhaps to obscure the castle from a former road that ran past it from that direction. The towers seem not to have had ground-floor entrances. <b>Putlog</b> holes suggest that they had upper floors. <b>Putlog</b> holes in the curtain walls suggest the presence of hoardings to protect defenders. This large, lime-washed, stone, moated castle would have been visually impressive.|$|R
50|$|The inconsequential {{size and}} the spacing of the holes meant {{that they did not}} affect the {{solidity}} of the walls, and in well-preserved castles, like Beaumaris, the ancient <b>putlog</b> holes can be seen to this day.|$|R
50|$|A {{historically}} {{common type}} of scaffolding, putlog holes date from ancient Roman buildings. The term putlock and the newer term putlog date from the 17th century and are still used today. <b>Putlogs</b> may be supported on the outer ends by vertical poles (standards), cantilevered by one end being firmly embedded in the wall, or cantilevered by penetrating the wall to provide scaffolds on both sides. <b>Putlogs</b> may be sawn off flush with the wall if they cannot be removed, but exterior putlog holes are typically filled in as the scaffold is removed to prevent water from entering the walls. Interior putlog holes may be left open, particularly if not in a finished space.|$|E
50|$|A putlog {{scaffold}} {{may also}} be called a bricklayer's scaffold. As such, the scaffold consists only of a single row of standards with a single ledger. The <b>putlogs</b> are transoms - attached to the ledger at one end but integrated into the bricks at the other.|$|E
50|$|Putlog holes or putlock {{holes are}} small holes {{made in the}} walls of {{structures}} to receive the ends of poles (small round logs) or beams, called <b>putlogs</b> or putlocks, to support a scaffolding. Putlog holes may extend through a wall to provide staging {{on both sides of}} the wall.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{suspected}} that in peacetime, hoardings were stored as prefabricated elements. Construction of hoardings was often facilitated by <b>putlog</b> holes, sockets {{that were left}} in the masonry of castle walls for wooden joists called [...] "putlogs".

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the word is uncertain, but may have been {{borrowed}} attributively from the term used to describe a horizontal timber in a scaffolding, lying parallel to {{the face of the}} building and supporting the <b>putlogs.</b> There is no basis to support the often-found claim that the word originates from the French léger, meaning [...] "light" [...] or [...] "slight" [...] The Oxford online dictionary describes the {{origin of the}} [...] "leger" [...] spelling as a [...] "variant of ledger" [...] that first appeared in the 19th century [...]|$|E
50|$|This {{fortress}} {{consists of}} three concentric enclosures set on red sandstone outcrops (micaceous of buntsandstein), which were partially chopped and modified to improve the defense. This sandstone (Rodeno), as megaliths, as ashlar, or as masonry walls settled with lime mortars or gypsum, is the mainly used material {{in the construction of}} the walls on this fortress. The wood was used to a lesser extent and always in beams and <b>putlogs.</b> The natural and intricate terrain secured the defense of the east and north flanks, and for that reason is why the Keep Tower (Torre del Homenaje) is erected in this area. On the west and south sides of the castle two high and thick walls with battlement were built. In the first enclosure, still remain two central elements of the castle: a cistern and two towers. In the second square, enclosed by an imposing wall three meters thick built at right angles, with a side of 70 and another 40 meters, the Weapon Square was established.|$|E
5000|$|Duras {{is located}} about twenty {{kilometers}} south and {{it belonged to}} the Dukes {{of the same name}} belonging to the Durfort family. Gageac faced the Dordogne valley and Laforce another stronghold. There may have been animosity between the two Duchies. The original 12th-century fortress was only composed of a square tower - the keep (west side). The keep, which was the only stone building, was defended by wooden fortifications. The entrance is situated on the first floor which is reached by a ladder that was removed when attackers came. They sent carrier pigeons to deter Duras (there are traces of <b>putlogs</b> (nests) over the guard room). This keep is divided into two main parts: one is called the [...] "guard room" [...] located in the highest part, lighted by a window which can be seen on the north side. Its access is by a strange staircase, which was built in the thickness of the walls. The other room is barely lit (only by a basement window), with access from the first floor, and the ground level of the rock is the dungeon or oubliette. It was used as a store for food or weapons, and is entered using the ladder also used to access the tower.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower is}} {{rectangular}} in plan and fronts the street. The building façade shows the typical rows of stone externally {{as well as}} some <b>putlog</b> holes which were used in medieval times as supports for scaffolding (used to complete particularly high construction) or as placement holes for the support beams of exterior balconies.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{couplers}} previously mentioned, right-angle couplers join ledgers or transoms to standards, <b>putlog</b> {{or single}} couplers join board bearing transoms to ledgers - Non-board bearing transoms should be fixed using a right-angle coupler. Swivel couplers are to connect tubes {{at any other}} angle. The actual joints are staggered to avoid occurring {{at the same level}} in neighbouring standards.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} entrance {{with its}} Gothic archway, with jambs made of tuff, lies at about four metres {{above the ground}} on the northern side and leads to the first floor. <b>Putlog</b> holes on the exterior show where the staircase access was. The doors turned in a carefully hewn out stone ring and could be locked with a bar.|$|R
50|$|Spacing is {{the same}} on a <b>putlog</b> {{scaffold}} as on a general purpose scaffold, and ties are still required.In recent years {{a number of new}} innovations have meant an increased scope of use for scaffolding, such as ladderbeams for spanning spaces that cannot accommodate standards and the increased use of sheeting and structure to create temporary roofs.|$|R
500|$|The barbican {{was built}} at the {{beginning}} of the 14th century and contained a guard-room on the first floor. The barbican contains numerous <b>putlog</b> holes from its construction, although these would have been masked by exterior plasterwork in the medieval period. A passageway led up from the barbican to the gatehouse, probably originally guarded by a drawbridge and containing the accommodation for the castle's constable.|$|R
50|$|Couplers are the {{fittings}} which {{hold the}} tubes together. The most common are called scaffold couplers, {{and there are}} three basic types: right-angle couplers, <b>putlog</b> couplers and swivel couplers. To join tubes end-to-end joint pins (also called spigots) or sleeve couplers are used. Only right angle couplers and swivel couplers {{can be used to}} fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection'. Single couplers are not load-bearing couplers and have no design capacity.|$|R
50|$|The Collegiate Church of Notre Dame dominates {{views of}} Mantes, {{particularly}} when approaching {{from the north}} or east, where it sits on a bluff above {{a bend in the}} River Seine. From the exterior, its most distinctive features are the large round windows (oculi) at gallery level (see below), the cage-like flying buttresses and the general pock-marked appearance, caused by the unusually prominent <b>putlog</b> holes (left over from where the original builders attached their wooden scaffolding).|$|R
50|$|The cella is a tall, {{circular}} shaft rising all the {{way through}} the center of both the podium and the rotunda. The cella is about 6.6 m in diameter at the bottom but tapers as it rises to a 5.6 m diameter at the top. The top features an oculus allowing for light. Throughout the cella, there are over 143 cut outs, divided into 12 rows of 10-14, in the walls of the cella that were used as <b>putlog</b> holes in the creation of the monument.|$|R
500|$|Cow Tower is {{a three-story}} {{circular}} {{building with a}} protruding turret, the main building being [...] across and [...] tall, tapering towards the top. Its walls, [...] thick at the base, are made of a core of flint stone, faced {{on the inside and}} outside with brick, and various <b>putlog</b> holes can still be seen in the walls. The turret, which contained a spiral staircase, would originally have been higher than the parapets, forming a look-out position. The walls rest on a stone plinth and several layers of mortared flint.|$|R
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Conwy has close to links to {{that found in}} the kingdom of Savoy in the same period. These include window styles, the type of crenellation used on the towers and positioning of <b>putlog</b> holes, and are usually ascribed to the influence of the Savoy architect Master James. The links between Conwy and Savoy are not straightforward, however, as in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built after James had left the region. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the Conwy project.|$|R
50|$|In 1189, Pembroke Castle was {{acquired}} by William Marshal. The Earl Marshal then set about turning the earth and wood fort into an impressive Norman stone castle. The inner ward, which was constructed first, contains the huge round keep with its domed roof. Its original first-floor entrance was through an external stairwell. Inside, a spiral stairwell connected its four stories. The keep's domed roof also has several <b>putlog</b> holes that supported a wooden fighting-platform. If the castle was attacked, the hoarding allowed defenders to go out beyond the keep's massive walls above {{the heads of the}} attackers.|$|R
500|$|The castle has a {{rectangular}} plan and {{is divided into}} an Inner and Outer Ward, separated by a cross-wall, with four large, [...] tall towers on each side; originally the castle would have been white-washed using a lime render. The outside of the towers still have the <b>putlog</b> holes from their original construction, where timbers were inserted to create a spiralling ramp for the builders. Although now somewhat decayed, the battlements originally sported triple finial designs and featured a sequence of square holes running along {{the outside of the}} walls. It is uncertain what these holes were used for – they may have been drainage holes, supports for defensive hoarding or for displaying ornamental shields.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} entrance {{was usually}} reached {{on a wooden}} or stone staircase or from a footbridge from {{another part of the}} building. Immediately in front of the entrance there was usually a wooden platform; on particularly long stairways there could be intermediate landings. A steep stairway and narrow landing in front of the entrance made it difficult for attackers to use heavy demolition equipment such as battering rams. Below the entranceway the corbels or <b>putlog</b> holes have often survived. Even the fixtures of the original wooden stairways are frequently still visible. In several cases, elevated entranceways built in the Late Middle Ages or Early Modern times were accessed by staircase towers with spiral staircases.|$|R
40|$|Local Name: Ciğlek DeresiLocal Information: The bridge, conduit, and tunnel {{are located}} on a small gully {{branching}} off {{the east side of}} the Ciğlek Deresi, a dry dere that runs north–south and connects to the Kepiz Çayı to the south. The Ciğlek Deresi forms the western limit of the Yahşiler plateau. The remains are located 4 km southwest of the modern village of Yahşiler, 2 km southeast of the modern village of Yeşilköy, and 16 km southeast of Aphrodisias. Latitude: 37. 36. 32. 024 Longitude: 28. 51. 40. 591 Elevation: 851. 3 mDescription: Preservation: The bridge that crossed the small gully north of the conduit no longer stands (E 034), but a cross section of the foundation, floor, and lower portion of the side walls of the conduit itself is preserved in the south hillside of the gully (E 035). The entire conduit is preserved inside the subterranean tunnel for 22 m, at which point the vault has collapsed. A short segment of conduit is preserved after this collapse, but a second collapse seals it off completely. ** Construction: Nothing can be said about the construction of the bridge that no longer stands (though see the projected original dimensions below). The conduit is a vaulted masonry structure built of regular blocks of the local sandy conglomerate rock, bonded with pink-beige lime mortar with densely packed stone inclusions smaller than 0. 01 m. The blocks are 0. 10 – 0. 40 m long, 0. 16 – 0. 20 m high, and ** 0. 15 – 0. 20 deep. Mortared rubble packing supports the exterior of the side walls and vault. The conduit floor also rests on a foundation of mortared rubble of smaller stones that is 0. 30 – 0. 35 m thick. The foundation is topped by a bedding of white-gray lime mortar ** with densely packed stone inclusions smaller than 0. 01 m. The mortar bedding is 0. 25 m thick under the center of the conduit floor but tapers to a thickness of 0. 10 m about 0. 20 – 0. 35 m from both edges of the floor. On top of this bedding is a very thin layer, 0. 001 m thick, of pink waterproofing mortar. On top of the pink waterproofing mortar is a layer of sinter, 0. 05 m thick. ** Description: The bridge must have originally been 5. 5 m high, 3. 8 m wide, and 8. 0 m long. The interior of the conduit is 1. 50 m wide and has a reconstructed height of 2. 25 m. Where the side walls are visible, they are 1. 15 m wide (east) and 1. 18 m wide (west). The portion of the conduit that has collapsed is 6. 7 m long. The preserved conduit within the hillside, which includes a 125 ° bend, can be divided into three segments according to differences in masonry. The first segment (as one enters the conduit from the north) is 8 m long on the outer side wall (west) of the bend and 7 m long on the inner (east) side wall, which is executed more sharply than the gently curving outer side wall. In this segment the vault is built of rubble masonry bonded with beige-pink lime mortar with small, loosely packed stone inclusions. A seam separates the rubble-vault segment from the next segment, which is 8. 8 m long and has a vault built of the same regular blocks as the side walls. The third segment has a vault of regular blocks, a portion of which has been rebuilt in rubble masonry with white-blue lime mortar with large, densely packed stone inclusions, most between 0. 005 m and 0. 012 m. The stones of the rebuilt portion are placed lengthwise across the width of the conduit and have a level profile, making it not a true vault at all. The <b>putlog</b> holes of the conduit are located at different heights within the three segments. They {{are located on}}e course lower in the regular-vault segment than in the other two segments. The <b>putlog</b> holes of the rubble-vault segment are set at intervals ranging from 0. 35 m to 1. 40 m in no clear pattern and are matched only roughly in pairs across the conduit. The <b>putlog</b> holes are set at shorter intervals at the inner part of the conduit curve. In the regular-vault segment, the <b>putlog</b> holes are set at intervals ranging between 0. 40 m and 2. 90 m, and are not matched across the conduit due to the bend. In the "false"-vault segment, the <b>putlog</b> holes are matched in pairs across the conduit, but those on the northeast side wall are located about 0. 14 m below those on the opposite side wall...|$|R
5|$|The Edwardian {{sites have}} strong {{architectural}} links to castles and town walls {{built in the}} kingdom of Savoy in North Italy during the same period. The resemblance between the two sets of buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of <b>putlog</b> holes, tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in Savoy these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La Bâtiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered {{to be the result of}} the influence of the Savoy architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other Savoyard architects with him to North Wales.|$|R
