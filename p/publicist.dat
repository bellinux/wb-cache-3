5000|$|Though {{there are}} many aspects to a <b>publicist's</b> job, their main {{function}} is to persuade the press to report about their client in the most positive way possible. <b>Publicists</b> are adept at identifying and pulling out [...] "newsworthy" [...] aspects of products and personalities to offer to the press as possible reportage ideas. <b>Publicists</b> offer this information to reporters in the specific format of a magazine, newspaper, TV or radio show, or online outlet. The third aspect of a <b>publicist's</b> job is to shape [...] "stories" [...] about their clients {{at a time that}} fits within a media outlet's news cycle.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Mariah Carey's fourteenth studio album, Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse, in May 2014, she parted ways with her record label Def Jam Recordings, her <b>publicist</b> Cindi Berger and her manager Jermaine Dupri. She signed a new record {{contract}} with L.A. Reid at Epic Records (who co-executively produced Carey's tenth album The Emancipation of Mimi in 2005), sought a new <b>publicist</b> with Chris Chambers of the Chamber Group and hired new managers Stella Bulochnikov and Brian Sher. Writers Shirley Halperin and Andrew Hampp of Billboard attributed Carey's decision to seek new a new label and management to the low sales of Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse, which at a total of 117,000 units since its release, is Carey's lowest selling album in the United States. Carey secured a multi-album record deal with Epic in January 2015, a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment, meaning that #1 to Infinity would be her first album since her seventh studio album Rainbow in 1999 to be released with Sony.|$|E

5|$|Geffen's press {{promotion}} for Nevermind {{was lower}} than that typical of a major record label. The label's <b>publicist</b> primarily targeted music publications with long lead times for publication as well as magazines in the Seattle area.

5|$|The next day, the K Foundation's <b>publicist,</b> Mick Houghton, {{claimed that}} the voting for the K Foundation's award was {{supposed}} to produce a tie, to illustrate the hypocrisy of the Turner award committee, but that strangely the result had been a huge margin of victory for Whiteread.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the influence of}} teachings of <b>publicists</b> {{on the development of}} international law. The category of ‘teachings of publicists’ is not a homogeneous one. The article argues that it can be divided into: entities that have been empowered by States to conclude teachings, such as the International Law Commission; expert groups, such as the Institut de Droit International; and ‘ordinary’ <b>publicists.</b> The teachings of ordinary <b>publicists</b> are also of different types and include digests, treatises, textbooks, monographs, journal articles, and blog posts. Only by breaking down the category into its various types can the influence of the teaching of <b>publicists</b> on the development of international law be properly gauged. Even then, it can prove rather difficult to pin down the notion of ‘influence’. Standard assessments of influence focus {{on the extent to which}} teachings are cited by courts and tribunals, in particular by the International Court of Justice. However, that approach privileges the role of courts and tribunals in the development of international law and overlooks the role of other actors. As such, the present article offers a different assessment of influence. It identifies the actors that comprise the community of international lawyers and analyses the various interactions that take place between these actors and the teachings of <b>publicists.</b> It is through this interaction, of which citation is but part, that the influence of the teachings of <b>publicists</b> can properly be determined...|$|R

5|$|According to The Wall Street Journal {{and diverse}} news sites, the 750 million units sold by Michael Jackson is an {{inflated}} figure that was initially claimed by Raymone Bain (2006), {{who was the}} singer's <b>publicist</b> at that time, without any factual evidence and probably {{in an effort to}} promote album sales. From 2006 until present time, several sources such as RIAA, Rolling Stone, and Time have claimed that Michael Jackson has sold 750 million units (or even 1 billion), however, Adrian Strain, a representative from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has said that this figure is unreal.|$|E

5|$|Caion {{was still}} {{carrying}} on as a <b>publicist</b> and historian, with a study about the ancient Bacchanalia. It was simultaneously published in Paris and Bucharest (1901). That year, with Carol Göbl press, he also published a devotional text, Isus, fragment ("Jesus, A Fragment"). The theme of decadence continued to fuel Caion's essays: in Carmen magazine (September 1902), he covered Castanier's Lotus du Gange, implicitly advertising the book's lewd content and titillating illustrations. His {{take on the}} Caragiale affair was outlined in the Carol Göbl essay Moravuri literare în 1902 ("Literary Morals as of 1902").|$|E

50|$|Hollywood <b>publicists</b> {{create and}} manage {{relationships}} between film {{stars and the}} array of other media channels through which the identities of stars are circulated. Stars have a dual relationship with publicity, for they publicize films but also, and importantly in the freelance market, {{have an interest in}} self publicity. It is for the latter reason that while many stars continue to regard managers as an optional luxury, today the majority of stars in Hollywood hire <b>publicists</b> to manage their media visibility. In other words, celebrities hire <b>publicists</b> who {{will be able to get}} their name out to the public preferably in a positive light.|$|R
