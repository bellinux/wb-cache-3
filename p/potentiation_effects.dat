50|$|Toxicity can {{be broken}} down into two broad {{categories}} of direct and indirect toxicity. Direct toxicity results from a toxicant acting at the site of action in or on the organism. Indirect toxicity occurs with a change in the physical, chemical, or biological environment. Lethality is most common effect used in toxicology and used as an endpoint for acute toxicity tests. While conducting chronic toxicity tests sublethal effects are endpoints that are looked at. These endpoints include behavioral, physiological, biochemical, histological changes. There are a number of effects that occur when an organism is simultaneously exposed to two or more toxicants. These effects include additive effects, synergistic effects, <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects,</b> and antagonistic effects. An additive effect occurs when combined effect is equal to a combination or sum of the individual effects. A synergistic effect occurs when the combination of effects is much greater than the two individual effects added together. Potentiation is an effect that occurs when an individual chemical has no effect is added to a toxicant and the combination has a greater effect than just the toxicant alone. Finally, an antagonistic effect occurs when a combination of chemicals has less of an effect than the sum of their individual effects.|$|E

Methods: Thirty four male (n = 17) and female (n = 17) university students with experience in rowing took part in this study conducted across three weeks. Following familiarisation of the 10 -second maximal rowing performance test on a rowing ergometer during Week 1, participants were randomly allocated to either complete a control or experimental session during Week 2 and 3. One rowing performance test was conducted during the control session whilst two rowing performance tests were conducted during the experimental session separated by 6 -minutes. The first rowing performance test during the experimental session was used to: 1) compare measures with the control session to assess day-to-day repeatability; and 2) induce post-activation <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> for the second rowing performance test.

40|$|Anthracene- 9 -carboxylic acid (9 -AC) {{has been}} {{reported}} to show both <b>potentiation</b> and inhibitory <b>effects</b> on guinea-pig cardiac cAMP-activated chloride channels via two different binding sites, and inhibition of Mg 2 +-sensitive protein phosphatases has been proposed for the mechanism of 9 -AC <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect.</b> In this study, we examined the effects of 9 -AC on wild-type and mutant human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channels expressed in NIH 3 T 3 or CHO cells. 9 -AC inhibits whole-cell CFTR current in a voltage-dependent manner, whereas the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> is not affected by membrane potentials. Anthracene- 9 -methanol, an electro-neutral 9 -AC analog, fails to block CFTR, but shows a nearly identical <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect,</b> corroborating the idea that two chemically distinct sites are responsible, respectively, for potentiation and inhibitory actions of 9 -AC. 9 -AC also enhances the activity of ΔR-CFTR, a constitutively active CFTR mutant whose R-domain is removed. In excised inside-out patches, 9 -AC increases Po by prolonging the mean burst durations and shortening the interburst durations. We therefore conclude that two different 9 -AC binding sites for <b>potentiation</b> and inhibitory <b>effects</b> on CFTR channels are located outside of the R-domain. We also speculate that 9 -AC potentiates CFTR activity by directly affecting CFTR gating...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} whether the human cerebellum takes part in fear conditioned potentiation of the acoustic blink reflex.  METHODS—A group of 10 cerebellar patients (eight patients with lesions involving the medial cerebellum, two patients with circumscribed lesions of the cerebellar hemispheres) was {{compared with a}} group of 16 age and sex matched healthy control subjects. The fear conditioned potentiation paradigm consisted of three phases. During the first, habituation phase subjects received 20 successive acoustic blink stimuli. In the subsequent fear conditioning phase, subjects passed through 20 paired presentations of the unconditioned fear stimulus (US; an electric shock) and the conditioned stimulus (CS; a light). Thereafter, subjects underwent the potentiation phase, which consisted of a pseudorandom order of 12 trials of the acoustic blink stimulus alone, 12 acoustic blink stimuli paired with the conditioned stimulus, and six conditioned stimuli paired with the unconditioned stimulus. The EMG of the acoustic blink reflex was recorded at the orbicularis oculi muscles. The <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> was determined as the difference in normalised peak amplitude of the blink reflex evoked by pairs of CS and acoustic blink stimuli and evoked by the acoustic stimulus alone.  RESULTS—In the habituation phase, short term habituation of the acoustic blink reflex was preserved in all cerebellar patients. However, in the potentiation phase, the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of the blink reflex was significantly reduced in patients with medial cerebellar lesions compared with the controls (mean (SD) <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> (%), patients: − 6. 4 (15. 3), controls: 21. 6 (35. 6)), but was within normal limits in the two patients with lateral lesions.  CONCLUSIONS—The present findings suggest that the human medial cerebellum is involved in associative learning of non-specific aversive reactions—that is, the fear conditioned potentiation of the acoustic blink reflex. ...|$|R

40|$|Chemical openers for KCNQ {{potassium}} {{channels are}} useful probes both for understanding channel gating and for developing therapeutics. The five KCNQ isoforms (KCNQ 1 to KCNQ 5, or Kv 7. 1 to Kv 7. 5) are differentially localized. Therefore, the molecular specificity of chemical openers {{is an important}} subject of investigation. Native KCNQ 1 normally exists in complex with auxiliary subunits known as KCNE. In cardiac myocytes, the KCNQ 1 -KCNE 1 (IsK or minK) channel is thought to underlie the IKs current, a component critical for membrane repolarization during cardiac action potential. Hence, the molecular and pharmacological differences between KCNQ 1 and KCNQ 1 -KCNE 1 channels have been important topics. Zinc pyrithione (ZnPy) is a newly identified KCNQ channel opener, which potently activates KCNQ 2, KCNQ 4, and KCNQ 5. However, the ZnPy effects on cardiac KCNQ 1 potassium channels remain largely unknown. Here we show that ZnPy effectively augments the KCNQ 1 current, exhibiting an increase in current amplitude, reduction of inactivation, and slowing of both activation and deactivation. Some of these are reminiscent of effects by KCNE 1. In addition, neither the heteromultimeric KCNQ 1 -KCNE 1 channels nor native IKs current displayed any sensitivity to ZnPy, indicating that the static occupancy by a KCNE subunit desensitizes the reversible effects by a chemical opener. Site-directed mutagenesis of KCNQ 1 reveals that residues critical for the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> by either ZnPy or KCNE are clustered together in the S 6 region overlapping with the critical gating determinants. Thus, the convergence of <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> and molecular determinants critical for both an auxiliary subunit and a chemical opener argue for a mechanistic overlap in causing potentiation...|$|E
40|$|In {{quantifying}} type B <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects,</b> given earlier merely qualitatively, it {{is found}} that Zn 2 +, 1 — 50 µM, causes increases in action potential duration, twitch tension, and twitch contraction period time, which are all directly proportional to the log of the concentration. Hence, the duration of the action potential, i. e. the magnitude of its mechanically effective period, is a causal factor quantitatively determining the degree of mechanical activation in the isometric twitch. In higher concentrations of Zn 2 + up to 1000 µM, the spike duration and the contraction time continue to increase but the twitch tension is disproportionately smaller, evidently because the high zinc (500 — 1000 µM) raises the mechanical threshold of excitation-contraction (E—C) coupling and reduces the intrinsic strength of the contractile system. Eserine (1. 5 mM) and also high Zn 2 + not only cause type B <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects,</b> but also slow the rise of the spike, thus causing retardation of the very onset of tension production, which is even greater for high Zn 2 + because of the raised mechanical threshold. This retardation is then succeeded by the faster tension output characteristic of type B potentiation resulting from spike prolongation. Thus, the changes in the consecutive, rising and falling phases of the action potential explicitly register their separate effects in the respective very earliest and directly following periods of twitch output; i. e., each phase of the action potential produces its own mechanical "transform. " These transforms, and other effects, suggest that the release of activator Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during E—C coupling can be graded in both the rate and the total amount of the release...|$|E

40|$|Background: Neurosteroids have various {{physiological}} and neuropsychopharmacological effects. In {{addition to the}} genomic effects of steroids, some neurosteroids modulate several neurotransmitter receptors and channels, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, c-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors, and s 1 receptors, and voltage-gated Ca 2 + and K + channels. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the various effects of neurosteroids {{have not yet been}} sufficiently clarified. In the nervous system, inwardly rectifying K + (Kir) channels also play important roles in the control of resting membrane potential, cellular excitability and K + homeostasis. Among constitutively active Kir 2 channels in a major Kir subfamily, Kir 2. 3 channels are expressed predominantly in the forebrain, a brain area related to cognition, memory, emotion, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study examined the effects of various neurosteroids on Kir 2. 3 channels using the Xenopus oocyte expression assay. In oocytes injected with Kir 2. 3 mRNA, only pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS), among nine neurosteroids tested, reversibly potentiated Kir 2. 3 currents. The <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> was concentration-dependent in the micromolar range, and the current-voltage relationship showed inward rectification. However, the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of PREGS was not observed when PREGS was applied intracellularly and was not affected by extracellular pH conditions...|$|R

Pharmacological concentrations of aspirin and ibuprofen (10 (- 8) - 10 (- 4) M), potentiated histamine (10 (- 6) - 10 (- 4) M) and forskolin (10 (- 5) M) stimulated pepsinogen secretion without affecting basal secretion, acetylcholine (10 (- 6) M) stimulated pepsinogen secretion or cell vitality. Augmentation of secretagogue stimulated pepsinogen secretion {{was dependent on}} extracellular calcium because potentiation was abolished by calcium depletion of the medium. Cimetidine inhibited the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> on histamine but not on forskolin stimulated pepsinogen secretion, thus suggesting that this augmentation was independent of histamine H 2 receptors. Of interest, potentiation was also independent of endogenous prostaglandin inhibition because exogenous addition of prostaglandin E 2 and D 2 increased both basal and acetylcholine stimulated pepsinogen secretion in a dose dependent way, {{but they did not}} modify histamine or histamine plus aspirin or ibuprofen stimulated pepsinogen secretion. In conclusion, aspirin and ibuprofen potentiate secretagogue stimulated pepsinogen secretion by dispersed human peptic cells and this might be an additional mechanism of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced gastric injury.

40|$|AbstractThe {{hypothesis}} that synaptic functions can be regulated by neurotrophins secreted from the postsynaptic cell was examined in Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures. Neuromuscular synapses formed on myocytes overexpressing neurotrophin- 4 (M+ synapses) exhibited {{a higher level}} of spontaneous synaptic activity and enhanced evoked synaptic transmission as compared to those formed on normal control myocytes (M− synapses). The NT- 4 effects involve a potentiation of presynaptic transmitter secretion as well as a lengthening of the mean burst duration of postsynaptic low conductance acetylcholine channels. Repetitive stimulation of either the presynaptic neuron or the postsynaptic myocyte led to a potentiation of synaptic transmission at M+ synapses. All <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> of NT- 4 overexpression were abolished by the extracellular presence of TrkB-IgG but not by the presence of TrkA-IgG, indicating that postsynaptic secretion of NT- 4 was responsible for the synaptic modification...|$|E

40|$|At {{vertebrate}} neuromuscular junctions, ATP {{is known}} to stabilize acetylcholine in the synaptic vesicles and to be co-released with it. We have shown previously that a nucleotide receptor, P 2 Y(1) receptor, is localized at the nmjs, and we propose that this mediates a trophic role for synaptic ATP there. In cultured myotubes, the activation of P 2 Y(1) receptors modulated agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) aggregation in a potentiation manner. This <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> in agrin-induced AChR aggregation was reduced by antagonizing the P 2 Y(1) receptors. The guanosine triphosphatase RhoA was shown {{to be responsible for}} this P 2 Y(1) -potentiated effect. The localization of RhoA in rat and chicken skeletal muscles was restricted at the neuromuscular junctions. Application of P 2 Y(1) agonists in cultured myotubes induced RhoA activation, which showed an additive effect with agrin-induced RhoA activation. Over-expression of dominant-negative mutant of RhoA in cultured myotubes diminished the agrin-induced AChR aggregation, as well as the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of P 2 Y(1) -specific agonist. Application of UTP in the cultures also triggered similar responses as did 2 -methylthioadenosine 5 'diphosphate, suggesting the involvement of other subtypes of P 2 Y receptors. These results demonstrate that RhoA could serve as a downstream mediator of signaling mediated by P 2 Y(1) receptor and agrin, which therefore synergizes the effects of the two neuron-derived trophic factors in modulating the formation and/or maintenance of post-synaptic apparatus at the neuromuscular junctions...|$|R

We recently demonstrated that DCF-induced toxicity in HepaRG decreases as they express DCF-metabolizing enzymes. DCF metabolism promotes toxicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing heterologous cytochromes-P 450. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) {{is used to}} treat diverse medical conditions due to its multiple properties (antioxidant, metal chelator, thiol-disulfide disruption). The latter property accounts for its mucolytic effects and broadens its potential molecular targets to signal transduction proteins, ABC transporters and others. Interaction of NAC with DCF effects depends on the experimental model. This study aims to investigate NAC/DCF interaction and the involvement of ABC transporters in wild type and mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DCF inhibited yeast growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner and the cells started adapting to DCF 24 -h post-treatment. NAC potentiated DCF-induced toxicity if added prior or parallel to DCF. Pretreatment with NAC increased its <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> and compromised cells adaption to DCF. Post-treatment with NAC potentiated DCF toxicity without compromising adaptation. Moreover, mutant strains in ABC transporters Pdr 5, Yor 1, Bpt 1 or Pdr 15, were more sensitive to DCF; while mutant strains in Pdr 5, Vmr 1 or Pdr 12 were more sensitive to NAC/DCF interaction. DCF[*]±[*]NAC elicited on the mutant strain in Yap 1, an oxidative stress-related protein, the same effects as on the wild type. Therefore, oxidative stress {{does not seem to}} be key actor in DCF toxicity in our model.

In type II AC-expressing mouse RAW 264. 7 macrophages, we showed that LPA at 3 – 50 [*]μM increased cyclic AMP formation in a concentration-dependent manner, the effect being additive with that of forskolin or cholera toxin, and synergistic with that of prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) or isoproterenol. The <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of LPA was unaffected by the removal of serum or pertussis toxin treatment. Both colchicine and cytochalasin B potentiated the cyclic AMP response to PGE 1, the effect being additive to that of LPA. On studying the regulation of type II AC by protein kinase C (PKC), phorbol 12 -myristate- 13 acetate (PMA) potentiated the PGE 1 -elicited cyclic AMP response, this effect being non-additive to that of LPA, suggesting that PKC activation was the common mechanism involved in AC potentiation by LPA and PMA. PKC inhibitor Ro 31 - 8220, but not Go 6976, significantly inhibited the LPA-induced cyclic AMP <b>potentiation.</b> The <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of LPA was unaffected by long-term treatment with PMA, {{which resulted in the}} down-regulation of PKCα, βI, βII and PKCδ, but not PKCε, μ, λ and ζ.

We identified and characterized a group of sulfonamide compounds—sulfameter, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfabenzamide, and sulfachloropyridazine—among the various isolated candidate molecules.

However, in plants or humans, i. e., following intake via inhalation or ingestion, linalool undergoes metabolic modifications including oxygenation and acetylation, which may affect the modulatory efficacy of the generated linalool derivatives.

Flight time, ground contact time (CT), peak force, reactive strength index (RSI), and leg-spring stiffness were the dependent variables.

Similarly, the results for the RBJ indicated that the fatigue workout significantly reduced FT (p < 0. 001), peak force (p < 0. 01), RSI (p < 0. 01), and significantly increased CT (p < 0. 05) at the 15 -second interval.

We demonstrate that BBR is also an activator of voltage-gated KCNQ potassium channels. In cultured recombinant cells, BBR exhibited significant <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> on KCNQ channels comparable to previously reported classical activators. In native dorsal root ganglion neurons, BBR effectively overcame the suppression of KCNQ currents, and the resultant neuronal hyperexcitability caused by inflammatory mediators, such as bradykinin (BK).

Notably, the analgesic effects of BBR are largely mediated through peripheral and not through central KCNQ channels, an observation supported both by pharmacokinetic studies and in vivo experiments. Moreover, multiple residues in the superficial part of the voltage sensing domain of KCNQ channels were identified critical for the potentiation activity of BBR by a molecular determinant investigation.

One possible mechanism for such <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> of opiates is {{the interaction of the}} mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the chemokine receptor CCR 5 (CCR 5), a known HIV- 1 co-receptor, to form MOR-CCR 5 heterodimer. In an attempt to understand this putative interaction and its relevance to neuroAIDS, we designed and synthesized a series of bivalent ligands targeting the putative CCR 5 -MOR heterodimer. To understand how these bivalent ligands may interact with the heterodimer, biological studies including calcium mobilization inhibition, binding affinity, HIV- 1 invasion, and cell fusion assays were applied. In particular, HIV- 1 infection assays using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and astrocytes revealed a notable synergy in activity for one particular bivalent ligand. Further, a molecular model of the putative CCR 5 -MOR heterodimer was constructed, docked with the bivalent ligand, and molecular dynamics simulations of the complex was performed in a membrane-water system to help understand the biological observation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine changes of {{presynaptic}} voltagesensitive calcium channel (VSCC) subtypes during synapse formation and regeneration {{in relation to}} transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Synaptic potentials were recorded from developing rat NMJs and from regenerating mouse and frog NMJs. As in normal adult NMJs, evoked transmitter release was reduced by an N-type VSCC blocker in the frog and by a P/Q-type VSCC blocker in the mammal at immature NMJs; however, various L-type VSCC blockers, both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine antagonists, increased evoked but not spontaneous release in a dose-dependent manner at newly formed NMJs. This presynaptic potentiation disappeared as NMJs matured. A rapid intracellular Ca 2 � buffer, bis(O-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N�,N�-tetra-acetic acid-AM, prevented the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of nifedipine, but a slow Ca 2...|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} in the maximal voluntary concentric torque was found only immediately after the conditioning contraction although the {{increase in}} isometric twitch torque was observed five minutes after conditioning contraction. This difference {{can be explained by}} sensitivity to the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of a conditioning contraction (i.e., myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation which is considered to be the primary mechanism of PAP) (Sweeney et al. 1993). Ca 2 + concentration is much higher in the maximal voluntary concentric contraction (multiple impulses) than in twitch contraction (single impulse). In addition, the extent of increase in torque by conditioning contraction becomes smaller when the Ca 2 + concentration is higher (Persechini et al. 1985). Thus, the increasing effect of the maximal voluntary concentric torque would have diminished faster than that in the isometric twitch torque.|$|R
40|$|Background: Inflammation is {{a highly}} complex {{biological}} response evoked by many stimuli. A persistent challenge in modeling this dynamic process has been the (nonlinear) nature of the response that precludes the single-variable assumption. Systems-based approaches offer a promising possibility for understanding inflammation in its homeostatic context. In order to study the underlying complexity of the acute inflammatory response, an agent-based framework is developed that models the emerging host response as the outcome of orchestrated interactions associated with intricate signaling cascades and intercellular immune system interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings: An agent-based modeling (ABM) framework is proposed to study the nonlinear dynamics of acute human inflammation. The model is implemented using NetLogo software. Interacting agents involve either inflammation-specific molecules or cells essential for the propagation of the inflammatory reaction across the system. Spatial orientation of molecule interactions involved in signaling cascades coupled with the cellular heterogeneity are further taken into account. The proposed in silico model is evaluated through its ability to successfully reproduce a selflimited inflammatory response {{as well as a}} series of scenarios indicative of the nonlinear dynamics of the response. Such scenarios involve either a persistent (non) infectious response or innate immune tolerance and <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> followed by perturbations in intracellular signaling molecules and cascades...|$|E
40|$|Ca 2 +-dependent K+ and Cl- {{currents}} {{were recorded}} in isolated and dialyzed rat lacrimal gland cells by use of the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. Under control conditions, application of acetylcholine (0. 5 - 1. 0 microM) resulted in {{the full activation of}} both types of current. When 50 - 200 microM guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S], a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue) was added to the intracellular solution, activation of both currents was seen with 1 nM acetylcholine, a dose 1 / 100 th that needed under control conditions. Dialysis with solutions containing 200 microM GTP or cAMP had no, or only slight, <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects.</b> The effects of GTP[S] were obtained only when ATP was included in the intracellular solution. The potentiated responses to acetylcholine were blocked by increasing 10 -fold the intracellular Ca 2 +-buffering capacity and were not dependent on external Ca 2 +. Thus, the potentiated responses appeared to result from a release of Ca 2 + from internal stores. GTP[S] also greatly potentiated the Ca 2 +-dependent adrenergic (norepinephrine) response of this preparation. In addition, GTP[S] elicited in some cells transient responses without application of acetylcholine or norepinephrine. Finally, rapid and sustained responses were seen as soon as the cells were dialyzed with inositol trisphosphate (20 microM). These findings are discussed in terms of a possible role of a GTP-binding protein as a link between activation of muscarinic or adrenergic receptors and initiation of Ca 2 + release by inositol trisphosphate...|$|E
40|$|The neocortex of awake {{animals is}} {{resistant}} to the induction of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). To determine if intense stimulation patterned after the theta (4 - 12 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythm may be effective in inducing synaptic plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex, LTP induction was examined in vivo using single 300 -Hz trains and paired trains delivered at a 100 -ms interval. Consistent with previous findings, single 300 -Hz trains caused a reduction of the early monosynaptic field potential component, reflecting UP of inputs to layer V, and a facilitation of the late polysnaptic component, reflecting the spread of activation across layer V. In response to paired trains, however, there was minimal change in the early component and a much larger increase in the late component as compared to single 300 -Hz trains. To investigate the mechanisms mediating the effectiveness of paired trains in inducing UP, an NMDA receptor antagonist was administered and effects on responses to UP induction stimuli and short-pulse trains at theta-frequency were assessed. NMDA-receptor antagonism reduced the early and late component amplitudes {{and the amount of}} short-term facilitation observed during repetitive stimulation. This indicates that theta-patterned stimulation induces short-term <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> that involve substantial NMDA-receptor mediated synaptic currents. Therefore, the enhanced induction of UP in the neocortex induced by paired trains versus 300 -Hz trains is likely due to enhanced NMDA receptor activation. These results suggest that learning-related plasticity in the sensorimotor neocortex may be promoted by rhythmic, population activity at theta-frequency...|$|E

A study {{of a series of}} such compounds suggested that active compounds had the structure R-O-NH 2, substitution of a nitrogen led to total loss of activity. The locus of the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> was traced to the inhibition of diamine oxidase. A new series of aliphatic and aromatic O-alkylhydroxylamines were synthesized to explore further the structure-activity relations of this effect. The poten-tiating effects of these compounds were determined by exam-ining the changes in short circuit current (Isc) produced by histamine and from the activity of a soluble preparation of diamine oxidase. We found that 1) branched compounds are less active than their straight chain counterparts, 2) greater steric bulk of the aliphatic substituent decreased activity, 3) th...|$|R
40|$|Insulin {{secretion}} from pancreatic β-cells {{in response}} to sudden glucose stimulation is biphasic. Prolonged secretion in vivo requires synthesis, delivery to the plasma membrane (PM) and exocytosis of insulin secretory granules (SGs). Here, we provide the first agent-based space-resolved model for SG dynamics in pancreatic β-cells. Using recent experimental data, we consider a single β-cell with identical SGs moving on a phenomenologically represented cytoskeleton network. A single exocytotic machinery mediates SG exocytosis on the PM. This novel model reproduces the measured spatial organization of SGs and insulin secretion patterns under different stimulation protocols. It proposes that the insulin <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> and the rising second-phase secretion are mainly due to {{the increasing number of}} docking sites on the PM. Furthermore, it shows that 6 min after glucose stimulation, the 'newcomer' SGs are recruited from a region within less than 600 nm from the PM...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRegulation of {{inositol}} phospholipid hydrolysis by UTP and UDP in neuroblastoma×glioma {{hybrid cell}} line NG 108 - 15 was potentiated {{in the presence}} of ATP. The effect of ATP was dose dependent and shifted the EC 50 value for these uracil nucleotides up to three powers of magnitude, having no influence on the maximal value of the response. Adenine nucleotides (ADP, AMP, adenosine 5 ′-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS), β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (βγMeATP), 3 ′-O-(4 -benzoyl) benzoyl ATP (BzATP) and 3 ′-deoxyadenosine 5 ′-O-(1 -thio) triphosphate (dATPαS)) as well as adenosine, had no influence on the pyrimidinoceptor response. The <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> was abolished by excess of EDTA. The results were in agreement with the hypothesis of pyrimidinoceptor affinity regulation via extracellular phosphorylation of the receptor protein, initiated by ATP. This mechanism may have physiological implication for functioning of uracil nucleotides as endogenous signaling molecules...|$|R
