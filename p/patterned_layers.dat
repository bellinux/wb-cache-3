40|$|ABSTRACT. This work {{shows that}} the zone casting- a method for the {{solution}} casting based fabrication of oriented anisotropic layers of organic materials- can also be applied to fabrication of <b>patterned</b> <b>layers.</b> In this method, solution is continuously supplied onto the substrate withdrawn at a controlled rate and the solvent evaporates {{from the surface of}} meniscus formed between a flat nozzle and the substrate. Due to the presence of the gradient of the solute concentration, its solidification proceeds within the narrow zone localized in the meniscus. In this way solute molecules can be self-assembled at surfaces into different anisotropic nanostructures (columns, rods, lamellae or crystals) uniaxially aligned parallel to the substrate. Under some conditions various phenomena like e. g. dewetting, fingering instability, stick-slip motion etc come into play leading to various periodic interruptions in the film deposition. Examples of continuous and <b>patterned</b> <b>layers</b> of different materials such as low molecular weight (semi) conductors, chromophores, discotic molecules and block copolymers, which can successfully be processed using this technique, are shown.

40|$|Abstract—The {{two most}} {{important}} abilities for a robot {{to survive in a}} given environment are selecting and learning the most appropriate actions in a given situation. Historically, they have also been the biggest problems in robotics. To help solve this problem, we propose a two-layered action selection mechanism (ASM) which designates an action <b>pattern</b> <b>layer</b> and a reactive behavior plan layer. In the reactive behavior plan layer, a task is selected by comparing behavior motiva-tion values that, in an animal, correspond to external stimuli as well as internal states due to hormones. After a task is selected, its corresponding reactive behavior plan is executed as a set of sequential dynamic behavior motivations (DBMs), each of which is associated with an action pattern. In the action <b>pattern</b> <b>layer,</b> each action <b>pattern</b> can be functionally decomposed into primitive motor actions. Shortest Path-based Q-Learning (SPQL) is incorporated into both the reactive behavior plan and action <b>pattern</b> <b>layers.</b> In the reactive behavior plan layer, relationships between perceptions and action patterns are learned to satisfy a given motivation, as well as the relative priorities of these relationships. In the action <b>pattern</b> <b>layer,</b> the relations between sensory states and primitive motor actions can be learned. To establish the validity of our proposed ASM, experiments with our real designed robot will be illustrated together with simulations...|$|R
