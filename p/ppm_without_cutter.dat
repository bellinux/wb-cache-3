This approach can result in more power-efficient realizations of the studied schemes. It is shown that our decoding approach can achieve near maximum likelihood decoding performance based on the trellis, while having a significantly lower decoding complexity. In addition, by exploiting the inherent advantage of PPM transmission, it is possible to reduce the candidate list to further simplify the decoding for RS-coded <b>PPM</b> <b>without</b> losing coding gain.
