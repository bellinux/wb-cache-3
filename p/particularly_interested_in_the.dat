5|$|The British government's {{principal}} {{interest in}} Japan was to renew pre-war trade concessions, and to secure new ones; it was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{port city of}} Kobe. The Americans blocked these attempts. Robertson clashed repeatedly with Lieutenant General Sir Charles Gairdner, the official representative of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Gairdner was nominally senior in rank to Robertson until March 1947, when Robertson was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, backdated to January 1944. Robertson resisted Gairdner's requests for BCOF aircraft for personal purposes.|$|E
5|$|The band {{were well}} known for their strong stage act, and had privately {{recorded}} several shows, or broadcast them on radio, but were unenthusiastic about recording a live album until their Japanese record company {{decided it would be}} good for publicity. They insisted on supervising the live production, including using Martin Birch, who had previously collaborated with the band, as engineer, and were not <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> album's release, even after recording. The tour was successful, with strong media interest and a positive response from fans.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{mission of}} the Marine Corps has been to perform an amphibious landing, and they were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> JVX program. They realized that a concentrated strike force was vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon, airborne solutions with good speed and range allowed for significant dispersal; and their CH-46s were wearing out; without replacement, {{the threat of a}} merger between the Marine Corps and the Army lingered, similar to President Truman's proposal following World War II. The OSD and Navy administration were against the tiltrotor project, but congressional pressure eventually proved persuasive.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Most Holy Synod, Peter concerned himself with improvements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> improving <b>the</b> education of the clerics, since many were illiterate and unable to administer sacraments.|$|R

5|$|The {{larger the}} {{population}} {{size of the}} G. cruciata, the more flowers and seeds the plant produces; however, {{there is also a}} positive link between the population size of the G. cruciata and the frequency of P. rebeli parasitizing the plant. Researchers are <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> G. cruciata plant because both the P. rebeli and G. cruciata are endangered. As a result, lepidopterists believe that conserving the P. rebeli requires focusing conservation efforts on preserving G. cruciata as well.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Wordie {{organised}} {{an expedition}} to North West Greenland to investigate cosmic radiation at high latitudes and great altitudes. He assembled a team of ten men, nine of whom were from Cambridge University, among them Lethbridge and two other archaeologists. Setting sail in June 1937, Lethbridge undertook excavations of Eskimo sites at Rhyder Island, Cary Island, North West Island, and Isbjörn Island. On returning home in October 1937, {{it was decided that}} various geographical features encountered would be named after team members, and thus two lakes on Baffin Island were named the Lethbridge Lakes. During the trip, Lethbridge became <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> design of Eskimo boats, resulting in the self-publication of his 11-page booklet, Umiak – the European Ancestry of the 'Women's Boat, in 1937. He followed this with a second book, The Fishermen of Durness (1938), in which he argued that a study of contemporary traditional fishing communities could inform archaeologists more about ancient boat-making and fishing.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Grant befriended {{the occult}} artist Austin Osman Spare, and in ensuing years helped to {{publicise}} Spare's artwork {{through a series}} of publications. During the 1950s he also came to be increasingly interested in Hinduism, exploring the teachings of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi and publishing a range of articles on the topic. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hindu tantra, incorporating ideas from it into the Thelemic practices of sex magic. On Germer's death in 1969, Grant proclaimed himself Outer Head of the O.T.O.; this title was disputed by the American Grady McMurtry, who took control of the O.T.O. Grant's Order became known as the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis, operating from his Golders Green home. In 1959 he began publishing on the subject of occultism, and proceeded to author the Typhonian Trilogies, {{as well as a number}} of novels, books of poetry, and publications devoted to propagating the work of Crowley and Spare.|$|E
5|$|The naval {{section of}} Alsos flew into Paris soon {{after it had}} been liberated in August 1944. They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the {{captured}} German destroyer Z39. After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb, the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe. They were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work of Dr Hellmuth Walter {{in the development of}} submarines and rockets. Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector, so they worked closely with their English allies. In {{the last days of the}} war, the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75-man task force, most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit, that made a dash for Kiel, entering the city far in advance of the Allied advance. The whole garrison of the city, some 150,000 men, surrendered to the task force. They drove to Admiral Karl Dönitz's headquarters in Flensburg, where they saw but did not speak with him, as Dönitz was on his way to surrender. They spoke instead to Admiral Otto Backenköhler, and persuaded him to sign a release for German scientists, so men like Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies. From April to December 1945, Mumma also served as assistant naval attaché.|$|E
25|$|Lowell became {{determined}} to study Mars and astronomy {{as a full-time}} career after reading Camille Flammarion's La planète Mars.

25|$|Huxley {{analysed}} {{the causes}} of this, such as overpopulation, {{as well as all}} the means by which populations can be controlled. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effects of drugs and subliminal suggestion. Brave New World Revisited is different in tone because of Huxley's evolving thought, as well as his conversion to Hindu Vedanta in the interim between the two books.|$|E
40|$|Six {{replicate}} {{sites of}} Betula- Faguswere located at Epping Forest. Between June to October 1990 and April to May 1991 pitfall traps {{were used to}} sample the Invertebrate fauna. Each site was surveyed {{and a series of}} environmental factors were recorded. Sorting and identification of the catch was undertaken and the invertebrate data (with <b>particularly</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carabids) was analysed using DECORANA, CANOCO and TWINSPAN. The four major environmental gradients affecting carabid distribution were found to be: humidity, ground temperature, light and vegetation cover. Predictive equations determining species abundance under specific environmental conditions were produced and conservation implications of the work were discussed...|$|R

25|$|The Project {{was delighted}} by the RC-1 proposal, and several well-publicized stories about it followed. They were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{way that it}} allowed them to have market flexibility; the RC-1 could reach {{pipelines}} in Cochrane, Ontario, {{any one of the}} existing pipe heads in Alberta, or any point between. If market demands changed, they could simply ship the gas to a different location, thereby avoiding the cycling of prices seen between the various points on the pipeline network.|$|E
25|$|German {{aircraft}} often {{flew over}} the British Empire lines at the first light and were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jericho and lower Jordan area where on 9 June a highflying Rumpler, was forced to land near Jisr ed Damieh, after fighting and striving during five minutes of close combat at 16,000 feet to get {{the advantage of the}} Australian pilots. These dawn patrols also visited the Lubban–road sector of the front (north of Jerusalem on the Nablus road) and the coast sector.|$|E
25|$|By {{this phase}} in his career, Aderca was {{establishing}} {{his reputation as}} a magazine columnist and theater chronicler, one <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of modernism in Weimar Germany and in Italy. His 1922 articles include an overview of Italian Futurism. Published in the Craiova-based journal Năzuința, it argued that the movement had set the stage for innovation not just in art, but also in everyday life and in politics. For a while in 1923, he tried his hand at publishing his own magazine, titled Spre Ziuă ("Toward Daylight").|$|E
