5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely <b>perfect,</b> <b>as</b> it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect {{continued}} their feud, although Flair legitimately requested {{to be released}} from his WWF contract in order to return to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). His request was granted on the condition that he help build up <b>Perfect</b> <b>as</b> a credible babyface. The two men attacked each other during the battle royal at Royal Rumble 1993, and Perfect eliminated Flair from the match. The following night, Perfect defeated Flair in a loser leaves town match. Flair did not return to the WWF until McMahon purchased WCW in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Martin Sieff, United Press International (December 25, 2001) — The great veteran actor Maury Chaykin {{was born}} to play Nero.

25|$|Aside {{from the}} rise of Marxism, E. Screpanti and S. Zamagni point to a {{different}} 'external' reason for marginalism's success, which is its successful response to the Long Depression and the resurgence of class conflict in all developed capitalist economies after the 1848-1870 period of social peace. Marginalism, Screpanti and Zamagni argue, offered a theory {{of the free market}} as <b>perfect,</b> <b>as</b> performing optimal allocation of resources, while it allowed economists to blame any adverse effects of laissez-faire economics on the interference of workers' coalitions in the proper functioning of the market.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that much of the}} farming done at Machu Picchu was done on the {{hundreds}} of man-made terraces there. These terraces were a work of considerable engineering, built to ensure good drainage and soil fertility while also protecting the mountain itself from erosion and landslides. However, the terraces were not <b>perfect,</b> <b>as</b> studies of the land show that there were landslides that happened during the construction of Machu Picchu. It can still be seen where the terraces were shifted by landslides and then stabilized by the Inca as they continued to build around the area.|$|E

25|$|The film {{tells the}} story of two women {{separated}} by more than six decades. In 1998, lonely New Yorker Wally Winthrop is obsessed with King Edward VIII's abdication of the British throne for the woman he loved, American divorcée Wallis Simpson. But Wally's research, including several visits to the Sotheby's auction of the Windsor Estate, reveals that the couple's life together was not as <b>perfect</b> <b>as</b> she thought. Weaving back and forth in time, W.E. intertwines Wally's journey of discovery in New York with the story of Wallis and Edward, from the early days of their romance to the unraveling of their lives in the decades that followed.|$|E
25|$|Alastair Cook's side won the toss on a pitch favouring {{the side}} batting first {{and made a}} swift start, yet found {{themselves}} fatally slowed as much by their own lack of conviction as Australia's neat bowling and high class fielding. Eoin Morgan was the only bastman to pass fifty for the tourists, his innings cut short thanks to a great return catch by Dan Christian amidst some controversy. Australia's chase was not quite <b>perfect,</b> <b>as</b> no batsman made a hundred and wickets were lost to loose strokes, but fifties to David Warner and Shaun Marsh meant Australia cruised to a 7 wicket victory to win the series 3-0.|$|E
25|$|When DNA is copied, the two {{strands of}} the old DNA are pulled apart by enzymes; then they pair up with new {{nucleotides}} and then close. This produces two new pieces of DNA, each containing one strand from the old DNA and one newly made strand. This process is not predictably <b>perfect</b> <b>as</b> proteins attach to a nucleotide while they are building and cause {{a change in the}} sequence of that gene. These changes in DNA sequence are called mutations. Mutations produce new alleles of genes. Sometimes these changes stop the functioning of that gene or make it serve another advantageous function, such as the melanin genes discussed above. These mutations and their effects on the traits of organisms are one of the causes of evolution.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{reviews of}} the film focused {{primarily}} on Streep's performance, praising her for making an extremely unsympathetic character far more complex than {{she had been in}} the novel.

500|$|The episode also {{presents}} a temporary role reversal for Mulder and Scully.

If you find his motive, you find the murderer". Kaner argues that this logic is {{more in line with}} what Mulder has subscribed to throughout the series. Furthermore, after Mulder discovers Padgett's manuscript, he arrests him [...] "without a second thought". By relying on empirical logic, Mulder is acting in the way Scully normally thinks.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the release}} of Spirit, [...] "Footprints in the Sand" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews by music critics, {{with some of them}} comparing Lewis's performance to other singers such as Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera.

Whilst reviewing Spirit, Chad Grischow of IGN Music described [...] "Footprints in the Sand", along with [...] "Here I Am", as a [...] "sleeper ballad". Lyndsey Winship, a reviewer from BBC Music, noted that the song [...] "is a piano warbler that brings Leona's voice to the forefront".|$|E
