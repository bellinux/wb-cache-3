40|$|Dyadic {{association}} between individuals {{forms the basis}} of group structures for herding animals. Group associations and social bonds are dynamic and can result {{in the establishment of}} new subgroups. The onset of parturition and the introduction of an offspring create a social change for a mother that is part of a herd. There is a need to nurture the young, develop and maintain a strong maternal bond, and build or maintain social networks within the larger herd. The present study explored associations within a herd of cattle that included <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> and cows with calves (maternal cows). Group dynamics were determined by daily observations of group associations over an 11 -week period. During the period, some <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> calved and it was possible to quantify their associations before and post-calving. The associations between individual cows were quantified using a half-weight index (HWI). The HWI data for the maternal and <b>pregnant</b> class of <b>cows</b> were compared. The overall HWI data and the individual class data (pregnant or maternal) were tested against a random model, using data that were generated using permutation methods. There were significant differences in the associations of the pregnant and maternal cows; the maternal cows had stronger associations with other maternal <b>cows</b> while the <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> showed evidence of weaker associations with other <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> and the maternal <b>cows.</b> As <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> calved, they developed stronger associations with other maternal cows.

Follicular fluid was pooled according to size and pregnancy status and estradiol, testosterone and progesterone concentrations in follicular fluid were determined by RIA. Characteristics of healthy follicles did not differ, regardless of follicle size or pregnancy status.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the study was the {{development}} of immunity and its possible transmission to progeny in <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> vaccinated against ringworm. Twelve experimental <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> were vaccinated twice against ringworm and another twelve cows served as non-vaccinated controls. Calves born by the experimental and the control cows were challenged epicutaneously with a virulent strain of Trichophyton verrucosum. The experimental cows were challenged with the same agent ten months after the second vaccination. The challenge resulted in mycotic lesions that were less severe and healed sooner in the vaccinated than in the control cows. No difference in the clinical course of ringworm induced by challenge were observed between the calves born by the experimental and the control cows. It is concluded that <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> vaccinated against ringworm developed immunity which was not transmitted to their progeny. The vaccination had no effect on pregnancy, parturition and the state of health of newborn calves. The results were not processed by statistical methods.

Pregnancies were detected by ultrasonography in between days 30 - 35 after insemination. 12 cows were detected to be pregnant this way, while 5 cows were detected to be not pregnant. Serum progesterone levels were determined by enyzme immunoassay method; and vitamin A, E, C and -carotene levels were detected by spectrophotometry. While no difference was observed between the sampling days in serum progesterone, vitamin A, C, E and -carotene levels in bloods collected for 21 - 24 days after insemination in <b>pregnant</b> and nonpregnant <b>cows</b> (P> 0. 05), vitamin C level at the 16 th day after insemination in <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> was detected to be higher (P 0. 05).

The present study aimed to study the pharmacological action of prostaglandin F 2 α injection on ovarian activity, blood picture, gonadal hormones and animal fertility during heat stress.

This public sacrifice was conducted in the form of a holocaust on behalf of the state at the Capitol, and also by each of the thirty curiae, the most ancient divisions of the city made by Romulus from the original three tribes.

40|$|When {{pregnancy}} is established, interferon tau (IFNT), a well-known pregnancy recognition signal in ruminants, is secreted by embryonic trophoblast cells and acts within the uterus {{to prepare for}} pregnancy. IFNT acts as an endocrine factor on the corpus luteum (CL) to induce refractory ability against the luteolytic action of PGF 2 α. Hypothesising that IFNT may influence not only the uterine environment but also the CL in cows via local or peripheral circulation, we investigated qualitative changes in the CL of <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> during the maternal recognition period (day 16) and the CL of non-pregnant cows. The CL of pregnant animals had a higher number of neutrophils, and the expression of interleukin 8 (IL 8) mRNA and its protein was higher as well {{as compared with the}} CL of non-pregnant animals. Although IFNT did not affect progesterone (P 4) secretion and neutrophil migration directly, it stimulated IL 8 mRNA expression on luteal cells (LCs), influencing the neutrophils, resulting in the increased migration of IFNT-activated neutrophils. Moreover, both IFNT-activated neutrophils and IL 8 increased P 4 secretion from LCs in vitro. Our novel finding was the increase in neutrophils and IL 8 within the CL of <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows,</b> suggesting the involvement of IFNT function within the CL toward establishment of pregnancy in cows. The present results suggest that IFNT upregulates neutrophil numbers and function via IL 8 on LCs in the CL of early <b>pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> and that both neutrophils and IL 8, stimulated by IFNT, are associated with an increase in P 4 concentrations during the maternal recognition period in cows...|$|R
