The power up boxes which are flat against the track in Super <b>Mario</b> <b>Kart</b> due to the technical limitations of the SNES became floating boxes in later games. The roster of racers has expanded in recent games to include a greater selection of Nintendo characters including some which had not been created {{at the time of}} Super <b>Mario</b> <b>Kart's</b> release – such as Petey Piranha from Super Mario Sunshine who appeared in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. Multiplayer has remained a key feature of the series and has expanded from the two-player modes available in Super Mario Kart; first to allow up to four simultaneous players in <b>Mario</b> <b>Kart</b> 64 and eventually up to twelve simultaneous online players in <b>Mario</b> <b>Kart</b> Wii.
