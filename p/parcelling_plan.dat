40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the legal and {{institutional}} aspects faced by practitioners during their professional actions. There are two situations: parcelling for private housing on private terrains promoted by private promoters and parcelling for young people housing on local council lands. Urban plans have been and still are facing the gloomy reality of suggested changes inside the legislation and methodology of approving the urbanism documentation, the LAP (Local Area Plan) and UDP (Urban Design Plan). In order to establish differentiated responsibilities for local administration and private developer (initiator of the Local Area Plan) regarding the ensuring of necessary resources so that the urban plan should be applied and without whose completion the building permit cannot be issued. To further illustrate the issues, a successful operation of building a 240 apartment housing development on 11. 00 ha given in Chitila, Ilfov County is presented. The involved project partners were: Chitila Local Council which provided with the land and pledged {{to carry out the}} infrastructure works, architects’ design office which produce the <b>parcelling</b> <b>plan</b> and provided the execution projects for a set of 6 types of buildings and the young beneficiaries. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{color as}} {{structuring}} material Shapes are stable, whereas colours are elusive 1. It {{is well known}} that, particularly in architecture, the visual acquisition of the colour scales is directly influenced by both the conservation conditions of the elements, which are subjected to the continuous action of chemical and atmospheric aggressions, and the optical effects caused by the reciprocal influence between colour and colour, the famous ???interaction of color??? by Josef Albers: ???no colour exists by itself {{and the nature of}} every hue changes in reaction to the adjacent colours 2. It would be necessary to add other considerations about the themes of the perception event, the transparency, the appearance, the expression, the simultaneous contrast of colours, their composition and the syntactic structure tied to the opposing duality between harmony and disharmony, in order to reveal the so-called visual cohesion forces. These forces are {{the true nature of the}} world and reality; it is not the nature of a fruitless sequence of objects which are placed side by side, but it is the nature of a continuous stratification of elements, because ???every object pushes beyond the merely visible and ventures into the ampler kingdom of the really seeable, which is the face of reality that is oriented towards us 3. With regards to the questions that are more directly referable to the use of colour in architecture, the colour has to be certainly considered as an intrinsic element of the final expression and form, through the factual propriety that makes the spatial effect perceptible. ???The building will gain its right meaning through its transformation in an out-and-out architecture, that is a monumental synthesis of space, shape and colour 4. Through the study of the structural relations expressed by the colour syntax, the colour score becomes the spatial device that produces the exaltation of the contrasts between the architectural components that are organised in the compositive system; moreover, it gives visibility to the plasticity of the space according to a combinatory sequence. Through intervals and contrasts, this sequence aims for an harmonic condition of balance, where every colour conserves its own energy force 5. In the space-time dimension of its plasticity, where the constructive and functional factor transforms itself in a multiple aesthetic factor, architecture acquires the colour in its significant role as expressive element and structuring material like other materials as iron, stone, glass. colour is not only useful for orienting but also, and even more, for satisfying the need to display the reciprocal spatial relationships in terms of proportions, relations, directions. The accord of these relationships is the aesthetic aim of architecture [???]??? which ???[???], finally dissatisfied to show its hidden structure, will develop as an indivisible, inspired totality??? 6. So, there is the densification of a concept: the concept that architecture without colour (that is, the architecture without the colour scale that goes from the neutral greys intervals, which are optically inarticulate, to the evident contrasts that give combinatory fullness) proves to be inexpressive and, in the sense of necessary complementarity between light and colour, it can only be considered a blind architecture 7. Another significant aspect is the aspect that excludes every difference between the colour application and the essence of colour in itself of the matter: just like all the materials, the colour scores dispense energy and, in the interference of their contrasts, produce a tensional regime which, in turn, determines the architectural and aesthetic function 8. Starting just from this last assumption, the contribution that we want to produce is tied to the possibility of determining an evaluation of the colour interactions afferent to the architectural characterisations of a monumental building, in relation to an experience conducted about the comparative readings of the original project drawings and the re-elaborations recently made through infographic processes, according to a system of data gained in situ. The proposed problem concerns the complexity of the process that is activated if we take a sample of colour measurements, according to different measurement systems (from Eugène Chevreul???s operative systems, to Albert Munsell???s systematic catalogues, until Harald Küppers???s rhombohedron 9), and if we establish actions of comparison and reproducibility through digital techniques. In our century the prevalent interest about the colour system has distinguished and applied itself around colorimetry or simultaneously to the experimentation of the colour visual perception [???] This is actually the summary of the colour modern history: applied colorimetric and psichological techniques (survey and production) ??? 10. The reference architecture is the Prince of Naples Gallery, a building strongly representative of a significant urban transformation of the so-called Fosse del Grano a Napoli area, from the National Museum to Dante square. This transformation, begun since the last decade of the Bourbon reign, materialized in the second half of the Eighteenth Century, starting from the Unity of Italy. Different hypotheses of intervention were formulated; among them, the hypothesis proposed by the architects Saponaro, Catalani, Capaldo and Alvino certainly deserves a mention, as well as the definitive solution which saw the engineer Giovanni de Novellis and the architect Nicola Breglia in action. These ones, following the demolition of the Monastery of S. Giovanniello, elaborated a <b>parcelling</b> <b>plan</b> that included the opening of Pessina street, in place of Fosse del Grano uphill street, of Bellini street, Broggia street and Conte di Ruvo street, the creation of the Academy of Fine Arts, the Bellini theatre and the new Prince of Naples Gallery, for which in 1868 they presented an hypothesis for the arrangement of the ???Front opposite the Museum??? 11. This project was accompanied by other two solutions that led to the final version, which included an iron and glass roof, the first-ever created in Naples, for completing the final stretch of Bellini street in the direction of the Museum. The drawings that accompanied these different proposals, including the final one, are preserved in the historical municipal Archive of Naples. They are characterized by being made with precise chromatic scores both in the wider compositions and in those, numerous, close-up ones; so, they are a precious documentary equipment for developing the comparative study with the representation of the current situation, which derives from the last restoration work, concluded in 2007.

Despite the strict framework within which the Quebec cadastral reform was launched in 1992, this renovation has raised unexpected questions that {{still need to be}} answered. The aim of our study is to describe the challenges and problems that have been generated by this transition. First of all, the impacts of the new cadastral system on land surveyors professional activities have neither been fully identified nor estimated. In the past, the idea of integration into a large cadastral grid was not compulsory and land surveyors used to represent their cadastral operations on <b>parcel</b> <b>plans</b> without showing the neighbouring properties. Therefore, these plans often contained inaccuracies that were non-apparent until one tried to integrate the individual lots and then created into a global map. Discrepancies between neighbouring lots could occur at this occasion, forcing the land surveyor to make a deeper investigation of the area. The main challenge will be to ensure the improvement of the global cadastral map, by enhancing its consistency in accordance with field survey data, and by implementing correction procedures, particularly when scale or projection changes are required...|$|R

40|$|Farming in Europe is {{constantly}} changing as environmental concerns have increasingly been {{taken into account}} since the mid 1980 s and emphasis {{has been put on}} agri-environmental matters throughout all European countries. For instance, in Wallonia (Belgium), {{as a result of the}} provisions of the Government Decree on agri-environmental measures, farmers are increasingly encouraged to adopt environmentally friendly practices such as the creation of grassy headlands in their fields. As European agriculture is changing, tools are needed to monitor the evolution of agricultural practices, to control policy application and to advise farmers. In this framework, we present a new approach to optimise the establishment of grassy headlands in cultivated fields. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), we identify exact locations where farmers can introduce grassy headlands in accordance with legal specifications and environmental concerns and calculate the total length of grassy headland that farmers can establish considering the features of their farm and parcels and for which they can receive subsidies. It indicates a potential, which could serve as a calculation baseline for an indicator. Wallonia was chosen as study area because a digitised <b>parcel</b> <b>plan</b> has been available from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) since 1997. The methodological approach proposes a new valorisation of this spatial information layer and can be considered as an example of application providing relevant information for several intervention levels: national or regional decisionmakers, advisors and individual farmers. Since all EU Member States had to set up their own GIS-based land parcel system starting in 2005, our approach may be useful as is or in similar applications in other countries.

A rich set of <b>parcel</b> and <b>planning</b> data {{for the city of}} Chicago was used to correlate sustainability indicators with the locations of both project- and tenant-based affordable housing programs. Difference-in-means tests and other descriptive statistical analysis suggest that project-based locations (with the exception of CHA family units) actually score above average, especially in terms of accessibility and walkability, albeit it at the cost of concentrated poverty, racial segregation, and crime. In contrast, vouchers are located in less sustainable locations when it comes to accessibility and walkability, although they are in neighborhoods with more diversity and less poverty â€”and, at lower voucher concentrations, with less segregation and crimeâ€” than project units. ...|$|R

This is promising and confirms that while L’Aquila is still in the early recovery phase the city is {{on the way to the}} recovery phase. With respect to tourism, L’Aquila’s recovery process can be compared to the recovery process of Christchurch, New Zealand, from two earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. While Christchurch had to close the city center for 2  years, and there are still demolition tasks and empty parcels characteristic of the early recovery phase, the city has managed to advance to the development phase. The institution in charge of reconstruction located monuments in some of the empty parcels and built symbolic buildings, such as the Cardboard Cathedral (also called the transitional cathedral) and founded the Quake City museum.

40|$|Context: The {{problem of}} how {{ecological}} mechanisms create and interact with patterns across different scales is fundamental not only for understanding ecological processes, but also for interpretations of ecological dynamics and the strategies that organisms adopt to cope with variability and cross-scale influences. Objectives: Our objective {{was to determine the}} consistency of the role of individual habitat patches in pattern-process relationships (focusing on the potential for dispersal within a network of patches in a fragmented landscape) across a range of scales. Methods: Network analysis was used to assess and compare the potential connectivity and spatial distribution of highland fynbos habitat in and between protected areas of the Western Cape of South Africa. Connectivity of fynbos patches was measured using ten maximum threshold distances, ranging from five to 50 km, based on the known average dispersal distances of fynbos endemic bird species. Results: Network connectivity increased predictably with scale. More interestingly, however, the relative contributions of individual protected areas to network connectivity showed strong scale dependence. Conclusions: Conservation approaches that rely on single-scale analyses of connectivity and context (e. g., based on data for a single species with a given dispersal distance) are inadequate to identify key land <b>parcels.</b> Landscape <b>planning,</b> and specifically the assessment of the value of individual areas for dispersal, must therefore be undertaken with a multi-scale approach.

30|$|The LSP’s {{delivery}} operation is executed via medium-sized diesel vans with an assumed maximum capacity of about 300 parcels. A typical delivery {{day of a}} driver starts around 6 : 00  am at the distribution centre at {{the fringe of the}} city of Antwerp. He loads the <b>parcels</b> and <b>plans</b> the route, before driving into the city and starting the distribution. Each driver performs a distribution tour alone and visits 99 customers on average. For each customer on the tour, the driver gets at close proximity, parks, fetches the parcel from the van and delivers it at the customer’s door. If the customer or any neighbours are not at home, the respective parcel is delivered to a nearby DP, from where the customer can pick it up. We computed from the dataset that the average duration per stop, including parking, fetching and delivering the parcel, amounts to 2.5  min. The delivery routes are planned by the driver, without any computer assistance. After all parcels have been delivered, the driver returns to the distribution centre for a debriefing. We estimated from the dataset that a driver typically spends 6  h for delivering activities in the city, and two hours for the remaining activities before and after each tour (loading, preparation, driving into the city and returning to the distribution centre, debriefing). Note that we cannot derive the actual delivery routes nor the specific durations of tours from the data, and we will derive those values by simulating the distribution process {{on the basis of the}} above observations.|$|R

Planned by Christian Philip Gottlieb Reuter, Bethania was the first permanent settlement laid out and established in 1759 on 2000 acre of the nearly 100000 acre Wachovia tract. Reuter's plan called for a compact village settlement near Muddy Creek, with agricultural areas near the creek and in the uplands above the village.

40|$|Abstract Despite an {{increase}} in efforts to address shortage and performance of Human Resources for Health (HRH), HRH problems continue to hamper quality service delivery. We believe that the influence of governance is undervalued in addressing the HRH crisis, both globally and at country level. This thematic series has aimed to expand the evidence base {{on the role of}} governance in addressing the HRH crisis. The six articles comprising the series present a range of experiences. The articles report on governance in relation to developing a joint vision, building adherence and strengthening accountability, and on governance with respect to planning, implementation, and monitoring. Other governance issues warrant attention as well, such as corruption and transparency in decision-making in HRH policies and strategies. Acknowledging and dealing with governance should be part and <b>parcel</b> of HRH <b>planning</b> and implementation. To date, few experiences have been shared on improving governance for HRH policy making and implementation, and many questions remain unanswered. There is an urgent need to document experiences and for mutual learning. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Neighbors {{around the}} {{proposed}} development began fighting it, {{as they were}} opposed to proposed apartments as not mixing with the existing single-family homes around the site, {{as well as being}} opposed to the planned extension of Cypress Street that would convert what had been a dead-end road into a collector street connecting Main Street to TV Highway via 32nd Avenue. In May, the developers removed plans to build apartments as part of the project, and instead opted to use nearly 12 acres that would have been used for housing for additional commercial development. At that time the shopping mall was expected to cost $23 million and total as much as , all on the western portion of the undeveloped <b>parcel,</b> though other <b>plans</b> called for the center on the eastern portion. Low-density housing was still planned {{for the remainder of the}} 95 acre plot. Early plans included proposals for a covered mall with four anchor tenants with up to [...] of space in total. Due to neighborhood opposition, focused mainly on housing density and increased traffic, the city’s planning commission delayed final decisions on the developer’s proposals several times.|$|R

The input test data consists of a pollution extent shapefile derived from the processing of hyperspectral aerial survey data from the Kolontár red mud disaster. Three algorithms were developed and the respective scripts were written in Python. The first model aims at drawing a <b>parcel</b> clean-up <b>plan.</b> The model tests four different parcel orientations (0, 90, 45 and 135 degree) and keeps the <b>plan</b> where clean-up <b>parcels</b> are less numerous considering it is an optimal spatial configuration. The second model drifts the clean-up parcel of a work plan both vertically and horizontally following a grid pattern with sampling distance of a fifth of a parcel width and keep the most optimal drifted version; here also with the belief to reduce the final number of parcel features. The last model aims at drawing a navigation line {{in the middle of}} each clean-up parcel. The models work efficiently and achieve automatic optimized <b>plan</b> generation (<b>parcels</b> and navigation lines). Applying the first model we demonstrated that depending on the size and geometry of the features of the contaminated area layer, the number of clean-up parcels generated by the model varies in a range of 4 % to 38 % from plan to plan. Such a significant variation with the resulting feature numbers shows that the optimal orientation identification can result in saving work, time and money in remediation. The various tests demonstrated that the model gains efficiency when 1 / the individual features of contaminated area present a significant orientation with their geometry (features are long), 2 / the size of pollution extent features becomes closer {{to the size of the}} parcels (scale effect). The second model shows only 1 % difference with the variation of feature number; so this last is less interesting for planning optimization applications. Last model rather simply fulfils the task it was designed for by drawing navigation lines...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} tasks of the cadastral activity in Israel is the preparation of mutation plans, which serve as a principal instrument of block parceling change. The Survey of Israel (SOI) is responsible for supply of necessary cadastral information for mutation plans preparation. In the past there was a specific form of recording the mutation plans sequence in the blocks. The purpose of this form was to list mutation plans ID, to record parcels numbers and to trace the origin of each parcel existing in block. For many years the recording procedure was based on managing of specific paper block cards. A few years ago SOI has initiated and completed a development of a computerized information system that would store and provide information about block <b>parcels</b> and mutation <b>plans.</b> As time went by, this system became {{an important part of}} cadastral process. In spite of a progress made, in order to obtain important information, a client was obliged to arrive personally to SOI office. After analysis of situation, SOI made a decision to expand the developed system accessibility by supplying its information via Internet. As a result of this innovation, now every professional, sitting in his office, may immediately obtain essentia...|$|R
