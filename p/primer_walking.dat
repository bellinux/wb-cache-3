40|$|Abstract Background The highly heterogenic {{characteristic}} of viruses {{is the major}} obstacle to efficient DNA amplification. Taking advantage of {{the large number of}} virus DNA sequences in public databases to select conserved sites for primer design is an optimal way to tackle the difficulties in virus genome amplification. Results Here we use hepatitis B virus as an example to introduce a simple and efficient way for virus primer design. Based on the alignment of HBV sequences in public databases and a program BxB in Perl script, our method selected several optimal sites for HBV primer design. Polymerase chain reaction showed that compared with the success rate of the most popular primers for whole genome amplification of HBV, one set of primers for full length genome amplification and four sets of <b>walking</b> <b>primers</b> showed significant improvement. These newly designed primers are suitable for most subtypes of HBV. Conclusion Researchers can extend the method described here to design universal or subtype specific primers for various types of viruses.

40|$|The {{success of}} the Human Genome Project depends on the {{development}} of adequate technology for rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing, which will also benefit biomedical research in general. The authors are working on DNA technologies that eliminate primer synthesis, the main bottleneck in sequencing by <b>primer</b> <b>walking.</b> They have developed modular primers that are assembled from three 5 -mer, 6 -mer or 7 -mer modules selected from a presynthesized library of as few as 1, 000 oligonucleotides ({double_bond} 4, {double_bond} 5, {double_bond} 7). The three modules anneal contiguously at the selected template site and prime there uniquely, even though each is not unique for the most part when used alone. This technique is expected to speed up <b>primer</b> <b>walking</b> 30 to 50 fold, and reduce the sequencing cost by a factor of 5 to 15. Time and expensive will be saved on primer synthesis itself and even more so due to closed-loop automation of <b>primer</b> <b>walking,</b> made possible by the instant availability of primers. Apart from saving time and cost, closed-loop automation would also minimize the errors and complications associated with human intervention between the walks. The author has also developed two additional approaches to primer-library based sequencing. One involves a branched structure of modular primers which has a distinctly different mechanism of achieving priming specificity. The other introduces the concept of ``Differential Extension with Nucleotide Subsets`` as an approach increasing priming specificity, priming strength and allowing cycle sequencing. These approaches are expected to be more robust than the original version of the modular primer technique...|$|E

It {{is being used to}} sequence complete cosmids and has substantially reduced the time taken to process the data. In addition to handling conventionally derived sequences it can use data obtained from Applied Biosystems,Inc. 373 A and Pharmacia A. L. F. fluorescent sequencing machines.

Insertions, deletions and replacements can be made in individual aligned readings and global changes can be made by editing the consensus. All changes are recorded. A click on a mouse button will display the traces covering the current cursor position, hence allowing quick resolution of problems. Another function automatically moves the cursor to the next unresolved character. The editor also provides facilities for annotating the sequences.

In this present work, the main beta-glucosidase of A. saccharolyticus responsible for the efficient hydrolytic activity was identified, isolated, and characterized. Ion exchange chromatography was used to fractionate the culture broth, yielding fractions with high beta-glucosidase activity and only 1 visible band on an SDS-PAGE gel. Mass spectrometry analysis of this band gave peptide matches to beta-glucosidases from aspergilli. Through a polymerase chain reaction approach using degenerate <b>primers</b> and genome <b>walking,</b> a 2919 bp sequence encoding the 860 amino acid BGL 1 polypeptide was determined. BGL 1 of A. saccharolyticus has 91 % and 82 % identity with BGL 1 from Aspergillus aculeatus and BGL 1 from Aspergillus niger, respectively, both belonging to Glycoside Hydrolase family 3.

40|$|The {{finishing}} {{phase of}} genome sequencing projects is expensive, in part, {{because of the}} cost of de novo synthesis of custom primers and the management burden associated with obtaining and using them for <b>primer</b> <b>walking.</b> One approach to reduce these high costs is the use of a presynthesized library of short oligonucleotides (8 - 10 bases) rather than long primers. The use of such a library eliminates the need for custom synthesis of oligonucleotides, providing the convenience of priming from ally site by combining two to three short oligonucleotides to form a string with the required specificity. The First practical implementation of this strategy presented a robust protocol for using hexamer strings with radioisotopic labeling. Whereas versions of this technique have subsequently been implemented on fluorescent sequencers we felt that there was a need to develop and extensively test a protocol that consistently gave read lengths comparable to dye-terminator sequencing with longer primers. We have developed a new two-cycle Fluorescent Sequenase terminator procedure for using hexamer strings. We tested this procedure using a set of 32 different 3 hexamer primer strings, each known to be Functional to some degree in radioisotopic sequencing, on single-stranded M 13 mp 18 template and ABI 373 DNA sequencers. The overall success rate of priming with these hexamer primer strings is 97 % with the Failure of only one string. In this case, the corresponding 18 -mer primer also failed to produce usable sequence from M 13 mp 18 template. The average read length from reactions successfully primed with the 31 different hexamer strings was 461 bases with > 99 % base-calling accuracy. The current protocol is robust enough to be used in virtually any situation where <b>primer</b> <b>walking</b> on single-stranded templates is used. The success rate and read lengths make it universally applicable to the sequencing of single-stranded templates on automated sequencers. It is also amenable to automation...|$|E
