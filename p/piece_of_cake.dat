25|$|On January 9, the Feast of the Epiphany {{has long}} been an {{important}} celebration in Wales, known there as Ystwyll. In Glamorganshire, a huge loaf or cake was prepared, which was then divided up into three parts to represent Christ, the Virgin Mary and the three Wise Men. A large company of neighbors was invited to be present at the dividing of the cake in which rings were concealed. Whoever discovered a ring in his <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>cake</b> (or bread) was elected as King or Queen and presided over the day's festivities. January 6 was the old-calendar Christmas Day and many of the festivities connected with it lasted well over a century after the new calendar was introduced in 1752.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} the battle was {{documented}} in, amongst many others, the 1969 film Battle of Britain, which drew many respected British actors to act key figures of the battle, including Sir Laurence Olivier as Hugh Dowding and Trevor Howard as Keith Park. It also starred Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer and Robert Shaw as Squadron Leaders. Former participants of the battle served as technical advisors including Douglas Bader, James Lacey, Robert Stanford Tuck, Adolf Galland and Dowding himself. An Italian film {{around the same time}} titled Eagles Over London (1969) also featured the Battle of Britain. The 1988 ITV mini-series <b>Piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cake,</b> an aerial drama about a fictional Second World War RAF fighter squadron in 1940, features the battle. The Czech film Dark Blue World (2001) also featured the battle, focusing on the Czech Pilots who fought in the battle. An inaccurate and fictional version of the battle is shown in the 2001 movie, Pearl Harbor, in which the battle is depicted as still going on into 1941.|$|E

2500|$|St. Thomas Aquinas, {{the leading}} {{scholastic}} theologian of the Roman Catholic Church, argued {{charging of interest}} is wrong because it amounts to [...] "double charging", charging for both the thing {{and the use of}} the thing. Aquinas said this would be morally wrong in the same way as if one sold a bottle of wine, charged for the bottle of wine, and then charged for the person using the wine to actually drink it. Similarly, one cannot charge for a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>cake</b> and for the eating of the <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>cake.</b> Yet this, said Aquinas, is what usury does. Money is a medium of exchange, and is used up when it is spent. To charge for the money and for its use (by spending) is therefore to charge for the money twice. It is also to sell time since the usurer charges, in effect, for the time that the money is in the hands of the borrower. Time, however, is not a commodity that anyone can charge. [...] In condemning usury Aquinas was much influenced by the recently rediscovered philosophical writings of Aristotle and his desire to assimilate Greek philosophy with Christian theology. Aquinas argued that in the case of usury, as in other aspects of Christian revelation, Christian doctrine is reinforced by Aristotelian natural law rationalism. [...] Aristotle's argument is that interest is unnatural, since money, as a sterile element, cannot naturally reproduce itself. [...] Thus, usury conflicts with natural law just as it offends Christian revelation: see Thought of Thomas Aquinas.|$|E
