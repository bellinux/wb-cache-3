Upon the most charitable construction, those who believed in rappings, <b>planchettes,</b> materialized forms, ghosts, messages on slates, {{and all the rest}} of the amazing catalogue, were either half-baked thinkers, intellectual perverts, or soft-pated sentimentalists, whose judgment was momentarily clouded by the passing of a grief.|$|E
60|$|During {{the next}} term or two, I'm afraid I {{must admit that}} the {{relations}} between my tutor and myself were distinctly strained, so much so as continually to threaten the breaking out of open hostilities. It wasn't merely that Nora was in question, but the Professor also suspected me of jeering in private at his psychical investigations. And if the truth must be told, I will admit that his suspicions were not wholly without justification. It began to be whispered among the undergraduates just then that the Professor and his sister had taken to turning <b>planchettes,</b> interrogating easy-chairs, and obtaining interesting details about the present abode of Shakespeare or Milton from intelligent and well-informed five-o'clock tea-tables. It had long been well known that the Professor took a deep interest in haunted houses, considered that the portents recorded by Livy must have something in them, and declared himself unable to be sceptical as to facts which had convinced such great men as Plato, Seneca, and Samuel Johnson. But the table-turning was a new fad, and we noisy undergraduates occasionally amused ourselves by getting up an amateur séance, in imitation of the Professor, and eliciting psychical truths, often couched in a surprisingly slangy or even indecorous dialect, from a very lively though painfully irreverent spirit, who discoursed to us through the material intervention of a rickety what-not. However, as the only mediums we employed were the very unprofessional ones of two plain decanters, respectively containing port and sherry, the Professor (who was a teetotaler, and who paid five guineas a séance for the services of that distinguished psychical specialist, Dr. Grade) considered the interesting results we obtained as wholly beneath the dignity of scientific inquiry. He even most unworthily endeavoured to stifle research by gating us all one evening when a materialized spirit, assuming the outer form of the junior exhibitioner, sang a comic song of the period {{in a loud voice}} with the windows open, and accompanied itself noisily with a psychical tattoo on the rickety what-not. The Professor {{went so far as to}} observe sarcastically that our results appeared to him to be rather spirituous than spiritual.|$|E

5000|$|Though <b>planchettes</b> {{experienced}} great surges {{of popularity}} in Victorian times, in modern usage {{the term is}} most commonly associated with the heart-shaped pointers for Ouija or [...] "talking boards."

5000|$|Following the {{commercial}} {{introduction of the}} Ouija board by Charles Kennard's Kennard Novelty Company and acquisition of the talking board patent by his partner Elijah Bond on 1 July 1890, automatic-writing <b>planchettes</b> took a secondary role to the suddenly popular Ouija board and the many imitators its success spawned. Though early press articles had dubbed the Ouija the [...] "new planchette," [...] the patentees were initially quick to differentiate their devices from classic automatic writers by pairing them with paddle-shaped, pencil-less pointers far different in shape from other <b>planchettes</b> of the period. The design changes {{and focus on the}} elegantly varnished boards and their clearly stenciled letters arching across their fronts seem to have had the intended effect, and the items were enthusiastically welcomed by the public {{in much the same way}} <b>planchettes</b> had experienced their own craze some 23 years previously. From this point on, the pencil-equipped <b>planchettes</b> that had facilitated often-garbled spirit writing for nearly four decades were quickly shoved aside in favor of the cleaner, faster communications of these new [...] "talking boards." [...] Though writing <b>planchettes</b> would enjoy brief revivals in subsequent years as the Ouija's popularity similarly waxed and waned, by the 1930s only British toy companies such as Glevum Games continued to produce true writing <b>planchettes</b> in any worthwhile numbers. By the Ouija revival that followed the Second World War, true writing <b>planchettes</b> were no longer being manufactured in any significant numbers anywhere, having been finally completely taken over by the more popular Ouija as they faded into obscurity.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Planchettes</b> took on {{a variety}} of forms during the height of their popularity. American <b>planchettes</b> were {{traditionally}} heart- or shield-shaped, but manufacturers produced a wide range of shapes and sizes hoping to distinguish themselves in the highly competitive and profitable market of the devices' late-1860s heyday. Manufacturers espoused the wonders and benefits of different materials (including various hardwoods, India rubber, and even glass), insulated castors, and various attachments meant to [...] "charge" [...] the devices or insulate the user from malevolent spirits. In Great Britain, <b>planchettes</b> took on the classical shapes popularized in early illustrations and newspaper depictions, with round, blunt noses and flat backs. Regardless of their shape or country of origin, almost all <b>planchettes</b> were equipped with brass castors and small wheels of bone or plastic, and their sometimes lavishly illustrated boxes were often packed with blank parchment, pencils, ouija-like folding letter sheets, and esoteric instructions espousing the mysterious communicative powers of the items.|$|E

During this period, they remained popular only among devout séance circles and enthusiastic Spiritualists, who at the time still largely relied on the services of celebrity mediums (such as the Fox Sisters and D.D. Home) to lead spirit communications, rather than using <b>planchettes</b> and other [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] devices. Mediums, seeing their monopoly threatened, often rallied against the devices and warned of the dangers of amateur experimentation.|$|E
