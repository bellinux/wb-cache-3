5|$|Adults {{should only}} eat one dinner with <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> meat and blubber per month.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> {{stock in}} the eastern and central North Atlantic is {{estimated}} to number 778,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> {{have one}} of the longest birth {{intervals}} of the cetaceans, calving once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> For short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which calving peaks can vary by population. For long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> have a 15-month gestation period.|$|R
2500|$|According to the American Cetacean Society, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are not {{considered}} endangered. The society cites [...] "there {{are likely to be}} almost a million long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and at least 200,000 short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> worldwide".|$|R
5|$|The {{size and}} weight depend on the species, as long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are {{generally}} larger than short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> Their lifespans are about 45 years in males and 60 years in females for both species. Both species exhibit sexual dimorphism. Adult long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> reach a body length of approximately 6.5 m, with males being 1 m longer than females. Their body mass reaches up to 1,300kg in females and up to 2,300kg in males. For short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> adult females reach a body length of about 5.5 m, while males reach 7.2 m and may weigh up to 3,200kg.|$|R
5|$|The short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> was described, from {{skeletal}} materials only, by John Edward Gray in 1846. He presumed {{from the}} skeleton that the whale {{had a large}} beak. The long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> was first classified by Thomas Stewart Traill in 1809 as Delphinus melas. Its scientific name was eventually changed to Globicephala melaena. Since 1986, the specific name of the long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> was changed to its original form melas. Other species classifications have been proposed but only two have been accepted. There exist geographic forms of short-finned pilot whales off {{the east coast of}} Japan, which comprise genetically isolated stocks.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the New Scientist {{reported}} {{in an article}} that research done in the Faroe Islands lead to the recommendation by Faroese government that the consumption of <b>Pilot</b> <b>Whale</b> meat in the Faroes should stop {{as it had been}} proved to be too toxic. However, the Faroese government did not forbid people to eat <b>Pilot</b> <b>Whale</b> meat due to the contamination, but the advice from the Joensen and Weihe had an effect, it has resulted in reduced consumption, according to a senior Faroese health official.|$|E
5|$|The calf nurses {{for three}} years, {{although}} lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. Short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> females will go though menopause, {{but this is}} not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales. Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since they can no longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young. Short-finned pilot whales grow more slowly than long-finned pilot whales. For the short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years. For the long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.|$|E
500|$|As {{with other}} marine mammals, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are {{susceptible}} to certain pollutants. [...] Off the Faroes, France, the UK, and the eastern US, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> {{were found to have}} been contaminated with high amounts of DDT and PCB. The Faroes whales have also been contaminated with cadmium and mercury. However, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> from Newfoundland and Tasmania were found to have had very low levels of DDT. Short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> off the west coast of the US have had high amounts of DDT and PCB in contrast to the low amounts found in whales from Japan and the Antilles.|$|R

40|$|Short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> (Globicephala macrorhynchus) {{generally}} forage on cephalopods in the mesopelagic zone, sometimes diving to over 1000 m {{in depth}} {{in pursuit of}} prey. However, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and several other species of odontocetes have learned to target longline fishing vessels to depredate (prey upon) hooked fish. These odontocetes may gain energetic benefits due to the high calorie prey and relatively little effort involved in depredation. Each year, hundreds of short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> become hooked due to depredation attempts {{and even if they}} break free they can become injured by trailing gear. In order to understand and reduce these interactions, basic questions still need to be answered, including which segments of the population are preying upon hooked fish? Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool used to study trophic interactions and can potentially identify <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> that are depredating on tuna. This requires stable isotope values of the <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> tuna, and cephalopod prey of both the <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and tuna to enable estimates of trophic relationships. Stable isotope values of cephalopods are lacking in the western North Atlantic. The primary cephalopod prey of short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are not caught in commercial fisheries, and offshore sampling is logistically and financially difficult. Considering those challenges, this study aims to use SCA of several tuna species to determine if tuna, and which species in particular, can be used as biological samplers to obtain the same deep-water cephalopod taxa that short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> prey upon...|$|R
5|$|Pilot {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to the}} genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> (G. melas) and the short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, {{and analysis of the}} skulls {{is the best way to}} distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, {{such as the}} short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> the false killer whale and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, {{they can also be}} hostile.|$|E
5|$|The short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> {{has also}} been hunted for many centuries, {{particularly}} by Japanese whalers. Between 1948 and 1980, hundreds of whales were exploited at Hokkaido and Sanriku {{in the north and}} Taiji, Izu, and Okinawa in the south. These fisheries were at their highest in the late 1940s and early 1950s; 2,326 short-finned pilot whales were harvested in the mid- to late 1980s. This had decreased to about 400 per year by the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Around 800 long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> (Globicephala melaena) {{are caught}} each year, mainly during the summer. Other species are not hunted, though {{occasionally}} Atlantic white-sided dolphin {{can be found}} among the <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> The hunt {{is known as the}} Grindadráp.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Sea Shepherd {{diverted}} several pods of <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> {{away from}} the hunting grounds. The authorities told Sea Shepherd that the killing would be halted {{for the remainder of}} the season if Sea Shepherd left, saving 500 <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving {{for a few}} minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked <b>whales,</b> foraging short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whale</b> pods off {{southern}} California {{have been}} observed in three different groups: traveling/hunting groups, feeding groups and loafing groups. In traveling/hunting groups, individuals position themselves in chorus lines stretching two miles long, {{with only a few}} whales underneath. Sexual and age-class segregation apparently occurs in these groups. In feeding groups, individuals are very loosely associated, but may move in the same direction. In loafing groups, whales number between 12 and 30 individuals resting. Mating and other behaviors may take place.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of the <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> {{is known}} by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} human health {{concerns}} {{associated with the}} consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of methylmercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning {{as a result of}} consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis. Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.|$|E
500|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> eat squid primarily, {{and also}} fish. They are highly social, and {{studies suggest that}} {{both males and females}} remain in their mother's pod, an unusual trait among mammals, also found in certain killer <b>whale</b> communities. Short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> {{are one of the few}} mammal species in which females go through menopause, and post-reproductive females may {{contribute}} to the survival of younger members of their pods. <b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are notorious for stranding themselves on beaches, and are among the most common cetacean stranders. Several theories have been proposed to account for this behavior. The conservation status of neither species has been determined, but they are subject to both direct and indirect bycatch in fisheries. [...] Whalers in a few countries continue to hunt <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R
500|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> emit {{echolocation}} clicks for foraging {{and whistles}} and burst pulses as social signals (e.g. to keep contact {{with members of}} their pod). With active behavior, vocalizations are more complex, while less-active behavior is accompanied by simple vocalizations. Differences {{have been found in}} the calls of the two species. Compared with short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> have relatively low-frequency calls with narrow frequency ranges. In one study of North Atlantic long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> certain vocalizations were heard to accompany certain behaviors. When resting or [...] "milling", simple whistles are emitted. Surfacing behavior is accompanied by more complex whistles and pulsed sounds. [...] The number of whistles made increases with the number of subgroups and the distance in which the whales are spread apart.|$|R

5|$|Type D was {{identified}} based on photographs of a 1955 mass stranding in New Zealand and six at-sea sightings since 2004. The first video record {{of this type}} in life happened between the Kerguelen and Crozet Islands in 2014. It is immediately recognizable by its extremely small white eye patch, narrower and shorter than usual dorsal fin, bulbous head (similar to a <b>pilot</b> <b>whale),</b> and smaller teeth. Its geographic range appears to be circumglobal in subantarctic waters between latitudes 40°S and 60°S. And although nothing {{is known about the}} type D diet, it is suspected to include fish because groups have been photographed around longline vessels, where they reportedly prey on Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides).|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales can {{be found}} in oceans nearly worldwide, but data about current {{population}} sizes is deficient. The long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> prefers slightly cooler waters than the short-finned, and is divided into two populations. The smaller group is found in a circumpolar band in the Southern Ocean from about 20 to 65°S. It may be sighted off the coasts of Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. An estimated more than 200,000 individuals were in this population in 2006. The second, much larger, population inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean, in a band from South Carolina in the United States across to the Azores and Morocco at its southern edge and from Newfoundland to Greenland, Iceland, and northern Norway at its northern limit. This population was estimated at 778,000 individuals in 1989. It is also present in the western half of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|The shark {{spends most}} of its time in the upper layer of the oceanto a depth of and prefers off-shore, deep-ocean areas. According to {{longline}} capture data, increasing distance from land correlates to a greater population of sharks. Occasionally, it is found close to land, in waters as shallow as , mainly around midocean islands such as Hawaii, or {{in areas where the}} continental shelf is narrow with access to nearby deep water. It is typically solitary, though gatherings have been observed where food is plentiful. Unlike many animals, it does not have a diurnal cycle, and is active both day and night. Its swimming style is slow, with widely spread pectoral fins. Despite its habitual isolation from members of its own species, pilot fish, dolphinfish, and remora may accompany it. In 1988, Jeremy Stafford-Deitsch reported seeing an individual accompanied by a shortfin <b>pilot</b> <b>whale.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} species of {{dolphins}} at SeaWorld San Diego: common dolphin hybrid, both Atlantic and Pacific bottlenose dolphins and Pacific short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> The bottlenose dolphins may rotate between Dolphin Amphitheater, Dolphin Point, and Animal Care.

5|$|Pilot whales, mostly short-finned pilot whales, {{have been}} kept in captivity in various marine parks, arguably {{starting}} the late 1940s. Since 1973, some long-finned pilot whales from New England waters were taken and temporarily kept in captivity. Short-finned pilot whales off southern California, Hawaii and Japan {{have been kept}} in aquariums and oceanariums. Several pilot whales from southern California and Hawaii were taken into captivity during the 1960s and early 1970s, two of which were placed at SeaWorld in San Diego. During the 1970s and early 1980s, six pilot whales were captured alive by drive hunts and taken for public display. Pilot whales have historically had low survival rates in captivity, with the average annual survival being 0.51 during the mid-1960s to early 1970s. There {{have been a few}} exceptions to the rule. Bubbles, a female short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> who was displayed in Marineland of the Pacific and eventually at Sea World California, lived to be somewhere in her 50s when she eventually died on 12 June 2016.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{should only}} eat one dinner with <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> meat and blubber per month.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> {{meat and}} blubber are stored, prepared, and eaten in Faroese households. This {{also means that}} whale meat is not {{available}} at supermarkets. Although the Faroe Islands’ main export is fish, {{this does not include}} <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> meat or blubber. An annual catch of 956 pilot whales (1990–1999) is roughly equivalent to 500 tonnes of meat and blubber, some 30% of all meat produced locally in the Faroe Islands.|$|E
