25|$|While {{very common}} in citrus fruits, such as limes, citric acid is found only in very minute {{quantities}} in wine grapes. It often has a concentration about 1/20 that of tartaric acid. The citric acid most commonly found in wine is commercially produced acid supplements derived from fermenting sucrose solutions.

It is used less frequently than tartaric and malic due to the aggressive citric flavors it can add to the wine. When citric acid is added, it is always done after primary alcohol fermentation has been completed due to the tendency of yeast to convert citric into acetic acid.

Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements {{in an aqueous}} electrolyte with <b>potassium</b> ferri- and <b>ferrocyanide</b> as a redox probe evidence that an optimized pure cardiolipin film is reached for a 7 μg cm− 2 deposit onto glassy carbon electrode. At this optimized surface concentration the pure cardiolipin deposit yields the most compact and less permeable supported lipid film on electrode surface. The thickness {{and the organization of}} the pure cardiolipin films were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. AFM imaging in aqueous buffer shows that the lipid deposit onto the surface forms a thick deposit of approximately 30 ± 10 nm of height with 4 nm average roughness and includes defects. Cytochrome-c electroactivity was studied with the redox protein either in solution or immobilized onto the modified electrode. First, the optimized amount of pure cardiolipin was deposited onto glassy carbon electrodes to study the stable and electrochemically quasi-reversible redox system of cytochrome-c in solution. Then, the potential cycling of a pure cardiolipin-modified glassy carbon electrode in a cytochrome-c solution led to the immobilization of the protein in its native state keeping intact its electrochemical properties, and with a surface coverage of 8 pmol cm− 2 corresponding to 50 % of a monolayer. © 2017 Elsevier B.
