There is a class of inductive truths avowedly not universal; in which it is not pretended that the predicate is always true of the subject; but the value of which, as generalizations, is nevertheless extremely great. An important portion of the field of inductive knowledge does not consist of universal truths, but of approximations to such truths; and when a conclusion is said to rest on <b>probable</b> <b>evidence,</b> the premises it is drawn from are usually generalizations of this sort.|$|E

There are reasons enough why the moral sciences must remain inferior to at least the more perfect of the physical; why the laws of their more complicated phenomena can not be so completely deciphered, nor the phenomena predicted with {{the same degree of}} assurance. But though we can not attain to so many truths, there is no reason that those we can attain should deserve less reliance, or have less of a scientific character.

6000|$|... ยง 7. If {{the extreme}} generality, and {{remoteness}} {{not so much}} from sense as from the visual and tactual imagination, {{of the laws of}} number, renders it a somewhat difficult effort of abstraction to conceive those laws as being in reality physical truths obtained by observation; the same difficulty does not exist with regard to the laws of extension. The facts of which those laws are expressions, are of a kind peculiarly accessible to the senses, and suggesting eminently distinct images to the fancy. That geometry is a strictly physical science would doubtless have been recognized in all ages, {{had it not been for}} the illusions produced by two circumstances. One of these is the characteristic property, already noticed, of the facts of geometry, that they may be collected from our ideas or mental pictures of objects as effectually as from the objects themselves. The other is, the demonstrative character of geometrical truths; which was at one time supposed to constitute a radical distinction between them and physical truths; the latter, as resting on merely <b>probable</b> <b>evidence,</b> being deemed essentially uncertain and unprecise. The advance of knowledge has, however, made it manifest that physical science, in its better understood branches, is quite as demonstrative as geometry. The task of deducing its details from a few comparatively simple principles is found to be any thing but the impossibility it was once supposed to be; and the notion of the superior certainty of geometry is an illusion, arising from the ancient prejudice which, in that science, mistakes the ideal data from which we reason, for a peculiar class of realities, while the corresponding ideal data of any deductive physical science are recognized as what they really are, hypotheses.|$|E
60|$|If this be {{the true}} state of the case, what are the Southern chiefs {{fighting}} about? Their apologists in England {{say that it is}} about tariffs, and similar trumpery. They say nothing of the kind. They tell the world, and they told their own citizens when they wanted their votes, that the object of the fight was slavery. Many years ago, when General Jackson was President, South Carolina did nearly rebel (she never was near separating) about a tariff; but no other State abetted her, and a strong adverse demonstration from Virginia brought the matter to a close. Yet the tariff of that day was rigidly protective. Compared with that, the one in force {{at the time of the}} secession was a free-trade tariff: This latter was the result of several successive modifications in the direction of freedom; and its principle was not protection for protection, but as much of it only as might incidentally result from duties imposed for revenue. Even the Morrill tariff (which never could have been passed but for the Southern secession) is stated by the high authority of Mr. H. C. Carey to be considerably more liberal than the reformed French tariff under Mr. Cobden's treaty; insomuch that he, a Protectionist, would be glad to exchange his own protective tariff for Louis Napoleon's free-trade one. But why discuss, on <b>probable</b> <b>evidence,</b> notorious facts? The world knows what the question between the North and South has been for many years, and still is. Slavery alone was thought of, alone talked of. Slavery was battled for and against, on the floor of Congress and in the plains of Kansas; on the slavery question exclusively was the party constituted which now rules the United States: on slavery Fremont was rejected, on slavery Lincoln was elected; the South separated on slavery, and proclaimed slavery as the one cause of separation.|$|E

Survival rate and endocrinological aspect of prostatic cancer (Prof. Kumamoto). 4. Experimental prostatic cancer (Prof. Yoshida). 5. Model mass screening for prostatic diseases using transrectal ultrasonotomography (Prof. Watanabe). 6. Cooperation study for prostatic cancer between Japan and U. S. A. (Prof. Yoshida). 7. A review on literatures of prostatic cancer epidemiology (Dr. Mishina). The review revealed evidences as follows: Two striking evidences in prostatic cancer epidemiology are prevalence only in older ages and different incidence between races. The highest frequency is observed among Negros living in U. S. and relatively higher among Whites commonly in U. S. and Europe. On the contrary, most Orientals show lower frequency, though that among Japanese is increasing remarkably during these one or two decades. Some migrant studies reveal that frequency among Japanese Americans is approximately in the middle between Japanese in Japan and American Whites. Although the occurrence of latent cancer is almost equal in each race, histological features of the cancer cells are more active in Whites or Japanese Americans than Japanese in Japan. Two <b>probable</b> <b>evidences</b> are influence from sexual life and heredity. This disease is fewer in unmarried men than married men and prevalent in men with greater sexual activities. A few kinds of hereditary disposition are reported. Two suspectable evidences are cadmium pollution and vegetables taking. High frequency might be observed among men chronically exposed to cadmium oxide dust {{over a period of}} ten or more years. Low frequency in vegetarians is also reported...|$|R

50|$|Totemistic taboo {{is also a}} {{possible}} reason for refusal to eat horse meat as an everyday food, but did not necessarily preclude ritual slaughter and consumption.

In The White Goddess, Robert Graves argued that the taboo among Britons and their descendants was due to worship of Epona, and even earlier rites. The Uffington White Horse is <b>probable</b> <b>evidence</b> of ancient horse worship. The ancient Indian Kshatriyas engaged in horse sacrifice (Ashwamedh Yaghya) as recorded in the Vedas and Ramayana; but within context of the ritual sacrificial is not being 'killed' but instead being smothered to death. In 1913, the Finnic Mari people of the Volga region were observed to practice a horse sacrifice.|$|E
5000|$|To {{establish}} a civil claim of fraud, most jurisdictions in the United States require that each element be plead with particularity and be proved by {{a preponderance of}} the evidence, meaning {{that it is more}} likely than not that the fraud occurred.
