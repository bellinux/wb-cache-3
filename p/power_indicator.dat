25|$|Through 21 CFR 1040, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates laser {{products}} entering {{commerce and}} requires all classIIIb and classIV lasers offered in commerce in the US to have five standard safety features: a key switch, a safety interlock dongle, a <b>power</b> <b>indicator,</b> an aperture shutter, and an emission delay (normally {{two to three}} seconds). OEM lasers, designed to be parts of other components (such as DVD burners), are exempt from this requirement. Some non-portable lasers {{may not have a}} safety dongle or an emission delay, but have an emergency stop button and/or a remote switch.|$|E
2500|$|CR {{models were}} only {{available}} with yellow and black alcantara interiors. [...] Additionally the CR interior has faux carbon fiber overlays {{on the center}} console and radio door and a peak <b>power</b> <b>indicator</b> light on the instrument gauge cluster that flashes when the engine is producing its peak power output. Finally, {{in an effort to}} reduce weight and lower the center of gravity, the spare tire was omitted and air conditioning and stereo were offered only as options. Net weight savings without the additional hardtop came to [...] relative to the standard model. The engine in the S2000 CR was unchanged from the standard trim. Shigeru Uehara, the designer of the S2000, stated that the CR was positioned between the Type S and a hypothetical Type R. [...] Honda has never made an official Type R for the S2000.|$|E

50|$|In 1948, Jaeger-LeCoultre {{introduced}} a <b>power</b> reserve <b>indicator</b> designed for production {{in a series}} of watches called the Powermatic which utilized the LeCoultre Caliber 481.

50|$|Bomb <b>Power</b> <b>Indicator</b> {{known by}} the acronym BPI was a {{detection}} instrument, located at the twenty five British Royal Observer Corps controls and nearly 1,500 ROC underground monitoring posts, across the United Kingdom, during the Cold War that would have detected any nuclear explosions and measured the peak-overpressure of the blast waves.|$|E
5000|$|ROC post bomb {{detection}} instruments (see Bomb <b>Power</b> <b>Indicator</b> [...] ) {{operated by}} recording the peak overpressure {{of the blast}} wave from any nearby nuclear explosion. Any ultra-high-altitude nuclear explosion, designed to knock out the UK's communications and electronic equipment would not produce a detectable blast wave, and the AWDREY system was therefore the only method of identifying these bursts.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that higher}} voltage is {{required}} if the LM386 {{is to be}} used. Therefore, small signal diodes (such as 1N4148) are recommended to create a voltage drop, or use a Zener DC-DC converter with a red LED (in forward, can double as a <b>power</b> <b>indicator)</b> and a resistor (several hundred ohms for 9V operation), as to avoid [...] overvolting the MK484.|$|E

5000|$|The Bomb <b>Power</b> <b>Indicator</b> or BPI {{consisted}} of a peak overpressure gauge with a dial that would register when the pressure wave from a nuclear explosion passed over the post. When related to {{the distance of the}} explosion from the post this pressure would indicate the power of the explosion. Reports following a reading on the BPI were preceded by the codeword [...] "Tocsin".|$|E
50|$|The {{altitude}} {{of the explosion}} was important because a ground or near ground burst would produce radioactive fallout, whereas an air burst would produce only short distance and short lived initial radiations (but no fallout). Once combined with the peak-overpressure readings from post Bomb <b>Power</b> <b>Indicator</b> readings {{the power of the}} burst in megatons could also be calculated by the Triangulation Team in the group control building, using a hand held plastic calculator device.|$|E
50|$|On {{the side}} of the screen are two bars (one for each player). Each bar is {{separated}} into 2 gauges, the Life Gauge and the Psycho Gauge. To execute most moves, you will deplete your Psycho Gauge. As your Life Gauge decreases, the space for your Psycho Gauge increases. Hence, your Psycho Gauge can go beyond 100% (max 200%) Above there's a <b>Power</b> <b>Indicator.</b> This indicator shows a number that represents the strength of the character (default is 100%, max 200%).|$|E

50|$|Sixty {{seconds after}} any {{reading on the}} Bomb <b>Power</b> <b>Indicator</b> an {{observer}} exited the post and changed the GZI cassettes. The exposed papers were returned underground for assessment. The pre-exposed papers had a graticule grid exposed on the papers that showed degrees of bearing.
