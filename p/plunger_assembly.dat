50|$|The {{machine has}} a heated {{crucible}} for the hot type metal, with a mechanically actuated plunger which operates {{as part of}} the injection cycle. The pot on the machine was usually left on overnight during the week, with some flux added to the pot to reduce oxidation. At the end of each week, the <b>plunger</b> <b>assembly</b> had to be disassembled (while hot), removed, and the pump well cleaned using a scraper (as with linecasting machines). After reassembly, heat was removed for the weekend. In the present day, most machines are heated up only for that day's casting, with the heat turned off each night.|$|E
5000|$|Particularly for {{intravenous}} administration, self-injection {{in the arm}} can be awkward, {{and some}} people modify a syringe for single-handed operation by removing the plunger and affixing a bulb such as from a large dropper or baby pacifier {{to the end of}} the barrel to in effect make it a large dropper with a needle affixed. This is therefore a variant of the common method of injection with a dropper with the hypodermic needle affixed, using a [...] "collar" [...] made of paper or other material to create a seal between the needle and dropper. Removing part of the <b>plunger</b> <b>assembly</b> by cutting off most of the shaft and thumb rest and affixing the bulb {{to the end of the}} barrel, thereby allowing the bulb to operate the plunger by suction, also does work in many cases.|$|E
50|$|The {{music for}} the machine {{consists}} of stage adaptations from the original Rock opera Tommy, composed by Pete Townshend of The Who. There are 21 songs total programmed to play throughout gameplay and for various stages and modes. Songs include Captain Walker, It's a Boy, Christmas, See Me Feel Me,Smash the Mirror, Fiddle About, Cousin Kevin, Sensation, Acid Queen, Pinball Wizard, and Sally Simpson. To launch each ball, the player can use either an automatic launch by pressing a flipper button while a ball is in the alley, or manually via the spring <b>plunger</b> <b>assembly.</b> The machine includes an automated silver disc that rotates to cover the flipper portion of the machine to emulate playing pinball as the title character. This mode occurs during each multiball sequence, or for the entire duration of the game by player selection of the Tommy game mode. The owner/operator may program a feature that allows the player to exchange credits for extra ball(s) to continue the game where it left off.|$|E
40|$|JumpSport, a major {{trampoline}} company, {{has requested}} Cal Poly {{to design a}} custom play-structure consisting of large diameter balls with two types of connectors-long rod connections and very close connectors (for a ball-to-ball type connection). By {{the end of the}} project, appropriate testing will be carried out on the connections and a full-scale model will be constructed. After an extensive design process, our team of three decided on a rod connection style for both the long and short connectors. These consist of a hook that latches into a loop protruding from the ball where the hook is attached by a power screw. The hook/power screw assembly is covered by a sleeve and <b>plunger</b> style cover <b>assembly.</b> The sleeve rides the threads of the power screw to tighten or loosen the fit of the plunger surface to the ball. Thus, the plunger acts to cover the hook while creating a suction to the ball so that the connection stays tight. For the short connector length is equal to approximately four inches so that adequate space is provided for a hand or foot to fit between the balls. The long connector is approximately four feet in length. This length is equal to the sum of one ball diameter and two short connectors so that at any time the created play-structure can be easily altered. The prototypes will be produced by the team-Gary Johnson, Rosalie Mangione, and Steve Rose. The initial parts will be machined and an at home molding process will be used to replicate parts. Purchased parts in conjunction with these self-made parts will be assembled by the team. Structural testing was conducted on both styles of connectors. The ball used to adequately measure the desired features are produced by Mondo. This Mondo product uses a plastic we intend to use except for a larger diameter. Testing on the Mondo products allows us to obtain the necessary test results without the need to produce a ball with the correct diameter. These tests include {{but are not limited to}} maximum weight capacity, tensile and shear tests on the loop alone, etc. This data was used to determine Young’s Modulus for the Mondo ball’s plastic. This information was useful in relating our calculated data to our tested data. In the end, a full scale prototype was made and assembled using an alternative to the Mondo ball so as to meet the diameter requirements. The reason for a full scale prototype is to model the connection points also designed by the team. From this full scale prototype we learned that simply adhering loops to the balls is not an appropriate substitution because it cannot even handle the static loads of the structure simply supporting itself. However, this prototype did yield useful information about the ergonomic qualities of the structure. Connecting a ball that will be suspended in the air proved difficult for two adults and would be impossible for young children alone. Due to these problems, a decision cannot yet be made without further testing using more appropriate materials. However, as the project stands currently, it is not a viable product...|$|R
