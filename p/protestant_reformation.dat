5000|$|As was {{the case}} with other Christian holidays, Christmas {{borrowed}} elements from pagan peoples, including yule logs and decorations such as candles, holly, and mistletoe. Christmas trees were seen as pagan in origin. During the various <b>Protestant</b> <b>reformations,</b> these paganizing elements were a source of controversy. Some sects, such as the Puritans, rejected Christmas as an entirely pagan holiday. Others rejected certain aspects of Christmas as paganizing, but wanted to retain the [...] "essence" [...] of the holiday as a celebration of the Christ's birth. This tension put in motion an ongoing debate within some Protestant denominations about the proper observance of Christmas.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Protestant</b> <b>Reformations</b> of England and Scotland were {{especially}} destructive of existing religious art, {{and the production}} of new work virtually ceased. The Artists of the Tudor Court were mostly imported from Europe, setting a pattern that would continue until the 18th century. The portraiture of Elizabeth I ignored contemporary European Renaissance models to create iconic images that border on naive art. The portraitists Hans Holbein and Anthony van Dyck were the most distinguished and influential {{of a large number of}} artists who spent extended periods in Britain, generally eclipsing local talents like Nicolas Hilliard, the painter of portrait miniatures, Robert Peake the elder, William Larkin, William Dobson, and John Michael Wright, a Scot who mostly worked in London.|$|R

Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France went on a colonial expansion and took possession of lands and set up colonies in Africa, southern Asia, and North and South America. Turkey colonized Southeastern Europe, and parts of the West Asia and North Africa. Russia took possession in Eastern Europe, Asia, and North America.|$|R

5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the <b>Protestant</b> <b>Reformation,</b> the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Scotland {{underwent}} a <b>Protestant</b> <b>Reformation</b> {{that created a}} predominantly Calvinist national Church of Scotland (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook.

The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.|$|E
40|$|Theological {{divisions}} are threatening the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s unity {{and focus on}} mission. Some Adventist theologians suggest {{that the cause of}} these divisions is a departure by other Adventist theologians from adhering to and applying the sola Scriptura principle. This study analyzes this problem. Chapter one presents reasons for a call during the 16 th century, to reform the church to its apostolic purity. Martin Luther and other Protestant Reformers argued against the medieval church, popes, and church councils’ claim for authority to properly interpret and teach Scripture and Tradition. Differing views of reforming the church sparked divisions among the Protestant Reformers, creating two main streams, the magisterial and the radical Reformers. The Roman Catholic Church responded to the <b>Protestant</b> <b>Reformations</b> with a Counter-Reformation. Chapter two discusses Seventh-day Adventism’s application of the sola Scriptura principle. Although Adventism claims to descend from the radical wing of the <b>Protestant</b> <b>Reformations,</b> its acceptance of Ellen G. White’s prophetic ministry and her non-canonical inspired writings departs from a radical application of the sola Scriptura principle. Chapter three presents Biblical evidences for God’s use of multiple media of communication beside the Bible. Therefore Adventism needs to clearly define its understanding and application of the sola Scriptura principle to accommodate other theological sources in addition to the Bible. Chapter four presents Scripture in Zambian Adventist context, tracing Adventism’s use of the Bible in evangelization. Adventism’s responses to changing socio-political and religiopluralistic trends which threatened to marginalize Bible Instructions, and the development of, but failed attempt to implement an Adventist Bible-based Religious Education syllabus at Rusangu Secondary School are presented.

Haakon was buried in the St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall for the winter, and when spring came he was exhumed and his body taken back to Norway, where he was buried in the Old Cathedral in his capital Bergen. Centuries later, in 1531, the cathedral was demolished by the Danish feudal overlord Eske Bille for military purposes in connection with the <b>Protestant</b> <b>Reformation,</b> and the graves of Haakon and other Norwegian kings buried there were apparently destroyed in the process.|$|E
5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested key points of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the <b>Protestant</b> <b>Reformation,</b> which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a declaration of nullity of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|E
