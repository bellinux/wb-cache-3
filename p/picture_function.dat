The PicPass protocol having two function i. e. <b>picture</b> <b>function</b> as well as distortion function is used to make picture in a compact size and then it is sent to receiver. In this paper, a new technique is used i. e. picture is used as a password instead of text to authenticate key exchange between two parties so that they can communicate confidentially. It also gives practical solution against offline dictionary attacks by using both private and public key cryptography...|$|E

We have already proved the efficiency and robustness of the STTP-SPIHT in both of noisy and noiseless channels. This coder has also added benefit of parallelization of the compression and decompression algorithm, thus can be used in real-time implementation in hardware and software. In addition, we demonstrate that STTPSPIHT has the functionality of region-based video encoding /decoding and spatial and/or temporal scalability. These features are highly desirable for today's multimedia applications, such as picture in <b>picture</b> <b>function,</b> video or volumetric image database browsing, distance learning, and video transmission over channels with highly constrained bandwidth...|$|E

40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been suggested}} to solve the correspondence problem for image sequences. This chapter discusses two basically different approaches for the estimation of optical flow vector fields in order to clarify their advantages and disadvantages {{as well as the}} relation between them. The first approach is based on the extraction and interframe match of features. Several features are investigated using real-world images. The performance of the approach involving features is evaluated. In distinction to feature-based approaches, one may directly evaluate the spatio-temporal variation of the <b>picture</b> <b>function</b> which results in a differential or gradient-based approach. This gradient-based approach has been supplemented by a smoothness requirements on the optical flow field, in which the estimation of the optical flow field formulated as an optimization problem resulting in a system of partial differential equations for the optical flow field. Subsequent investigations show that s ignificant contributions for the determination of the optical flow field could be expected among others from gray value structures which correspond to the image locations evaluated in the feature-based approach. Results from both approaches obtained using the same input data are compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify how visual {{analysis}} of a handmade <b>picture</b> <b>function</b> in between at least two views, the creator and the respondent. The starting point is to look upon the picture as a symbol system, no matter who made it and if the product is art or not art. Pictures originate from art and media but also from our hands and minds in learning. The function of lines and colours, is the basis for externalised interpretation. My point is that the more externalised views and minds, the better the tutor gets to know the student, and the better the student gets to know her- or himself and the better the student and tutor meet in symmetry. The critical view to the Habermas ´ concept of symmetry in pedagogical practice, is that there is always one that is supposed to know more (tutor) than the other (student). Learning is relational and so defined in terms of a variation. This means that an aspect of the social within us is externalised and interpreted in a unique communicative form (of the object), different from that of others. All together the different artefacts about a specific phenomena can inside the student or between students open up for an awareness of other ways of experiencing the specific and lead to deep learning. My point is that visual analysis and understanding, it’s methodology and science, is an arena of not only aesthetic educational learning but gives birth to more of symmetrical relations, to creator personal identity and integrity...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, various picture-based {{password}} {{systems were}} proposed {{to exploit the}} utility of pictures for user authentication. However, there are problems associated with these picture-based password authentication systems such as: vulnerability to security threats, and users’ memorability of the passwords. This research was undertaken to develop methods to mitigate shoulder-surfing attack. Two falsifying authentication methods using: (i) penup event and neighbouring connectivity manipulation; and (ii) partial password selection and metaheuristic randomisation algorithm methods, were proposed. The first and second proposed methods were incorporated into the proposed Background Pass-Go (BPG) system and Visual Identification Protocol Professional (VIP Pro) system respectively. To improve the users’ memorability, the upload background <b>picture</b> <b>function</b> and cued colour scheme were proposed for the BPG system; the grid line scaling function and the loose authentication method were proposed for the enhanced BPG system; and the chronological story-based cued recall technique was proposed for the VIP Pro system. Prototypes, simulations, observations and interviews were used as the data gathering methods. An offline FOA Java simulation was carried out to evaluate the capability of the MRA method in preventing FOA attack. Case studies were conducted to evaluate the capability of the proposed methods in mitigating shoulder-surfing attack. Kruskal Wallis test and calculation of the success rate in attacking were {{used to evaluate the}} capability of the proposed methods in mitigating shoulder-surfing attack. In general, the result of the case studies show that the two proposed falsifying authentication methods are able to mitigate shoulder-surfing attack regardless of the gender and competency levels of the shoulder-surfing attackers. Besides, the proposed MRA is effective in preventing FOA attack. A majority of the survey participants also stated that the proposed cued recall methods can aid users in memorising their password...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{revealed that}} action video game players outperform non-players {{in a wide}} range of attentional, perceptual and cognitive tasks. Here we tested if expertise in action video games is related to differences regarding the potential of shortly presented stimuli to bias behavior. In a response priming paradigm, participants classified four animal <b>pictures</b> <b>functioning</b> as targets as being smaller or larger than a reference frame. Before each target, one of the same four animal pictures was presented as a masked prime to influence participants' responses in a congruent or incongruent way. Masked primes induced congruence effects, that is, faster responses for congruent compared to incongruent conditions, indicating processing of hardly visible primes. Results also suggested that action video game players showed a larger congruence effect than non-players for 20 ms primes, whereas there was no group difference for 60 ms primes. In addition, there was a tendency for action video game players to detect masked primes for some prime durations better than non-players. Thus, action video game expertise may be accompanied by faster and more efficient processing of shortly presented visual stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Generalization of {{acquired}} responses {{appears to}} be a crucial, yet under investigated process in emotional disorders. Generalization occurs when a conditioned response is elicited by a stimulus different from the original conditioned stimulus. The expansion of complaints, often seen in emotional disorders, is at least in part due to processes of generalization. In the present study, generalization is approached from a memory perspective. It is hypothesized that generalization of conditioned responding is associated with autobiographical memory specificity. Higher levels of generalization are predicted for people who are characterized by limited memory specificity. In a human contingency-learning procedure, participants learned the association between two pictures of female faces and a schematic drawing of a lightning bolt. Subsequently, six morphed <b>pictures</b> <b>functioning</b> as generalization stimuli (GSs) were introduced and conditioned responses to these GSs were measured. The results showed that memory specificity was significantly associated with the extent of generalization. Participants low in autobiographical memory specificity exhibited significantly stronger conditioned responses to GSs as compared to participants high in autobiographical memory specificity. status: publishe...|$|R
