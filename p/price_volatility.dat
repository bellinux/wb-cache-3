To fill this gap, we estimate absolute and relative crop <b>price</b> <b>volatilities</b> of wheat, barley, maize, triticale, potato, rapeseed, and sugar beet applying autoregressive models using annual price data for the period 1991 – 2009. The results for Switzerland are compared with estimates for the USA, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Relative <b>price</b> <b>volatilities,</b> expressed by the coefficient of variation, are found to be lower in Switzerland by a factor of 2 – 3 compared to the other considered countries. For some crops such as potatoes the differences are even higher. An increase in <b>price</b> <b>volatilities</b> of this magnitude due to market liberalization may become a threat to Swiss farmers.

25|$|Chemical {{recycling}} of PET will become cost-efficient only applying high capacity recycling lines {{of more than}} 50,000 tons/year.

Several attempts of industrial magnitude to establish such chemical recycling plants {{have been made in}} the past but without resounding success. Even the promising chemical recycling in Japan has not become an industrial breakthrough so far. The two reasons for this are: at first, the difficulty of consistent and continuous waste bottles sourcing in such a huge amount at one single site, and, at second, the steadily increased prices and <b>price</b> <b>volatility</b> of collected bottles. The prices of baled bottles increased for instance between the years 2000 and 2008 from about 50 Euro/ton to over 500 Euro/ton in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and <b>price</b> <b>volatility</b> as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{question}} {{we seek to}} address in this paper is does monetary or price stability contribute to asset price stability. The literature in this regard, although rich and growing, is not yet settled with there being still no clear consensus on how one affects the other. Given the evidence of a stabilizing monetary policy and stable headline prices in the post-reform period since the mid - 1990 s, we argue that Indian economy is a fit case-study to examine such a nexus. Accordingly, we study the impact of money and price variability on asset <b>prices</b> <b>volatility</b> in India. We use data on BSE Sensex to proxy for asset prices and include variability of money supply and wholesale prices as explanatory variables for the volatility of the former. Using monthly data from 1980 : 04 to 2003 : 03, and employing alternative methodologies such as GARCH, MA, EWMA to estimate asset <b>prices</b> <b>volatility,</b> we test the hypothesis whether money and price variability have any bearing on asset <b>prices</b> <b>volatility</b> during the sample period as well as during the post-liberalization period alone.

2500|$|Interstate {{pipeline}} {{companies in}} the US {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Prior to 1992, these companies owned all the gas that flowed through their systems. This also included gas in their storage facility, over which they had complete control. Then FERC Order 636 was implemented. This required the companies to operate their facilities, including gas storage on an open access basis. For gas storage, this meant that these companies could only reserve the capacity needed to maintain system integrity. The rest of the capacity would be available for leasing to third parties on a nondiscriminatory basis. Open access has opened a wide variety of application for gas storage, particularly for marketers which can now exploit price arbitrage opportunities. Any storage capacity would be priced at cost-based pricing, unless the provider can demonstrate to FERC that it lacks market power, in which case it may be allowed to price at market-based rates to gain market share. FERC defines market power as [...] "..the ability of a seller profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time.". The underlying pricing structure for storage has discouraged development in the gas storage sector, which has not seen many new storage facilities constructed, besides current ones being expanded. In 2005, FERC announced a new Order 678 targeted particularly to gas storage. This rule is intended to stimulate the development of new gas storage facility in the ultimate goal of reducing natural gas <b>price</b> <b>volatility.</b> Commission Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher observed: [...] "Since 1988, natural gas demand in the United States has risen 24 percent. Over the same period, gas storage capacity has increased only 1.4 percent. While construction of storage capacity has lagged behind the demand for natural gas, we have seen record levels of <b>price</b> <b>volatility.</b> This suggests that current storage capacity is inadequate. Further, this year, what storage capacity exists may be full far earlier than in any previous year. According to some analysts, that raises the prospect that some domestic gas production may be shut-in. Our final rule should help reduce <b>price</b> <b>volatility</b> and expand storage capacity." ...|$|E
