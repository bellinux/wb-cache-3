40|$|International audienceLattice <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> of serpentines {{induce a}} strong {{anisotropy}} of various properties in serpentine bearing-rocks. Lattice <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> {{had so far}} been obtained only by X-ray diffraction techniques. We have applied electron back-scattering diffraction to the measurement of the lattice <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> of antigorite in a naturally deformed high-pressure serpentinite. This technique is very sensitive to sample preparation {{that can lead to}} surface amorphization in the case of serpentine. A polishing procedure is described that avoids amorphization and allows accurate electron back-scattering diffraction measurements with optimized experimental conditions in a variable pressure scanning electron microscope. Results indicate that deformation leads to lattice <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> characterized by extremely strong c-axis clustering perpendicular to the foliation, as expected for a layered silicate. In the foliation plane, a significant clustering of the a-axis is observed and tentatively attributed to intracrystalline deformation mechanisms. These data suggest that antigorite deforms mostly by gliding along the basal plane of the layered phyllosilicate structure, but that gliding may occur along directions favouring a-axis alignment. Electron back-scattering diffraction appears to be a reliable method for determining phyllosilicate lattice <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> in deformed rocks, with potential applications for determining anisotropy of properties like seismic velocities or thermal and electrical conductivities...|$|R

In this study, based on psychophysical measurements with ten human observers, threshold values of the angle between a target and background line elements were obtained as functions of background-element orientation, in brief masked displays. A repeated-loess analysis of the threshold functions suggested the existence of several groups of orientation-selective mechanisms contributing to rapid orientated-line detection; specifically, coarse, intermediate and fine mechanisms with <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> spaced at angles of approximately 90 degrees, 35 degrees, and 10 degrees- 25 degrees, respectively.

25|$|In an {{antiparallel}} arrangement, {{the successive}} β-strands alternate directions {{so that the}} N-terminus of one strand is adjacent to the C-terminus of the next. This is the arrangement that produces the strongest inter-strand stability because it allows the inter-strand hydrogen bonds between carbonyls and amines to be planar, which is their <b>preferred</b> <b>orientation.</b> The peptide backbone dihedral angles (φ,ψ) are about (–140°,135°) in antiparallel sheets. In this case, if two atoms C and C are adjacent in two hydrogen-bonded β-strands, then they form two mutual backbone hydrogen bonds to each other's flanking peptide groups; {{this is known as}} a close pair of hydrogen bonds.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePeridotite xenoliths with a {{broad range}} of textures {{provides}} evidence for consistent microstructural evolution in a vertical transect of the shallow lithospheric mantle (35 ? 55 km depth) beneath the Persani Mountains, SE Carpathians, Romania, due to ongoing plate convergence in the Carpathian Arc nearby. The recrystallized grain size, crystal <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> strength, and resulting seismic anisotropy vary continuously and display a strong correlation to equilibrium temperatures, suggesting a continuous change in deformation conditions with depth. The shallowmost xenoliths have microstructures typical of high stress deformation, marked by strong recrystallization to fine grain sizes, which results in weak crystal <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> and anisotropy. The deepest xenoliths have coarse-grained porphyroclastic microstructures and strong crystal <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations.</b> Replacive orthopyroxene structures, consuming olivine, and high H 2 O concentrations in the pyroxenes are observed in some xenoliths indicating limited percolation of fluids or volatile-rich melts. Despite the high stress deformation and high H 2 O contents in some of the studied xenoliths, analysis of olivine crystallographic orientations indicates that [100] slip systems, rather than ?wet? [001] accommodate most of the deformation in all samples. Seismic anisotropy estimated from the measured olivine and pyroxene crystal <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> suggests that the strike-parallel fast SKS polarization directions and ~ 1 s delay times measured in the SE Carpathians are likely the consequence of convergence-driven belt-parallel flow in the lithospheric mantle...|$|R

40|$|We {{discover}} and characterise strong quantum scars, or quantum eigenstates resembling classical periodic orbits, in two-dimensional quantum wells perturbed by local impurities. These scars are not explained by ordinary scar theory, {{which would require}} the existence of short, moderately unstable periodic orbits in the perturbed system. Instead, they are supported by classical resonances in the unperturbed system and the resulting quantum near-degeneracy. Even {{in the case of}} a large number of randomly scattered impurities, the scars <b>prefer</b> distinct <b>orientations</b> that extremise the overlap with the impurities. We demonstrate that these <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations</b> can be used for highly efficient transport of quantum wave packets across the perturbed potential landscape. Assisted by the scars, wave-packet recurrences are significantly stronger than in the unperturbed system. Together with the controllability of the <b>preferred</b> <b>orientations,</b> this property may be very useful for quantum transport applications...|$|R
