40|$|Tutorialpg. 221 Compared to {{leading edge}} {{technologies}} such as high speed turbomachinery, reciprocating pumps {{may appear to be}} a simple technology: A reciprocating plunger causes liquid to be drawn from a low <b>pressure</b> <b>manifold</b> through the suction check valves, and expelled into a high <b>pressure</b> <b>manifold</b> through the discharge check valves. However, the interaction of flow, valve dynamics, and the acoustics of the pump and piping system can generate high amplitude pressure pulsation, causing severe vibration and reliability problem in some systems. The effects of improperly operating valves, and the successful resolution of such problems with valve design modifications are examined. Since the pump vales are operated by the action of the fluid, valve components (including the spring, valve body, valve disc shape, and sealing surfaces, etc.) must be carefully selected to ensure that the valves open and close at the appropriate times. Problems associated with valve dynamics include over pressure spikes at the opening of discharge valves, under pressure spikes {{at the opening of the}} suction valves, high noise levels, and excessive wear of valve components. Severe over pressure spikes have been known to cause fatigue failures of pump working barrels, connecting rods, bearings, and even drive-train components. Under pressure spikes can cause cavitation that can also lead to plunger and valve failures, due to pitting damage. High level valve noise is usually indicative of sever impacts associated with the opening and closing of the valves. Impacts at the valve closing are sometimes referred to as valve hammer and can result in damage to the sealing surfaces. Impacts at the valve opening, which may be identified by damage to the back side of the valve disc, are due to the over pressure and under pressure spikes which can result in fatigue failures of the components. Excessive valve wear can also be experienced when the valve disc material is not suitable for the pumping conditions. The use of field data coupled with a computer model to analyze the valve dynamics will be presented. Using this tool, the effect of various valve modifications such as changes in sealing surfaces, valve lift, spring preload, and spring stiffness can be observed. Instrumentation and data analysis techniques to evaluate these problems will also be discussed. The effects of modifications to valves (including changes in lift, spring preload, spring construction and stiffness, valve disc geometries, etc.) will be examined using data from actual systems...|$|E
40|$|Copyright c ○ 2004 SAE International Mean value {{cylinder}} {{air charge}} (CAC) estimation models for control and diagnosis are investigated on turbocharged SI-engines. Two topics are studied; Firstly CAC changes due to fuel enrichment and secondly CAC sensitivity to exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> changes. The {{objective is to}} find a CAC model suitable for control and diagnosis. Measurements show that CAC models based on volumetric efficiency gives up to 10 % error during fuel enrichment. The error is caused by the cooling effect that the fuel has as it evaporates and thus increases the charge density. To better describe the CAC during fuel enrichment a simple one parameter model is proposed which reduces the CAC estimation error on experimental data from 10 % to 3 %. With active wastegate control, the pressure changes in the exhaust manifold influences the CAC. The magnitude of this influence is investigated using sensitivity analysis on an exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> dependent CACmodel. From the sensitivity analysis it can be concluded, that the CAC is most sensitive to exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> changes for low intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressures</b> (part load). Without taking the exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> into account the CAC error is approximately 5 % when the wastegate is opened at part load.

Furthermore, another radial basis function neural network is used as a fault classifier to isolate an occurred fault from other possible faults in the system by classifying fault characteristics embedded in the modelling errors. The performance of the developed scheme is assessed using an engine benchmark, the Mean Value Engine Model CMVEM), with Matlab/Simulink. Five faults have been simulated on the MVEM: three sensor faults, one component fault and one actuator fault. The three sensor faults considered are 10 ~ 20 % changes superimposed on the measured outputs of manifold <b>pressure,</b> <b>manifold</b> temperature and crankshaft speed sensors; the component fault considered is air leakage in the intake manifold; and the actuator fault considered is the malfunction of the fuel injector. The simulation results show that all the simulated faults can be clearly detected and isolated in dynamic conditions throughout the engine operating range. Furthermore, in order to reflect the real state for an automotive engine, the FDI method is evaluated for the MVEM system under closed-loop control with air fuel ratio control.

The thesis is conducted {{in order to improve}} the disturbance cancelation algorithm in the indirect tire pressure monitoring system, TPI developed by NIRA Dynamics AB. The model consists of two parts, the model of the engine and the model of the driveline. The engine model uses an analytical cylinder pressure model capable of describing petrol and diesel engines. The model {{is a function of the}} crank angle, manifold <b>pressure,</b> <b>manifold</b> temperature and spark timing. The output is the pressure in the cylinder. This pressure is then used to calculate the torque generated on the crankshaft when the pressure acts on the piston. This torque is then applied in the driveline model. Both a two wheel and a four wheel driveline model are presented and they consist of a series of masses and dampers connected to each other with stiff springs. The result is a 14 and 19 degrees of freedom system of differential equations respectively. The model is then validated using measurements collected at LiU during two experiments. Measurements where conducted of the cylinder pressure of a four cylinder petrol engine and on the wheel speed of two different cars when driven in a test rig. The validation against this data is satisfactory and the simulations and measurements show good correlation.

The effects of the drivelines natural frequencies are investigated and so is the difference between the disturbances on the wheel speed for a petrol and diesel engine.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{synthetic}} piperazines {{have been associated}} with multiple fatalities {{and was one of the}} top 25 identified drugs in 2011. While circumventing legislative controls and preventing the detection in standard drug tests, synthetic piperazine derivatives are encountered in forensic casework as “legal” alternatives to ecstasy (3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine). These chemically-produced compounds share very similar pharmacological and psychological effects with ecstasy which in turn has led to their popularity as “party pills”. The long-lasting duration of synthetic piperazines, especially when 1 -benzylpiperazine (BZP) is mixed with 1 -(3 -trifluoromethylphenyl) -piperazine (TFMPP), has also made them desirable to drug users to receive enhanced hallucinogenic effects. 	Although most methods are optimized to accurately quantify the amount of drugs in biological specimens submitted for forensic toxicology testing, unforeseeable challenges may arise to complicate the analysis such as postmortem redistribution, enzymatic reactions, the presence of bacterial activities, chemical and matrix interferences as well as the lack of reference materials. Thus, the purpose of this research was to investigate the stability of synthetic piperazines in human whole blood under various storage conditions and time ranges. A total of eight synthetic piperazines were assessed on their degrees of degradation using a Shimadzu Ultra-Fast Liquid Chromatography (UFLC) with SCIEX 4000 Q-Trap Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry in positive ionization mode. These analytes included: 1 -benzylpiperazine (BZP), 1 -(4 -fluorobenzyl) -piperazine (FBZP), 1 -(4 -methylbenzyl) -piperazine (MBZP), 1 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) -piperazine (MeOPP), 1 -(para-fluorophenyl) -piperazine (pFPP), 1 -(3 -chlorophenyl) -piperazine (mCPP), 2, 3 -dichlorophenylpiperazine (DCPP), and 1 -(3 -trifluoromethylphenyl) -piperazine (TFMPP). 	Individual unknown samples were prepared by spiking certified reference standards (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, U. S. A.) of each synthetic piperazine into certified drug-free human whole blood (UTAK Laboratories, Inc., Valencia, CA, U. S. A.) independently at 1000 ng/mL. To closely monitor the stability of each compound and potential drug-drug interactions, mixed samples consisted of all eight piperazines were also stored at room temperature (~ 20 °C), 4 °C and - 20 °C for one, three, six, nine and twelve months in dark sealed containers. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was performed to remove unwanted components prior to the injection into the LC system. Drug of Abuse (DAU) mixed-mode copolymeric columns (Clean Screen®, UCT Inc., Levittown, PA, U. S. A.) were utilized with a positive <b>pressure</b> <b>manifold</b> rack followed by evaporating to dryness with low heat at 65 °C. All samples were then reconstituted with 250 µL of 50 : 50 mixture of methanol and 2 mM ammonium formate buffer with 0. 2 % formic acid (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, U. S. A.). Analysis was performed in triplicate using a reversed-phase column (Kinetex® F 5, Phenomenex®, Torrance, CA, U. S. A.) with a binary gradient of a 2 mM ammonium formate buffer with 0. 2 % formic acid and methanol with 0. 1 % formic acid. The total run time was 11. 5 minutes including equilibration and the flow rate was 0. 4 mL/min. Three internal standards including BZP-d 7, mCPP-d 8 and TFMPP-d 4 (Cerilliant, Round Rock, TX, U. S. A) were used to generate calibration curves that were ranged from 20 ng/mL to 2000 ng/mL. Results revealed that BZP, MBZP and FBZP were more stable than phenyl piperazines over time under all storage conditions, in which MBZP was consistently more stable and still had more than 70 % remaining after 12 months. Data showed a smaller degree of degradation when samples were kept frozen or refrigerated; whereas storing at room temperature should be avoided to ensure minimal degradation and detrimental impacts on stability of piperazine compounds. For crime laboratories that are facing backlog situations, case samples with synthetic piperazines should be kept frozen or refrigerated even for time period as short as 30 days or less. However, storing them for too long will clearly affect the quantitation accuracy because phenyl piperazines are more susceptible to degrade completely after six months regardless of storage conditions. Additionally, matrix interference was present due to the outlier of MBZP quantified on Day 270. Drug-drug interaction was also observed in the analyte mixture but the exact stability pattern of phenyl piperazines when mixed together could not be determined from this data set alone due to discrepancies observed on Day 91 and 270. This research project had shown a solid method to examine how quickly or slowly synthetic piperazines degrade in blood at different storage conditions. To further this study, it would be also important to evaluate the number of freeze-thaw cycles on each specimen in order to minimize the effect of non-metabolic degradation...|$|E
