500|$|In 1944, the Sukhoi design bureau (OKB) began {{designing}} a twin-engined fighter powered by two Lyulka TR-1 turbojets, known internally as the Samolyet or Izdeliye (item or product) K. The ultimate design was very probably {{influenced by a}} captured Messerschmitt Me 262, but the Su-9 was not {{a copy of the}} German aircraft. The Su-9 had an oval cross-section, all-metal stressed skin monocoque fuselage that housed a single cockpit. The pilot was protected by armor plates to his front, an armored seat back and a bulletproof windscreen for the bubble canopy. He was provided with an ejection seat, copied from that used in the Heinkel He 162 [...] The aircraft carried a total of [...] of fuel in two bladder tanks, one each ahead and behind the pilot. The low-mounted, straight wing had a single-spar and a slight dihedral of 4°20'. The outer flaps were split and could act as air brakes. The Su-9 was the first Soviet aircraft to use hydraulic <b>powered</b> <b>controls.</b> A Soviet copy of the Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet, known as the RD-10, was hung under each wing in a streamlined nacelle. The aircraft had a tricycle undercarriage that retracted into the fuselage. The Su-9 was designed with a very high wing loading which increased the aircraft's speed and reduced its dimensions. This consequently increased the take-off and landing speeds so it was equipped with a provision for two JATO bottles (11.27kN (530lbf) thrust for 8 seconds) mounted {{on the sides of the}} fuselage. These reduced the take-off distance by nearly 50 percent and a braking parachute was fitted to reduce the landing distance.|$|E
2500|$|From March 1970 {{the bureau}} {{developed}} all-new designs under the Il-86 designation. Instead of the [...] "appropriate technology" [...] {{approach of the}} Il-62, these designs were to have <b>powered</b> <b>controls,</b> complex high-lift devices and advanced automation which would {{reduce the number of}} flightdeck crew.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity was {{provided}} via a bleed air-driven turbine {{housed in the}} rear fuselage, which in turn drove an AC alternator and DC generator; the approach was considered unusual at the time due to most aircraft using driveshaft-driven generators/alternators for electrical energy. A 28V DC battery provided emergency backup power. Aviation author Kev Darling stated of the Lightning: [...] "Never before had a fighter been so dependent upon electronics". Each engine was equipped {{with a pair of}} hydraulic pumps, one of which would provide pressure for the flight-control systems and the other, pressure for the undercarriage, flaps, and airbrakes; switchable hydraulic circuits were used for redundancy {{in the event of a}} leak or other failure. A combination of Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid brakes on the main wheels and an Irvin Air Chute braking parachute slowed the aircraft during landing; a tailhook was also fitted. Accumulators on the wheel brakes performed as backups to the hydraulics, providing minimal braking. Above a certain airspeed a stopped engine would 'windmill', i.e., continue to be rotated by the air flowing through it in a similar manner to a ram air turbine, sufficiently to still generate adequate hydraulic power for the <b>powered</b> <b>controls</b> during flight.|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanisms}} of PC can be largely classified into static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> and dynamic <b>power</b> <b>control.</b> A static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> allocation assigns <b>power</b> levels to the nodes {{that do not}} change frequently over time, unless there are drastic changes in the network topology. On the other hand, with dynamic <b>power</b> <b>control</b> strategies, every node changes its power level for transmission frequently over the time. Such changes can be made on per link, per destination, per TDMA slot or per packet basis. The Static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms are simpler and more robust but often result in suboptimal performance due to their inefficient adaptation of changing traffic demands and dynamic wireless conditions. Static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms can be further classified into uniform range <b>power</b> <b>control</b> and variable range <b>power</b> <b>control</b> [23].|$|R

50|$|Another {{first for}} Cessna is the {{inclusion}} of <b>powered</b> <b>controls</b> in the Citation X. The controls are powered by dual-hydraulic systems for redundancy. There are two elevators and the tailplane is all-moving for trim. The rudder is in two pieces: the lower portion is hydraulically powered and the upper portion is electrically powered. Each wing has five spoiler panels, to be used both for roll control (in addition to the ailerons) and as speed brakes. One of the major challenges of the Citation X design was finding enough space in the wing to run all the necessary hydraulic lines. As Paul Kalberer, the chief engineer of the Citation X program, explained, the Citation X needs just as many hydraulic pumps and actuators as a large airliner, but has much less space inside the wings.|$|E
5000|$|Building on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin {{modified}} {{a commercial}} {{variant of the}} C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130. [...] Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully <b>powered</b> <b>controls,</b> in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit. The HTTB first flew on 19 June 1984, with civil registration of N130X. After demonstrating many new technologies, {{some of which were}} applied to the C-130J, the HTTB was lost in a fatal accident on 3 February 1993, at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, in Marietta, Georgia. [...] The crash was attributed to disengagement of the rudder fly-by-wire flight control system, resulting in a total loss of rudder control capability while conducting ground minimum control speed tests (Vmcg). The disengagement was a result of the inadequate design of the rudder's integrated actuator package by its manufacturer; the operator's insufficient system safety review failed to consider the consequences of the inadequate design to all operating regimes. A factor which contributed to the accident was the flight crew's lack of engineering flight test training.|$|E
