50|$|Using NaxC6 as the anode, {{the average}} voltage {{on the low}} <b>potential</b> <b>plateau</b> was higher for Na cells than Li cells. Unlike {{traditional}} Li cells, which make use of an intercalated graphite anode with a fully lithiated stoichiometry of LiC6, Na capacity in graphite is very low. This is because of a weak binding between Na and carbon. In fact, quantum-mechanical calculations show that among the alkali and alkaline earth metals, Na and Mg generally have the weakest chemical binding to a given substrate, compared with the other elements in {{the same group of}} the periodic table. The phenomenon arises from the competition between trends in the ionization energy and the ion-substrate coupling, down the columns of the periodic table. For these reasons, carbon-based anodes rely on amorphous carbon that consists of spatially disoriented graphene sheets, defects and interstitial pores. These amorphous carbon allotropes can be categorized as hard or soft. Soft carbons can be transformed into graphite through annealing at high temperatures. Hard carbon materials can be derived from feedstocks such as: sugar, starch, fiber and certain polymers.|$|E

The effects of increases in ventricular volume and pressure on epicardial monophasic action potentials were therefore investigated in isolated, cross circulated and in situ canine hearts. In seven isolated hearts, increases in ventricular volume and pressure resulted in (1) a linearly related decrease in action potential amplitude (r = 0. 988; slope = 0. 41 % amplitudeml-I; volume intercept = 17. 6 ml), mainly due to a decrease in maximum diastolic potential; (2) a decrease in action <b>potential</b> <b>plateau</b> duration (at 20 % repolarisation) by 19 (SD 8) %; and (3) appearance of early afterdepolarisations, reaching up to 18 % of total action potential amplitude. Afterdepolarisations occurred only when ventricular outflow was obstructed at end diastole but not at end systole. In eight in situ hearts, increase in left intraventricular pressure produced by transient occlusions of the ascending aorta was also accompanied by decrease in maximum diastolic potential and action <b>potential</b> <b>plateau</b> duration, and by appearance of early afterdepolarisations.

Slow potentials with initial fast and subsequent <b>plateau</b> components (<b>plateau</b> <b>potentials),</b> generated at a frequency of 14. 8 min− 1, were recorded from oval-shaped cells with bipolar processes. Periodic bursts of spike potentials (4. 6 min− 1) and bursts of oscillatory potentials (4. 3 min− 1) were recorded in circular and longitudinal smooth muscle cells, respectively. Nifedipine (0. 1 μm) abolished the bursts of spike and oscillatory potentials and reduced the duration of <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials.</b> The <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials</b> were abolished by 1 μm nifedipine. The <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials</b> were also abolished by cyclopiazonic acid (an inhibitor of Ca 2 + uptake into internal stores) or 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (an inhibitor of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca 2 + release), and were inhibited by bis-(aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (a chelator of intracellular Ca 2 +). Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (a mitochondrial protonophore) abolished <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials,</b> and its action was not mimicked by oligomycin (an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase). It is concluded that in mouse proximal colon, submucosal c-kit-positive bipolar cells spontaneously generate <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials</b> with rhythms different from those generated by smooth muscle cells.

To {{study the}} mechanism responsible, patch-clamp techniques {{were used to}} evaluate transmembrane ionic currents during "reperfusion" after a CN(-) -induced metabolic surrogate for ischemia in isolated myocytes from a feline model of experimental LVH. Reperfusion caused the generation of early afterdepolarizations (EADs) from an average take-off potential of - 33 mV in LVH cells but not in cells from normal hearts. 10 min after initiating reperfusion of normal cells, action potential duration (APD) at 50 % repolarization (APD 50) lengthened from 198 +/- 41 to 233 +/- 57 ms whereas in LVH cells APD 50 lengthened from 262 +/- 84 to 349 +/- 131 ms (P < 0. 05). Among the LVH cells, APD 50 lengthening was significantly greater in the cells that had developed EADs. During reperfusion, steady state outward current in the voltage range of the action <b>potential</b> <b>plateau</b> (between - 20 and + 20 mV) was reduced from the control values in LVH cells but not in normal cells. Reperfusion-related reduction of steady state outward current in LVH cells was abolished under experimental conditions in which L-type Ca 2 + current was isolated from other classes of currents whereas it was still observed under the condition in which pure K+ currents could be recorded.

In all spiny neurons of the forebrain, adequate glutamatergic inputs generate dendritic <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials</b> (dendritic UP states) characterized by (i) fast rise, (ii) plateau phase lasting several hundred milliseconds and (iii) abrupt decline {{at the end of the}} plateau phase. The dendritic <b>plateau</b> <b>potential</b> propagates towards the cell body decrementally to induce a long-lasting (longer than 100 ms, most often 200 – 800 ms) steady depolarization (~ 20 mV amplitude), which resembles a neuronal UP state.

The somatic plateau rises after the onset of the dendritic voltage transient and collapses with the breakdown of the dendritic plateau depolarization. We hypothesize that neuronal UP states in vivo reflect the occurrence of dendritic <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials</b> (dendritic UP states). We propose that the somatic voltage waveform during a neuronal UP state is determined by dendritic <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials.</b> A mammalian spiny neuron uses dendritic <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials</b> to detect and transform coherent network activity into a ubiquitous neuronal UP state.

Two signals in a 2 : 1 ratio at extremely high chemical shifts of 412 and 433 ppm, respectively, relative to 1 M aqueous lithium chloride solution, were detected and give the indisputable evidence that lithiation of the clathrate-II framework was successful. Hence, this work presents a new method for filling clathrate cages and moreover, the first lithium containing clathrate compound...|$|E

40|$|Spinal motor neurones can exhibit {{sustained}} depolarization in {{the absence}} of maintained synaptic or injected current. This phenomenon, referred to as a <b>plateau</b> <b>potential,</b> is due to the activation of monoamine-dependent persistent inward currents. Accordingly, activation of a <b>plateau</b> <b>potential</b> should result in a decrease in the excitatory synaptic drive required to activate a motor unit. This, in turn, has been suggested to cause a progressive decline in the muscle force at which motor units are recruited during repeated voluntary contractions. Such a progressive decrease in threshold force associated with preceding activation of a <b>plateau</b> <b>potential</b> is referred to as ‘warm up’. Furthermore, activation of a <b>plateau</b> <b>potential</b> is thought to manifest itself as a decrease in the derecruitment force compared to recruitment force. Multiple muscles, however, can contribute to the detected force and their relative contributions may vary over time, which could confound measures of recruitment and derecruitment force. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to compare the recruitment and derecruitment forces of single motor units in the human extensor digitorum and tibialis anterior during repetitive triangular-force contractions in which the contributions of other muscles had been minimized. In both muscles, we found that the recruitment thresholds of single motor units were unchanged during repeated contractions, and that the derecruitment force was consistently greater than the recruitment force. These results suggest either that <b>plateau</b> <b>potentials</b> were not engaged (or were rapidly extinguished) under these experimental conditions or that changes in recruitment and derecruitment force are not suitable criteria for detecting them...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{simplified}} {{model in}} this paper relies exclusively on the ERG K+ current to repolarize the membrane after a <b>plateau</b> <b>potential</b> or the depolarization block that can follow a burst, {{it is likely that}} several slow outward currents, such as I_Na,p or additional slow K+ currents contribute to burst termination and recovery from depolarization block in vivo, because blocking the ERG K+ current only rarely causes cells to fail to repolarize from the <b>plateau</b> <b>potential</b> induced by negative modulation of the SK channel current [20].|$|R
