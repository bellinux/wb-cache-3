50|$|A secretagogue is a {{substance}} that causes another substance to be secreted.

The pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test is useful in cases of suspected MTC that are not associated with elevated calcitonin. In these patients, injecting <b>pentagastrin</b> will cause calcitonin levels to rise significantly above the normal or basal range. After a total thyroidectomy for medullary thyroid carcinoma, the pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin release can be used to detect residual parafollicular cell C-cells.|$|E

His {{certificate}} of election to the Royal Society reads: Has made outstanding contributions, based on fundamental considerations of receptor theory, to the development of new drugs of clinical importance. Introduced the first effective beta blockers and analysed their cardiovascular effects. These drugs have opened up new perspectives for the treatment of angina pectoris, cardiac irregularities and hypertension. More recently, in a concerted drive carried out with great vision, he has developed a new type of histamine antagonist capable of inhibiting gastric acid secretion induced by histamine or <b>pentagastrin.</b> Apart from its practical implications this work has considerable fundamental importance since it provided evidence for the existence of a new type of histamine receptor. This work has also provided experimental support for the hypothesis that endogenous histamine may be involved in the secretion of acid in the stomach. In 1979, he was awarded the Artois-Baillet Latour Health Prize. In 1982 Black was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine. and the year after the Scheele Award. He was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine along with Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings for their work on drug development.

40|$|Patients with {{duodenal}} ulcer disease received either a two hour <b>pentagastrin</b> infusion test {{or a similar}} test {{with the addition of}} a bolus of cimetidine, 200 mg, after one hour of <b>pentagastrin.</b> <b>Pentagastrin</b> induced secretion of acid and histamine, the secretion patterns of the two being similar. Total histamine output in the gastric aspirate in the first hour of <b>pentagastrin</b> infusion was related to total acid output (r = 0. 58, p less than 0. 01). A similar correlation was observed during the second hour of <b>pentagastrin</b> infusion (r = 0. 61, p less than 0. 05). Plasma histamine concentration rose to a peak coinciding with maximal acid secretion. After cimetidine blockade, gastric acid fell rapidly but gastric histamine output did not change. Plasma histamine concentration increased further. These results suggest that <b>pentagastrin</b> induced gastric histamine release is not affected by an acid inhibiting dose of cimetidine. Cimetidine caused histamine release into the circulation in both healthy volunteers and patients after total gastrectomy. The rise in plasma histamine concentration, however, was transient. In contrast, during <b>pentagastrin</b> infusion, the plasma histamine concentration remained high. These data support the hypothesis that histamine release induced by <b>pentagastrin</b> is a major stimulant of gastric acid secretion...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>pentagastrin</b> on {{oesophageal}} motility was studied in six subjects with idiopathic diffuse oesophageal spasm (IDOS). <b>Pentagastrin</b> was administered by continuous intravenous infusion in doses of 1 microgram/kg/h, 5 micrograms/kg/h, and 10 micrograms/kg/h.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>pentagastrin</b> on lower esophageal {{sphincter}} (LES) pressure {{has been studied}} in trained, unanesthetized dogs. LES pressure was monitored by an infusion manometric technique. Increasing doses of <b>pentagastrin</b> up to 3 mug/kg given as an i. v. bolus resulted in increasing rises in LES pressure; larger doses resulted in a lesser effect of shorter duration. Increasing i. v. boluses of methacholine produced greater increases in LES pressure up {{to a maximum of}} 5 mug/kg; higher doses had similar effects. Atropine (50 - 100 mug/kg) slightly diminished the response of the LES to 2 or 6 mug/kg of <b>pentagastrin.</b> In large doses (500 - 2, 000 mug/kg), atropine did not diminish the response to <b>pentagastrin</b> and prolonged the response of 6 mug/kg <b>pentagastrin.</b> Hexamethonium (2 mg/kg i. v.) depressed the peak response to 3 mug/kg <b>pentagastrin</b> slightly but the response to 6 mug/kg was increased and prolonged. Propranolol (2 mg/kg i. v.) significantly prolonged the effect of 6 mug/kg <b>pentagastrin</b> on the LES. We conclude that the stimulatory effect of <b>pentagastrin</b> is mainly due to a direct action on the LES. A lesser stimulatory effect is due to an action on preganglionic cholinergic neurons. Large doses of <b>pentagastrin</b> have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects. The inhibitory effect is mediated at least in part via preganglionic neurons acting through adrenergic receptors. Ganglionic transmission of the effect may be through muscarinic as well as nicotinic receptors...|$|E
40|$|Does gastrin stimulate {{gastric acid}} {{secretion}} by direct action on oxyntic cells, by releasing histamine, or by being potentiated by histamine? Previous {{studies in the}} mouse pointed to gastrin-regulated histamine release. Guinea pig and rat are well known to vary in their sensitivity to histamine. Therefore, the effects of histamine and <b>pentagastrin</b> were compared quantitatively on isolated, lumen-perfused, stomach preparations from these species in the absence and presence of histamine H 2 -receptor blockade. The loss of potency of histamine in the rat was mirrored by a loss of potency of <b>pentagastrin</b> {{consistent with the idea}} that <b>pentagastrin</b> acts by releasing histamine. In the rat, a well-defined <b>pentagastrin</b> curve was obtained in the presence of histamine H 2 -receptor block as though <b>pentagastrin</b> acts both directly on the oxyntic cell and indirectly by releasing histamine. It was not necessary to invoke a potentiating interaction between histamine and <b>pentagastrin</b> at the oxyntic cell; the two effects appeared simply to add. Potentiation was observed, however, between other combinations of stimuli, for example, between vagal nerve and <b>pentagastrin</b> stimulation. The physiological consequences of these results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the CCKB-receptor agonist <b>pentagastrin,</b> a {{synthetic}} analogue of the cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK- 4), were studied in seven patients suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and seven healthy controls. All subjects were challenged with an IV dose of 0. 6 mu g/kg <b>pentagastrin</b> or placebo under double blind placebo controlled conditions, on two separate occasions, with a minimum interval of 1 week. Six (86 %) out of seven OCD patients experienced a panic-like reaction after <b>pentagastrin</b> administration, against only two (29 %) in the control group. These differences failed to reach statistical significance, {{probably due to the}} small sample size. No increases were observed in obsessions or compulsive behaviors as assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Challenge Scale, neither in the <b>pentagastrin,</b> nor in the placebo condition. These findings suggest that <b>pentagastrin</b> has panic-inducing properties in OCD patients, without affecting the core symptoms. The panic-inducing properties of <b>pentagastrin</b> are not specific for panic disorder patients, which might be indicative of a common neurobiological dysfunction in panic disorder and OCD at the level of CCK-B receptors...|$|E

40|$|Gastrin-like immunoreactive {{substances}} {{have been}} reported as occurring in both digestive tract tissues and nervous system, including the hypothalamus and the anterior and posterior pituitary. The carboxyterminal tetrapeptide shared by gastrin and cholecystokinin, which represents the bioactive site of both hormones, {{has been shown to}} be a secretagogue for insulin and glucagon and it might have a neurotrasmitter function. As small gastrin-like peptides may also play a role in the regulation of anterior pituitary hormones, the present study deals with the in vivo effect of <b>pentagastrin</b> on the release of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL). Six healthy volunteer males and six healthy volunteer females were studied. All females subjects were in the early follicular phase of the normal menstrual cycle and all subjects were not taking or had been taking any drug known to affect GH or PRL secretion. A continuous intravenous infusion of <b>pentagastrin</b> (1. 5 micrograms/kg/h) was administered to all the subjects for a time of 3 hours. In males <b>pentagastrin</b> infusion resulted in a significant increase in GH concentration from basal values (P less than 0. 01 at 60 min). In females <b>pentagastrin</b> infusion did not affect GH levels. PRL levels were not affected at all by intravenous <b>pentagastrin</b> infusion both in males and females. The exact understanding of <b>pentagastrin</b> action on GH release awaits further investigation. The different pattern between male and female subjects suggests a sexual hormone influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary sites of action of <b>pentagastrin</b> in vivo.

The study was repeated on another day during infusion of glucagon in {{a dose of}} 103 pmol/kg/h (0. 36 micrograms/kg/h) which results in plasma-glucagon concentrations comparable with those seen after a protein-rich meal. Pepsin output was maximal after 0. 2 nmol/kg/h (0. 1 microgram/kg/h) of <b>pentagastrin</b> and 20 nmol/kg/h (10 micrograms/kg/h) resulted in a marked decrease. The dose of <b>pentagastrin</b> required for half-maximal pepsin output was less than 0. 1 nmol/kg/h (0. 05 micrograms/kg/h). When the study was repeated during infusion of glucagon, the dose-response curve was shifted to the right. The highest pepsin output was obtained with 20 nmol/kg/h (10 micrograms/kg/h) of <b>pentagastrin</b> and D 50 increased to well over 1 microgram/kg/h.

40|$|<b>Pentagastrin,</b> a {{cholecystokinin}} 2 (CCK 2) receptor agonist, evokes autonomic {{and subjective}} features of anxiety in healthy volunteers. The present experiments {{examined the effects}} of <b>pentagastrin</b> on two responses with known sensitivity to another anxiogenic procedure (threat of electric shock) : the acoustic startle response and the pupillary light reflex. The effects of <b>pentagastrin</b> were compared with those of the cold pressor test, a procedure known to elicit sympathetic activation. Twelve healthy males (18 - 35 years) participated in two experiments each consisting of two sessions in which they received (1) <b>pentagastrin</b> (0. 3 microg/kg, i. v.) and a control infusion (saline), and (2) cold pressor test (90 s hand immersion at 4 degrees C) and a control immersion (37 degrees C), using a balanced single-blind protocol. Electromyographic responses of the orbicularis oculi to 40 ms, 1 kHz, 115 dB tones ('startle responses') [Experiment 1], and miotic responses to 200 ms, 0. 43 mW/cm 2 light pulses [Experiment 2] were recorded before, during and after the infusions and hand immersions. Heart rate, blood pressure and subjective feelings were also recorded. The amplitude of the startle response was not significantly affected by <b>pentagastrin,</b> but was reduced during the cold pressor test. Resting pupil diameter increased during both <b>pentagastrin</b> infusion and the cold pressor test, but neither procedure altered the amplitude of the light reflex. Tachycardia, increased blood pressure and subjective anxiety were induced by both <b>pentagastrin</b> and the cold pressor test. The cardiovascular and mydriatic effects of <b>pentagastrin</b> and the cold pressor test are consistent with the known ability of these treatments to induce sympathetic activation. The anxiety induced by these treatments, unlike anxiety induced by threat of electric shock, was not accompanied by potentiation of the startle response or reduction of the miotic response. The results indicate that different anxiogenic procedures do not have equivalent effects on these reflexes...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the effects of <b>pentagastrin</b> and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on stress-induced ulceration and on the antral content of gastrin and somatostatin (SLI) in rats. Four groups of 14 to 15 rats had been prepared for 7 days by one of the following methods: saline injection (control); injection of <b>pentagastrin</b> (250 micrograms/kg, 3 times/day); injection of EGF (10 micrograms/kg, 3 times/day); or injection of EGF plus <b>pentagastrin.</b> At the end of the treatment period, half of each group of rats were sacrificed (nonstress group). There were no ulcers in the nonstress control groups of rats. Stress was applied by water immersion in the remaining half of the rats. The injections of <b>pentagastrin</b> and/or EGF resulted in substantial increase in antral content of SLI. After 20 hours of stress, the ulcer index was 40. 5 +/- 3. 3 in the controls, compared to 6. 4 +/- 1. 2 and 16. 2 +/- 2. 3 in rats that received <b>pentagastrin</b> or EGF, respectively. Injections of both <b>pentagastrin</b> and EGF resulted in an ulcer index of 26. 2 +/- 2. 0, which was significantly lower than that in controls, but higher than that in rats treated with either peptide alone. The stress resulted in significant decrease in antral SLI in all groups of rats, whereas SLI content in rats treated with <b>pentagastrin</b> and/or EGF remained significantly higher than that of controls. Antral content of gastrin did not differ significantly in the four groups tested. The ulcer index was inversely correlated with antral SLI content. We confirm and extend previous observations that <b>pentagastrin</b> and EGF prevent stress ulcer formation, and suggest that endogenous SLI may account, at least in part, for their antiulcer activity...|$|E
40|$|Salivary {{secretion}} is principally {{regulated by}} autonomic nerves. However, recent evidence from in vivo animal experiments suggests that gastrointestinal peptide hormones can also influence saliva production. The {{aim of the}} present study was to define the secretagogue activity of the gastrin-analogue <b>pentagastrin</b> in human salivary glands. For this purpose, parotid tissues were exposed to <b>pentagastrin</b> in vitro. Morphological techniques were used to evaluate modifications to serous acinar cells associated with secretion. Using a variant of the osmium maceration method, high resolution scanning electron microscopy allowed assessment of the morphology of the cytoplasmic aspect of the plasmalemma to demonstrate secretory activity. To quantify responses to <b>pentagastrin,</b> we recorded morphometric data on microvilli, microbuds, and protrusions. Dose-dependent morphological changes were observed, whereas protein concentration increased in the incubate. The use of selective receptor antagonists showed <b>pentagastrin</b> to act principally via cholecystokinin-A receptors. The morphological responses observed following exposure to <b>pentagastrin</b> differed from those elicited following exposure to the pan-muscarinic agonist carbachol. This study provides the first demonstration of a direct secretory action of gastrointestinal peptides on salivary glands in humans...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the ability of}} intravenous (i. v.) challenge with <b>pentagastrin</b> to induce behavioural and cardiovascular effects consistent with panic attack in conscious rhesus monkeys.

Behaviour was rated by a blind observer continuously during, {{and for the first}} 5 min immediately following i. v. injections while the monkey sat on the handler's lap, and then for a further 25 min in an individual observation cage. In separate experiments, the ability of <b>pentagastrin</b> to alter cardiovascular parameters which may accompany panic or anxiety (elevated heart rate and blood pressure) was explored. For cardiovascular studies, 8 male or female rhesus monkeys with femoral artery catheters were chair restrained and received a bolus injection of <b>pentagastrin</b> (4, 8 or 16 micrograms/kg) or saline into the saphenous vein at 30 min intervals. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously using a Statham Gould pressure transducer. <b>Pentagastrin</b> induced no consistent behavioural or cardiovascular changes. Similar pilot studies using CCK 4 also failed to reveal such effects.

40|$|The {{effects on}} {{gastrointestinal}} myoelectric activity of infused <b>pentagastrin,</b> cholecystokinin (CCK), and secretin at physiological doses were studied in live dogs with implanted serosal electrodes during 56 six-hour studies. <b>Pentagastrin</b> dose-dependently increased gastric and duodenal slow-wave frequencies; secretin and CCK did not. <b>Pentagastrin</b> and CCK diminished {{the incidence of}} fasting migrating myoelectric complexes (MMCs), but MMCs were abolished only in the proximal small intestine. <b>Pentagastrin</b> infusion was not reflected in an increased number of spikes, whereas CCK induced a dose-dependent increase in jejunal spike activity. Secretin dose-dependently decreased duodenal and jejunal spike incidence without a marked effect on MMC incidence. Analysis of patterns of spike activity showed significant dose-dependent changes with all three peptides. The different effects of <b>pentagastrin</b> and CCK on spike activity in these studies {{may have been a}} consequence of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. None of the three peptides produced a pattern of myoelectric activity which closely resembled that seen on feeding; since, unlike food, all three peptides had little or no effect on the distal small intestine, it seems unlikely that combinations of these peptides are responsible for the change induced by food. The failure of these peptides to abolish fasting patterns in the distal intestine suggests a possible mechanism for some types of post-vagotomy dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Background : The {{cholecystokinin}} agonist <b>pentagastrin</b> {{has been}} used to study panic attacks in the laboratory and to investigate hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity. Its mechanism of panicogenesis remains unclear. Data from other models suggest that respiratory stimulation itself may induce panic, but pentagastrin's effects on respiration are not well established. Data from another model also suggest links between respiratory and HPA axis reactivity and cognitive modulation of both. To further explore these phenomena, we added respiratory measures to a study of cognitive modulation of HPA and anxiety responses to <b>pentagastrin.</b> Methods : Healthy subjects received <b>pentagastrin</b> and placebo injections, with measurement of cortisol and subjective responses, on two different laboratory visits. They were randomly assigned to receive standard instructions or one of two versions of previously studied cognitive interventions (to either facilitate coping or increase sense of control), given before each visit. Capnograph measures of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and end-tidal pCO 2 were obtained on 24 subjects. Results : Relative to placebo, <b>pentagastrin</b> induced a significant decline in pCO 2 with no change in RR. Cortisol and HR increased, as expected. Cognitive intervention reduced the hyperventilatory response to <b>pentagastrin.</b> Conclusions : <b>Pentagastrin</b> stimulates respiration, likely via increases in tidal volume. Respiratory stimulation could play a role in its panicogenic potency, though perhaps indirectly. As with HPA axis responses, higher-level brain processes may be capable of modulating pentagastrin-induced hyperventilation. This model may be useful for further study of cortical/cognitive control of interacting emotional, respiratory, and neuroendocrine sensitivities, with potential relevance to panic pathophysiology.

40|$|The {{action and}} {{mechanism}} of action of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK- 8) and <b>pentagastrin</b> on isolated segments of guinea-pig duodenum were examined using contractility studies and by intracellular recordings made from smooth muscle cells. Both CCK- 8 and <b>pentagastrin</b> caused an excitatory contractile response. The threshold concentration ranged from 5 X 10 (- 11) to 10 (- 9) M for CCK- 8 and 5 X 10 (- 10) to 10 (- 8) M for <b>pentagastrin.</b> The excitatory response was abolished by tetrodotoxin (3. 1 X 10 (- 6) M) and atropine (1. 5 X 10 (- 6) M) and inhibited by d-tubocurarine (up to 2. 9 X 10 (- 5) M). In the presence of atropine a proportion of preparations relaxed in response to CCK- 8 (nineteen of thirty-one) and <b>pentagastrin</b> (thirteen of seventeen). This response was only seen at high concentrations of the peptides (10 (- 8) - 10 (- 7) M) and was abolished by tetrodotoxin (3 X 10 (- 6) M). Intracellular recordings from duodenal smooth muscle revealed multiple excitatory junction potentials (e. j. p. s) in response to CCK- 8 and to <b>pentagastrin.</b> These e. j. p. s were identical to those evoked by transmural nerve stimulation and were abolished by atropine (1. 5 X 10 (- 7) M) and by tetrodotoxin (3 X 10 (- 6) M). Inhibitory junction potentials (i. j. p. s) were not recorded {{in response to the}} peptides except on one occasion. It is suggested that CCK- 8 and <b>pentagastrin</b> cause an increase in duodenal motility by the selective activation of excitatory pathways in the enteric nervous system...|$|E
40|$|The {{histamine}} H- 3 receptor {{has been}} shown to inhibit pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion in dogs. Since <b>pentagastrin</b> releases histamine in dogs, we have now assessed whether the effects of H- 3 -receptor ligands may be indirectly mediated by changes in gastric histamine release. Methods: <b>Pentagastrin</b> infusions (1 or 6 mu g/kg/h), alone or together with the H- 3 -receptor agonist (R) alpha-methylhistamine (1. 2 mu mol/kg/h) or the agonist thioperamide (0. 1 mu mol/kg/h), were performed in dogs. One group (anaesthetized) was used for enzyme immunoassays of plasma histamine and, when required, (R) alpha-methylhistamine in the gastrosplenic vein, and another group (non-anaesthetized) for measurement of gastric acid secretion. Results: Histamine levels were increased five- and eight-fold after 1 and 6 mu g/kg/h <b>pentagastrin,</b> respectively, whereas acid output was nearly maximal at the lower dosage. (R) alpha-methylhistamine, at a plasma concentration of 0. 15 mu M, inhibited histamine release by 78 % (P < 0. 007) and 37 % (not significant) and the total acid output by 44 % (P < 0. 05) and 19 % (not significant) after infusion of 1 and 6 mu g/kg/h <b>pentagastrin,</b> respectively. Thioperamide, together with <b>pentagastrin</b> in low dose, significantly increased histamine release by 212 % (P < 0. 05), whereas acid output increased by 34 % (not significant). Conclusions: The histamine H- 3 receptor mediates a negative feedback control of pentagastrin-induced release of gastric histamine. It is tonically activated by endogenous histamine after <b>pentagastrin</b> in low dosage. The control of acid secretion by the H- 3 receptor seems to involve modulation of endogenous histamine release, possibly by means of enterochromaffin-like cells...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{infusion}} and <b>pentagastrin</b> injection {{were compared}} as tests to stimulate calcitonin secretion {{for the detection}} of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Plasma concentrations of immunoreactive calcitonin were measured by radioimmunoassay before and during both stimulation tests in 2 persons who had been found at operation to have medullary thyroid carcinoma, 1 relative in whom a cervical lymph node biopsy had shown medullary thyroid carcinoma and 36 asymptomatic relatives. The tests were carried out on separate days by intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate for 2 hours, to provide 3. 75 mg/kg of elemental calcium per hour, and rapid intravenous injection of 0. 5 microgram/kg of <b>pentagastrin.</b> Before stimulation immunoreactive calcitonin was undetectable in the plasma of 34 of the 36 asymptomatic persons; the 2 with elevated baseline concentrations of the hormone had a positive response to both tests. Seven others showed an increase in plasma immunoreactive calcitonin concentration only after <b>pentagastrin</b> injection. The two persons with initially elevated values and three of the seven with increased values after <b>pentagastrin</b> injection were found at subsequent operation to have focal medullary carcinoma and parafollicular cell hyperplasia; after the operation immunoreactive calcitonin was undetectable in the plasma, even after stimulation. Rapid injection of <b>pentagastrin</b> is more reliable than slow infusion of calcium as a stimulation test for the early detection of medullary thyroid carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that salivary secretion is exclusively under nervous control. However, {{at variance with}} this prevailing view, our {{recent studies have shown}} some hormones to influence saliva composition. In rat parotid gland, melatonin, and gastrin-analogue <b>pentagastrin,</b> cause, by direct action, in vivo secretion of protein. In mammals, melatonin is secreted not only by the pineal gland but also by intestinal mucosal cells, and induces duodenal bicarbonate secretion. OBJECTIVES: Since studies are lacking with respect to an hormonal influence on the secretory activity of human glands, the present work aimed at evaluating morphological effects of melatonin and <b>pentagastrin,</b> in vitro, on human parotid glands. METHODS: Parotid samples, obtained at surgery from 40 subjects, were incubated in an oxygenated inorganic medium added with melatonin or <b>pentagastrin.</b> To quantify the effect of stimulation we investigated by high resolution scanning electron microscopy on osmium macerated tissues, the morphological changes in the intercellular canaliculi. RESULTS: To melatonin and <b>pentagastrin,</b> density of microvilli decreased (P< 0. 001, Mann-Whitney U-test) by 44 % and 40 %, respectively, while that of microbuds increased (P< 0. 001) by 45 % and 280 %, respectively (as compared to controls), whereas lumina were sparsely dilated. CONCLUSIONS: In analogy with our previous findings on human salivary tissues incubated with secretagogue muscarinic and adrenergic agonists mimicking nervous stimulation, we conclude that our present ultrastructural findings reflect secretory activity to <b>pentagastrin</b> and melatonin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} two H 2 -receptor antagonists (burimamide and metiamide) on the {{mobilization}} of gastric mucosal histamine, as shown by its urinary excretion and acid secretion following <b>pentagastrin</b> infusion, were studied in rats provided with Heidenhain pouches. Pentagastrin-induced secretion was completely inhibited without major Alterations in urinary excretion of histamine. These observations can easily be reconciled with the hypothesis that <b>pentagastrin</b> is not a direct stimulant of the parictal cell...|$|E
