40|$|This {{research}} report aims {{to identify the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil towards economic growth in Malaysia. The increasing demand <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil has contributing to the economic growth in Malaysia. However, <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil in Malaysia has to compete with Indonesia and <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybeans oil that are capable in producing more products. Thus, factors that most influence the economic growth in Malaysia need to be identified. The objectives {{of this study are}} to study the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil in Malaysia, to study the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybean oil in Malaysia and to determine whether capital or labor is the most factors influence the economic growth in Malaysia. The study used descriptive research design. It focused on the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil in Malaysia scope. It involved the selection and analysis of secondary data, journals and related write-up that are relating to <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil in Malaysia that includes the factors that affecting <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil, <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybeans oil, capital and labor <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil. From the analysis <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil {{it can be seen that}} the total production is increasing year by year. There are constant increase in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil and thus concluded that there is positive growth in the palm oil industry and the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybean is one factors that have contributed to the increasing the economic growth in Malaysia. On the other hand, the regression analysis clearly shows that the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil has positive relationship with the economic growth in Malaysia, and also positive relationship between <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybeans oil, capital and labor <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil. Among all the factors. <b>Production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil and capital <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil has been identified as the factors that contribute the most economic growth in Malaysia...|$|R

50|$|The {{problem of}} {{allocation}} of resources arises due to the scarcity of resources, and refers {{to the question of}} which wants should be satisfied and which should be left unsatisfied. In other words, what to produce and how much to produce. More <b>production</b> <b>of</b> a good implies more resources required for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> that good, and resources are scarce. These two facts together mean that, if a society decides to increase <b>production</b> <b>of</b> some good, it has to withdraw some resources from the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> other goods. In other words, more <b>production</b> <b>of</b> a desired commodity can be made possible only by reducing the quantity of resources used in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> other goods.|$|R
