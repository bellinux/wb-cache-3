The composite had an oxidation inhibited matrix, {{which consisted of}} alternating layers of silicon carbide and boron carbide and was reinforced with laminated Hi-NicalonTM fibers woven in a five-harness-satin weave. Fiber preforms had <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon fiber <b>coating</b> with boron carbon overlay applied. The interlaminar shear properties were measured. The creep behavior was examined for interlaminar shear stresses in the 16 – 22 [*]MPa range. Primary and secondary creep regimes were observed in all tests conducted in air and in steam. In air and in steam, creep run-out defined as 100 [*]h at creep stress was achieved at 16 [*]MPa. Similar creep strains were accumulated in air and in steam. Furthermore, creep strain rates and creep lifetimes were only moderately affected {{by the presence of}} steam. The retained properties of all specimens that achieved run-out were characterized. Composite microstructure, as well as damage and failure mechanisms were investigated. The tested specimens were also examined using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) with wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). Analysis of the fracture surfaces revealed significant surface oxidation, but only trace amounts of boron and carbon. Cross sectional analysis showed increasing boron concentration in the specimen interior...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better characterise a {{permanent}} modifier based on iridium deposited on zirconium or tungsten treated platforms of transversely heated graphite atomizer, and to gain additional information about its chemical behavior directed to an eventual further optimization, a series of experiments were carried out, both by surface techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS or ESCA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry on the iridium release from unmodified and various other modified pyrolytic graphite platforms. Special {{attention was paid to}} the influence of the amount of iridium, zirconium carbide coating of the platform surface and the presence of citric acid on the iridium vaporization during pyrolysis and atomization. The processes of iridium losses during pyrolysis and atomization and peak maximum alignment depend on the amount of the iridium deposited on the <b>pyrolytic</b> graphite <b>coated</b> platforms in the presence of nitric acid. A fractional order of release which suggests an atom vaporization from the surface or edges of the iridium islands was estimated. In the presence of citric acid, mass independence and zero order of the atom release were found. The zirconium treatment of the platform results in change of the spatial distribution of iridium and hence its vaporization. Vaporization temperatures as high as 2100 degrees C, and first order of the process of atom generation were obtained, While it was possible to study the iridium atomization from uncoated and zirconium coated surfaces, evidencing a different order for the release process, the same was not possible for the tungsten coated platforms due to an 'overstabilization' that brought the iridium atomization temperature out of the working range of the instrument used, The different chemical behavior of tungsten and zirconium was also confirmed by XPS investigations, With tungsten, evidence of both W-C and W-O bonding was found, while zirconium on the contrary shows only Zr-O bonding and no evidence of carbide bonding. The SEM revealed a highly dispersed distribution of spot-like features whose smallest average diameter was of the order of 0. 1 mu m. The XRF asserted the confinement of iridium in these features and a strict association with zirconium in the case of zirconium treated surfaces. It is worth mentioning that such structure was preserved also after 400 thermal cycles simulating an atomization step at 1900 degrees C despite a quite evident deterioration of the graphite surface, thus confirming the excellent durability of this modifier.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} fabrication, {{optimisation}} {{and integration of}} black silicon (bSi) for different applications. The research work presented in this thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, bSi formation was studied in an inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etcher (ICP-RIE). The design of experiments (DOE) technique was used to evaluate the influence of process parameters on bSi formation. The outcome was used to establish guidelines for fabricating different types of bSi. Applications of bSi are discussed {{in the second part of}} this thesis. Process development using standard and novel micro and nanofabrication techniques was performed to enable bSi employment for targeted applications. The developed processes were used to achieve patterned wetting of liquid droplets and a wide band optical enhancement. For patterned wetting, novel fabrication processes were developed to achieve patterns that composed extreme wetting contrast with the substrate. Hydrophobic, hydrophilic and superhydrophilic patterns were fabricated with superhydrophobic surroundings. Upon dispensing, the liquid droplets confined to more wettable patterns and mimicked their shape. Due to an extreme wetting contrast and topographical discontinuity, patterned wetting to a large number of patterns was achieved. A fabricated template containing patterns with extreme wetting contrast and topographical discontinuity with the surrounding substrate was used to demonstrate self-alignment of microchips. High accuracy, reliable and repeatable self-alignment of microchips was recorded. Several techniques were employed to improve the self-alignment of microchips on bSi based self-alignment template. Self-alignment of microchips is an increasingly popular technique for advanced packaging. Optical enhancement was achieved by optimisation of bSi surface structures. Improved anti-reflection and light trapping behaviour were demonstrated in UV-VIS spectrum. In order to extend the anti-reflection behaviour of bSi beyond UV-VIS, conformal <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon (PyC) <b>coating</b> was deposited and a substrate with exceptionally low reflectance over a wide spectrum (UV-NIR) was achieved. The surface structure optimisation was also exploited for plasmonic enhancement. Thin silver (Ag) films and different bSi surface structures were studied to achieve highly sensitive surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrate...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 {{relates the}} {{background}} information {{of the structure}} of antibodies, the nature of their interaction with antigen and their production as polyclonal antibodies. Examples of antibodies which have been produced against luminescent molecules are given and it is illustrated how the specific interaction of antibodies with luminescent complexes can be used to gain information on the structure, function and rotational dynamics of antibodies. The principle features of immunoassays are outlined with a focus on amperometric immunosensing including some areas of active research within amperometric immunosensing. This serves as a general introduction to Chapter 4; the development of an amperometric immunosensor based on single wall carbon nanotubes. Chapter 2 begins with a review of the fundamental chemical, photochemical and electrochemical properties of Ru(II) and Os(II) polypyridyl complexes. It is shown how their photophysical properties can be modulated by the interaction of the complexes with biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids and antibodies. The synthesis and characterisation of [Os(bpy) 2 dcbpy] and some related Os(II) and Ru(II) complexes is described. The production and characterisation of a [Os(bpy) 2 dcbpy]-thyroglobulin conjugate which was used as the immunogen is described, as well as the purification and characterisation of the resulting polyclonal antibody. Competition ELISA served to confirm the cross-reactivity of the antibody with the Os and Ru complexes synthesised. Chapter 3 describes the effect of antibody binding on the spectrochemical properties of the complexes. Changes in the emission spectra and lifetimes were examined. Association constants were derived from emission titrations. The extent that the antibody binding site protects the complexes from excited state deactivation via interaction with solvent was investigated. The possibility of energy transfer from [Ru(bpy) 2 dcbpy] to [Os(bpy) 2 dcbpy] when both were bound to the same antibody was investigated, as were the effects of antibody binding to a self-assembled layer of [Os(bpy) 2 (p 2 p) 2] 2 +. Chapter 4 begins with an introduction to the structure and properties of CNTs and outlines their application thus far in biosensing. The assembly of oxidatively shortened SWNTs onto Nafion/iron oxide <b>coated</b> <b>pyrolytic</b> graphite electrodes is described and characterised by both AFM and resonance Raman spectroscopy. The immunosensing strategy investigated involved the adsorption of anti-biotin antibody to the carbon nanotube surface. The presence of HRP-labelled biotin was determined via the reduction of hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence of the}} soluble mediator hydroquinone. A short investigation is also presented on the ability of HRP-modified SWNT forest electrodes to detect H 2 O 2 produced by a mutant catalase negative E. coli bacteria which was co-immobilised with the HRP. Recommendations for future work arising from this thesis are given in Chapter 5...|$|R
