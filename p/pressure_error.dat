40|$|A {{passivity}} {{framework for}} hydraulic actuators is developed by {{consideration of the}} compressibility energy function for a fluid with a pressure dependent bulk modulus. The typical actuator’s mechanical and pressure dynamic model is shown to be the Euler-Lagrange equations for this energy function. A passivity property for the actuator is exhibited in which the hydraulic supply rate contains the compressibility energy, instead of just being P · Q. A storage function for the <b>pressure</b> <b>error</b> is then proposed based on the physical compressibility energy and the <b>pressure</b> <b>error</b> dynamics is {{shown to be a}} passive two-port subsystem.

40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} a {{finite element method}} for {{approximating}} solutions to the Navier-Stokes-alpha model (NS-α) that utilizes approximate deconvolution and a modified grad-div stabilization and greatly improves accuracy in simulations. Standard finite element schemes for NS-α suffer from two major sources of error if their solutions are considered approximations to true fluid flow: 1) the consistency error arising from filtering, and 2) the dramatic effect of the large <b>pressure</b> <b>error</b> on the velocity error that arises from the (necessary) use of the rotational form nonlinearity. The proposed scheme “fixes ” these two numerical issues through the combined use of a modified grad-div stabilization that acts in both the momentum and filter equations, and an adapted approximate deconvolution technique designed {{to work with the}} altered filter.

40|$|The {{viability}} of a generalized (Hybrid) Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), {{together with the}} importance of thermobaricity and the choice of reference pressure, is demonstrated by analyzing simulations carried out using the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Community Modeling Experiment (CME) Atlantic basin configuration. The standard hybrid vertical coordinate configuration is designed to remain isopycnic throughout {{as much of the}} water column as possible while smoothly making a transition to level (pressure) coordinates in regions with weak vertical density gradients, such as the surface mixed layer, and to terrain-following coordinates in shallow-water regions. Single-coordinate (pressure or density) experiments illustrate the flexibility of the model but also bring forward some of the limitations associated with such a choice. Hybrid experiments with potential density referenced to the surface (su) and to 20 MPa (; 2000 m) (s 2) illustrate the increased influence of <b>pressure</b> <b>errors</b> with increasing distance from the reference pressure. The su hybrid experiment does not properly reproduce the northward flow of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), and large <b>errors</b> in near-surface <b>pressure</b> gradients in the s 2 experiment produce a wind-driven gyre circulation that is too strong, when compared with observations, and a North Atlantic Current that follows an unrealistic path. These near-surface and near-bottom <b>pressure</b> <b>errors</b> are removed when thermobaric effects are included, resulting in a more accurate rep-resentation of the upper-ocean gyre circulation, the northward AABW flow near the bottom, and the meridional overturning circulation and heat flux. 1...|$|R

However, we have obtained only suboptimal accuracy via the energy estimate in [11]. In this paper, we study semi-discrete gauge-Uzawa method to prove optimal accuracy via energy estimate. The main key in this proof is to construct the intermediate equation which is formed to gauge-Uzawa algorithm.

40|$|Intense extratropical winter {{cyclones}} often {{impact the}} West Coast of North America with strong winds and heavy precipitation. Several times during a winter season, short-term forecasts (24 - 48 hours) of these storms are seriously deficient with central <b>pressure</b> <b>errors</b> in the 10 's of hPa and surface low position {{errors in the}} 100 's of km. For example, 48 -hr sea level <b>pressure</b> <b>errors</b> (forecast - observation) at buoy 46005 off the Oregon coast for the 2001 - 2002 winter season is plotted. In addition, two times the standard deviation (determined from <b>pressure</b> <b>errors</b> from the last four winter seasons) are also shown. It is evident from this figure that large forecast errors (i. e. greater than 10 hPa) occurred about 10 times this past winter at buoy 46005 with three events where the errors were 20 hPa. Beside large forecast errors of sea level pressure, numerical forecasts of precipitation for land falling cyclones can also be flawed. This is {{due in large part}} to the lack of accurate precipitation information over the ocean. Therefore, remote sensing techniques are the only viable option for obtaining accurate information on the distribution and intensity of precipitation over the North Pacific. Due to the radiative characteristics of precipitation sized hydrometeors at microwave frequencies, microwave sensors are able to detect precipitation over oceanic regions. Past studies have demonstrated the utility of passive microwave rainrate data for locating intense rainfall in rapidly deepening cyclones, in detecting developing polar mesocyclones and in determining frontal bands. There are currently many sources of microwave rainrate data: the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) (currently flying on three platforms), the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-B) (currently flying on NOAA- 15, NOAA- 16, and NOAA- 17), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI). Data will soon be available from the Advanced Microwave Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) on the Aqua platform. In this paper, we present a new technique for mapping rainrate distributions over the North Pacific utilizing rainrate estimates from several microwave sensors and upper-tropospheric winds derived from geosynchronous satellite IR data. The goal of this work is to develop a way to obtain high temporal and spatial rainfall information over the North Pacific. This information will be used to support the verification of model derived precipitation distributions and to support the analysis of in situ measurements of rainfall during the Improvement of Microphysical Parameterization through Observational Verification Experiment (IMPROVE) field campaigns...|$|R

This analysis includes standard deviation and bias error due to instrument noise {{and the presence of}} two cloud layers, the lower of which is opaque. Instantaneous cloud <b>pressure</b> retrieval <b>errors</b> are determined for a range of cloud amounts (0. 1 - 1. 0) and cloud-top pressures (850 - 250 mb). Large cloud-top <b>pressure</b> retrieval <b>errors</b> are found to occur when a lower opaque layer is present underneath an upper transmissive cloud layer in the satellite field of view (FOV). Errors tend to increase with decreasing upper-cloud effective cloud amount and with decreasing cloud height (increasing <b>pressure).</b> <b>Errors</b> in retrieved upper-cloud pressure result in corresponding errors in derived effective cloud amount. For the case in which a HIRS FOV has two distinct cloud layers, the difference between the retrieved and actual cloud-top pressure is positive in all cases, meaning that the retrieved upper-cloud height is lower than the actual upper-cloud height. In addition, errors in retrieved cloud pressure are found to depend upon the lapse rate between the low-level cloud top and the surface. We examined which sounder channel combinations would minimize the total errors in derived cirrus cloud height caused by instrument noise and by the presence of a lower-level cloud. We find that while the sounding channels that peak between 700 and 1000 mb minimize random errors, the sounding channels that peak at 300 - 500 mb minimize bias errors.

A set of measurement was carried out with elderly cardiac surgery patients. The experiments comprised two to five measurements per patient, each including a one-minute follow-up, after which the cuff was slowly inflated over the systolic blood pressure. Systolic pressure errors were defined and correlations with other specific values, like pressure rise time, pulse wave velocity, systolic pressure, augmentation, arm circumference and body mass index were calculated. These indices may be affected by arterial stiffness, a common source of errors in blood pressure measurements.
