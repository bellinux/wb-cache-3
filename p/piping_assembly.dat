40|$|Pulsed jet {{actuators}} (PJAs) {{are one of}} {{the candidate}} technologies to be integrated in Fowler flaps to increase the maximum lift coefficient of transport aircraft in the landing configuration. The total system consists of the actuators plus sensors, a piping system to supply pressurized air and a (redundant) power and communication system to provide actuator control. In this paper, it is investigated what increase in the maximum lift coefficient is required to justify the added weight and power off-takes that accompany the integration of pulsed jet actuators. This is done by making an automated design process for the overall aircraft, the <b>piping</b> <b>assembly</b> system, and the electrical wiring interconnection system. These last two sub-systems rely on KBE techniques that automate dimensioning and performance evaluation. A test case is specified that encompasses the design of a typical single-aisle mid-range aircraft with and without the PJA system installed. It is concluded that the introduction of the PJA system requires at least an increase in maximum lift coefficient of 0. 2 to justify the increase in system mass and power off-takes. Furthermore, it is shown that if the maximum lift coefficient increases with 0. 4, only small reductions in maximum take-off weight (− 0. 3 %) and operating empty weight (− 0. 6 %) can be expected, while the total fuel burn remains virtually constant.

40|$|Assembly is {{the process}} in which two or more objects are joined {{together}} through particular sequences and operations. Current practice utilises two-dimensional (2 D) drawings as the main visualisation means to guide assembly. Other visualisation means such as three-dimensional (3 D) manual and Virtual Reality (VR) technology have also been applied to assist in assembly. As an emerging technology, Augmented Reality (AR) integrates 3 D images of virtual objects into a real-world workspace. The insertion of digitalised information into the real-world workspace using AR can provide workers with the means to implement correct assembly procedures with improved accuracy and reduced errors. Despite the substantial application of AR in assembly; related research has rarely been explored from a human cognitive perspective. The limited available cognitive research concerning the applications of AR visualisation means in assembly highlights {{the need for a}} structured methodology of addressing cognitive and useability issues for the application potentials of AR technology to be fully realised. This dissertation reviews the issues and discrepancies in using four types of visualisation means (2 D drawings, 3 D manual prints, VR, and AR) for guiding assembly, and investigates potential cognitive theories to underpin the benefits of animated AR in assembly. A theoretical framework is then put forward, which summarises existing mechanisms concerning visual-spatial information processing and THE Working Memory (WM) processing in the context of spatial cognition theory, active vision theory and THE WM theory, and raises the to-be-validated aspects of the above theories when transferring from the psychological arena to practical instances. Moreover, the dissertation formulates the methodology of configuring a prototype-animated AR system, and devising particular assembly tasks that are normally guided by reference to documentation and a test-bed with a series of experiments. Two experiments were conducted with three testing scenarios: experiment I concerns the evaluation in the first and second scenarios, while experiment II concerns the third scenario. In scenario 1, a small scale LEGO model was used as the assembly and experimental tester task to compare 3 D manual prints and AR. This scenario measured the task performance and cognitive workload of using the system for assembly. The second scenario applied the knowledge gained from scenario 1 to the real construction <b>piping</b> <b>assembly.</b> Comparisons were then made as to productivity improvements, cost reduction and the reduction of rework between 2 D isometric drawings and AR. Common findings from both scenarios revealed that the AR visualisation yielded shorter task completion time, less assembly errors and lower total task load. Evaluation from the real construction scenario also indicated that the animated AR visualisation significantly shortened the completion time (original time and rework time), payment to assemblers and cost on correcting erroneous assembly. Questionnaire feedback (including NASA task load index) (Hart 2006, 908) revealed that the animated AR visualisation better aided assembly comprehension, and better facilitated information retrieval and collaboration between human and guidance medium. Using the same LEGO tester task, the third scenario measured the training effects of using 3 D manual prints and AR among novice assemblers. The results revealed that the learning curve of novice assemblers was reduced (faster learning) and task performance relevant to working memory was increased when implementing AR training. Useability evaluation was conducted based on classical useability methods, to assess the user interface regarding system improvements...|$|E
40|$|Stainless steel-to-titanium {{bimetallic}} transitions {{have been}} fabricated with an explosively bonded joint. This novel joining technique {{was conducted by}} the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, working under contract for the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. These bimetallic transitions are being considered for use in future superconducting radio-frequency cavity cryomodule assemblies. This application requires cryogenic testing to demonstrate that this transition joint remains leak-tight when sealing superfluid helium. To simulate a titanium cavity vessel connection to a stainless steel service pipe, bimetallic transition joints were paired together to fabricate <b>piping</b> <b>assemblies.</b> These <b>piping</b> <b>assemblies</b> were then tested in superfluid helium conditions at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory test facilities.

40|$|The {{potential}} for primary water {{stress corrosion cracking}} (PWSCC) of large diameter austenitic nickel alloy components and their associated welds presents a particular problem for the nuclear industry due to {{a limited number of}} available options for mitigating or repairing large bore pressure boundary components such as reactor vessel, reactor coolant pump, and steam generator inlet or outlet nozzles. While a full structural weld overlay (FSWOL), as governed by ASME Code Case N- 740, is commonly used to mitigate and repair small (4 ”) to medium (10 ”) bore <b>piping</b> <b>assemblies</b> employing Alloy 82 / 182 dissimilar metal welds, the large amount of weld metal that would be have to be deposited on large components (and the associated impact on outage schedule) makes this an unattractive strategy for managing the degradation of Alloy 60...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Ongoing {{research}} aims {{to determine}} if a full-scale virtual reality mockup can be effectively used to reduce construction and maintenance costs of the next generation of nuclear power plants. A full-scale virtual mockup of Room 12306 of the Westinghouse AP 1000 nuclear power plant provides the test bed for this research. Located in the auxiliary building, Room 12306 contains a number of construction modules and <b>assemblies</b> comprised of <b>piping</b> from 10 different fluid systems. The virtual mockup developed at Penn State is currently being evaluated for visualizing and testing the planned construction of Room 12306. Using the virtual mockup, the designer and contractor can evaluate, in 1 : 1 scale, a step-by-step installation sequence for the modules and <b>piping</b> <b>assemblies</b> for completeness and feasibility. Simulating a multiple-step installation sequence, the user can experience a human-in-the-loop, virtual construction of the yet-to-be-built space. Using software tools, the user may also interactively develop installation sequences by selecting modules and assemblies in the appropriate order. Two sets of experiments performed at Penn State ARL’s SEALab were used to determine the value added by using the virtual mockup to develop and visualize the construction schedule fo...|$|R
40|$|During {{a severe}} nuclear reactor {{accident}} involving core melt down conditions, the deposition of fission product aerosols inside the reactor coolant system affects the final source term {{available to the}} containment and subsequently to the environment. Towards quantifying the aerosol deposition under varying flow conditions and thermal gradients, as may be encountered in the heat transport systems, experiments were performed to investigate the dry deposition behavior of metal oxide aerosols in a 3. 6 m long stainless steel <b>piping</b> test <b>assembly.</b> This assembly consisted of divergent and convergent sections, horizontal and vertical sections and right angle bends. Tin oxide aerosols, generated by a plasma torch aerosol generator, were transported into the test assembly using argon carrier gas. Temperature sensors coupled to data loggers were used to record the pipe inner wall and carrier gas temperatures. The experimental deposition results {{were found to be}} within 8 % of those estimated by the SOPHAEROS module of the accident analysis code ASTEC (Accident Source Term Evaluation Code). Code results for experimental input parameters showed that for sections at higher temperature gradients the dominant deposition mechanism was thermophoresis, while in sections for low thermal gradients, gravitational settling dominated. The micrographs obtained using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed that the deposited Tin oxide particles were mostly spherical and bimodal in nature. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that plasma torch generated aerosols exhibit tetragonal SnO and SnO 2 phases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSodium cooled {{fast breeder}} {{reactors}} constitute {{the second stage}} of India's three -stage nuclear energy programme, for effective utilization of the country's limited reserves of natural uranium and exploitation of its large reserves of thorium. The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) at Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam, is a loop type, sodium cooled fast reactor. Its main aim is to provide experience in fast reactor operation, large scale sodium handling and to serve as a test bed for irradiation of fast reactor fuels & materials. FBTR was built on the lines of the French Rapsodie-Fortissimo reactor, with modifications to make it a generating plant. FBTR went critical on 18 th Oct 1985 with a small core of 22 fuel subassemblies of a unique, high Pu carbide fuel. The core was rated for 10. 5 MWt. The TG was rolled and synchronized to the grid in July 1997. Reactor power was progressively increased by enlarging the core, to reach 18. 6 MWt. Several challenges in reactor operation came on the way, which were successfully overcome. A large number of modifications were carried out to improve the plant performance. The reactor coolant used (Sodium) is highly reactive when exposed to atmosphere and also becomes highly active on exposure to neutron radiation. These properties of sodium make it essential to handle it carefully and safely within a leak tight containment. During course of operation of the reactor, a number of sodium laden components viz. pumps, valves, cold traps, Rupture discs, level probes, shielding plugs, control rod drive mechanisms, experimental <b>assemblies,</b> <b>piping</b> etc. are required to be removed for various maintenance, modification and replacement jobs.
