5|$|As {{a longer}} term and more {{significant}} development, the Bill of Middlesex {{was one of}} several revolutionary developments by the King's Bench met with a conservative reaction from the Common <b>Pleas,</b> fearful of losing its own caseload. The troubles during this period are best illustrated by Slade's Case. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Common <b>Pleas,</b> a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common <b>Pleas,</b> through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts. In Slade's Case, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, John Popham, deliberately provoked the Common <b>Pleas</b> into bringing an assumpsit action to a higher court where the Justices of the King's Bench could vote, allowing them to overrule the Common <b>Pleas</b> and establish assumpsit as the main contractual action. After the death of Edmund Anderson, the more activist Francis Gawdy became Chief Justice of the Common <b>Pleas,</b> which briefly led to a less reactionary and more revolutionary Common <b>Pleas.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts with the King's Bench, the Common <b>Pleas</b> fought to maintain its jurisdiction and caseload, in a way that during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary. Reaching an acceptable medium with the King's Bench and Exchequer of <b>Pleas</b> proved to be the downfall of all three courts; with several courts of near-identical jurisdiction, there was little need for separate bodies, and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice. With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880, the Common <b>Pleas</b> Division of the High Court ceased to exist, marking the end of the Court of Common <b>Pleas.</b>|$|E

[...] Criminal Evidence explained the application of the Alford <b>plea</b> in U.S. states, [...] "Most state courts hold that an Alford <b>plea</b> is the 'functional equivalent' of a regular <b>plea</b> of guilty. Therefore, a defendant who enters a guilty <b>plea,</b> whether an Alford <b>plea</b> or a regular guilty <b>plea,</b> has lost almost all rights to appeal. Most courts hold that the only issues applicable are the voluntary and intelligent nature of the <b>plea</b> and the jurisdiction of the court." ...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common <b>Pleas,</b> Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common <b>Pleas</b> their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common <b>Pleas</b> was located. This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of <b>Pleas,</b> a court of equity. This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common <b>Pleas</b> allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common <b>Pleas,</b> allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E
5|$|From the 13th century onwards, the Court of Common <b>Pleas</b> could issue its own writs, {{and was not}} {{dependent}} on the Court of Chancery, where such documents usually originated. These were sealed with the Great Seal of the King until at least 1338, along with the seal of the justices; the Chancery writs had their own independent seal. Documents were, from 1350, considered acceptable if only marked with the seal of the justices. In 1344, the king created a separate seal for the Common <b>Pleas,</b> allowing them to process cases without involving the Chancery or the king. The court stood {{on an equal footing}} with the Exchequer of <b>Pleas,</b> Court of Chancery and King's Bench in relation to transferring cases between them. Any errors {{on the part of the}} Common <b>Pleas</b> would be corrected by the King's Bench through a separate action brought there. Thanks to the Bill of Middlesex and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common <b>Pleas</b> remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E

5000|$|In {{criminal}} {{trials in}} certain United States jurisdictions, it is a <b>plea</b> where the defendant neither admits nor disputes a charge, {{serving as an}} alternative to a pleading of guilty or not guilty.

5|$|The Act, finally {{passed as}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common <b>Pleas,</b> Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. The Court of Common <b>Pleas</b> thus ceased to exist, except as the Common <b>Pleas</b> Division of the High Court. The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880, allowing for {{the abolition of the}} Common <b>Pleas</b> Division and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880, with their functions merged into the King's Bench Division, with the Lord Chief Justice of the Common <b>Pleas</b> becoming Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Justice of the Common <b>Pleas</b> was {{the head}} of the Court of Common <b>Pleas,</b> also known as the Common Bench or Common Place, which was the second-highest common law court in the English legal system until 1875, when it, along with the other two common law courts and the equity and probate courts, became part of the High Court of Justice. As such, the Chief Justice of the Common <b>Pleas</b> was one of the highest {{judicial}} officials in England, behind only the Lord High Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice of England, who headed the Queen's Bench (King's when the monarch was male).|$|E

According to the United States Department of Justice, in 2000 {{a greater percentage of}} State inmates made use of the <b>plea</b> than Federal inmates. The state courts of Indiana, Michigan, and New Jersey do not allow usage of the <b>plea.</b> It has been used in other states, and in application of the <b>plea</b> process the courts require the <b>plea</b> to be of a voluntary nature and based on factual evidence. The courts make an effort to determine defendants are entering the <b>plea</b> by their own choice, {{and that there is a}} factual basis for the plea; they accomplish this by questioning the defendant about their choice and the prosecution about the potential case against the defendant. Once entered, the <b>plea</b> is treated as a standard guilty <b>plea.</b>|$|R

5|$|The case is {{particularly}} notable {{as an example}} of judicial legislation, with the judges significantly modernising the law and moving it forward in a way Parliament had not considered. As a side impact, Coke's arguments were the first to define consideration. The conservative outlook of the Common <b>Pleas</b> soon changed; after the death of Edmund Anderson, the more activist Francis Gawdy became Chief Justice of the Common <b>Pleas,</b> and other Common <b>Pleas</b> judges, many of whom were uncertain but had followed Anderson's lead in the case, changed their mind.|$|E
5|$|The {{troubles}} {{during this}} period are best illustrated by Slade's Case.

5|$|While {{these reforms}} succeeded in forming an {{equilibrium}} {{between the old}} common law courts and the new courts, they were viewed with suspicion by the Common <b>Pleas,</b> who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. While the King's Bench was more revolutionary, the Common <b>Pleas</b> became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases.

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common <b>Pleas</b> became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on {{the business of the}} Common <b>Pleas.</b> This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between the old and new forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was finally reached, it eventually led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E
5|$|The Court of King's Bench (or Court of Queen's Bench {{during the}} reign of a female monarch), {{formally}} known as The Court of the King Before the King Himself, was an English court of common law in the English legal system. Created in the late 12th to early 13th century from the curia regis, initially following the monarch on his travels, the King's Bench finally joined the Court of Common <b>Pleas</b> and Exchequer of <b>Pleas</b> in Westminster Hall in 1318, making its last travels in 1421.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>plea</b> bargaining system on innocent defendants is fiercely debated. Many scholars call for a ban on <b>plea</b> bargaining, arguing that the practice coerces innocent defendants to plead guilty. Proponents of <b>plea</b> bargaining respond that even an innocent defendant is better off when he choose to <b>plea</b> bargain in order to assure a lenient result, if he concludes {{that the risk of}} wrongful trial conviction is too high. They claim that since <b>plea</b> bargaining is only an option, it cannot harm the defendant whether he is guilty or innocent. This paper argues that the both supporters and opponents of <b>plea</b> bargaining overlook its most important effect on innocent defendants: its effect on prosecutorial screening. When <b>plea</b> bargaining is available, prosecutors can extract a guilty <b>plea</b> in nearly every case, including very weak cases, simply by adjusting the <b>plea</b> concession to the defendant’s chances of acquittal at trial. When almost every case results in a <b>plea</b> of guilty, regardless of the strength of the evidence, prosecutors have much less interest in screening away weak cases. Since some cases are weak because the defendant is innocent, however, more innocent defendants are charged and as a result more are convicted. When the screening process is taken into account, {{there is no reason to}} believe that innocent defendants gain from <b>plea</b> bargaining. Yet, a total ban on <b>plea</b> bargaining is not the optimal response to the system’s deficiencies – and not only because such a ban would be unsustainable in an overloaded criminal justice system. A better response would be a partial ban on <b>plea</b> bargaining, meaning a system that only prohibits <b>plea</b> bargains when the concession offered to the defendant in return for his guilty <b>plea</b> is large. With <b>plea</b> concessions restricted in such a way, defendants with relatively high chances of acquittal at trial would refuse to <b>plea</b> bargain. That way, prosecuting a weak case would usually result in a trial while a strong cases would be disposed through <b>plea</b> bargaining. Since prosecution resources do not allow for a high trial rate, prosecutors will be forced to refrain from bringing weak cases in order to direct scarce resources to stronger cases that can be settled. A partial ban therefore encourages prosecutors to refrain from bringing weak cases and reduces the risk of an innocent person being charged...|$|R

Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants.

5|$|This was {{originally}} {{interpreted as the}} foundation of the King's Bench, with the Court of Common <b>Pleas</b> not coming into existence until the signing of the Magna Carta. The later theory was that Henry II's decree created the Court of Common <b>Pleas,</b> not the King's Bench, and that the King's Bench instead split from the Common <b>Pleas</b> at some later time. The first records of an independent King's Bench come from 1234, when distinct plea rolls are found for each court. Modern academics give 1234 as the founding date for the King's Bench as a fully independent tribunal, considering it part of the law reform which took place from 1232 to 1234. Under Edward I, the presence of the King in the court became more and more irregular, and by 1318 the court sat independent of the monarch. Its last travels around the country were in 1414 to Leicestershire, Staffordshire and Shropshire, and a visit to Northamptonshire in 1421. From then onwards, the King's Bench became a fixed court rather than one that followed the King. Like the Common <b>Pleas,</b> the King's Bench sat in Westminster Hall until its dissolution.|$|E

40|$|When the {{government}} enters into a <b>plea</b> agreement with a criminal defendant that stipulates that {{the government}} will give a specific sentence recommendation in exchange for the defendant’s guilty <b>plea,</b> it can implicitly breach that agreement by clearly distancing itself from the recommendation at the sentencing hearing. In most circuits, the implicit breach of a non-court-binding <b>plea</b> agreement—an agreement where the defendant is bound to the guilty <b>plea</b> even if the court rejects the sentence recommendation—entitles defendants to a remedy. However, in 2014, the Ninth Circuit was the first circuit to hold that a defendant is entitled to a remedy when the government implicitly breaches a court-binding <b>plea</b> agreement—an agreement where the defendant is only bound to the guilty <b>plea</b> if the court accepts the <b>plea</b> agreement’s sentence recommendation. This Note examines whether the same implicit breach analysis used for non-court-binding <b>plea</b> agreements should be applied to court-binding <b>plea</b> agreements. To examine this question, this Note balances the actual harms imposed on criminal defendants by an implicit breach in each context against the potential impact increased appellate scrutiny may have on prosecutors’ ability to fulfill their duties as ministers of justice. Ultimately, this Note concludes that court-binding <b>plea</b> agreements should not be subject to the same implicit breach analysis and, at the very least, should be subject to harmless error analysis...|$|R
