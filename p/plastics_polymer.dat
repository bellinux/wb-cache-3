40|$|AbstractUsed <b>plastic</b> <b>polymer</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} wastes in the {{developed}} countries like Australia. Australia is spending a lot of money each year to process solid wastes in land filling which are not biodegradable and can be a threat to the environment in the long run. About 19 % of the overall plastic wastes are recycled every year in Australia. The incineration processes of plastic wastes lead to severe air pollution, too. Since the <b>plastic</b> <b>polymers</b> are originated from the petroleum resources, the possible technologies of converting them into fuel have drawn attention to meet the future fuel demand. Thus, converting the <b>plastic</b> <b>polymers</b> into transport fuel through a cleaner combustion process will contribute to saving environment. It has been observed that the thermal fuel conversion technology, known as thermolysis and the dissolution process of <b>plastic</b> <b>polymers</b> into an acceptable bio-solvent can lead to reduction of plastic wastes effectively. This paper presents a review on various thermolysis processes and the dissolution effect of various <b>plastic</b> <b>polymers</b> into bio-solvents. The technical features of converting polymers into fuel through appropriate and optimal technologies for the fuel production also have been analyzed. The authors have undertaken further studies on developing alternative fuel processing technologies to utilize polymer wastes as a resource, thus reducing environmental contaminant in an effective way...|$|R

These bio fibre composites are immersing as a viable alternative to glass fibre reinforced composite especially in automotive and building product applications. The combinations of bio-fibres such an kenaf, hemp, flax, jute, henequen, pine apple leaf fibre and sisal with polymer matrices from both renewable and non renewable resources to produce composite materials that are competitive with synthetic composites requires special attention.

40|$|This article {{presented}} the synthetic and preparation route of quaternary ammonium functionalized anion exchange membranes (AEMs), which {{were derived from}} an engineering <b>plastics</b> <b>polymer,</b> poly(arylene ether sulfone) with 3, 3, 5, 5 -tetramethyl- 4, 4 -dihydroxybipheny moiety (PAES-TM). The benzylmethyl groups on the main-chain of PAES-TM were converted to the bromomethyl groups via a radical reaction, thereby avoiding complicated chloromethylation, which required carcinogenic reagents. The chemical structure of the bromomethylated PAES was characterized by H- 1 NMR spectrum. Following a homogeneous quaternization with trimethylamine in the solution, a series of flexible and tough membranes were obtained by a solution casting and anion exchange process. The ion exchange capacity values were ranging from 1. 03 to 1. 37 meq g(- 1). The properties of the membranes, including water uptake, hydroxide conductivity, and methanol permeability were evaluated in detail. The AEM showed a high conductivity above 10 (- 2) S cm(- 1) at room temperature and extremely low methanol permeability of 4. 16 - 4. 94 x 10 (- 8) cm(2) s(- 1).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for (1) a method (M 2) for {{the production}} of (I) as above in which the organic medium is the binder (II) (2) nano-composites (I) obtained by these methods (3) a method (M 3) as described above {{for the production}} of modified nano-fillers (III) (4) surface-modified nano-fillers (III) obtained by M 3. USE - Nano-composites obtained by this method are used in paint, adhesives, casting compounds and coating materials, as matrix resins for fibre-reinforced <b>plastics,</b> <b>polymer</b> foam or plastic moldings, or {{for the production of}} such products, especially in aircraft construction and electronics, for painting cars, transparent plastics and parquet flooring, as dental materials, for coating optical glass, as base material for optical glass, more especially for varnishing polycarbonate car windows, for coating spectacles or as base materials for spectacle lenses (claimed).

40|$|The {{consumption}} of plastic materials {{has been increasing}} and the accumulation of plastic {{at the end of}} its life cycle has also increased on the earth. This causes a big waste disposal and pollution problem. Therefore, this motivated many researchers to conduct studies to produce a polymer which is biodegradable and environmental friendly and at the same time has improved properties to produce <b>plastics.</b> <b>Polymer</b> nanocomposites have gained the greatest interest in this issue since few years. Polycaprolactone (PCL) as the polymer and Sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) a type of nanoclay as the inorganic nanofiller is used in this study. However, the polymer matrix and the nanoclay surface are not compatible because the inorganic Na-MMT is hydrophilic and PCL is hydrophobic. Thus, the main aim of this study is to develop a new modification method for dispersing the nanofiller into PCL nanocomposite and to fabricate PCL nanocomposite. The surface of Na-MMT was modified from inorganic to organic through surfactant method by reacting Aminopropylisooctyl Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (AP-POSS) surfactant with Na-MMT and the fabrication of PCL nanocomposite was then done through solution intercalation technique with both modified and unmodified nanoclay of different weight percentages. The structure and morphology of pure nanoclay, modified nanoclay (POSS-MMT) and the PCL nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). XRD revealed that the d-spacing of the POSS-MMT is increased by 0. 64 nm as compared to Na-MMT. FTIR and FESEM results also showed that AP-POSS were well dispersed and intercalated throughout the interlayer space of Na-MMT. An exfoliated structure was also observed for PCL/POSS-MMT nanocomposite. Thermal properties of the nanocomposite were investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis which showed highest melting and crystallization temperature in PCL/POSS-MMT 5 % nanocomposite which is 56. 6 ˚C and 32. 7 ˚C respectively whereas a lower degree of crystallinity for PCL/POSS-MMT nanocomposite as compared to PCL/Na-MMT nanocomposite and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) recorded the highest degradation temperature in PCL/POSS-MMT 1 % nanocomposite which is 394. 1 ˚C at 50 % weight loss (T 50 %) but a decrease in degradation temperature when POSS-MMT content is increased. Mechanical properties of the nanocomposite were analysed through tensile testing and the results indicated the highest Young’s Modulus and tensile strength for PCL/POSS-MMT 3 % nanocomposite which is 87 MPa and 2. 64 MPa respectively while the lowest elongation at break in PCL/POSS-MMT 1 % nanocomposite which is 138 %. This study affords an efficient modification method to obtain organoclay with larger interlayer d-spacing to enhance the properties of polymer nanocomposit...|$|E
