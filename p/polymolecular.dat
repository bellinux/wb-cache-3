Several levels of weight gain were achieved by varying the reaction time. For each species the approximate general reaction rate order based on hydroxyl substitution was Ph-NCO> n-BuNCO> HDI > TDI for Corsican pine, and HDI > Ph-NCO> n-Bu-NCO > TDI for beech. The effect of chemical modification in the sorption properties {{and in the}} associated dimensional stability of wood was investigated by determining sorption isotherms and measuring the respective volumetric swelling at each relative humidity (RH) level. The treatment depressed the isotherms evenly over {{the entire range of}} RH for all levels of reaction, however, the difunctionally modified wood tended to show lower reduction in sorption at low RH's. The reduction in sorption was closely accompanied by a reduction in swelling indicating that within the accuracy of the experiment no voids were formed within the cell walls due to the treatment. The TDI treated specimens showed higher reduction in swelling under RH conditions than at saturation in liquid water. This was interpreted as to be caused by the formation of rigid TDI crosslinkages. The mechanisms of reduction in wood hy roscopicity were investigated by fitting data to the Hailwood-Horrobin sorptIOn model. It was shown that the chemical modification treatment affects both monomolecular and <b>polymolecular</b> sorption. The accessibility of bonding sites was also reduced. Regression analYSIS revealed that the reduction in monomolecular sorption is chiefly governed by the decrease in site accessibility and that the reduction in <b>polymolecular</b> sorption is governed by the increase in the adduct volume in the cell wall. Investigation of the causes of the reduction in site accessibility by analyzing the sorption isotherms for wood modified with n-Bu-NCO and with a bulkier monofunctional isocyanate (octadecyl isocyanate) suggest that the accessibility of the internal wood surfaces is related to the weight gain and not to the fraction of hydroxyl groups (OH) reacted. This suggests that the reduction in accessibility is caused by a "shieldin effect" where the adducts physically cover some of the adjacent unreacted sorptIon sites. With difunctionally modified wood no evidence of crosslinking effectiveness was indicated at saturation in liquid water. However, when the samples were soaked in pyridine, the crosslinkages seemed to influence superswelling in comparison to that shown by mono functionally reacted wood. Finally, tensile strength testes carried out on modified and unmodified wood strips revealed that with the exception of n-Bu-NCO treated samples, the wood strength is slightly but significantly reduced by the treatments...|$|E

40|$|Water {{is unique}} among liquids {{for its ability}} for {{tetrahedral}} coordination with four neighbouring molecules. Water catalyzed reactions (or spontaneous reactions) are pH independent hydrolytic processes that involve the transfer of one or several protons to or from water molecules in the transition state (TS) of the rate determining step. Indeed, in these reactions one water molecule acts as a nucleophile while one or several act as general bases, and typically show a) high negative values of entropy of activation (∆S ≠), and b) high kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE). In these reactions water is solvent, nucleophile and catalyst. The hydrolyses of alkyl halides, alkyl and aryl sulphonates, and derivatives of carboxylic acids (esters, amides) have been extensively studied. The reaction with derivatives of saturated carbons is quite different than the hydrolyses of esters and amides. At least two water molecules must be strongly bound at the TS to produce a high KSIE, restricting the number of possible positions of these molecules.

This method determines the hydrodynamic size of aggregates. The polymer was shown to have a complex aggregation behavior in aqueous solutions containing salt. This was expressed {{in the formation of}} differently sized structures, from single polymer chains to large <b>polymolecular</b> aggregates. The polymer changed its aggregation ability in the presence of different salts and salt concentrations, as reflected by changes in hydrodynamic size. Three different salts were tested: potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, and sodium phosphate. Even at micromolar concentrations of sodium sulfate, a pronounced aggregation was observed, probably due to reduced charge repulsion. At higher concentrations of the ''salting-out'' salts, the hydrodynamic size increased rapidly, reflecting the reduced solubility of the hydrophilic parts of the polymer, i. e. the poly(ethylene oxide) grafts. Sodium sulfate, and sodium phosphate in particular, had a stronger influence on polymer aggregation than potassium chloride.

40|$|The {{relaxation}} process of shear-induced crystal nucleation precursors {{has been investigated}} in a temperature range slightly above the melting point using a series of commercial grade isotactic poly(1 -butene) s with different molecular weights. Development of transcrystalline morphology {{from the surface of}} a fiber pulled through the molten polymer is ascribed to high concentration of ordered clusters promoted by the alignment of chain segments under the high-intensity shear flow at the fiber-melt interface. Sheared melts isothermally crystallized immediately after cessation of flow exhibit a well pronounced cylindritic morphology, characterized by closely spaced fibrillar branches; on the other hand, prolonged relaxation in the molten state before crystallization leads to classical spherulitic morphology. The lifetime of shear-induced nucleation precursors, t*, has been associated with the complete disappearance of the transcrystalline morphology. It has been found that systems composed of short chains relax much faster than those containing a large fraction of high molecular weight species. When relaxed slightly above the melting point of the tetragonal crystal modification the highest molecular weight samples keep memory of flow-induced structuring during several hours. Temperature has a dominant role on the kinetics of re-equilibration of sheared samples: experimental data of t* obtained in wide range of “relaxation” temperatures can be fitted by an Arrhenius-type equation with an apparent activation energy of around 700 kJ/mol.

The maximum displacement value in 0.5  M H 2 SO 4 is 73  mV in the anodic direction and 17  mV in the anodic direction for 1  M HCl, and thus in 0.5  M H 2 SO 4 and 1  M HCl, TPD can be classified as mixed-type inhibitor with cathodic and anodic inhibiting characteristics. TPD has strong influence on the entire electrochemical process as the polarization resistance in Tables  3 and 4 increases with increase in inhibition efficiency till the maximum studied concentration. Organic compounds inhibit through surface coverage and adsorption which stifles the redox electrochemical process. The amines functional groups in TPD are nucleophiles that form a variety of electrophilic compounds due to the basic functionality of their nitrogen atoms and the electrophilic substitutions [30, 31, 32]. The unshared electron pair of the nitrogen atom forms a coordinate bond with a proton released from the ionized atoms at the steel surface. Amines from TPD react with acids to give salts and the valence steel electrons to produce chemical complexes responsible for the compact impenetrable barrier which strongly adsorbs to the steel and inhibits corrosion.

Conductivities at room temperature of the thiourea-halide derivatives in pellets show a changing behaviour from insulator (10 - 11 S/cm) for 2, 3 and 4 measured in vacuµm, to semiconductor (10 - 7 - 10 - 8 S/cm) for the thiourea-halide derivative measured at atmospheric pressure. For the urea-halide system the highest conductivity value corresponds to derivative 7 (8. 66 x 10 - 5 S/cm) at atmospheric pressure, and the lowest to derivative 5 (5. 48 x 10 - 7 S/cm) measured in vacuµm. Comparisons considering structural aspects are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|This article explores global {{geometric}} {{features of}} bicontinuous space-partitions and their relevance to self-assembly of block-copolymers. Using a robust definition of `local channel radius', {{based on the}} concept of a medial surface [Schröder et al., Eur.  Phys.  J.  B 35, 551 (2003) ], we relate radius variations of the space-partition to <b>polymolecular</b> chain stretching in bicontinuous diblock- and terblock copolymer assemblies. We associate local surface patches with corresponding cellular volume elements, to define local volume-to-surface ratios. The distribution of these v/a ratios and of the channel radii are used to quantify the degree of packing frustration of molecular chains {{as a function of the}} specific bicontinuous geometry, modelled by triply-periodic minimal surfaces and related parallel interfaces. The Gyroid geometry emerges as the most nearly homogeneous bicontinuous form, with the smallest heterogeneity of channel radii, compared to the cubic Primitive and Diamond surfaces. We clarify a geometric feature of the Gyroid geometry: the three-coordinated nodes of the graph are not the widest points of the labyrinths; the widest points are at the midpoints of the edges. We also explore a more complex cubic triply-periodic surface, the I-WP surface, containing two geometrically distinct channel subdomains. One of the two channel systems is nearly as homogeneous in local channel diameters as the Gyroid, the other is more heterogeneous than the Primitive surface. Its hybrid nature suggests the possibility of an “alternating I-WP” phase in polydisperse linear ABC-terpolymer blends, with monodisperse molecular weight distributions (MWD) in the A and B blocks and a more polydisperse C block.

SIThe {{adsorption}} kinetics of gelatin to the air/water interface {{is still not}} fully understood. We investigated two samples of gelatin having different gel strength (65 Bloom and 280 Bloom), named, respectively gelatin 65 B and 280 B. The gelatin samples in solution were characterised by viscosimetric methods. We evidence a chain expansion of gelatin upon dilution due to the polyelectrolyte effect. The measurement of the intrinsic viscosity in water gave values of 22 mL/g for the sample 65 B and 70 mL/g for the sample 280 B. Although gelatin is a highly <b>polymolecular</b> polymer containing branched chains, the normalisation of the concentration by the intrinsic viscosity allowed {{the construction of a}} master curve of viscosity, giving the reduced critical overlap concentrations c* similar to 0. 6 and c** similar to 5. All concentrations of the gelatin solutions used for the determination of the adsorption behaviour were within the range of the dilute regime. The analysis of the adsorption behaviour leads us to the hypothesis that there are two different phenomena: first, a step governed by diffusion to the interface which lasts until full coverage of the interfacial film. The length of this induction period seemed to be dependent on the gelatin chain length, with larger chains taking more time. Second, the adsorption of the chains to the air/water interface leads to the formation of an encumbered subsurface layer which opposes steric hindrance to newly arriving chains. This causes a continuous slow down of the rate of surface pressure increase, which was linear on the logarithmic time scale and showed a slope of - 1. The {{adsorption kinetics}} was independent of the salt concentration of the solvent and of the gelatin chain size measured by the intrinsic viscosity. The gelatin sample 65 B shows furthermore higher equilibrium surface pressures at high bulk concentrations (> 0. 01 wt%) than sample 280 B, while the contrary was observed at small concentrations...|$|E
