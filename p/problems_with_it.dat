500|$|Although Comedy Central did {{not object}} to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to {{material}} they deemed potentially offensive.

Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executives had <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and Parker said they had to handle its animation [...] "very carefully". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and took {{a bite out of}} it.

500|$|Although {{the band}} liked the demo, it was {{difficult}} for them to record the song. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, [...] "that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard, as we call them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous." [...] Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and the group continued trying to fix it up.

500|$|Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said, [...] "Frankly, I {{was never}} {{happy with the}} whole idea in the first place. The central idea was too ordinary".

He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that [...] "We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and he was very good at that". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that [...] "the primary <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television...

[...] He later confirmed his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol because it [...] "was going to basically just transfer money directly to Russia for nothing" [...] and that it must include [...] "every nation of the world in this entire project...includ China and India" [...] to meet his approval.

Madonna wanted Auto-Tune because she wanted [...] "Hollywood" [...] to have a more dance-like feel to it, although Ahmadzaï was against it. The track [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] had gentle vocals, then the singing was frozen using a Roland VP-9000.
