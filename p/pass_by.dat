5|$|The Hokies {{lived up}} to their favored status in the first half, running up a 21-3 lead before halftime, {{thanks in part to}} a well-executed <b>pass</b> <b>by</b> wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal on a trick play.

5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or <b>pass,</b> <b>by</b> doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E

With 2:15 remaining in the opening quarter, Tech fair caught the punt at its 19-yard line.|$|E

Ravetch found Larry McMurtry's novel, Horseman, <b>Pass</b> <b>By,</b> in an airport shop during a Dallas stopover and presented the project to Ritt and Newman after reading a description of Hud Bannon.

5|$|Bolton {{started the}} second half on the attack. Bolton were awarded a free-kick, {{following}} a foul on Thompson, by Liverpool defender Rob Jones, who was shown a yellow card. From the subsequent free-kick, Bolton striker John McGinlay received the ball, keeping it from the onrushing James, his pass into the Liverpool penalty area found Mixu Paatelainen whose volleyed shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. Bolton had another attack almost immediately. A <b>pass</b> <b>by</b> McAteer found Thompson {{on the right side}} of the pitch, but his shot went across the face of the Liverpool goal. Liverpool began to assert more pressure following the attack. A <b>pass</b> <b>by</b> striker Ian Rush in the 52nd minute found Bjørnebye, whose subsequent shot hit the post. Another Liverpool attack was stopped by Bolton defender Mark Seagraves as he intercepted a cross from Bjørnebye to Rush, but his interception went towards the Bolton goal and was only stopped by Branagan.|$|E
