40|$|Protein NMR <b>peak</b> <b>assignment</b> {{refers to}} the process of {{assigning}} a group of “spin systems” obtained experimentally to a protein sequence of amino acids. The automation of this process is still an unsolved and challenging problem in NMR protein structure determination. Recently, protein backbone NMR <b>peak</b> <b>assignment</b> has been formulated as an interval scheduling problem, where a protein sequence P of amino acids is viewed as a discrete time interval I (the amino acids on P one-to-one correspond to the time units of I), each subset S of spin systems that are known to originate from consecutive amino acids of P is viewed as a “job ” jS, the preference of assigning S to a subsequence P of consecutive amino acids on P is viewed as the profit of executing job jS in the subinterval of I corresponding to P, and the goal is to maximize the total profit of executing the jobs (on a single machine) during I. The interval scheduling problem is Max SNP-hard in general. Typically the jobs that require one or two consecutive time units are the most difficult to assign/schedule. To solve these most difficult assignments, we present an efficient 137 -approximation algorithm. Combining this algorithm with a greedy filtering strategy for handling long jobs (i. e. jobs that need more than two consecutive time units), we obtained a new efficient heuristic for protein NMR <b>peak</b> <b>assignment.</b> Our study using experimental data shows that the new heuristic produces the best <b>peak</b> <b>assignment</b> in most of the cases, compared with the NMR <b>peak</b> <b>assignment</b> algorithms in the literature. The 137 -approximation algorithm is also the first approximation algorithm for a nontrivial case of the classical (weighted) interval scheduling problem that breaks the ratio 2 barrier...|$|E
