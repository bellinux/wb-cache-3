The HMM component of the model analyzes the image along one direction, in a specific state observation probability given by the product of causal MRF-like pixel conditional probabilities. Aspects concerning definition, training and recognition via this type of model are developed throughout the paper. Experiments were performed on handwritten digits and words in a small lexicon. For the latter, we report a 89. 68 % average word recognition rate on the SRTP French <b>postal</b> <b>cheque</b> database (7057 words, 1779 scriptors...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} system for the {{recognition}} of handwritten words on literal cheque amounts which advantageously combine HMMs and Markov random fields (MRFs). It operates at pixel level, in a holistic manner, on height normalized word images which are viewed as random field realizations. The HMM analyzes the image along the horizontal writing direction, in a specific state observation probability given by the column product of causal MRF-like pixel conditional probabilities. Aspects concerning definition, training and recognition via this type of model are developed throughout the paper. We report a 90. 08 % average word recognition rate on 2378 words and a 79. 52 % amount rate on 579 amounts of the SRTP French <b>postal</b> <b>cheque</b> database (7031 words, 1779 amounts, different scriptors) ...|$|E
40|$|At the Dr. Neher Laboratories the {{recognition}} of handwritten figures was started for the then PostalCheque and Giro Services in 1968. In 1975 this research resulted in first generation machines which checked punched cards, automatically. Owing to the great success of these reading machines, considerably improved second generation machines were delivered in 1982, suitable for the current 'floppy' forms. After the privatization of the <b>Postal</b> <b>Cheque</b> and Giro Services, Postbank N. V. entered into a long-term contract with the Dr. Neher Laboratories {{for the development of}} third generation machines and also for research concerning a fully automated encoding machine instead of a checking one. This study, which appeared as an article in 'Natuur & Techniek' in October 1986, gives an insight in the principle of figure recognition which is used and its application by Postbank N. V...|$|E

30|$|Off-line {{handwritten}} {{character recognition}} {{continues to be an}} active research area towards exploring the newer techniques because it has various applications such as <b>postal</b> sorting, bank <b>cheque</b> amount reading, and official document reading. Mori et al. (1992) presented historical review of off-line character recognition research and development. A comprehensive survey of recognition techniques has been reported in (Govindan and Shivaprasad 1990; Mehfuz and Katiyar 2012; Katiyar and Mehfuz 2012). A survey on on-line and off-line handwritten and hand printed character recognition has already been presented (Plamondon and Srihari 2000). Recognition of cursive handwritten character is a difficult task. Most of the researchers have conducted their work on unconstrained character (Hanmandlu et al. 2003; Saurabh and Singh 2011; Lee 1996).|$|R

English Character Recognition (CR) has been extensively studied {{in the last half}} century and progressed to a level, sufficient to produce technology driven applications. But same is not the case for Indian languages which are complicated in terms of structure and computations.

50|$|Stamps {{used for}} {{training}} postal {{workers in the}} United Kingdom are usually normal postage or other stamps, including television license and national insurance stamps (when they were in use), obliterated with two vertical or horizontal bars to prevent genuine use, though other forms of cancellation have been used such as overprinting or rubber stamps. They have frequently {{found their way into}} the hands of collectors. Early examples were properly printed with bars but more recent examples tend to simply be crossed through with a black marker pen. A range of cancelled or voided paper money, <b>cheques,</b> <b>postal</b> orders, credit cards and horizon labels are also used to train workers which takes place at counter training schools (CTOs). Before decimalisation in 1971, post offices were issued with very simple training stamps in the same colours as the upcoming decimal stamps.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} half century, the English {{character}} recognition was studied {{and the results were}} of such type that’s it can produce technology driven applications. But the same approach cannot be used in case of Indian languages {{due to the nature of}} complication in terms of structure and computation. “Hindi ” the national language of India (written in Devanagri script) is world’s third most popular language after Chinese and English. Devanagri handwritten character recognition has got lot of application in different fields like <b>postal</b> address reading, <b>cheques</b> reading electronically. There are several Handwritten numeral recognition have been proposed and evolved during last few decades. But robustness and accuracy of such system is still a issue due to variety of writing patterns, size, slant, ink, and writing style. So In this paper, a novel approach for Devanagari handwritten numerals recognition based on global and local structural features is proposed. Probabilistic NeuralNetwork (PNN) Classifier is used to classify the Devanagari numerals separately...|$|R
40|$|Character {{recognition}} {{has been}} a popular research area for many years because of its various application potentials. Some of its application areas are <b>postal</b> automation, bank <b>cheque</b> processing, automatic data entry, signature verification and so on. Nevertheless, recognition of handwritten characters {{is a problem that}} is currently gathering a lot of attention. It has become a difficult problem because of the high variability and ambiguity in the character shapes written by individuals. A lot of researchers have proposed many approaches to solve this complex problem but none {{has been a}}ble to solve the problem completely in all settings. Some of the problems encountered by researchers include selection of efficient feature extraction method, long network training time, long recognition time and low recognition accuracy. This paper developed a feature extraction technique for online character recognition system using hybrid of geometrical and statistical features. Thus, through the integration of geometrical and statistical features, insights were gained into new character properties, since these types of features were considered to be complementary...|$|R
40|$|Handwriting {{recognition}} {{has been}} an active and challenging area of research. Handwriting recognition system plays {{a very important role}} in today’s world. Handwriting recognition is very popular and computationally expensive work. At present time {{it is very difficult to}} find correct meaning of handwritten documents. There are many areas where we need to recognize the words, alphabets and digit. There are many application <b>postal</b> addresses, bank <b>cheque</b> where we need to recognize handwriting. This review paper will focus on different technique which is used on handwriting recognition. There are basically two different types of handwriting recognition system online and offline handwriting recognition. There are many approaches are present for offline handwriting recognition system. This review paper will represent the limitations and superiorities of different technique which is used for handwriting recognition system. So handwriting recognition has been studied from many decades. Handwriting recognition system can be used to solve many complex problems and can make human’s work easy. So this paper is an overview of different approaches of handwriting recognition system with their limitations and accuracy rate.
