30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether workable flesh-toned paints can be made from colourants from aphid insects and ivy gum using medieval gum and scale insect recipes. The processes of extracting pigment from the lesser-known ivy, wormwood <b>and</b> the giant <b>willow</b> <b>aphids</b> were explored, whilst paint binder and colourant was obtained from ivy plant gum. This work follows on experiences applying past practices derived from painters’ to illuminators’ technical manuals using similar processes once used for making colourants from historical scale insects, such as kermes and cochineal. The experimental reconstructions created by using selected locally sourced aphid insects and ivy gum, indicate that an aphid-stain and dye-based colourant which was fixed to calcium carbonate can form a successful paint source.|$|R
30|$|Past {{studies on}} dyes from aphid insects {{were carried out}} in the 1950 s and 1960 s by Cameron and Lord Todd and {{resulted}} in a number of publications, such as The Colouring Matter of the Aphididae [5]. Their work focused on isolating the compounds in the giant <b>willow</b> <b>and</b> bean <b>aphids</b> to understand the structure and stereochemistry of the proto aphins, rather than outlining practical applications for producing an alternative paint. However, their investigations established an overview and understanding of the key components present in selected aphid insects.|$|R
30|$|Even {{though there}} has been no {{historical}} evidence found to suggest that aphids were used for colourants in past practice on manuscripts or other objects, this work explores the ivy aphid (Aphis hederae); the wormwood aphid (Macrosiphoniella absinthii) <b>and</b> the giant <b>willow</b> <b>aphid</b> (Tuberolachnus salignus) <b>and</b> processed into paint sources {{as an alternative to the}} more commonly known scale insects that are evidently recorded in historical recipes. Well known scale insects included the kermes insect (Kermes vermilio) which contains the colouring agent kermesic acid (C 16 H 10 O 8), the cochineal insect (Dactylopius coccus) containing carminic acid (C 22 H 20 O 13) and the secretion from the lac insect (Kerria lacca, Laccifer lacca, Carteria lacca, Tachardia lacca, Lakshadia lacca, and the Chinese lac: Kerria chinensis) containing laccaic acid (C 26 H 19 NO 12) which belongs to the chromophore group anthraquinone [7, 8]. For this work, experience with producing colourants from these better known dye sources was essential for experiments to produce the aphid-based colours.|$|R

30|$|The {{chromophore}} group {{contained in}} aphids is naphthoquinone, {{with the most}} important element being perylene quinone obtained from the protoaphin-sl compound (C 36 H 38 O 16). This is present when the giant <b>willow</b> <b>aphid</b> (Tuberolachnus salignus) is crushed under neutral conditions [5]. The wormwood aphid (Macrosiphoniella absinthii) contains the acetylfluoraphin compound (C 23 H 24 O 11) and the 2 -hydroxyemodin compound (C 15 H 10 O 6) is found in the ivy aphid (Aphis hederae) [6].|$|R

30|$|The colour {{intensity}} produced by aphid-based dyes {{appears to be}} duller {{in comparison to the}} dyes from commercially produced scale insects, kermes and cochineal, nevertheless, this work shows that aphid species can produce a workable paint when the dye is mixed with a calcium carbonate substrate or used simply as a dye-based stain. Monitoring changes in the aphid and ivy gum colourants indicated that over 4  years all samples maintained their original colour, but after several months, dye from the giant <b>willow</b> <b>aphid</b> lost its original strength by rapidly fading in a concealed environment, therefore, being very unstable.|$|R
30|$|From the aphids {{selected}} for study, colour from the ivy aphid (Aphis hederae) made with wine using similar processes from the fifteenth-century recipe § 8 without adding any calcium carbonate, has remained fairly stable after 4  years {{kept in a}} dark envelope (Fig.  8 —no. 2). Therefore, using the ivy aphid reconstruction as a basis to work from, {{the stability of the}} colour could be developed further using variant recipe combinations with other ingredients. Even with the more fugitive colour from the giant <b>willow</b> <b>aphid,</b> with further research and investigation its durability may be improved by adjusting the processing method and additives.|$|R
30|$|In fact, {{the giant}} <b>willow</b> <b>aphid</b> (Tuberolachnus salignus) {{which is one}} of the largest aphid species in the world, had been {{researched}} as a potential dye source for military uniforms [1]. However, this colourant can gradually change from a crimson-purple to a brownish colour when exposed to daylight (Fig.  3 g). It had also been noticed that several smaller aphid species such as the Schizoneura lanigera (Eriosoma lanigerum)—also known as American Blight—which hosts on apple trees, have pronounced characteristics for producing a crimson dyestuff, but also can be fugitive to light [2] showing similar fading properties as the dyestuff made from the cochineal insect [3] 1.|$|R

40|$|The giant <b>willow</b> <b>aphid</b> [Tuberolachnus salignus (Gmelin) ] has {{recently}} become noteworthy {{as a potential}} pest species due to the increased uptake of willow, its host-plant, for use in growing biomass for energy production. In this paper we describe host selection studies of T. salignus on short rotation coppice (SRC) willow varieties in laboratory bioassays and field experiments. In laboratory olfactometry tests, T. salignus was significantly attracted to certain SRC willow varieties, but not to others. Field trials during 2007 and 2008 showed that T. salignus infestation levels varied significantly on different SRC <b>willow</b> varieties <b>and</b> that levels are highest on the varieties {{to which they are}} most strongly attracted in the laboratory bioassays...|$|R

30|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} in the late nineteenth-century when Buckton stated that adding caustic potash or lye [potassium hydroxide (KOH)] to aphin dye extracted from the pine tree aphid, produces a fine crimson colour [23]. The potash method was adopted and reconstructed using the localized giant <b>willow</b> <b>aphids,</b> firstly by crushing the entire insect in 5  ml of cold water (Fig.  3 b), then adding 1.5  g of potassium carbonate (K 2 CO 3) to deepen the dye making it more alkaline (pH 14), which produced a brighter crimson and a good colour tone (Fig.  3 e, h). However, the dye when exposed to natural daylight, decolorized quickly {{over a period of}} 7  days, thus making it a poor quality dyestuff (Fig.  3 f, g).|$|R
