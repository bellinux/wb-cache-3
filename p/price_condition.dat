40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{stressed}} {{the important role}} of cues such as price and other attributes in biasing consumers' product judgments. For example, Rao and Monroe (1989) reviewed evidence showing that consumers often use price to judge quality, even in categories where the actual price-quality correlations are low. Carpenter, Glazer, and Nakamoto (1994), among others, showed that consumers use irrelevant attributes, which are uncorrelated with quality, to judge product quality. The current research replicates those findings, but more importantly, shows that potentially biasing cues [...] price, irrelevant attributes, and even attributes that are merely imperfectly correlated with product quality [...] can actually improve consumers' judgments of product quality during later purchases. We argue that price and irrelevant attributes do not just function as heuristic cues that bias quality judgments but also as memory cues that help consumers to correctly retrieve quality information from previous experiences. When consumers have no direct quality information, they will use price or attribute information as a heuristic cue to judge quality. However, after receiving quality information, e. g., by experiencing the product, consumers will not only update the general heuristic relationship between the cue and quality, but also store exemplar information about the experienced product that includes a specific level of the cue (e. g., price or attribute), quality level, and other information such as brand name. Over time, this specific memory of a particular price or attribute can help consumers retrieve the specific quality level that accompanied the specific price or attribute, leading to more accurate quality judgment than if no price or attribute information was ever given. Thus, contrary to what is suggested by previous research, extrinsic and potentially biasing cues can actually make consumers more accurate and thereby increase consumer welfare. In Experiment 1, participants received information about three brands of orange juice (learning phase). For each juice, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> were first shown a brand name and a price, then asked to judge the quality level of the juice on a five-star scale, and then given feedback about the actual quality level of the juice. The actual price-quality correlation was zero. After a 20 -minute delay, participants were then presented with the brand names and prices again and asked to recall the actual quality levels of all three juices (test phase). In the no-price condition, no price information was ever given. As expected, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> used price as a heuristic cue in the learning phase, as evidenced by high correlations between price and quality judgments. However, at test, quality judgments were more accurate in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> than in the no <b>price</b> <b>condition,</b> as evidenced by higher correlations between quality judgments and actual quality in the <b>price</b> <b>condition.</b> Thus, whereas initial, pre-experience quality judgments were biased by price information (that was actually uncorrelated with real quality), post-experience quality judgments were made more accurate by the same price information. In Experiment 2, price was replaced by an attribute, the location (US state) where the juice was bottled. The location attribute was irrelevant {{in the sense that it}} was not highly correlated with product quality. (Unlike many other experiments involving irrelevant attributes, participants were not explicitly told that the location attribute was irrelevant.) Again, we found that this attribute biased initial quality judgments, but made postexperience judgments more accurate. Experiment 3 shows that the accuracyenhancing effect of adding an extrinsic cue is not limited to situations in which there is no overall relationship between the extrinsic cue and product quality. In the learning phase, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> received the same types of information for each brand as they did in Experiment 1 (brand, price, quality level). This time, higher-priced products had higher quality levels, with one exception. The last product had a high price but low quality. Participants in the no <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> received the same information, except that no price information was given. During a test phase, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> were provided with brand names and prices and were asked to recall the quality level of each of the products. Participants in the no <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> did the same but were not given any price information. As expected, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> judged the quality level of the "exceptional" 37 product more accurately than participants in the no <b>price</b> <b>condition.</b> In Experiment 4, we tested the hypothesis that potentially-biasing extrinsic cues (i. e., cues that participants expect to be related to an outcome such as quality) can lead to an even stronger accuracyenhancing effect than cues that participants do not expect to be related to the outcome. This might occur because a product experience that disconfirms an expectation may draw attention to that experience and exemplar information will be stored better than if participants had no expectation about the outcome. The high-expectation condition was identical to the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> in Experiment 3. The low-expectation condition replaced price by package size. As expected, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> judged the quality level of the "exceptional" product more accurately than participants in the low-expectation condition. Thus, the cue with the strongest potential to bias (price) ended up having the strongest unbiasing effect over time. These findings have clear implications for marketers and consumers. They indicate, for example, that adding attribute information that violates participants expected attribute-quality relationships (e. g., putting a high price on a low quality product or introducing irrelevant attribute information) can make low quality products more attractive initially, but over time may actually help consumers recognize those products' mediocrity by reducing confusion in memory, leaving that product worse off than if the attribute information had never been added. Thus, instead of hurting consumer welfare, potentially biasing and irrelevant attributes can improve consumer welfare. From a theoretical perspective, our results suggest that consumers use cues such as price and irrelevant attributes not just as heuristic cues that have general relationships with benefits such as quality (e. g., "higher price usually means higher quality") but that individual levels of price or other attributes are also stored as part of exemplars that can be used as memory cues to retrieve specific experiences. It is argued that these two functions rely on different memory and learning systems. Further experiments will asses moderators that determine when cues are used as general heuristic cues versus specific memory cues. Future research may also explore indirect effects of adding misleading attribute information on the quality implications of other product features such as brand names. status: publishe...|$|E

CSR involvement {{was based on a}} cause-related marketing campaign. Brand naming was based on a local/Thai brand name and a foreign brand name signifying that the product is from a renowned country. High prices and low prices were adopted for the pricing factor. A computer notebook was used to represent a high involvement and technological product for the experiment. Siam Computer was used to represent a Thai brand name whereas Toshisu was used to represent a foreign brand name. Students from a local university were recruited as experimental subjects. Fifty subjects were randomly assigned to each of the eight experimental conditions. All three experimental factors were found to have significant effects on purchase intentions. The levels of purchase intentions were found to be higher for products with CSR involvement, foreign brand name, and lower prices. The two way interaction effects suggested that CSR involvement had a positive effect on products with foreign brand name and higher prices. The effect of pricing was found to be stronger for products using Thai brand name. The three way interaction effect suggested that for a high <b>price</b> <b>condition,</b> CSR involvement had a strong effect on purchase intentions for products using a foreign brand name whereas in a low <b>price</b> <b>condition,</b> CSR involvement had no significant effect regardless of the name of the brand. </p...|$|E

This proposition is tested in a laboratory experiment against a one-sided message and the classic type of two-sided comparative message (at the brand level). The results are largely as expected and indicate a strong interaction between price and type of message.

40|$|When {{faced with}} a choice of {{selecting}} one of several available products (or possibly buying nothing), according to standard theoretical perspectives, people will choose the option with the highest cost–benefit difference. However, we propose that decisions about free (zero price) products differ, in that people do not simply subtract costs from benefits and perceive the benefits associated with free products as higher. We test this proposal by contrasting demand for two products across conditions that maintain the price difference between the goods, but vary the prices such that the cheaper good in the set is priced at either a low positive or zero price. In contrast with a standard cost–benefit perspective, in the zero <b>price</b> <b>condition,</b> dramatically more participants choose the cheaper option, whereas dramatically fewer participants choose the more expensive option. Thus, people appear to act as if zero pricing of a good not only decreases its cost but also adds to its benefits.

40|$|Malaysia is {{the main}} {{producer}} of palm oil, with its market segment of 50 {{percent more than the}} world palm oil product, In 1994, Malaysian palm oil production was 7, 220, 717 tons, while the need for domestic consumption was relatively small, i. e. only 10 percent of the total production, It shows that the palm oil is an export commodity for Malaysia. As the export commodity, the demand for Malaysian palm oil is very dependable on the world market's demand. The demand for the world palm oil itself is influenced by some factors, such as : the level of consumption, the price of subtitute product, the stock of the world vegetable oi!, income per capita, etc. Due to such many factors which may influence the demand for palm oil, the efforts to keep and increase the world market segment are of importance. The strategy may be in the form of market expansion, or market penetration towards the existing market. As a matter of fact, it is expected that the domestic palm oil business can be developing and keep the position as the main producer of the world palm oil. Johor Tenggara Oil Palm (JTOP) as one of domestic palm oil producers is also influenced by the world market situation. The unstable condition may have negative impact towards the continuity of the company's business since there is a sensitivity of palm oil demand towards the market's influence. Consequently, there is a price fluctuation, while the production cost needed is constant. The price fluctuation may cause a problem for the company, particularly for the selling price regulation, which then affecting the company's income. To face this challenge, a marketing strategy and the carefulness in conducting the market analysis which is in accordance with the company's objectives are necessary, Due to the matter, this internship is aimed to analyze and study the marketing strategy and the selling price regulation applied by JTOP, Sdn, Bhd to keep and increase the market segment and the company's profit. The internship is carried out in kind of "two-months apprentice" in JTOP, so that the apprenticers are expected to be able to study and analyze the problems occurred, which are in accordance with their internship objectives, within the given available time. The marketing strategy applied by JTOP is a direct selling and a selling via a broker. The direct selling is carried out by marketing directly the products to the consumers. In the direct selling, the price regulation and the candidate consumers are carried out by the company itself (the marketing manager). Different from the marketing via broker, the selling price regulation and the candidate consumers are based on the information given by the broker. Consequently, for the broker fee, the compan'y should spend RM 2 per ton (Rp, 1680) of the selling volume. The direct selling is usually carried out for the permanent consumers of JTOP. The marketing system done is a contract system (forward selling) in 1 - 4 months period. The marketing strategy with forward selling system carried out by JTOP is a high risk marketing strategy. This is because the valid palm oil price has a quite sharp fluctuation. As the consequences, the company has a quite high profit loss during the past 1994. The marketing with forward selling system can be done, when the demand for palm oil is decreasing and the price is relatively stable, so that the product marketing can be more guaranteed. The analysis result shows that the marketing via broker is more profitable for the company, if compared to the self-marketing. The contribution from the marketing margin via broker is still higger than the self-marketing margin, although the self-marketing has no broker fee. It means that before the company can use the resources optimally, the marketing via broker can be carried out since it can give a maximum profit to the company. However, for a long-term, the dependancy of the marketing on broker may have negative impact for the campany because it may reduce the income and the utilization of resources is not optimal. The selling price regulation is much related to the applied marketing system. In a fluctuating <b>price</b> <b>condition,</b> the optimal selling price regulation seldom give a maximum profit if it is not accompanied by a proper marketing strategy. In the fluctuating <b>price</b> <b>condition,</b> the marketing of long-term contract system must be avoided, because it may inflict a financial loss for the company. If during the contract, there is a price change and it tends to increase, the company will loose an opportunity to get the maximum profit.
