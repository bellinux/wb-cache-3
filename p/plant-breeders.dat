40|$|This {{thesis is}} about plant {{breeding}} in Early 20 th-Century Italy. The {{stories of the}} two most prominent Italian <b>plant-breeders</b> of the time, Nazareno Strampelli and Francesco Todaro, are used to explore a fragment of the often-neglected history of Italian agricultural research. While Italy was not at the forefront of agricultural innovation, research programs aimed at varietal innovation did emerge in the country, along with an early diffusion of Mendelism. Using philosophical as well as historical analysis, plant breeding is analysed throughout this thesis as a process: a sequence of steps that lays on practical skills and theoretical assumptions, acting on various elements of production. Systematic plant-breeding programs in Italy started from small individual efforts, attracting more and more resources until they became a crucial part of the fascist regime's infamous agricultural policy. Hybrid varieties developed in the early 20 th century survived World War II and are now ancestors of the varieties that are still cultivated today. Despite this relevance, the history of Italian wheat hybrids is today largely forgotten: this thesis is an effort to re-evaluate a part of it. The research did allow previously unknown or neglected facts to emerge, giving a new perspective on the infamous alliance between plant-breeding programs and the fascist regime. This thesis undertakes an analysis of Italian plant-breeding programs as processes. Those processes had a practical as well as a theoretical side, and involved various elements of production. Although a complete history of Italian plant breeding still remains to be written, the Italian case can now be considered along with the other case-studies that other scholars have developed in the history of plant breeding. The hope is that this historical and philosophical analysis will contribute to the on-going effort to understand the history of plants...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{varieties}} of crops {{usually have a}} short but spectacular life. When they succumb to disease, replacing them requires a lengthy breeding, process. But <b>plant-breeders</b> at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), in India, have developed a strategy that will keep pearl millet hybrids going indefinitely, even when they become susceptible to disease. Normally hybrids are developed by crossing two uniform inbred parents. The new strategy replaces one of the parents with an open pollinated variety. This new cross produces what are called 'Top-cross' hybrids and they are now being tested by the All-India Coordinated Pearl Millet Improvement Project. So far they have yielded {{as well as the}} best uniform hybrid, and yet they have a greater resistance to disease because, within the cross, there is a better spread of genetic material. If, however, the 'Top-cross' hybrid does succumb to disease it is very much easier to get resistance back into it through the open pollinated parent. This can be done in one or two generations. It is possible, therefore, to keep a hybrid going indefinitely by performing maintenance breeding on the open-pollinated parent. The ICRISAT plant breeders are taking the strategy a stage further. They are replacing the uniform inbred parent with a hybrid by crossing the hybrid with an open-pollinated variety. This means that the resulting hybrid has even more genetic variability within it. This method helps, too, in reducing the cost of seed production. ICRISAT is also changing another aspect of its pearl millet breeding programme. Instead of developing varieties that can be grown in all locations and situations, they are now breeding varieties to suit very specific areas. For instance, to breed varieties specially for the deserts of Rajasthan in India the plant breeders have taken local {{varieties of}} pearl millet and improved them so that they mature in a shorter time. In this way they can escape the onset of droughts that usually begin {{at the end of the}} growing season.
