40|$|Abstract — A {{comprehensive}} two-dimensional {{numerical model}} for the dispersion of air pollutants is presented. This model deals with the dispersion of both <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>pollutants</b> emitted from an area source with mesoscale wind along with large scale wind. The mesoscale wind is chosen to simulate the local wind produced by urban heat island. It is found that the mesoscale wind reduces the concentration of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>pollutants</b> in the upwind side centre of heat island and enhances the concentration in the downwind side of centre of heat island, and as the gravitational settling velocity increases, the concentration of secondary pollutants decreases. The concentration of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>pollutants</b> is less in magnitude for neutral atmosphere when compared to stable condition. The neutral atmospheric condition enhances vertical diffusion carrying the pollutant concentration to greater heights and thus the concentration of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>pollutants</b> is less at the surface region of the urban city...|$|R

50|$|Sedimentation and silt are the <b>primary</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{degrading}} the fishery.

Some hard rock mining has altered the riverbed in {{a small portion of}} the stream so that it is overwide and shallow. Within the vicinity of Elliston, the Little Blackfoot River is in extremely good shape, ecologically. Between Elliston and North Trout Creek, lack of vegetation (due to cattle grazing and haying) has created significant erosion and sedimentation. The river was largely in good shape from North Trout Creek to Snowshoe Creek Road, but from Snowshoe Creek Road to Homestead Gulch the river was in extremely poor condition due to lack of vegetation, heavy erosion, the use of riprap to stabilize the banks, and the erection of gravel dikes to contain flooding. From Homestead Gulch to Beck Hill Road, the lower Little Blackfoot had numerous segments of excellent to severely degraded riparian conditions. From Beck Hill Road to the river's mouth, the river was in extremely poor condition, largely due to the use of riprap and heavy erosion. The Little Blackfoot River was assessed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as being a substantial source of sediment source in the Clark Fork River.|$|E
