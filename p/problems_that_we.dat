[...] "Even the album title was misunderstood.", Billy Corgan wrote on the band's website that the title Adore “was a joke {{that no one ever}} got,” explaining that Adore was meant as a play on “A Door,” meaning the album would offer a new entrance to the band’s career. [...] By the end of 1998, Corgan, who would later call the making of Adore [...] "one of the most painful experiences of my life", was already writing material for the band's next album, and Jimmy Chamberlin was readmitted into the band.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 June 2010, {{following}} England's {{departure from}} the 2010 FIFA World Cup competition in South Africa, the UK's Culture and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the England fans for their behaviour during the competition, saying [...] "I mean, not a single arrest for a football-related offence, and the terrible <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had in Heysel and Hillsborough in the 1980s seem now to be behind us." [...] He later apologised and said [...] "I know that fan unrest played no part in the terrible events of April 1989 and I apologise to Liverpool fans and {{the families of those}} killed and injured in the Hillsborough disaster if my comments caused any offence." [...] Margaret Aspinall, chairperson of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, asked for a face to face meeting with Hunt before deciding if she would accept the apology.|$|E

And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I {{think that we need to}} prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E

60|$|In Utopia {{there is}} no {{distinct}} and separate science of economics. Many <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should regard as economic come {{within the scope of}} Utopian psychology. My Utopians make two divisions of the science of psychology, first, the general psychology of individuals, a sort of mental physiology separated by no definite line from physiology proper, and secondly, the psychology of relationship between individuals. This second is an exhaustive study of the reaction of people upon each other and of all possible relationships. It is a science of human aggregations, of all possible family groupings, of neighbours and neighbourhood, of companies, associations, unions, secret and public societies, religious groupings, of common ends and intercourse, and of the methods of intercourse and collective decision that hold human groups together, and finally of government and the State. The elucidation of economic relationships, depending as it does {{on the nature of the}} hypothesis of human aggregation actually in operation at any time, is considered to be subordinate and subsequent to this general science of Sociology. Political economy and economics, in our world now, consist of a hopeless muddle of social assumptions and preposterous psychology, and a few geographical and physical generalisations. Its ingredients will be classified out and widely separated in Utopian thought. On the one hand there will be the study of physical economies, ending in the descriptive treatment of society as an organisation for the conversion of all the available energy in nature to the material ends of mankind--a physical sociology which will be already at such a stage of practical development as to be giving the world this token coinage representing energy--and on the other there will be the study of economic problems as problems in the division of labour, having regard to a social organisation whose main ends are reproduction and education in an atmosphere of personal freedom. Each of these inquiries, working unencumbered by the other, will be continually contributing fresh valid conclusions for the use of the practical administrator.|$|E
