5|$|In 1895, Maryland Agricultural, a land-grant {{school with}} a {{military}} curriculum requirement, had a new commandant of cadets take office. Lieutenant Clough Overton, who opposed football at the university, cut funding for equipment and instituted strict rules limiting <b>practice</b> <b>time.</b> Instead of accepting this serious disadvantage against their opponents, the players declined to field a football team for the season.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Pennsbury High School, {{where he}} was coached by Frank Sciolla. Former Temple player Dalton Pepper was his high school teammate. In ninth grade, Allen decided {{that he wanted to}} be great, and put in much more <b>practice</b> <b>time.</b> He became a starter on the varsity team in his sophomore year. As a junior, he averaged 12 points and nine rebounds per game, and was named a Top 150 player in his class by Hoop Scoop.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, NFF {{launched}} {{plans for}} a redevelopment of Ullevaal, including artificial turf, a retractable roof and redevelopment of the West Stand to increase total capacity to 30,500 spectators. The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi-purpose venue and allow more matches to be played, grant the teams more <b>practice</b> <b>time</b> on their home pitch, make room for sponsor events, allow more concerts and potentially allow non-football sports, such as sprint skiing, to be held.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the main story, there's also a VR training mode in which the player can test out their sneaking skills {{in a series of}} artificially constructed environments. This mode is divided into three main categories (<b>practice,</b> <b>time</b> attack, and gun shooting), each consisting of ten stages. After completing all 30 stages, a survival mission is unlocked in which the player must proceed through all ten gun shooting stages in a row under a seven-minute limit.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} four {{different}} game types: Championship, Race <b>Practice,</b> <b>Time</b> Trial, and Multi Player. In Championship, players {{compete in a}} league of seasons consisting of four races and, in Wrecking Racing, a Destruction Derby match. In Race Practice, players practise a race, while Time Trials consists of a race against the clock. Multi Player allows up to nine players to race individually. After all have finished, a league table showing their placings is displayed.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers entered {{their first}} matchup with the Cleveland Browns having won 15 {{of the last}} 16games between the two teams. Ben Roethlisberger started the game despite missing <b>practice</b> <b>time</b> during the week due to a {{shoulder}} injury suffered in Week One. The Steelers' defense held the Browns to 16yards on their first four drives, as the teams played to a scoreless tie after the first quarter. After a Bryant McFadden interception the Steelers drove 70yards and Roethlisberger connected with Hines Ward for their third touchdown combination of the season. Cleveland responded with a 14play, 71yard drive, but Troy Polamalu intercepted a Cleveland pass as time expired {{in the first half}} solidifying Pittsburgh's seven point halftime lead.|$|E

5|$|The Steelers' matchup {{with the}} Jacksonville Jaguars—their first since the Jaguars knocked the Steelers {{out of the}} —was {{featured}} as the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Throwback Game of the Week. On the Steelers opening drive, Roethlisberger—who missed <b>practice</b> <b>time</b> during the week due to injections for his shoulder—was intercepted by Rashean Mathis who returned the ball 72yards for a touchdown. Pittsburgh responded by driving 71yards, with Heath Miller receiving a 1-yard touchdown pass to tie the game. Jacksonville re-gained the lead on the next drive when Maurice Jones-Drew ran for a touchdown. Pittsburgh {{took the lead in}} the second quarter with two field goals and a 48-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Nate Washington.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} collegiate game, against Duke, Farmer played 7 minutes and air balled his only shot. After an early season loss to Notre Dame in the Big Four Classic dropped the Wildcats' record to 23, Sutton noted that Farmer, Sean Sutton, and LaRon Ellis had all missed <b>practice</b> <b>time</b> with the flu. After {{managing}} just 17 {{points in the}} Wildcats' first five games, Farmer scored 10 points in 20 minutes in the team's sixth game against Northwestern State. With 12 seconds {{to go in the}} game and Kentucky trailing 8482, Farmer was whistled for an intentional foul on Northwestern State's Roman Banks while trying to draw a charge on an inbounds play. Banks maintained that Farmer had tugged Banks toward him and fallen down, attempting to draw the call, but Farmer and Sutton both denied the alleged chicanery. Banks hit one of two free throws, and Farmer missed a potentially game-tying three-point shot at the buzzer, dropping the Wildcats to 24 on the season. Farmer followed up with a 15-point performance in a win against Western Carolina. In the Kentucky Invitational Tournament, where Kentucky lost its opening round game to Bowling Green before winning the third-place game against Marshall, Farmer scored 12 points in each game.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Yamaha could not develop a dirt track motorcycle capable of competing with the dominant Harley-Davidson dirt track team, the American Yamaha importer, Yamaha USA, offered to send Roberts to Europe in 1978 to compete in the World Championship Grand Prix road racing series, along with Kel Carruthers to act as his mentor and crew chief. Roberts also secured the financial backing of the Goodyear tire company. The team planned to compete in the 250cc world championship as well as the Formula 750 series in order to have more <b>practice</b> <b>time</b> to learn the tracks, but their main focus would be on the 500cc class, considered the premier class at the time. His main competition in the 500cc world championship would come from Suzuki rider Barry Sheene, winner of the two previous titles. Roberts said that he was initially indifferent about competing in Europe, but when he read that Sheene had labeled him as"no threat", he made up his mind to compete. Few observers gave Roberts any chance of winning the championship, citing the reasoning that it would take him at least one season to learn the European circuits.|$|E

25|$|The USA Basketball organization, with {{input from}} VanDerveer, decided {{to depart from}} the usual {{strategy}} to form a team {{a few weeks before}} the event, which severely limited the <b>practice</b> <b>time.</b> Instead, they decided to form a full-time national team to stay together for a year, preparing to the 1996 Olympics. VanDerveer was chosen as head coach, but was expected to take a one-year sabbatical from her head coaching position at Stanford.|$|E

25|$|LCBL field {{managers}} {{are among the}} youngest in any summer college baseball league. This gives an unrivaled level of comfort to the players, being coached {{by a man who}} is closer to their age than their college head coach. However, youth or inexperience is not a viable excuse for not commanding the dugout. The interview process is thorough and each must take their leadership duties very seriously. Upon being hired, managers select their assistant coach and set aside at least one day a week for <b>practice</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rodriguez's {{final season}} began with new {{hope in the}} program, as Robinson was named the {{starting}} quarterback over Forcier. Robinson led the Wolverines to a 5–0 start, but after a defeat to Michigan State at home, the Wolverines finished the season 2–5 over their last seven games. Michigan did, however, qualify for a bowl game with a 7–5 record, and clinched its bowl berth in dramatic fashion against Illinois, with Michigan winning 67–65 in three overtime periods. The game was the highest combined scoring game in Michigan history, and saw Michigan's defense give up the most points in its history. Michigan was invited to the Gator Bowl to face Mississippi State, where it lost 52–14. The Michigan defense set new school records as the worst defense in Michigan history. In {{the middle of the}} season, the NCAA announced its penalties against Michigan for the <b>practice</b> <b>time</b> violations. The program was placed on three years probation and docked 130 practice hours, which was twice the amount Michigan had exceeded.|$|E
