50|$|Although {{there was}} already a main project (magnetic mirror) at the University of California, a {{scientist}} named W. R.

50|$|Operating {{conditions}} during {{membrane filtration}} are also vital, {{as they may}} affect fouling conditions during filtration. For instance, crossflow filtration is always preferred to dead end filtration, because turbulence generated during the filtration entails a thinner deposit layer and therefore minimises fouling (e.g. tubular <b>pinch</b> <b>effect).</b>|$|E

40|$|We perform {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to investigate the}} reduction of the thermal conductivity by kinks in silicon nanowires. The reduction percentage can be as high as 70 % at room temperature. The temperature dependence of the reduction is also calculated. By calculating phonon polarization vectors, two mechanisms are found to be responsible for the reduced thermal conductivity: (1) the interchanging effect between the longitudinal and transverse phonon modes and (2) the <b>pinching</b> <b>effect,</b> i. e a new type of localization, for the twisting and transverse phonon modes in the kinked silicon nanowires. Our work demonstrates that the phonon interchanging and <b>pinching</b> <b>effects,</b> induced by kinking, are brand new and effective ways in modulating heat transfer in nanowires, which enables the kinked silicon nanowires to be a promising candidate for thermoelectric materials.

50|$|Alfvén waves (low {{frequency}} hydromagnetic plasma oscillations) {{are named}} in his honor. Many of his {{theories about the}} solar system were verified {{as late as the}} 1980s through external measurements of cometary and planetary magnetospheres. But Alfvén himself noted that astrophysical textbooks poorly represented known plasma phenomena: A study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts such as double layers, critical velocity, pinch effects, and circuits is made. It is found that students using these textbooks remain essentially ignorant of even the existence of these concepts, despite {{the fact that some of}} them have been well known for half a century (e.g, double layers, Langmuir, 1929; <b>pinch</b> <b>effect,</b> Bennet, 1934). Alfvén reported that of 17 of the most used textbooks on astrophysics, none mention the <b>pinch</b> <b>effect,</b> none mentioned critical ionization velocity, only two mentioned circuits, and three mentioned double layers.|$|E
5000|$|Implosion of {{the liner}} occurs under {{the action of}} a {{magnetic}} force, produced when a large-electric current flows through a plasma column (<b>pinch</b> <b>effect).</b> The time required for the liner to collapse to the axis is typically shorter than a microsecond, when driven by a pulsed, high-current, high-power electrical supply. The Sandia National Laboratories Z Facility {{is probably the best}} example of a state-of-the-art, pulsed-power driver used for these types of studies ...|$|E
5000|$|Mark C. Porter first {{suspected}} that the <b>pinch</b> <b>effect</b> {{was responsible for the}} return of separated particles into the core flow by the membrane. This effect was first demonstrated in 1956 by G. Sergé and A. Silberberg. They had been working with dilute suspensions of spherical particles in pipelines. While the particle was flowing through the pipeline, it appeared to migrate away from the pipe axis and pipe wall and reach equilibrium in a radial eccentric position.|$|E
40|$|We extend Kennel and Coroniti's (1984) spherical {{magnetohydrodynamic}} {{models for}} the Crab Nebula to include the <b>pinching</b> <b>effect</b> of the toroidal magnetic field. Since the bulk nebular flow {{is likely to be}} very submagnetosonic, a quasi-static treatment is possible. We show that the <b>pinching</b> <b>effect</b> can be responsible for the observed elongation of the pulsar wind bubble, as indicated by the surface brightness contours of optical synchrotron radiation. From the observed elongation we estimate a value for sigma, the ratio of Poynting flux to plasma kinetic energy flux in the free pulsar wind, which is consistent with previous results from spherical models. Using the inferred magnetic field configuration inside the pulsar wind bubble, combined with the observed dimensions of the X-ray nebula, we are able to constrain the particle distribution function. We conclude that, for a power-law injection function, the maximum energy has to be much larger in the pulsar equatorial region than in the polar region...|$|R

His Ph.D. thesis on cosmic rays was completed {{under the direction of}} Nobel laureate Arthur Compton. While working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory from 1941 to 1948, he helped build a microwave linear electron accelerator. As an associate professor of Tufts University from 1948 to 1954, he researched magnetic <b>pinch</b> <b>effects,</b> which led to his later work on plasma <b>pinch</b> <b>effects.</b> His discoveries of plasmoids and other plasma-related effects began between 1954 and 1956 at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, where he continued to act as consultant. A 1956 New York Times front page story featured Bostick's [...] "plasma gun". He served as Professor of Physics at the Stevens Institute of Technology from 1956 until receiving Professor Emeritus status at his retirement in 1981, and as head of the physics department from 1968.

50|$|The name {{refers to}} the {{direction}} of the current in the devices, the Z-axis on a normal three-dimensional graph. Any machine that causes a <b>pinch</b> <b>effect</b> due to current running in that direction is correctly referred to as a Z-pinch system, and this encompasses a wide variety of devices used for an equally wide variety of purposes. Early uses focused on fusion research in donut-shaped tubes with the Z-axis running down the inside the tube, modern devices are generally cylindrical and used to generate high-intensity x-ray sources for the study of nuclear weapons and other roles.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} {{in the construction of}} a linear collider {{is the fact that the}} beams can be brought to a collision only once and do not circulate for many turns as in circular machines like the LHC. This strongly decreases the rate of particle collisions. Hence, it is necessary to increase the collision probability of the particles at the interaction point for each bunch crossing. In order to do so, the transverse size of the beam must be reduced as strongly as possible, e.g. to (before <b>pinch</b> <b>effect)</b> 40 nm horizontally and 1 nm vertically for CLIC (compared to 17000 nm horizontally and vertically for the LHC).|$|E
50|$|The first {{creation}} of a Z-pinch in the laboratory may have occurred in 1790 in Holland when Martinus van Marum created an explosion by discharging 100 Leyden jars into a wire. The phenomenon was not understood until 1905, when Pollock and Barraclough investigated a compressed and distorted length of copper tube from a lightning rod after it had been struck by lightning. Their analysis showed that the forces due to {{the interaction of the}} large current flow with its own magnetic field could have caused the compression and distortion. A similar, and apparently independent, theoretical analysis of the <b>pinch</b> <b>effect</b> in liquid metals was published by Northrupp in 1907. The next major development was the publication in 1934 of an analysis of the radial pressure balance in a static Z-pinch by Bennett (see the following section for details).|$|E
30|$|<b>Pinching</b> <b>effect</b> and {{stiffness}} degradation {{were the}} main characteristics for the CH- and CL-series splices. These features {{were similar to those}} of bond stress-slip behavior between embedded reinforcing steel bars and concrete under cyclic loading. The analytical model for bond stress-slip behavior proposed in (Teng and Zou 1996) appropriately considers these characteristics and, therefore, was used as a basis for developing a stress–strain relationship of the tested splices.|$|R
30|$|Mechanical {{behavior}} of splices under cyclic loading has a pronounced <b>pinching</b> <b>effect</b> and stiffness degradation. The {{shape of the}} load-deformation curves for specimens under cyclic loadings {{were similar to those}} under incremental tensile loading. This finding formed a basis for presenting the stress–strain relationship of the splices under cyclic loading. Appreciable residual deformations were found for specimens under cyclic loadings. Degradation of the ultimate strengths and ultimate deformation capacities were not observed compared to specimens under tensile loadings.|$|R

40|$|Beam-beam effects {{present one}} of major factors {{limiting}} the luminosity of colliders. In the linac-ring option of the eRHIC design, an electron beam accelerated in a superconducting energy recovery linac(ERL) collides with a proton beam circulating in the Rille ring. Some specific features of beam-beam interactions should be carefully evaluated for the linac-ring configuration. One {{of the most}} important effects on the ion beam stability originates from a strongly focus ed electron beam because of the beam-beam force. This electron <b>pinch</b> <b>effect</b> makes the beam-beam parameter of the ion beam several times larger than the design value, and leads to a fast emittance grow th of the ion beam.

40|$|The {{effect of}} weak {{dissipation}} on drift orbits {{has been investigated}} making use of a simple mapping model in a helical magnetic field. It is found that, after many mapping iterations, any orbit tends to an attractor froming a vortex line even with very small dissipation. The convergence is faster for larger dissipation,i. e., the number of iteration N to converge within a certain distance from the attractor is inversely proportional {{to the amount of}} the dissipation. Altougth the behavior of orbits completely change, the basic stability characteristics of the system does not change, i. e., the coordinate of the attractors are determined by the stable fixed points in the area preserving system because the dissipation is very small. Since wide range of orbits are concentrated arround the attractors after many toroidal circulations, a <b>pinch</b> <b>effect</b> is created by a small dissipation. Application of this <b>pinch</b> <b>effect</b> to fusion plasmas is disscussed. ...|$|E

This spirit is best reflected in the unceasing failures in efforts for solving the problem of controlled thermonuclear fusion for even the simplest pinches for over decades; and the nature keeps us challenging with examples. However, these efforts have permitted researchers the obtention of a dense plasma with a lifetime that, albeit short, is sufficient to study the physics of the <b>pinch</b> <b>effect,</b> to create methods of plasma diagnostics, and to develop a modern theory of plasma processes. Most importantly, they have impregnated the solid state plasmas, particularly the electron-hole plasmas in semiconductors, which do not suffer from the issues related with the confinement and which have demonstrated their potential not only for the fundamental physics but also for the device physics. Here, we report on a two-component, cylindrical, quasi-one-dimensional quantum plasma subjected to a radial confining harmonic potential and an applied magnetic field in the symmetric gauge.
