50|$|The {{patterns}} of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct {{from those of}} the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, EGLN1 appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. Even then, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Among the Andeans, there are no significant associations between EPAS1 or EGLN1 SNP genotypes and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans. The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) <b>play</b> <b>vital</b> <b>roles</b> in their weak adaptation to hypoxia.|$|E
