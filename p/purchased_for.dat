40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} self-reported health and register-based prescription medicine purchases on re-employment chances, and whether these health indicators measure similar aspects of health in this analysis. Data came from a 2006 Danish unemployment survey among {{a random sample of}} unemployed individuals enriched with register data (2006 – 2008, N= 1806). The survey participants all received unemployment benefits from the welfare system and had been unemployed for more than 20 weeks {{at the time of the}} interview in 2006. We combined these data with longitudinal register data on individual prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> somatic illnesses and prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> mental illnesses, information on re-employment and various socio-demographic variables. We conducted binary logistic regression analyses to investigate the impact of self-reported health and prescription medicine purchases measured in 2006 on re-employment chances in 2007 and 2008. Our analyses show that unemployed workers with poor self-reported health and workers who had prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> mental illnesses were less likely to be re-employed in 2007 and 2008. Furthermore, the impact of both prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> somatic illnesses and for mental illnesses increased when adding self-reported health to the model although prescription <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> somatic illnesses became statistically insignificant. The impact of prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> somatic illnesses was mediated by self-reported health, whilst prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> mental illnesses was only partly mediated. Finally, SRH seemed a much stronger prediction than prescription medicines. From these results, we propose, when possible, the inclusion of both an indicator of self-reported health and an indicator of mental health in studies on re-employment...|$|R

5|$|Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF {{through the}} {{build-up}} of Australia's {{commitment to the}} Vietnam War beginning in the mid-1960s.

Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces.
