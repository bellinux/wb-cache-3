5|$|Tank, {{himself a}} capable {{development}} test pilot, {{took over the}} test program to investigate the aircraft's stalling characteristics, although the requisite airframe changes took several months to complete, with the Pulqui II N. 02(m) so modified not able to undertake its third <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> until 23 October. During the ensuing high-altitude test, on two successive occasions, the IAe 33 stalled inadvertently, although Tank had sufficient height at 9,000 m for recovery. Adding ballast to {{the nose of the}} aircraft cured the problem. On 8 February 1951, Tank publicly demonstrated the IAe 33 before Perón at the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires. The audience also included government officials, legislators and the foreign diplomatic corps in the military attaches of the embassies, along with a large crowd of spectators. Both the IAe 27 Pulqui I and IAe 33 Pulqui II flew during the demonstration.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, the Constellation {{came into}} its own as a fast {{civilian}} airliner. Aircraft already in production for the USAAF as C-69 transports were finished as civilian airliners, with TWA receiving the first on 1 October 1945. TWA's first transatlantic <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> departed Washington, DC, on December 3, 1945, arriving in Paris on December 4 via Gander and Shannon.|$|E
5|$|Comet 2E: Two Comet 2 airliners were {{fitted with}} Avon 504s {{in the inner}} {{nacelles}} and Avon 524s in the outer ones. These aircraft were used by BOAC for <b>proving</b> <b>flights</b> during 1957–1958.|$|R
2500|$|Later in {{the same}} year, Percival was {{involved}} in a landmark series of <b>proving</b> <b>flights</b> that helped establish the use of carrier-borne fighters, culminating in his being catapulted in a [...] "navalised" [...] Sopwith Pup off the USS Idaho battleship, at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.|$|R
5000|$|... 521 Lieutenant de Vaisseau Paris: The first {{completed}} aircraft, {{powered by}} 6 × Hispano-Suiza 12Ydrs. Operated by Air France on route <b>proving</b> <b>flights</b> the 521 was militarised in 1939 {{and operated by}} the Vichy government until stored at Marignane, finally being destroyed when axis troops retreated from advancing Allies.|$|R
25|$|Undeterred {{when the}} airline fails, the group start a second airline in Key West, Florida, to deliver mail {{throughout}} the Caribbean. Another pilot friend, Hap Stuart (Humphrey Bogart), signs up {{and as the}} airline begins to prosper, Logan becomes more obsessed, making life difficult for all around him including his wife and best friends. Jean and Hap quit but come back {{on the eve of}} an important <b>proving</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{negotiations}} with relevant {{authorities in the}} UK and destination countries for the grant of interim operating permits to enable the transfer of BOAC's loss-making routes to South America and to ensure continuity of service were still in progress, BUA's first <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> to that continent took place on 12 October 1964. It was operated {{with one of the}} brand-new VC10s, which carried a small load of VIPs comprising BUA MD Laker and a high-ranking British trade delegation.|$|E
25|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{arrival at}} Glasgow of BEA's first Comet 4B revenue {{service and a}} British Eagle BAC One-Eleven <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> from Heathrow on 2 May 1966 coincided {{with the opening of}} the city's new Abbotsinch Airport. This event was followed by British Eagle's first Heathrow—Glasgow One-Eleven revenue service on 9 May, making it the second British independent airline after BUA to operate scheduled jet services on domestic trunk routes. Although BUA's services preceded BEA's and British Eagle's by four months, this occasion marked the first time jets were used to operate scheduled services on a domestic trunk route from Heathrow. It also marked the first time parallel jet competition was introduced on a UK domestic trunk route, as well as the fourth time such competition was introduced anywhere. British Eagle initially operated its scheduled domestic jet services with a pair of 200 series One-Elevens leased from the Central African Airways, pending delivery of the UK carrier's first three One-Eleven 300s between the end of May and July. British Eagle marketed its 79-seat, all-tourist Heathrow—Glasgow One-Eleven jet services as a better and faster alternative to BEA's Comet 4B services and as a less time-consuming option compared with BUA's Gatwick—Glasgow InterJet One-Eleven service.|$|E
50|$|Following <b>proving</b> <b>flights</b> by United Airlines of the DC-4E it {{was soon}} obvious the 52-seat {{airliner}} was too large to operate economically and the partner airlines recommended {{a long list of}} changes required to the design. Douglas took the new requirement and produced a new design, the DC-4A, with a simpler unpressurised fuselage, R-2000 Twin Wasp engines and a single fin and rudder.|$|R
50|$|Tiger {{undertook}} {{the final}} stage of Australian regulatory procedures on 20 November 2007, successfully performing two <b>proving</b> <b>flights</b> from Melbourne to the Sunshine Coast and Launceston. Each carried officials from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) as well as Tiger crew. Tiger received its Air Operator's Certificate on 22 November. The airline projected initial traffic of 2 million passengers annually.|$|R
25|$|He {{also made}} {{a great impact on}} the {{extension}} of British Civil Aviation through his support for Imperial Airways and by his part in creating the Empire Air Mail Scheme, in which he went as a passenger in one of the early <b>proving</b> <b>flights</b> to India in December 1926. He negotiated overflight and landing rights with South Africa and other African administrations, Australia and India.|$|R
500|$|The YB-52, {{the second}} XB-52 {{modified}} with more operational equipment, first flew on 15 April 1952 with [...] "Tex" [...] Johnston as pilot. During ground testing on 29 November 1951, the XB-52's pneumatic system failed during a full-pressure test; the resulting explosion severely damaged the trailing {{edge of the}} wing, necessitating considerable repairs. A two-hour, 21-minute <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> from Boeing Field, King County, in Seattle, Washington to Larson AFB was undertaken with Boeing test pilot Johnston and air force Lieutenant Colonel Guy M. Townsend. The XB-52 followed on 2 October 1952. The thorough development, including 670 days in the wind tunnel and 130 days of aerodynamic and aeroelastic testing, paid off with smooth flight testing. Encouraged, the air force increased its order to 282 B-52s.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Canada {{had almost}} no airline coverage; many Canadians wishing to fly long {{distances}} by air would journey through the United States. The Liberals proposed legislation to establish a government-financed corporation, with half the stock to be owned by the CNR and half by the privately owned Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The CPR balked at the deal, and the remaining stock was {{taken up by the}} CNR. In May 1937, Trans-Canada Air Lines was founded with its inaugural flight, a perilous transcontinental <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> on 30 July 1937. [...] Howe, along with other dignitaries, was on board, urging the pilots on, even through dangerous weather conditions. For the rest of his political career, Howe kept Trans-Canada Air Lines in his ministerial portfolio, considering it his [...] "progeny and generally promoted its interests." ...|$|E
500|$|McDonnell {{test pilot}} Edwin Schoch was {{assigned}} to the project, riding in the XF-85 while it was stowed aboard the EB-29B, before attempting a [...] "free" [...] flight on 23 August 1948. After Schoch was released from the bomber at a height of 20,000ft (6,000 m), he completed a 10-minute <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> at speeds between 180 and 250mph (290–400km/h), testing controls and maneuverability. When he attempted a hook-up, it became obvious the Goblin was extremely sensitive to the bomber's turbulence, as well as being affected by the air cushion created by the two aircraft operating in close proximity. [...] Constant but gentle adjustments of throttle and trim were necessary to overcome the cushioning effect. After three attempts to hook onto the trapeze, Schoch miscalculated his approach and struck the trapeze so violently that the canopy was smashed and ripped free and his helmet and mask were torn off. He saved the prototype by making a belly landing on the reinforced skid at the dry lake bed at Muroc. [...] All flight testing was suspended for seven weeks while the XF-85 was repaired and modified. Schoch used the down period to undertake a series of problem-free dummy dockings with a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star fighter.|$|E
50|$|Early <b>proving</b> <b>flights</b> {{were flown}} in 1934 by Railway Air Services which had {{three of the}} first four single-seat {{aircraft}} built. The third aircraft built, G-ACVY Mercury, started flying between Croydon, Castle Bromwich, Barton, Belfast and Renfrew on 20 Aug 1934. The third aircraft built was shipped to Australia for Holyman's Airways to operate the Empire air route between Melbourne and Hobart in Tasmania.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{registered}} CF-BEL-X {{while still}} in the experimental stage, this one-off, twin-boom, aerofoil-section fuselage, high-lift airliner garnered significant interest from the industry. CF-BEL-X underwent rigorous testing and <b>proving</b> <b>flights</b> designed to show off its potential. Despite a trouble-free test program and glowing accolades from the press and industry observers, no production orders resulted and the prototype was later sold in the United States as N17N.|$|R
2500|$|As a <b>proving</b> <b>flight,</b> Dick and {{his partner}} Jeana Yeager made a record setting {{endurance}} flight {{off the coast of}} California. [...] In December 1986, they took off from Edwards Air Force Base in California and flew around the world (westward) in nine days, fulfilling the aircraft's design goals. [...] The Voyager was retired and now hangs in the Milestones of Flight exhibit in the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) main exhibit hall, with the Wright Flyer, Spirit of St. Louis and Bell X-1.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Hawks {{convinced}} Texaco to back a <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> {{that would}} demonstrate {{the effectiveness of}} gliders. As a reserve officer in what was by then known as the United States Army Air Corps, Hawks foresaw the military usefulness of gliders, and {{despite a lack of}} government support and critical reaction from seasoned glider pilots, Hawks mapped out a transcontinental flight. The appropriately named Texaco Eaglet was a custom-made [...] wingspan glider built by R.E. and Wallace Franklin. Designed to achieve a maximum speed of 125 miles [...] per hour, it was fitted with a two-way radio and telephone connection with the tow plane, the [...] "Texaco 7", a Waco ASO biplane, flown by J. D. [...] "Duke" [...] Jernigan, Jr., a member of Texaco’s domestic sales division.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 June 2017 Airlink won the bid {{to operate}} {{scheduled}} flights to St Helena Airport.

Passengers also {{have the option to}} connect to Cape Town bound flights in Windhoek. The flights will be on Embraer E190 aircraft filling a maximum of only 76 of the 99 seats due to runway limitations related to the wind shear issues. [...] Airlink conducted a successful <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> on 23 August 2017 and commenced passenger flights on 14 October 2017. The first scheduled flight landed on 14 October 2017 around 14:00 UTC without any problems, although it was slightly delayed.

2500|$|... 14 July 1919: The first {{international}} commercial flight {{arrived in the}} form of a Caudron aircraft piloted by Etienne Poulet, carrying photos from Paris – Le Bourget Airport, in accordance with inter-government agreements celebrating the Treaty of Versailles. At that time, Hounslow Heath was the only approved aerodrome in the London area with customs facilities. In the following five weeks, various <b>proving</b> <b>flights</b> took place, sometimes without customs clearances or passports.|$|R
50|$|On 5 July 1937, A.S. Wilcockson flew a Short Empire for Imperial Airways from Foynes to Botwood, Newfoundland and Harold Gray piloted a Sikorsky S-42 for Pan American in the {{opposite}} direction.

2500|$|To {{explore the}} balance between good air and water {{performance}} and behaviour versus the expanding fault list, MAEE decided the Severn should go on a <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> to the Near East. [...] This took the Severn and an accompanying Supermarine Southampton 6,530 miles via Port Sudan and included trials on Lake Timsah. [...] The conclusions were as before: the Severn performed well {{in the air and}} on the water, was seaworthy during a storm and returned without corrosion, but suffered from many problems both small and large. The second category included broken ribs and a servo-rudder kingpost and the conclusion was {{that this was not a}} practical aircraft for Service use, so no orders followed. [...] Nonetheless, the sole Severn served for about five months with No. 209 Squadron RAF after the end of the MAEE trials before it was lost in the English Channel.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} obtain its air operator's certificate, the airline had to conduct a <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> with passengers. Because Tripoli was still unsafe, Libyan Wings {{operated}} its <b>proving</b> <b>flight</b> in Turkey with Libyan Civil Aviation Authority officials on board. The airline commenced operations on 21 September 2015 with a flight from Tripoli to Istanbul. Four days later, Turkey required all Libyan citizens to have a visa before entering the country; Libyan Wings had to suspend operations while its passengers travelled to the Turkish consulate in Misrata, 200 km away, to obtain their visas.|$|E
