DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Both the in-phase-signal path and the quadrature-signal path, {{as well as the}} amplitude <b>detection</b> <b>path,</b> are connected to an analysis unit (AWE) for the demodulation of the received data signal, in which either a normalizer (NORM) and thereafter a symbol discriminator (SE) and a data reconstruction logic (DRL) are arranged in the analysis unit. In the receiver, a connection is provided from the amplitude <b>detection</b> <b>path</b> to the normalizer, and the normalizer is provided for normalizing the in-phase and quadrature-signals with the aid of the signal output from the amplitude <b>detection</b> <b>path.</b> The symbol discriminator is designed for discriminating the symbols output from the normalized in-phase and quadrature-signals and optionally also from the amplitude <b>detection</b> <b>path</b> signal or, prior to the data reconstruction logic. There is an ARG-operator followed by a symbol discriminator arranged in the analysis unit and a connection is provided from the amplitude <b>detection</b> <b>path</b> to the symbol discriminator. An angle is determined from the in-phase and quadrature-signals by the ARG-operator. The symbol discriminations are made in the symbol discriminator by amplitude discrimination, using the signal output from the amplitude <b>detection</b> <b>path</b> and by phase discrimination from the output signal of the ARG-operator. USE - Optical receiver for receiving optical data signal. ADVANTAGE - The receiver structure has a structure independent of the modulation format with same symbol rate hence enables the insertion of the receivers in adaptive systems. The different modulation formats are realized by exclusive adjustment of the decision electronics as well as data reconstruction logic. The modular exchange of modulation-specific electronic modules and the parallel interpretation for different modulation formats are enabled by arrays of electronic modules...|$|R

30|$|Recent {{development}} in wireless communication-based positioning technology brings significant challenge of detecting the weak signal component arriving from the direct propagation path for time-of-arrival (TOA)-based approach. Due {{to the common}} obstruction of the direct propagation path in dense multipath environments, identification of the weak direct path in these environments can be very difficult via the classical correlation-based estimator {{in the presence of}} interference from significant later arriving multipath components. A new direct <b>path</b> <b>detection</b> scheme using the multipath interference cancelation is presented in this article. For data communication purpose, an iterative estimator with improved accuracy for joint channel and data estimation is first developed; based on which, the interference of multipath components are reconstructed and subtracted from the original received signal. With the aid of the detected data, an enhanced preamble is formulated. The accuracy of direct <b>path</b> <b>detection</b> is substantially improved by using the correlation between the multipath interference-suppressed signal and the enhanced preamble. Semi-analytical expression of the performance of the iterative estimator is derived. The analysis enables the system to determine an automatic stopping criterion to reduce the computational complexity of the iterative process. The performance of the direct <b>path</b> <b>detection</b> is also analyzed in terms of the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and compared with that of the conventional approach.

Furthermore, the theoretical performance and the practical constraints, e.g., complexity issues, have not been considered. In this article, we propose a direct <b>path</b> <b>detection</b> scheme using multipath interference cancelation for accurate TOA estimation in dense multipath environments. We consider an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based communication system, which is widely adopted in various broadband wireless applications[31] and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed direct <b>path</b> <b>detection</b> method in communication-based positioning systems. For data communication purpose, an iterative estimator for joint channel estimation and data detection with progressively improved accuracy is first proposed to achieve better performance of data communication. Based on {{the output of the}} iterative estimator, we propose to reconstruct and mitigate the multipath components from the received signals. Data-aided method is also used to construct an enhanced preamble. The new direct <b>path</b> <b>detection</b> is therefore based on the cross-correlation between the multipath interference-suppressed signal and the enhanced preamble. Considering the computational burden for the mobile receivers, the characteristics of the iterative estimator is studied by deriving a semi-analytical expression of the variance of the estimation error and the convergence conditions. An automatic stopping criterion is further developed to avoid the unnecessary computational complexity and allow a tradeoff between the performance degradation and computational burden. The performance of the direct <b>path</b> <b>detection</b> is analyzed by deriving the signal-to-noise-interference ratio (SINR)b.
