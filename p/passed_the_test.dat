5|$|Marcel Lihau {{was born}} on 29 September 1931 in Bumba, Équateur Province, Belgian Congo, the eldest of eight children. After his {{secondary}} education at the Bolongo seminary, he attended the Jesuit University Centre in Kisantu, graduating from the school's administrative sciences division. One of Lihau's teachers, sociologist Willy De Craemer, resolved to help him enroll in the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium, a school mostly unavailable to Congolese. To do this, De Craemer tutored him in Latin, Greek, and Flemish so he could take the Jury Central entrance exam. Lihau <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> with a high score and {{was admitted to the}} university. Since it was his goal to study law (not permitted to Congolese students at the time), De Craemer and several sympathetic Jesuit educators arranged for Lihau to take the necessary classes under the cover of studying Roman philology. He also studied economics and philosophy. For the duration of his studies he stayed with the family of a former director of Léopoldville Radio, Karel Theunissen. Lihau {{served as president of the}} small Congolese-Ruanda-Urundi students' union in Belgium, Association Générale des Étudiants Congolais en Belgique (AGEC).|$|E
25|$|Wagoner {{read about}} the AAGPBL in Life {{magazine}} when she was 12 years old. I told my parents that someday I'd like to play in that league (if I was good enough), she recalled in an interview. After graduating at 17, she attended a tryout at Chicago. She <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> and was rewarded with a contract {{to play in the}} circuit.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{students}} <b>passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> on their first attempt has risen slightly each year since 2004. More than three-quarters of students <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> {{more than two years}} before they finish high school, and more than nine out of ten students to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> by <b>the</b> end of high school.|$|R
25|$|Gorillas. Initially, it {{was thought}} that gorillas did not <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> but there are now several {{well-documented}} reports of gorillas (such as Koko) <b>passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
50|$|High School Assessment <b>test</b> scores show <b>the</b> {{school to}} be {{performing}} well. In 2006, only 29.5% of <b>the</b> students <b>passed</b> algebra, 44.0% <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> biology <b>test,</b> 53.8% <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> government <b>test,</b> and 46.3% <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> English <b>test.</b> However, in 2011, 81.1% of students who took all 4 of <b>the</b> required HSA <b>tests</b> (Algebra/Data Analysis, Biology, Government, and English) have <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
25|$|Twenty white city firefighters at the New Haven Fire Department claimed {{discrimination}} under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 {{after they}} had <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> for promotions to management positions and the city declined to promote them. New Haven officials invalidated the test results because none of the black firefighters who took it scored high enough {{to be considered for}} the positions.|$|E
25|$|When Haridasa Thakura {{was a young}} {{devotee of}} the Lord, he was allured by the {{incarnation}} of Maya-devi, but Haridasa easily <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord Krsna. He also believed to have stayed and chanted in a cave with a notorious snake, however, seemed unaffected by all of this. He did not even seem {{to be aware of}} the snake's presence.|$|E
25|$|Davis was mustered out on March 6, 1899, and on June 18, 1899, {{he enlisted}} {{as a private}} in Troop I, 9th Cavalry Regiment (one of the {{original}} Buffalo Soldier regiments), of the Regular Army. At his post in Fort Duchesne, Utah, he served first as the troop's clerk and later as squadron sergeant major through 1900. In late 1900, Davis's unit was commanded by Lieutenant Charles Young, the only African-American officer serving in the US military at that time. Young encouraged Davis's ambition to become an officer. Young tutored Davis {{in all of the}} subjects that were covered in the officer candidate test, especially mathematics, which had been Young's most difficult subject at the United States Military Academy at West Point. In early 1901 Davis <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, his highest score coming in the math section. (A second African American, John E. Green, <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> along with 10 other soldiers.) On February 2, 1901, Davis was commissioned a second lieutenant of Cavalry in the Regular Army.|$|E
50|$|In December 2005, Prince 5.1 <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Acid2 <b>test</b> from <b>the</b> Web Standards Project. It was {{the third}} user agent to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> after Safari and Konqueror.|$|R
50|$|Note that <b>passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> is also {{required}} for anyone wishing to remain indefinitely in the UK, {{whether or not}} they apply for citizenship. E.g., a husband or wife of a British citizen will be deported if they do not <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> in time.|$|R

25|$|Even with a {{seaworthy}} craft, {{the builders}} {{also needed to}} get official papers {{to allow them to}} freely sail the ocean. Once again Captain Wilkes was able to provide this necessity, but not before testing Captain Gale on his sailing and navigation skills. Gale <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> and Wilkes presented papers to the crew along with a compass, kedge anchor, log line, two log glasses, and an American flag.|$|E
25|$|In her defence, {{eyewitness}} {{evidence was}} presented of dingoes having {{been seen in}} the area on the evening of 17 August 1980. All witnesses claimed to believe the Chamberlains' story. One witness, a nurse, also reported having heard a baby's cry after the time when the prosecution alleged Azaria had been murdered. Evidence was also presented that adult blood also <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> used for foetal haemoglobin, and that other organic compounds can produce similar results on that particular test, including mucus from the nose and chocolate milkshakes, both of which had been present in the vehicle where Azaria was allegedly murdered.|$|E
25|$|Back in DunBroch, Merida {{shows off}} the helm, when the witch {{showed up for}} it, {{but she had a}} {{surprise}} for Merida. The quest for the helm was a test to prove that she was worthy of being the ruler of DunBroch, and she <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> The witch gives Merida a pouch of magical ale, to summon her father's spirit from the Underworld. Merida then thanked Mulan and Ruby for helping her, with Ruby and Mulan decide to team up together to find other werewolves. Merida then uses the spell at her father's grave and his spirit appears to her, telling Merida that he was proud of her. After King Fergus' spirit disappears, Merida vows to make Arthur pay.|$|E
50|$|At this point, {{the only}} {{purpose of the}} written code is to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> <b>The</b> {{programmer}} must not write code that is beyond the functionality that <b>the</b> <b>test</b> checks.|$|R
50|$|Zend {{considers}} the required score to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> confidential, {{as well as}} the questions themselves. They will inform failing candidates only about the topics that made them fail. It is known that candidates must pass every topic to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> as whole, and it is believed that the required score per topic might be about 75-85%.|$|R
50|$|No {{composite}} number below 264 (approximately 1.845·1019) <b>passes</b> <b>the</b> Baillie-PSW <b>test.</b> Consequently, {{this can}} be considered a deterministic primality test on numbers below that bound. There are also no known composite numbers above that bound that <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Commons {{then passed}} an address condemning {{the growth of}} popery in England. To shore up the Protestantism of the nation, Parliament <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> Act of 1673, which became law on 20 March 1673. The Test Act {{required}} all holders of civil and military office in England to take communion in the Church of England {{at least once a}} year and to make a declaration renouncing the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. Shaftesbury supported the Test Act, and, alongside James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, received the sacrament at St Clement Danes, with John Locke serving as the legal witness for each man's conformity with the Test Act. In March 1673, Shaftesbury supported a bill for easing the plight of the Protestant dissenters in England, but nothing came of this bill.|$|E
25|$|This {{was similar}} to tests {{previously}} used in Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania. It enabled immigration officials to exclude individuals {{on the basis of}} race without explicitly saying so. After 1903 the passage chosen was not important in itself as it was already decided the person could not enter Australia and so failure was inevitable. Although the test could theoretically be given to any person arriving in Australia, in practice it was given selectively {{on the basis of race}}, and others considered undesirables. Between 1902 and 1909, only 59 people <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> out of 1,359 who were given it. After 1903 passes were largely due to early immigration officers not understanding their role in this fraud or being unable to choose a language other than English. No-one passed the dictation test after 1909.|$|E
25|$|The Turing test, {{developed}} by Alan Turing in 1950, {{is a test}} of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware {{that one of the}} two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> The test does not check the ability to give correct answers to questions, only how closely answers resemble those a human would give.|$|E

25|$|In September 1912, {{he volunteered}} for {{detached}} service with the Signal Corps' Aeronautical Division to undertake flying {{training at the}} planned aviation school at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California. He became the 26th serving officer so detailed. The lack of facilities at Rockwell forced most of his training to {{take place at the}} Curtiss Aeroplane Company in Hammondsport, New York during October 1912. Brereton returned to Rockwell in November, and after the Signal Corps Aviation School officially opened in December, <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> qualifying him for a rating of Military Aviator on March 27, 1913, the 10th pilot to earn the rating. He began to train and instruct on float planes but experienced two crashes, the first as pilot of a fatal crash of a Curtiss F on April 8, 1913, and the second as an observer on May 21. At his own request, Brereton was relieved of aviation duties on July 3, 1913. He returned to the Coast Artillery Corps, posted to the 115th Company at Fort Rosecrans, on the Point Loma peninsula across the channel from Rockwell. While stationed in San Diego, he married Helen Clason Willis on February 27, 1913, and subsequently had two children.|$|E
25|$|Early Irish law, An Senchus Mor (The Great Knowledge of the Ancient ones) {{mentions}} in {{a number}} of places recht aicned or natural law. This is a concept predating European legal theory, and reflects a type of law that is universal and may be determined by reason and observation of natural action. Neil McLeod identifies concepts that law must accord with: fír (truth) and dliged (right or entitlement). These two terms occur frequently, though Irish law never strictly defines them. Similarly, the term córus (law in accordance with proper order) occurs in some places, and even in the titles of certain texts. These were two very real concepts to the jurists and the value of a given judgment with respect to them was apparently ascertainable. McLeod has also suggested that most of the specific laws mentioned have <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time and thus their truth has been confirmed, while other provisions are justified in other ways because they are younger and have not been tested over time The laws were written in the oldest dialect of the Irish language, called Bérla Féini , which even at the time was so difficult that persons about to become brehons had to be specially instructed in it, the length of time from beginning to becoming a learned Brehon was usually 20 years. Although under the law any third person could fulfill the duty if both parties agreed, and both were sane. It has been included in an Ethno-Celtic breakaway subculture, as it has religious undertones and freedom of religious expression allows it to once again be used as a valid system in Western Europe.|$|E
500|$|When Roland was young, Marten had {{an affair}} with Roland's mother, Gabrielle, using the affair to provoke Roland to take the gunslinger test early. He hoped Roland would fail so he would [...] be exiled but Roland <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> Eventually, Roland catches Walter; they have a long {{discussion}} about Roland's destiny and the Tower which causes him to slip into delirium. He awakens to find a pile of bones in Walter's place. In the original edition Walter and Marten are separate characters, with Walter dying {{at the end of the}} novel. When King published an expanded edition of the novel Walter and Marten are portrayed as identical, and Walter fakes his own death.|$|E

500|$|A {{few years}} after its release, Sony {{purchased}} satellite rights for the film for [...] 4 crore. The film was also released on VHS, DVD, and eventually Blu-ray. Now Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, along with Johar's second film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., often play on television to consistently high ratings. Johar said, [...] "It’s gratifying to know that they've aged well and <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time." [...] One {{of the best examples}} of the iconic status of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was the 2012 film Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi. Farah Khan and Boman Irani re-created scenes and characters from KKHH for posters to promote their film, and also paid homage in one of the songs, [...] "Ramba Mein Samba". In 2010, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was selected by Time as one of their [...] "Five Essential Bollywood movies to Netflix".|$|E
500|$|SAMS {{graduates}} {{first saw}} active service in December 1989 during Operation Just Cause in Panama. A core planning cell of seven SAMS graduates [...] "crafted a well rehearsed and well executed plan that simultaneously struck some roughly 50 objectives {{in a single}} coordinated blow". According to Colonel Kevin Benson, the tenth director of the school, [...] "The Army and SAMS faced a test of battle and the new group of highly-educated planners appeared to have <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> with flying colors." [...] After its mission in Panama, the army's leaders began to draw on SAMS to assist in additional ways. In the early 1990s, US Army leaders called upon the school to help develop army doctrine. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas E. Mitchell, Colonel James McDonough (the fifth SAMS director), {{and other members of}} the SAMS team helped revise the US Army Doctrinal Manual 100-5 Operations in 1990–1993.|$|E
500|$|While Plumlee {{was working}} as a {{caseworker}} for the welfare department of Clackamas County, a woman police officer encouraged her to take a civil service test. She <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> and was selected from a pool of 300 applicants to fill the Portland Police Bureau's only open position. According to Louis Barker, his mother became a police officer [...] "for the money" [...] rather than to [...] "make the world safe". The family needed her income: Paul, a World War II veteran, suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder and had difficulty holding steady jobs, and Plumlee was also contributing to the support of her aging mother. She served in the unit known as the known as the Women's Protective Division from 1947 to 1967. Policewomen in that division did not work with male officers other than those assigned to the Juvenile Division, and did not wear uniforms. Their work focused on crimes like child abuse, domestic violence, and rape.|$|E
