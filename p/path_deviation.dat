5000|$|For {{hitting a}} distant target an {{appropriate}} positive elevation angle is required that {{is achieved by}} angling the line of sight from the shooter's eye through the centerline of the sighting system downward toward the line of departure. This {{can be accomplished by}} simply adjusting the sights down mechanically, or by securing the entire sighting system to a sloped mounting having a known downward slope, or by a combination of both. This procedure has the effect of elevating the muzzle when the barrel must be subsequently raised to align the sights with the target. A projectile leaving a muzzle at a given elevation angle follows a ballistic trajectory whose characteristics are dependent upon various factors such as muzzle velocity, gravity, and aerodynamic drag. This ballistic trajectory {{is referred to as the}} bullet path. If the projectile is spin stabilized, aerodynamic forces will also predictably arc the trajectory slightly to the right, if the rifling employs [...] "right-hand twist." [...] Some barrels are cut with left-hand twist, and the bullet will arc to the left, as a result. Therefore, to compensate for this <b>path</b> <b>deviation,</b> the sights also have to be adjusted left or right, respectively. A constant wind also predictably affects the bullet path, pushing it slightly left or right, and a little bit more up and down, depending on the wind direction. The magnitude of these deviations are also affected by whether the bullet is on the upward or downward slope of the trajectory, due to a phenomenon called [...] "yaw of repose," [...] where a spinning bullet tends to steadily and predictably align slightly off center from its point mass trajectory. Nevertheless, each of these trajectory perturbations are predictable once the projectile aerodynamic coefficients are established, through a combination of detailed analytical modeling and test range measurements.|$|E

40|$|In laser {{cleaving}} of {{brittle materials}} using the controlled fracture technique, thermal stresses {{are used to}} induce a single crack and the material is separated along the cutting path by extending the crack. One {{of the problems in}} laser cutting of glass with the controlled fracture technique is the cut deviation at the leading and the trailing edges of the glass sheet. This work is about minimizing this deviation through an optimization process, which includes laser beam geometry. It has been established that the thermal stresses generated during laser scanning are strongly dependent upon laser beam geometry. Experimental techniques are used to quantify cut deviation for soda-lime glass sheets under a set of conditions while finite element modeling is used to optimize the process and reduce (or eliminate) cut deviation. The experimental results of the effect of different laser beam geometries on cut <b>path</b> <b>deviation</b> have been presented in this study, along with the finite element modeling of the cutting process to simulate the transient effects of the moving beam and predict thermal fields and stress distribution. These predictions are compared with the experimental data. In comparison to other beam geometries, the triangular-forward beam at the leading edge and triangular-reverse and circular beam geometry at the trailing edge produces lower tensile stresses (sigma(xx)) and hence minimizes the cut <b>path</b> <b>deviation.</b> The work also shows that beam divergence inside the glass plays a significant role in changing the cut <b>path</b> <b>deviation</b> at the bottom leading and trailing edges of the glass...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} non-atomic {{network congestion}} games with heterogeneous players where the latencies of the paths {{are subject to}} some bounded deviations. This model encompasses several well-studied extensions of the classical Wardrop model which incorporate, for example, risk-aversion, altruism or travel time delays. Our main goal is to analyze the worst-case deterioration in social cost of a perturbed Nash flow (i. e., for the perturbed latencies) with respect to an original Nash flow. We show that for homogeneous players perturbed Nash flows coincide with approximate Nash flows and derive tight bounds on their inefficiency. In contrast, we show that for heterogeneous populations this equivalence does not hold. We derive tight bounds on the inefficiency of both perturbed and approximate Nash flows for arbitrary player sensitivity distributions. Intuitively, our {{results suggest that the}} negative impact of <b>path</b> <b>deviations</b> (e. g., caused by risk-averse behavior or latency perturbations) is less severe than approximate stability (e. g., caused by limited responsiveness or bounded rationality).
