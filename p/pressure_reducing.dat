25|$|Researchers in {{the field}} do not agree on a theory for cold fusion. One {{proposal}} considers that hydrogen and its isotopes can be absorbed in certain solids, including palladium hydride, at high densities. This creates a high partial <b>pressure,</b> <b>reducing</b> the average separation of hydrogen isotopes. However, the reduction in separation is not enough {{by a factor of}} ten to create the fusion rates claimed in the original experiment. It was also proposed that a higher density of hydrogen inside the palladium and a lower potential barrier could raise the possibility of fusion at lower temperatures than expected from a simple application of Coulomb's law. Electron screening of the positive hydrogen nuclei by the negative electrons in the palladium lattice was suggested to the 2004 DOE commission, but the panel found the theoretical explanations not convincing and inconsistent with current physics theories.|$|E
25|$|Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do {{not occur}} {{homogeneously}} across the human genome. In fact, there is enormous diversity in SNP frequency between genes, reflecting different selective pressures on each gene as well as different mutation and recombination rates across the genome. However, studies on SNPs are biased towards coding regions, the data generated from them are unlikely to reflect the overall distribution of SNPs throughout the genome. Therefore, the SNP Consortium protocol was designed to identify SNPs with no bias towards coding regions and the Consortium's 100,000 SNPs generally reflect sequence diversity across the human chromosomes.The SNP Consortium aims to expand the number of SNPs identified across the genome to 300 000 {{by the end of}} the first quarter of 2001. Changes in non-coding sequence and synonymous changes in coding sequence are generally more common than non-synonymous changes, reflecting greater selective <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> diversity at positions dictating amino acid identity. Transitional changes are more common than transversions, with CpG dinucleotides showing the highest mutation rate, presumably due to deamination.|$|E
25|$|Wetsuits {{are limited}} {{in their ability to}} {{preserve}} warmth by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, the suit is compressed by the ambient <b>pressure,</b> <b>reducing</b> effectiveness at depth, and the insulating neoprene can only be made to a certain thickness before it becomes impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7mm, 5mm, 3mm, and 1mm. A 1mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of neoprene, to put the most thickness where it will be most effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of neoprene are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and are more suitable for wetsuits for non-diving purposes as they will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they are more comfortable for surface sports because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.|$|E

2500|$|The SFR reactor {{concept is}} cooled by liquid sodium and {{fueled by a}} {{metallic}} alloy of uranium and plutonium or spent nuclear fuel, the [...] "nuclear waste" [...] of light water reactors. The SFR fuel is contained in steel cladding with liquid sodium filling {{in the space between}} the clad elements which make up the fuel assembly. One of the design challenges of an SFR is the risks of handling sodium, which reacts explosively if it comes into contact with water. However, the use of liquid metal instead of water as coolant allows the system to work at atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> <b>reducing</b> the risk of leakage.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, HBOT was {{developed}} {{as a treatment for}} diving disorders involving bubbles of gas in the tissues, such as decompression sickness and gas embolism, It is still considered the definitive treatment for these conditions. The chamber treats decompression sickness and gas embolism by increasing <b>pressure,</b> <b>reducing</b> the size of the gas bubbles and improving the transport of blood to downstream tissues. The high concentrations of oxygen in the tissues are beneficial in keeping oxygen-starved tissues alive, and have the effect of removing the nitrogen from the bubble, making it smaller until it consists only of oxygen, which is re-absorbed into the body. [...] After elimination of bubbles, the pressure is gradually reduced back to atmospheric levels. [...] Hyperbaric chambers are also used for animals, especially race horses where a recovery is worth a great deal to their owners. [...] It is also used to treat dogs and cats in pre- and post-surgery treatment to strengthen their systems prior to surgery and then accelerate healing post surgery.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{electricity}} generation from water pipelines was rare because {{the water would}} have been pumped by other engines in the system prior to the intake of water turbines to generate electricity.

If the process pressure is insufficient to allow a sample stream to flow by itself to the analyser, a small pump may be used to move it there. The temperature of a hot sample may be lowered by use of an online sample cooler. The sampling and analysis can be done at the command of an operator, periodically (for example, every 15 minutes), or continuously - providing an analysis result vs. time graph on a chart recorder, computer, or other device. For periodic sampling, valves (or other devices) can be switched open to allow a fluid sample stream to flow to the analyser and shut when not sampling.|$|E
