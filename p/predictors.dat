A TAGE <b>predictor</b> [4] constitutes {{the core of the}} ISL-TAGE <b>predictor.</b> The TAGE <b>predictor</b> (Section 2) captures most of the correlation on the branch outcomes for very long histories. But sometimes TAGE fails to predict loops with constant number of iterations. The loop <b>predictor</b> (Section 3) is used to predict these loops. TAGE also fails to predict branches that are not strongly correlated, but only statistically biased. The Statistical Corrector <b>predictor</b> (Section 4) is in in charge of tracking these statistically correlated branches that are not correctly predicted by the TAGE <b>predictor.</b> The TAGE <b>predictor</b> must be updated at retire time to avoid pollution by the wrong path; this delayed update induces extra mispredictions compared with an optimistic at fetch time update.

40|$|Abstract: Branch {{prediction}} in simultaneous multithreaded processors {{is difficult}} because multiple independent threads interfere with shared prediction resources. We evaluate the prediction accuracy of four branch <b>predictor</b> configurations: 1) a totally shared <b>predictor,</b> 2) a completely split <b>predictor,</b> 3) a <b>predictor</b> with a shared history and split BHT, and 4) a <b>predictor</b> with a shared BHT and separate history registers, each for two static prediction schemes, a generic 2 -bit <b>predictor,</b> a Gshare <b>predictor,</b> and a YAGS <b>predictor.</b> We simulate each combination listed with four threads executing a different benchmark and with each thread executing the same code. We conclude that for an execution with unique threads, separating the branch history register for each thread allows for higher prediction accuracy by eliminating the negative aliasing between threads. Surprisingly, this splitting of <b>predictor</b> resources still performs better than a shared <b>predictor</b> even when each thread is running the same code. This study demonstrates that allotting each thread its own history register to access a shared <b>predictor</b> table gives performance close {{to that of a}} totally split <b>predictor</b> while using significantly less resources. Overall system performance, as measured in CPI, is only marginally affected by branch prediction accuracy in a multithreaded environment because threadlevel parallelism allows for the hiding of long latency hazards, such as branch mispredicts. As such, we feel that branch prediction accuracy is not of peak importance when running multithreaded applications and that valuable development time and chip resources should be spent on other issues...|$|R
