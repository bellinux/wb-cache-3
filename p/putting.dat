40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae can utilize {{high quality}} (e. g. {{glutamine}} and ammonia) {{as well as}} low quality (e. g. γ-amino butyric acid and proline) nitrogen sources. The transcriptional activator <b>Put</b> 3 p allows yeast cells to utilize proline as a nitrogen source through expression of the <b>PUT</b> 1 and <b>PUT</b> 2 genes. <b>Put</b> 3 p activates high level transcription of these genes by binding proline directly. However, <b>Put</b> 3 p also responds to other lower quality nitrogen sources. As nitrogen quality decreases, <b>Put</b> 3 p exhibits an increase in phosphorylation concurrent {{with an increase in}} <b>PUT</b> gene expression. The proline-independent activation of the <b>PUT</b> genes requires both <b>Put</b> 3 p and the positively acting GATA factors, Gln 3 p and Gat 1 p. Conversely, the phosphorylation of <b>Put</b> 3 p is not dependent on GATA factor activity. Here, we find that the mutation of <b>Put</b> 3 p at amino acid Tyr- 788 modulates the proline-independent activation of <b>PUT</b> 1 through Gat 1 p. The phosphorylation of <b>Put</b> 3 p appears to influence the association of Gat 1 p, but not Gln 3 p, to the <b>PUT</b> 1 promoter. Combined, our findings suggest that this may represent a mechanism through which yeast cells rapidly adapt to use proline as a nitrogen source under nitrogen limiting conditions...|$|R
