40|$|The {{present study}} proposes a new fine-positioning {{mechanism}} with piezoelectric actuators and a fine-positioning method for this mechanism. We realized a long stroke path and an ultraprecision <b>positioning</b> simultaneously {{with a single}} apparatus. A <b>positioning</b> apparatus with a fine-positioning mechanism attached to the displacement extension mechanism was developed. Actuators were used sequentially for the extension mechanism and the reduction mechanism. Fine <b>positioning</b> is obtained with cooperative <b>positioning</b> that is performed by combining extended displacement <b>positioning</b> and reduced displacement <b>positioning.</b> As a fundamental experiment, the <b>positioning</b> characteristics of extended displacement <b>positioning</b> and reduced displacement <b>positioning</b> were examined individually. A value of 4. 63 times the displacement magnification in extended displacement <b>positioning</b> and a value of 0. 19 times the displacement magnification in reduced displacement <b>positioning</b> were obtained in comparison with displacement of an actuator unit alone. Cooperative <b>positioning</b> using displacement feedback with PI control was then examined. As a result, even though the stroke was extended, high-resolution <b>positioning</b> was realized simultaneously. In addition, {{under the condition that}} the overshoot is not allowed, shortening at the settling time in comparison with only the extended displacement <b>positioning</b> was confirmed...|$|R

30|$|It is {{observed}} that 23 <b>positions</b> have a precision of 100 % in both cases.

30|$|Figure  7 {{shows the}} robot arm <b>positioning</b> error at {{different}} model placement angles. According {{to the visual}} robot’s <b>positioning</b> error for different angles of different models, this paper calculates the <b>positioning</b> error of visual robots for different models. The average <b>positioning</b> error of the regular quadrilateral is 0.86  mm, the average <b>positioning</b> error of the circular shape is 0.8  mm, and the average <b>positioning</b> errors for the triangle and the hexagon are 0.93  mm and 1.27  mm, respectively. The data {{results show that the}} robot system will produce different <b>positioning</b> errors for different shape models. The mean value of the <b>positioning</b> error of the visual robot for the regular quadrilateral and the circle is significantly smaller than the mean value of the <b>positioning</b> error for the triangle and the hexagon. Therefore, the use of a regular quadrilateral and circular model with low <b>positioning</b> error rate can improve the accuracy of <b>positioning.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Brand <b>positioning</b> is {{essential}} for brand differentiation and building brand equity. Obtaining and sustaining competitive advantage through brand <b>positioning</b> is a complex process {{in the context of}} increasing competition and complicated consumers. However, many <b>positioning</b> strategies are prone to follow similar pitfalls by aligning to market tendencies and thus failing to provide significant brand differentiation. This paper analyzes new <b>positioning</b> strategies for gaining sustainable competitive advantage. By using anti-market reactions such as transformation, subtraction and division, companies are able to build effective <b>positioning</b> strategies by making the problem of competition irrelevant. We relate these new <b>positioning</b> strategies to the classic <b>positioning</b> process and identify the key elements which make them successful. We describe the value proposition of new <b>positioning</b> strategies from the means-end theory perspective. Finally, the managerial implications of new <b>positioning</b> strategies are reviewed. We suggest directions for effective <b>positioning</b> and propose avenues for future <b>positioning</b> research...|$|R
50|$|<b>Positioning</b> is {{the final}} stage in the ‘STP’ process and focuses on how the {{customer}} ultimately views your product or service in comparison to your competitors and is important in gaining a competitive advantage in the market. Therefore, customer perceptions have {{a huge impact on}} the brands <b>positioning</b> in the market. There are three types of <b>positioning</b> that are key in <b>positioning</b> the brand to a competitive advantage; these are Functional <b>Positioning,</b> Symbolic <b>Positioning,</b> and Experiential <b>positioning.</b> Functional <b>Positioning</b> is focused on the aspects of the products or services that can fulfill consumers’ needs or desires. Symbolic <b>Positioning</b> is based on the characteristics of the brand that fulfill customers’ self-esteem. Experiential <b>positioning</b> is based around the characteristics of the brands that stimulate the sensory or emotional connection with the customers. A combination of the three is key to <b>positioning</b> the brand at a competitive advantage to its immediate competition. Overall, <b>positioning</b> should provide better value than competitors and communicate this differentiation in an effective way to the consumer.|$|R
