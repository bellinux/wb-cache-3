The agricultural subsidies are decoupled from the actual production and replaced by the so-called payment entitlements. A <b>payment</b> <b>entitlement</b> has a farm specific value and may be freely traded. This paper discusses the complexity of this new market and suggests an auction that simplifies the complexity. The suggested auction allows a buyer to simultaneously bid on all payment entitlements. The prices are found by a tatonnement that monotonically approximates the equilibrium prices for {{the different types of}} payment entitlements for sale.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) A {{significant}} new direction in Australian income support policy {{was introduced in}} 2002. Known as Australians Working Together, this development changed the basis of social security entitlement for parents. Throughout most of the twentieth century, low-income sole mothers, and later sole fathers and parents in couple families, could claim income support throughout most of their children’s school years. The primary grounds for their entitlement were low income and parenting responsibilities. Australians Working Together introduced compulsory employment-oriented activities to Parenting <b>Payment</b> <b>entitlement</b> for parents whose youngest child had turned 13. This thesis investigates mothers’ experience of this new welfare system. Using Dorothy Smith’s ‘everyday life’ approach to research, it draws upon qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse Australians Working Together. The research is grounded in a longitudinal interview survey of Australian mothers of teenage children who were subject to these changes. The analysis moves from their experience outwards through the four levels of analysis in Williams and Popay’s welfare research framework. The thesis examines mothers’ day-to-day worlds, the opportunities and constraints they navigate, the policies and institutions which shape their opportunities, the political framing of those policies, and wider social and economic transformations. In their negotiation {{of the social security}} system, mothers are striving for recognition of autonomy and care. They want their capacity to determine for themselves how to live their lives to be acknowledged. They would like the social contributions they make through employment, education and voluntary work to be recognised. They struggle for their unpaid work caring for their families to be valued. They wish that they had sufficient material resources to care well for their families. The thesis develops a theoretical framework to examine these struggles drawing on the work of Honneth, Fraser, Lister, Sennett, Fisher and Tronto, Daly and Lewis. This multi-level, everyday life analysis reveals the possibility of reframing the social security system around mutual respect...|$|E

The following paper shows the results of an analysis of the market for <b>payment</b> <b>entitlements</b> in Germany between 2005 and June 2007.

A closer look at the figures reveals that despite a large difference in the face value of the entitlements, the entitlements are rarely traded in order to optimize farm budget. In most cases, trade of entitlements is directly linked to farm or land transfer. As a consequence, the overwhelming majority of trade takes place on the local level with very little redistribution of direct payments on a regional level being observed. Differences between the thirteen German trading regions with respect to observed trade patterns are quite small. Fischler Reform, SFP, Decoupling, Q 180,...|$|R

Indeed, the empirical analysis {{has shown that the}} amount of DP does also vary over time at individual farm level because of several reasons. Because some DP are coupled to production, DP vary yearly according to production choices. <b>Payment</b> <b>entitlements</b> own by a farmer generate DP only if he/she declares an equivalent number of eligible hectares; thus, changes in land availability can push the amount of eligible land below the amount of own entitlements reducing the overall amount of DP received.

Farmers may receive part of the expected DP in the following year because of administrative or legal problems that delay the payment.

40|$|Land dual {{values are}} one of the {{important}} aspects of the results of mathematical programming models used to evaluate the impact of agricultural policy measures at regional and farm level. When the decoupling of direct payments and the <b>payment</b> <b>entitlements</b> per hectare are included in PMP models {{in the context of the}} Single Payment Scheme (SPS), the analysis of the land dual values is more complex than in models which do not take these aspects into account. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the land dual values when the SPS is included in PMP farm models. This theoretical analysis is carried out for the base year (linear model) and for a simulated year (quadratic model). The results of this analysis are illustrated by comparing numerically the land opportunity costs obtained in the case of partial decoupling and in the case of full decoupling of direct payments.

The aim of current research is to simulate the impact of a flat rate system (equal payments per hectare of cultivated land) compared to the current historical system (payments based on individual historic entitlements). Impact on production and income of arable, dairy and cattle farms of two different flat rate scenario's, is assessed with a farm-based sector model for Flanders. The model maximizes income at farm level, calibrated to observed farming behavior in 2001 - 2003. Farm data can be selected by farm type, size and region, simulations could be run for specific sub sectors, size classes or regions.

40|$|In 2001, Germany faced slower {{economic}} growth than {{at almost any}} time since reunification. The German economy was the world’s third largest, after the United States and Japan, and accounted for about one-third of Europe’s gross domestic product (GDP). The growth rate of real GDP was about 1. 5 % compared with 3. 0 % in 2000. The decrease stemmed from poor performance in the construction sector combined with sluggish consumer spending and a global downturn in technology sectors. Also, persistent high unemployment, high outstanding Government debt, an increased share of Government revenues that went for debt service payments, and growing social security and nonwage labor costs contributed to the problem.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer the {{research}} question: is the allocation of resources to insolvent company employees in Australia consistent with Rawlsian distributive justice? The analysis of the research question comprises two components: first, the allocation of resources to insolvent company employees that is required by Rawlsian distributive justice and second, whether Australian law is consistent with that allocation. This thesis focuses on four particular areas of Australian law: the priority regime that is applicable when an insolvent company’s assets are distributed to creditors, director and related company liability for employee entitlements, the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) and the procedure for corporate and business rescue contained in Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Employees are among the least advantaged persons {{in the event of}} corporate insolvency. According to Rawlsian distributive justice, resources must therefore be reallocated to ensure greater equality between employees and other persons ‘affected’ by corporate insolvency, including secured creditors, quasi-secured creditors, consumers, shareholders, insolvency practitioners, directors and taxpayers. However, Rawls’s ‘difference principle’ permits inequalities between employees and other persons affected by corporate insolvency if those inequalities contribute to achieving the greatest benefit of employees, for example as a result of job maintenance or the <b>payment</b> of employee <b>entitlements.</b> The priority regime is broadly consistent with the Rawlsian objective of ensuring the greatest benefit of the least advantaged employees. Although employee entitlements receive only partial priority over the claims of secured creditors and are subordinated to the claims of quasi-secured creditors and insolvency practitioners, the better prospects of secured creditors, quasi-secured creditors and insolvency practitioners satisfy Rawls’s difference principle because they are likely to preserve employment and the <b>payment</b> of employee <b>entitlements</b> in the ordinary course of business, thus contributing to the greatest benefit of employees. Director and related company liability for employee entitlements is likely to be beneficial for employees only in circumstances where directors and related companies engage in improper behaviour in relation to the <b>payment</b> of <b>entitlements.</b> Liability outside those circumstances is likely to jeopardise employment and the <b>payment</b> of employee <b>entitlements.</b> However, existing Australian law does not adequately provide for director and related company liability in circumstances of improper behaviour. Amendments to director and related company liability for employee entitlements in Part 5. 8 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), including the replacement of the test of subjective intention with an objective test, are likely to contribute to the greatest benefit of employees, thus ensuring greater consistency with the Rawlsian framework. In certain respects, GEERS is consistent with Rawlsian distributive justice. For example, GEERS reduces inequalities between employees and taxpayers; operates in conjunction with the employee priority regime and director and related company for employee entitlements, thus facilitating the equal sharing of resources among claimants; and effectively differentiates between the relative levels of disadvantage faced by individual employees in the event of corporate insolvency. However, the limitation of GEERS to liquidation and the restriction on claimable wages pursuant to GEERS compromise the Rawlsian objective of ensuring the greatest benefit of employees. The corporate and business rescue procedure contained in Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) facilitates sustained employment and the preservation of employee entitlements, thus contributing to the greatest benefit of employees. Additionally, Part 5. 3 A does not encourage ‘hopeless’ rescue attempts and does not override the interests of secured and quasi-secured creditors, thus avoiding outcomes that may otherwise compromise the greatest benefit of employees. However, the ability of substantial charge holders to remain outside a Part 5. 3 A corporate or business rescue attempt is likely to adversely affect the interests of employees, thus implementing greater protection for secured creditors than is required to satisfy Rawls’s difference principle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of tradable and non-tradable single farm <b>payment</b> (SFP) <b>entitlements</b> for farm successors on structural change and the lease market. Using the example of Swiss agriculture, the effects on rental-price trends and farm-exit rates are investigated. An ex-ante normative impact analysis is performed with the agent-based agricultural-sector model SWISSland, which simulates structural change processes and income trends in Swiss agriculture {{over a period of}} up to 15 years. A land market implemented at municipality level simulates the plot-by-plot leasing of land to surrounding neighbouring agents that is common in Switzerland. Allocation of plots to tenants as well as lease pricing is modelled taking into account the farm-specific land rents. The results show that personalised SFP entitlements which could not be transferred to a farm successor not only cause an intensification of structural change, but would also thus lead to a substantial reduction in rental prices. SFP entitlements which were successfully transferred to farm successors have only a slight impact on structural change and the rental prices of arable land.

40|$|Little {{work has}} {{considered}} explicitly {{the role of}} farm tenancy in influencing the uptake (or not) of diversification activities. The need to examine this link has been heightened because of the 2003 CAP reforms and the decision to tie Single Farm <b>Payment</b> (SFP) <b>entitlement</b> to the land rather than what is produced on that land. The main objective of this paper, therefore, {{is to examine the}} nature of diversification activities on tenant farms in England, which includes a consideration of how the introduction of the SFP and other CAP reforms may influence such restructuring processes. Results from a national postal survey, supported by tenant farmer/landlord interviews and a workshop, reveal high rates of farm diversification on farms with tenanted land. However, if one takes away contract/hire services the rate of diversification on tenant farms is much less. Tenant farms appear to favour more ‘traditional’ diversification activities and the results also demonstrate an increasing need to move towards more ‘encultured’ definitions of farm diversification. The second key finding to emerge from the research relates to the high levels of uncertainty and negativity surrounding the potential impacts of the CAP reforms, and SFP in particular, on farm business behaviour. Tenant farmers were more concerned about levels of SFP and entitlement than future investment decisions, including diversification...|$|R
40|$|In {{presenting}} {{the outcome of}} the final round of negotiations on CAP reform at a press conference on June 26 th 2003, the EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler claimed that the EU had 'largely said goodbye to an old system of support which distorted trade' and he maintained that the new system would be more 'trade friendly', and would put the EU 'on the offensive at the WTO negotiations in Cancun in September', with the EU looking for 'something in return' for the concessions they will now be able to make. He acknowledged that the reform was a compromise but maintained that it was 'an acceptable one', and claimed that the new system would no longer promote overproduction so that the trade-distorting effects of EU policies would be substantially reduced. In a speech to the European Parliament on July 9 th 2003, Commissioner Fischler sought to evaluate the final agreement on CAP reform. He began by reiterating the objectives of reform, namely to: make a substantial contribution to stabilising farmers' incomes {{and at the same time}} to diversifying their farming activities; promote healthy and better quality foods, produced under environmentally sound production methods, which respected animal welfare; improve the public image of agricultural-support programmes. He then set out the reforms agreed, namely: a multiple-choice system for the introduction of the single farm payment scheme from January 2005 (with exceptions upon justified request until 2007); the introduction of flexibility without distorting competition; the linkage of the single farm payments scheme to compliance with a range of standards (cross compliance); the use of the 2000 - 2002 <b>payment</b> <b>entitlements</b> as the basis for calculating the single decoupled farm payment. The introduction of decoupling alongside specific sector reforms will it is argued 'strengthen the EU's negotiating hand in the WTO Ministerial conference in Cancun in September'. Commissioner Fischler maintained that the EU is now well placed to reach agreement in Cancun and that it is now up to other countries to match the EU's concessions. Comment: The claim that the reform will lead to less trade distortion is only justified in a highly relative context, as the reference point for the claim is the level which EU production would have attained by 2009 were existing policies to be pursued until then. If this reference point is used then EU production levels post-reform in most major commodities subject to reform will be lower than in the scenario without reform. However, if the point of reference is current levels of EU production then post-reform EU production will be higher, but at prices that will be much lower than those currently prevailing. This will enable the EU to clear its markets more easily without recourse to WTO-restricted trade instruments. EU claims to the effect that the new policy will be less trade distorting thus need to be subjected to close and critical scrutiny.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} a newly extended {{version of the}} dynamic micro simulation model SADNAP (Social Affairs Department of the Netherlands Ageing and Pensions model). SADNAP is being developed for calculating the financial and economic implications of the ageing {{of the population and}} of the ageing-related policy measures that are being proposed to cope with ageing. The model uses administrative datasets of Dutch public pension <b>payments</b> and <b>entitlements</b> for both public and private pensions. SADNAP has already been in use since 2007 for forecasting the state pension expenditures and for analysing the budgetary effects of policy changes. The model has been extended in order to give a broader assessment of policy alternatives by providing insight into other important evaluation indicators like income redistribution and the retirement decision of workers. For the modelling of income redistribution a new micro data source with individual data on private pensions is combined with differentiation of mortality rates in order to gain a better insight in the income at the individual level within the population of pensioners. For the modelling of the retirement decision an option value model is developed in which key parameters vary at the individual level in order to benefit from the micro simulation approach. These extensions greatly enhance the performance of SADNAP. Besides the financial implications, additional insight can now be provided into the effects of policy measures on a set of key indicators. In this paper both extensions are described in detail and a complete baseline projection of all key indicators is discussed...|$|R
