50|$|To easily {{understand}} the concept of an <b>isolation</b> <b>valve,</b> one can think of the valves under a kitchen or bathroom sink in a typical household. These valves are normally left open so that the user can control the flow of water with the spigot above the sink, and does not need to reach under the counter to start or stop the water flow. However, if the spigot needs to be replaced (i.e. maintenance needs to take place on the <b>system),</b> the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> are shut to stop the flow of water when the spigot is removed. In this <b>system,</b> the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> and the spigot may even be the same type of valve.

The information collected by the staff was provided to the INEEL analysts. System Description Figure 1 is a simplified drawing of the system.

In the case of prolonged loss of SFPC system or loss of inventory events, the inventory in the pool can be made up using firewater system.

40|$|AbstractLaunch {{vehicles}} will impart {{high levels of}} vibration to satellite during launch. Whole-spacecraft vibration isolation is a better choice to reduce the magnitude of launch dynamic loads. In this paper, active vibration isolation technology based on predictive control for whole-spacecraft vibration isolation is studied. Considering the special environment of the rocket, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>system</b> is applied. In order to improve the dynamic characteristics of the <b>isolation</b> <b>system,</b> a cascade control with double loop structure and predictive control algorithm for pressure tracking control of inner loop are proposed. A <b>pneumatic</b> servo <b>system</b> exhibits strong nonlinearity. To resolve this problem, the control method of multi-models combined with MPC is put forward and applied in this paper, where piecewise linear models, on which controllers are built, are obtained by integrating the models with data at the work points. To enhance the tracking speed, a strategy of switching ahead is proposed, whose feasibility and effectiveness are proved by experiments. In addition, by resetting the predictive horizon and the weighting matrices of the MPC algorithm, influences of the considerable time delay, which {{is caused by a}} long pipeline, on the control system performance are effectively suppressed. With these newly proposed approaches, the pressure tracking performance is significantly improved. Thus with this design, the real-time pressure tracking can be guaranteed and so that the active control system can work at higher frequency range.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from American Society of Civil Engineers via the DOI in this record. <b>Isolation</b> <b>valves</b> are crucial components of water distribution systems for separating pipe segments from the network for repair or maintenance purpose. This paper looks at the impacts of <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> failure on the three indictors including number of valves that are needed to isolate a distribution system segment, the size of distribution system segments and the shortfall in meeting demands during failure. A network with various <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> configurations {{in terms of the}} density of valves is used as a case study. The results obtained from the case study show that the failure of an <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> has substantially varying impacts on system performance during a shutdown. The density of valves in the network determines impacts of inoperable valves on a shutdown. Generally speaking, a higher density of <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> leads to the less impact of valve failure. Finally, several conclusions drawn from the critical valve analysis in this study could be applied to guide the <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> maintenance and management.

This TS amendment clarifies a potential source of confusion introduced into the TS during the conversion to the Improved Technical Specifications (ITS).
