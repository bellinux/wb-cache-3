5|$|As Josephine {{continued}} east-northeastward, it had weakened {{back into}} a tropical storm. Under the influence of an area of high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a cyclonic loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the cyclonic loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October18. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged with a broad mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October19. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward and moved in that direction until it became unidentifiable on October21.|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium forms a {{wide range}} {{compounds}} with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis. Ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl converts {{in the absence of}} CO <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dark red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Dyson swarm, the {{constructs}} {{making it up}} are not in orbit around the star, but would be statitesâ€”satellites suspended by use of enormous light sails using radiation pressure to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs {{would not be in}} danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E
5|$|By early August14, the shear had {{substantially}} {{disrupted the}} storm, leaving the low-level center of circulation exposed {{from the area}} of convection, which was also deteriorating. After meandering, the storm began to move westward. Forecasters expected it to resume a northwestward track as high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of Bermuda was forecast to weaken and another high was predicted to form southwest of the Azores. By 1800UTC on August14, the strong shear had further weakened the storm, and it no longer met the criteria for a tropical cyclone. It degenerated into a remnant low, and the National Hurricane Center issued their final advisory on the cyclone. Moving westward, it occasionally produced bursts of convective activity, before dissipating on August18.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{generally}} westward, Dean {{continued to}} gradually intensify {{and became a}} hurricane on August 2 after an Air Force reconnaissance flight had recorded hurricane-force winds. The following day a decreasing ridge of high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and a trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States caused Dean to slow in its forward motion and turn northwest. The trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States was deepening, causing Dean to curve northward while remaining nearly stationary. After remaining nearly stationary, Dean began to accelerate to a forward speed of 17mph (28km/h) as it headed toward Bermuda. Thereafter, Dean intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, whilst {{the eastern half of}} the eyewall brushed Bermuda. Dean continued to intensify slightly after passing the island of Bermuda and became a Category 2 hurricane on August 7. While Dean was a Category 2 hurricane, it attained its peak intensity with winds of 105mph (165km/h) and a minimum pressure of 968mbar (hPa; 28.59inHg).|$|E
5|$|Developing as a {{tropical}} depression near Nassau in the Bahamas on September 12, Felice had {{its origins in}} a persistent upper-level trough over the area. The nascent depression tracked slowly toward the west-southwest without much intensification, ultimately passing just north of Key West, Florida as it entered the Gulf of Mexico. Over the open waters of the Gulf, the system accelerated toward the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a large ridge of high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. While reconnaissance aircraft data on the storm suggested that the depression strengthened into {{a tropical}} storm midday on September 14, the official Atlantic tropical cyclone database known as HURDAT indicates the disturbance attained tropical storm status at 0000 UTC on September 15.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August18. Shortly after, the system became embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. By August23, the system began to intensify while convective activity become consolidated around the center of circulation. By 0600UTC on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the wave spawned Tropical Depression Eight roughly 965miles (1,555km) east of Barbados. A weak ridge of high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the depression led to a general westward movement of the system. Gradually strengthening, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm early on August25, at which time it was given the name Gustav.|$|E

5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni was a {{damaging}} {{tropical cyclone}} that impacted the island nations of Tuvalu and Fiji. It was first noted within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{at the start}} of December 1992, as a shallow tropical depression {{in the vicinity of the}} island nation Tuvalu. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it affected Tuvalu, before it was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Joni by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 7. Over the next couple of days the system intensified further as it was steered south-westwards and posed a threat towards the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The system subsequently peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale as it approached the Fijian Islands during December 10. Over the next couple of days the system moved through the Fijian Islands, before it became an extratropical cyclone during December 13. The system was last noted during the next day as it was absorbed by a mid-latitude trough of low <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Lua {{affected}} a {{sparsely populated}} region of Western Australia during mid-March 2012. Originating {{in a broad}} low pressure area that formed northwest of Australia by 8 March, the storm was plagued by inhibiting wind shear {{for the duration of}} its formative stages. However, it gradually organised, and received the name Lua on 13 March. The cyclone meandered for the first several days of its existence, caught between weak and competing steering currents. After the cyclone drifted northwestward, a building ridge of high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north drove Lua southeastward toward the Pilbara region. Ultimately intensifying into an upper-end Category 3 severe tropical cyclone with maximum sustained 10-minute winds of 155km/h (100mph), Lua made landfall near the remote community of Pardoo, about 150km (95mi) east of Port Hedland. It steadily weakened as it progressed south over interior Western Australia, diminishing below tropical cyclone status on 18 March.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might {{be on the verge of}} transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E
5|$|Steered by {{currents}} {{from an area}} of high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, {{the storm}} began to drift northwestward and rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Gulf. It executed a tight counterclockwise loop, and continued to mature; on October 16 it reached peaked winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar (hPa; 27.29 inHg). The hurricane turned northeastward, again approaching western Cuba, and began to accelerate towards the Florida Peninsula on October 17. Its center passed west of Key West and made landfall near Cape Romano. The storm moved due north for a time as it moved inland, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. From northeastern Florida, the cyclone curved northeastward and hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeast United States before heading out to sea. The storm is estimated to have dissipated on October 23.|$|E
