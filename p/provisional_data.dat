40|$|Timeliness is {{considered}} one of the various aspects on which quality of statistical data should be founded in addition to exhaustiveness, coherence, comparability, low cost and degree of discrepancy respect to true data (EUROSTAT, 2000). However, there is an obvious trade/off between timeliness and overall quality, when intended, as commonly done in practice, in terms of precision of estimates. This problem, even though widely faced in literature, should be carefully monitored in each specific contest concerning short-term indicators production. One solution consists in building up a statistical system able to calculate and spread out both definitive and <b>provisional</b> quick <b>data.</b> At the moment, the retail trade index represents the only monthly economic output indicator on the service sector currently calculated and spread out by ISTAT, with a delay of about 54 days from the end of the reference month, considered too large by many users.
