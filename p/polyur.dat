40|$|This report deals {{only with}} the boardstock foams. It {{summarizes}} the key findings {{of the project and}} refers to other publications issued during the course of work. Research on sprayed polyurethane foam has already been presented in two reports: "Report on sprayed polyurethane foam with alternative BAS" published by the Polyurethane Division of the Society of Plastics Industry lnc. in 1989 and "Report on factors affecting the field performance of spray applied thermal insulating foams" published in 1993 by the Polyurethane Foam Contractors Division of the SPI Inc. Ce rapport traite uniquement des mousses de p 2 te m 9 canique pour cartons. On y r 9 sume les conclusions principales du projet et renvoie le lecteur 0 d?autres publications parues au cours de ces travaux.

40|$|A {{simple method}} has been {{developed}} that allows the rapid Isolat ion and Ident i f i ca t ion of highly resolved mRNA molecules. RNA species are separated by gel electrophoresis and then blotted on to a paper sheet to which <b>polyur</b> idyl ic add has been covalently bound. This mRNA a f f i n i t y paper ("mAP") speci f ica l ly binds, 1 n a reversible manner, polyA+ containing molecules. A replica picture of the agarose gel 1 s thus obtained on the mAP, from which bound mRNA molecules can be eluted by heating 1 n water. In addit ion to their simple Isolat ion Individual mRNA species, whi lst s t i l l bound to mAP, can be Ident i f ied by both " 1 n-s 1 tu hybridization and translation...|$|E
