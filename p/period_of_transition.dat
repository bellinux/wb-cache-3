5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who first {{presented}} it to Osama bin Laden in 1996. At that time, bin Laden and al-Qaeda were in a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition,</b> having just relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan. The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point, as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} governing {{institutions of}} medieval Birmingham – including the Guild of the Holy Cross and the lordship of the de Birmingham family – collapsed between 1536 and 1547, leaving {{the town with}} an unusually high degree {{of social and economic}} freedom and initiating a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> and growth.

5|$|After {{the failed}} August Coup of 1991 Boris Yeltsin and the Ministry of Finance of the RSFSR claimed {{authority}} over the Ministry of Finance of the USSR, the state bank and the Bank of Foreign Economic Activity. This meant that the institutions could not carry out any orders {{without the consent of}} the RSFSR government. The Ministry of Finance continued functioning until the RSFSR government issued a decree completing its takeover of the Soviet financial system. It was succeeded by the Ministry of Economics and Finance of the Russian Federation (1991) and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (1992). The last Soviet Minister of Finance was Vladimir Yefimovich Orlov, and Vladimir Rayevsky was acting Minister during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's {{emergence}} as title challengers {{put an end}} to Arsenal and Manchester United's domestic duopoly. The London club won back-to-back league titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06 under José Mourinho, at a time when Arsenal and United underwent a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition.</b> Vieira and Keane had left their respective clubs by the end of 2005, while Ferguson came under intense scrutiny over his management. Nevertheless, he guided his team to Premier League success in 2006–07, and won a further four league titles. At Arsenal, Wenger oversaw the club's relocation to the Emirates Stadium and made the decision to prioritise it over strengthening the squad. The club sold several experienced players, replenishing them with younger talent. The 2005 Cup win was their last piece of silverware until 2014.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the 18th century onwards, the garden went through major changes as it fell into neglect. It was painted in 1747 by Canaletto during a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition,</b> as Westminster was being {{transformed}} by the construction of new buildings and roads. By {{the start of}} the 19th century it had been redeveloped as the site for a row of townhouses, some of which were occupied by prime ministers seeking homes near the government buildings nearby. The last remnants of the Privy Garden were destroyed in 1938 during the construction of government offices which now house the Ministry of Defence's headquarters building.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without taking time off, {{he said in an}} interview, he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to nothing, and Morrison's next album was A <b>Period</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transition</b> in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E
5|$|Several signal {{events from}} the 4th to 6th centuries mark the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> {{during which the}} Roman Empire's Greek East and Latin West divided. Constantine I (r. 324–337) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital, and legalised Christianity. Under Theodosius I (r. 379–395), Christianity became the Empire's {{official}} state religion and other religious practices were proscribed. Finally, under the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin. Thus, although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained, modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople, oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture, and characterised by Orthodox Christianity.|$|E

5|$|The 1850s was a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> for the ice trade. The {{industry}} was already quite large: in 1855 around $6–7 million ($118–138 million in 2010 terms) was {{invested in the}} industry in the U.S. and an estimated two million tons (two billion kg) of ice was kept in storage {{at any one time}} in warehouses across the nation. Over the coming decade, however, the focus of the growing trade shifted away from relying upon the international export market in favour of supplying first the growing, eastern cities of the US, and then the rest of the rapidly expanding country.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1894 season, MacLaren {{resigned}} from the bank to play a whole season of cricket. Lancashire {{at the time were}} undergoing a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition,</b> and the captaincy was unsettled: three men captained the county {{in the first part of}} the season. In the absence of other amateurs with county experience who could play regularly, MacLaren was appointed captain. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack observed that MacLaren was young for the position, and largely unproven in cricket, but it supported the decision. After losing his first match in charge, the team improved in the latter part of the season to finish fourth in the Championship. MacLaren finished sixth in the Lancashire averages, and in total scored 1,105 runs at 25.69, but his batting had made little progress since his debut. However, his successful leadership of Lancashire led some press critics to suggest him as a future England captain. At the end of the season, he was a last-minute selection to tour Australia with a team led by Andrew Stoddart.|$|E
5|$|Godley's II ANZAC Corps {{consisted}} of the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions along with the ANZAC Mounted Division, and it took over the defensive duties of the I ANZAC Corps. The two Australian divisions were still relatively raw and Godley oversaw the intensive training of both formations. By the end of May 1916, he considered the divisions to be the equal of the 1st and 2nd Australian divisions, which were by that time on the Western Front. The following month, the divisions of II ANZAC Corps began departing for France. Godley went on leave {{for a short time}} during this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> for his corps. In July, he returned to duty and II ANZAC Corps took over the section of the front line previously occupied by the I ANZAC Corps, near Armentieres. Later that same month, the 5th Division participated in the Battle of Fromelles in support of the neighbouring British XI Corps. It, together with the 4th Division, would later be transferred to the Somme.|$|E

5|$|Manager Bill Nicholson and his {{assistant}} Eddie Baily then began a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> at White Hart Lane– key players such as Danny Blanchflower, John White and Dave Mackay would all leave the club within {{the space of a}} few years and had to be replaced. Greaves remained a consistent goalscorer though, and in the 1963–64 season he scored hat-tricks in victories over Nottingham Forest, Blackpool, Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers. Spurs finished in fourth place, six points behind champions Liverpool, and exited the FA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup at the opening stages. Greaves scored 35 goals in 41 league games to again finish as the division's top scorer. Strike partner Bobby Smith left the club in the summer, though Greaves felt the partnership he went on to form with new signing Alan Gilzean was even more effective.|$|E
5|$|The music {{industry}} {{was in a}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> {{at the time the}} song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded. U.S. copyright laws at the time did not allow music composers to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders or music rolls for player pianos. Edison Records paid popular singers like Harry Macdonough to sing the songs and then sold the recordings without paying any royalties to the composer or publisher of the music. Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. copyright laws. In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators and the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. He also submitted papers with the U.S. State Department asking for an extension of copyright protection outside the United States, especially in Canada and England.|$|E
