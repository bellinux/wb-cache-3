40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} scene classification methods using spatial {{relationship between}} local <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities</b> of each category. Recently, the authors proposed the probability higher-order local autocorrelations (PHLAC) feature. This method uses autocorrelations of local <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities</b> to capture spatial distributions of local <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities</b> of a category. Although PHLAC achieves good recognition accuracies for scene classification, {{we can improve}} the performance further by using crosscorrelation between categories. We extend PHLAC features to crosscorrelations of <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities</b> of other categories. Also, we introduce the subtraction operator for describing another spatial relationship of local <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities,</b> and present vertical/horizontal mask patterns for the spatial layout of auto/crosscorrelations. Since the combination of category index is large, we compress the proposed features by two-dimensional principal component analysis. We confirmed {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed methods using Scene- 15 dataset, and our method exhibited competitive performances to recent methods without using spatial grid informations and even using linear classifiers. ...|$|R
25|$|In Bayesian statistics, one can compute (Bayesian) {{prediction}} intervals {{from the}} <b>posterior</b> <b>probability</b> of the random variable, as a credible interval. In theoretical work, credible intervals are not often {{calculated for the}} prediction of future events, but for inference of parameters – i.e., credible intervals of a parameter, not for the outcomes of the variable itself. However, particularly where applications are concerned with possible extreme values of yet to be observed cases, credible intervals for such values can be of practical importance.|$|E
25|$|Often these {{conditional}} distributions include parameters {{which are}} unknown {{and must be}} estimated from data, sometimes using the maximum likelihood approach. Direct maximization of the likelihood (or of the <b>posterior</b> <b>probability)</b> is often complex when there are unobserved variables. A classical approach to this problem is the expectation-maximization algorithm which alternates computing expected values of the unobserved variables conditional on observed data, with maximizing the complete likelihood (or posterior) assuming that previously computed expected values are correct. Under mild regularity conditions this process converges on maximum likelihood (or maximum posterior) values for parameters.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} method of structural learning uses optimization based search. It requires a scoring function and a search strategy.

A local search strategy makes incremental changes aimed at improving the score of the structure. A global search algorithm like Markov chain Monte Carlo can avoid getting trapped in local minima. Friedman et al. discuss using mutual information between variables and finding a structure that maximizes this.

500|$|However, as {{the number}} of {{sequences}} increases and especially in genome-wide studies that involve many MSAs it is impossible to manually curate all alignments. Furthermore, manual curation is subjective. And finally, even the best expert cannot confidently align the more ambiguous cases of highly diverged sequences. In such cases it is common practice to use automatic procedures to exclude unreliably aligned regions from the MSA. For the purpose of phylogeny reconstruction (see below) the Gblocks program is widely used to remove alignment blocks suspect of low quality, according to various cutoffs on the number of gapped sequences in alignment columns. However, these criteria may excessively filter out regions with insertion/deletion events that may still be aligned reliably, and these regions might be desirable for other purposes such as detection of positive selection. A few alignment algorithms output site-specific scores that allow the selection of high-confidence regions. Such a service was first offered by the SOAP program, which tests the robustness of each column to perturbation in the parameters of the popular alignment program CLUSTALW. The T-Coffee program uses a library of alignments {{in the construction of the}} final MSA, and its output MSA is colored according to confidence scores that reflect the agreement between different alignments in the library regarding each aligned residue. [...] Its extension, [...] : (Transitive Consistency Score), uses T-Coffee libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Another alignment program that can output an MSA with confidence scores is FSA, which uses a statistical model that allows calculation of the uncertainty in the alignment. The HoT (Heads-Or-Tails) score can be used as a measure of site-specific alignment uncertainty due to the existence of multiple co-optimal solutions. The GUIDANCE program calculates a similar site-specific confidence measure based on the robustness of the alignment to uncertainty in the guide tree that is used in progressive alignment programs. An alternative, more statistically justified approach to assess alignment uncertainty is the use of probabilistic evolutionary models for joint estimation of phylogeny and alignment. A Bayesian approach allows calculation of posterior probabilities of estimated phylogeny and alignment, which is a measure of the confidence in these estimates. In this case, a <b>posterior</b> <b>probability</b> can be calculated for each site in the alignment. Such an approach was implemented in the program BAli-Phy.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOwing to the {{exponential}} growth of genome databases, phylogenetic trees are now widely {{used to test}} a variety of evolutionary hypotheses. Nevertheless, computation time burden limits the application of methods such as maximum likelihood nonparametric bootstrap to assess reliability of evolutionary trees. As an alternative, the much faster Bayesian inference of phylogeny, which expresses branch support as <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities,</b> has been introduced. However, marked discrepancies exist between nonparametric bootstrap proportions and Bayesian <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities,</b> leading to difficulties {{in the interpretation of}} sometimes strongly conflicting results. As an attempt to reconcile these two indices of node reliability, we apply the nonparametric bootstrap resampling procedure to the Bayesian approach. The correlation between <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities,</b> bootstrap maximum likelihood percentages, and bootstrapped <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities</b> was studied for eight highly diverse empirical data sets and were also investigated using experimental simulation. Our results show that the relation between <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities</b> and bootstrapped maximum likelihood percentages is highly variable but that very strong correlations always exist when Bayesian node support is estimated on bootstrapped character matrices. Moreover, simulations corroborate empirical observations in suggesting that, being more conservative, the bootstrap approach might be less prone to strongly supporting a false phylogenetic hypothesis. Thus, apparent conflicts in topology recovered by the Bayesian approach were reduced after bootstrapping. Both <b>posterior</b> <b>probabilities</b> and bootstrap supports are of great interest to phylogeny as potential upper and lower bounds of node reliability, but they are surely not interchangeable and cannot be directly compared...|$|R
