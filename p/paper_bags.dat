5|$|For printing, {{the mass}} {{production}} of paper for writing was already well established in China. The papermaking process had been perfected and standardized by the Han dynasty court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121) in 105, {{and was in}} widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century. The Song dynasty was the world's first government in history to issue paper-printed money—the banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi). Toilet paper had been in general use in China since the 6th century, <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> for preserving the flavor of tea leaves by the 7th century, and by the Song dynasty government officials who had done a great service were rewarded by the court with gifts of paper-printed money wrapped in paper envelopes. During the Song dynasty, independent and government sponsored industries were developed {{to meet the needs}} of a growing population that had reached over 100 million. For example, for the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run mints and factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.|$|E
5|$|With {{access to}} wood from the Quantock Hills, {{records show that}} paper making was {{established}} by 1652. In the 15th century, a flour mill was established by the Fulford and Hadley families {{near the mouth of}} the Washford River. By 1587 the Wyndham estate had established a fulling and grist mill to the south west. By 1652, the mill had started to produce paper. In 1846 business partners James Date, William Peach and John Wansbrough bought the business and introduced mechanised-production using a water wheel-powered pulley system. In the 1860s, the factory was converted to steam power and the local harbour was used to import raw materials and export finished goods. Most of the mill was destroyed by fire in 1889 but it was rebuilt and less than ten years later five paper making machines were operating. The mill became the largest manufacturer of <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> in the UK. In 1896, the business became the Wansbrough Paper Company, a limited liability company and is now known as the Wansbrough Paper Mill. With an annual capacity of 180,000 tonnes of product and employing 100 people, it is the UK's largest manufacturer of coreboard, and also produces containerboard, recycled envelope, bag and kraft papers. In December 2015 the paper mill ceased production and closed.|$|E

25|$|A bag is a non-rigid or {{semi-rigid}} container usually made of paper {{which is used}} to hold items or packages. In 1868, Margaret E.

50|$|Although {{breathing}} into a <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> was {{a common}} recommendation for short-term treatment of symptoms of an acute panic attack, it has been criticized as inferior to measured breathing, potentially worsening the panic attack and possibly reducing needed blood oxygen. While the <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> technique increases needed carbon dioxide and so reduces symptoms, it may excessively lower oxygen levels in the blood stream. To make matters worse, several studies show a link between panic attacks and the abrupt increase in CO2 from the <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> method: Use of the <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> method may worsen feelings of panic in patients who might otherwise use measured breathing techniques with success.|$|R

25|$|In 1878, the {{president}} of the Union Paper Bag Co. of Philadelphia called on House, as he had heard that House had developed a machine that was able to make sachel-bottom <b>paper</b> <b>bags.</b> House came up with a folding attachment for their old machines, and although this was satisfactory to a degree, the machines were still old, and were not properly constructed. House then designed new machines.|$|E
25|$|Dry food (8–10% moisture) is {{generally}} made by extrusion cooking under high heat and pressure. Fat may then be sprayed {{on the food}} to increase palatability, and other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall <b>paper</b> <b>bags,</b> sometimes with a plastic film layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.|$|E
25|$|In early April 2016, {{as part of}} an {{initiative}} to become more environmental-friendly, Apple sent an email to employees of Apple Stores that they would begin a transition process with their shopping bags, moving away from the plastic bags that customers get when they buy products in the stores, and switching to <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> with 80% recyclable materials, with the company expecting the transition to happen on April 15. In the email, Apple also wrote that employees should first ask the customer if they want a bag, rather than giving them one without asking.|$|E

50|$|Colorism is not {{a synonym}} to racism as colorism can occur, and often does, within racial and ethnic groups. The brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> test was used in America for black people to be further divided: those lighter than a brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> were allotted some {{privilege}} that those darker were not permitted to. The brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> test and colorism add to the fuel of intersectionality: recognizing the different identities of an individual {{in order to better}} understand one's lived experiences which can be different by race, gender, sexuality, as well as color, amongst other qualities. The brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> test is not used outright today but there are still implications of colorism; for example in media, lighter skin black females are often more sexualized than their darker counterparts.|$|R
25|$|But a key {{fact was}} unknown in 1997, {{and had not}} been {{elicited}} under sworn testimony in which Mulroney had denied business dealings or significant meetings with a business associate: Mulroney later confirmed that he had personally accepted cash payments from his business associate Karlheinz Schreiber, a German-Canadian businessman {{who had been a}} paid broker for Airbus and other companies. The cash changed hands in three secret meetings in hotels in Montreal and New York City, in brown <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> of $1000 bills totaling either $225,000 (according to Mulroney) or $300,000 (according to Schrieber). The payments occurred over an 18-month period, beginning in 1993 when Mulroney had stepped down as Prime Minister but was still a member of Parliament. In 2007, Mulroney stated that he had kept the cash paid in New York in a New York safe deposit box (thus implying that he had not illegally carried it undeclared across the US-Canada border) and in a safe in his Montreal home. The cash payments had not then been declared as income for tax purposes.|$|E

A popcorn machine was added, but broke down in 1965 and was not replaced.

500|$|Canada has a {{long history}} of {{involvement}} with nuclear research, dating back to the pioneering work of Ernest Rutherford at McGill University in 1899. In 1940, George Laurence of the National Research Council (NRC) began experiments in Ottawa to measure neutron capture and nuclear fission in uranium to demonstrate the feasibility of a nuclear reactor. For that purpose, he obtained [...] of uranium dioxide in <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> from the Eldorado Mine at Port Radium in the Northwest Territories. For a neutron moderator, he used carbon in the form of petroleum coke. This was placed with the bags of uranium oxide in a large wooden bin lined with paraffin wax, another neutron moderator. A neutron source was added, and a Geiger counter used to measure radioactivity.|$|E
