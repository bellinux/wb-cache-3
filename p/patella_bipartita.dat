50|$|Bipartite patella, {{also known}} as <b>Patella</b> <b>bipartita</b> is a {{condition}} where the patella, or kneecap, is composed of two separate bones. Instead of fusing together as normally occurs in early childhood, {{the bones of the}} patella remain separated. The condition occurs in approximately 12% of the population and is nine times more likely to occur in males than females. It is often asymptomatic and most commonly diagnosed as an incidental finding, with about 2% of cases becoming symptomatic.|$|E
40|$|Patellofemoral pain {{syndrome}} (PFPS) is {{a common}} and painful musculoskeletal condition that affects physically active young adults. It presents as diffuse anterior or retropatellar knee pain that is aggravated by activities which repetitively load the patellofemoral joint. The etiology of PFPS appears to be multifactorial which includes biomechanical, muscular and overactivity theories. For most patients, a careful history and physical examination are sufficient to make the diagnosis. Treatment can be initiated without imaging. When symptoms continue despite appropriate management, radiological investigation is indicated to exclude pathologies such as osteochondritis dissecans, <b>patella</b> <b>bipartita,</b> and neoplasms. The initial treatment plan must be nonoperative and should include a comprehensive rehabilitation program with temporary activity modifications.
