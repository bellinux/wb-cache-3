40|$|<b>Pterocarpus</b> <b>santalinus</b> L. f. (Red Sanders) is an endemic and {{endangered}} species largely confined to the southern portion of the Eastern Ghats, Andhra Pradesh, India. To understand its ecological and geographic distribution, we used ecological niche modelling (ENM) based on field sample-based distributional information, in relation to climatic and topographic datasets. Before modelling, hierarchical partitioning was used to optimize the choice of variables for better prediction and reliability. We used three ENM approaches, namely GARP, Maxent and BIOCLIM for predicting potential areas of occurrence. The ENM successfully reconstructed key features of the species geographic distribution, mainly in the forest tracts of Chittoor and Kadapa districts. GARP appeared to be more robust in prediction capabilities compared to BIOCLIM. The potential distributional area identified by these models falls mainly in regions not protected and experiencing high anthropogenic pressure owing to economic and medicinal use. The success of this model indicates that ENM-based approaches provide a promising tool for exploring various scenarios useful {{in the study of}} ecology, biogeography and conservation...|$|R

30|$|Pollination {{behavior}} {{is required to}} be studied for conservation and crop improvement programme, as genetic variations are present. Pollination success in plants {{is determined by the}} timing of flowering, anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity (Renata et al. 2006). The results of this study on floral biology and breeding system indicate the reproductive potential of the species for cross pollination, which would limit the production of selfed seeds and as such is likely to maintain the sustainable levels of heterozygosity among the various populations. The results obtained from pollination studies revealed predominant self-incompatibility in this species as there was no fruit set in self-pollinated flowers (Borges et al. 2009). Comparison of all the pollination methods studied revealed the prevalence of cross pollination in this species. The fruit set observations in natural condition was recorded as 2.05 %. Among the different pollination methods tried out more percentage of fruit set was found in manual cross pollination (2.46 %), which was comparable with open pollination (2.28). The geitonogamous pollination method acquired only 0.46 % of fruit set. This bespeaks the high degree of cross pollination in this species, while comparing to self pollination (autogamy and geitonogamy). Similar kind of geitonogamy and xenogamy has been observed in other species of Fabaceae, <b>Pterocarpus</b> <b>santalinus</b> Lf. (Rao and Raju 2002).|$|R
30|$|Green {{synthesis}} {{is one of}} the rapid, reliable, {{and best}} routes for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs).

The formed Ag NPs were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. UV-vis spectra of the aqueous medium containing silver nanoparticles showed a surface plasmon resonance peak at 418 nm. FT-IR analysis was performed to analyze the biomolecules responsible for the reduction of Ag NPs. XRD results confirmed the presence of silver nanoparticles with face-centered cubic structure. The EDX analysis showed the completed inorganic composition of the synthesized Ag NPs. AFM analysis exemplified the results of particle sizes (41 nm). The calculated crystallite sizes are in the range of 20 to 50 nm, and the spherical nature of the Ag NPs was ascertained by SEM. The synthesized Ag NPs exhibited good antibacterial potential against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The zone of inhibition effect of antibacterial activity depends upon the concentration of Ag NPs.|$|R
