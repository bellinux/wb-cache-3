40|$|Abstract: The EFDC {{model is}} applied to predict the flow field of two typical {{circulating}} water body impacted by both <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> current and wind-driven current. The result demonstrates that there exists strong effect between <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> current and wind-driven current. The wind can effectively reduce the area of low velocity zone of <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> current {{as well as the}} power consumption of pump. And the increased high velocity area could better inhibit the algae growth and thus prevents degradation of water quality...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a graphene quantum <b>pump,</b> adiabatically <b>driven</b> by two thin potential barriers vibrating around their equilibrium positions. For the highly doped leads, the pumped current per mode diverges at the Dirac point {{due to the}} more efficient contribution of the evanescent modes in the pumping process. The pumped current shows an oscillatory behavior with an increasing amplitude {{as a function of}} the carrier concentration. This effect is in contrast to the decreasing oscillatory behavior of the similar normal pump. The graphene <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by two vibrating thin barriers operates more efficient than the graphene <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by two oscillating thin barriers.

40|$|In {{the current}} economy {{situation}} companies {{try to reduce}} their expenses. One of the solutions {{is to improve the}} energy efficiency of the processes. It is known that the energy consumption of pumping applications range from 20 up to 50 % of the energy usage in the certain industrial plants operations. Some studies have shown that 30 % to 50 % of energy consumed by pump systems could be saved by changing the pump or the flow control method. The aim of this thesis is to create a mobile measurement system that can calculate a working point position of a <b>pump</b> <b>drive.</b> This information can be used to determine the efficiency of the <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> operation and to develop a solution to bring pump’s efficiency to a maximum possible value. This can allow a great reduction in the <b>pump</b> <b>drive’s</b> life cycle cost. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a brief introduction in the details of <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> operation is given. Methods that can be used in the project are presented. Later, the review of available platforms for the project implementation is given. In the second part of the thesis, components of the project are presented.

30|$|The {{improvement}} in the reliability and availability of the pumping engine components, which {{is a part of}} the general technological progress, has caused that the availability of the 2 [*]×[*] 60 % (2 [*]×[*] 50 %) systems driven with electric motors is only slightly different from the values achieved by the EM 3 [*]×[*] 50 % or BPT 100 %[*]+[*]EM 30 % configurations. On the other hand, the investment expenditures for the EM 2 [*]×[*] 60 % (EM 2 [*]×[*] 50 %) systems are much lower compared to the other two [6]. For these reasons, in many recent constructions of high capacity power units, it was the <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by a frequency-controlled electric motor that was selected, not the <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by the turbine. Despite the electric power losses in the generator, transformer, supply network, frequency converter and motor, this system is sometimes more efficient than the feed <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by a condensing turbine.|$|R

Pulsations in the hydraulic lines were smoothed out {{by a series of}} recuperators; German fighter pilots soon learned that by shooting at the area around roundels painted on the fuselage, two of the three turrets could be disabled, thus the recuperators were repositioned in later models of the Stirling to reduce their vulnerability.|$|R
