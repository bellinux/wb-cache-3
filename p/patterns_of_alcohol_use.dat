Our aim is to assess the influence of genetic variations in the opioid receptor mu 1 on alcohol and tobacco consumption in a Spanish population. 763 unrelated individuals (465 women, 298 men) aged 18 - 85 years were recruited between October 2011 and April 2012.

Individuals were genotyped for three polymorphisms in the opioid receptor mu 1 (OPRM 1) gene, using a TaqMan® protocol. In males, the rs 10485057 polymorphism was associated with total pure ethanol intake and with the risk of being an alcohol consumer.

A population-based survey was conducted in a sample of Metropolitan São Paulo, Brazil, using the GENACIS questionnaire, Gender, Alcohol and Culture: An International Study.

40|$|Alcohol is {{frequently}} co-administered with other psychotropic substances, yet {{little is known}} about <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> in a simultaneous polysubstance context.

In two retrospective self-report studies polysubstance users reported on their simultaneous use of drugs and alcohol. Results revealed that alcohol was commonly co-administered with various abused substances, particularly with psychostimulant drugs that are known to increase dopamine neurotransmission, and there was an identifiable pattern of administration that was characterized by initial alcohol consumption preceding repeated intermingled alcohol-psychostimulant administrations which resulted in alcohol dose escalation. In a third study, the effects of administering the psychostimulant drug nicotine on alcohol intake was directly examined using a double-blind placebo controlled self-administration procedure. Nicotine was found to significantly increase alcohol ingestion. In a final study we examined the effect of decreasing dopamine neurotransmission on alcohol self-administration by using a dietary manipulation that depletes the nutritional precursors to dopamine. This procedure was found to decrease alcohol consumption, an effect that was especially evident in a subset of drinkers thought to be hypersensitive alcohol's ascending limb dopamine effects. Overall findings suggest that alcohol co-administration with psychostimulant drugs affects patterns of alcohol intake and that this {{may be the result of}} an interaction involving dopamine neurotransmission...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{association}} between light drinking and reduced mortality compared to lifetime abstinence is robust. Confounders, such as unhealthy diet, social class, and social isolation, which are associated both with abstaining and with poorer health, {{have made it}} difficult for doctors to assess the meaning of the association, and to know how to respond to individual patients seeking advice on 'drinking for health'. This paper attempts to bring up to date the evidence concerning the confounders. The evidence for a preventive effect is reviewed according to <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> and type <b>of</b> patient. The balance of risk to benefit appears to favour giving medical advice to some patients in middle life with uncontrollable risk factors for coronary heart disease (and probably of ischaemic stroke), who are very infrequent drinkers, to increase slightly the frequency of drinking (not the per session amount) and for some abstainers to consider starting to take alcohol. However, caveats render quite small the number of patients to whom physicians will give this advice. There is also the theoretical risk of a ripple in the population such that more people may move into harmful drinking...|$|R

Methods:a transversal and longitudinal quantitative study carried out between November 2012 and September 2013 in the ED. Medical and nursing students collected blood samples, applied the J section of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and submitted alcohol abusers and dependents to BI. One year after admission, patients were contacted and asked about their <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> and their reasons for any changes. Results:from a sample of 507 patients admitted to the ED for trauma, 348 responded to MINI, 90 (25. 9 %) being abusers and 36 (10. 3 %) dependent on alcohol. Among the abusers, the most frequent cause of injury was motorcycle accident (35. 6 %) and among the dependents it was predominantly interpersonal violence (22. 2 %). Positive blood samples for alcohol were identified in 31. 7 % of the abusers and 53. 1 % of the dependents. One year after trauma, 66 abusers and 31 dependents were contacted, and it was ascertained that 36. 4 % of the abusers and 19. 4 % of the dependents had decreased alcohol consumption. The main reported reason for the reduction was the experienced trauma. Conclusion:the motorcycle accident {{was the most common}} cause of injury.

Results: Prevalence for <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> was 13. 4 % (including current and ever user both). 43 (5. 07 %) of study subjects were current alcohol users and 71 (8. 37 %) were categorized as ever users for <b>alcohol.</b> <b>Alcohol</b> <b>use</b> was found significantly associated with age, sex, socio-economic status, occupation, religion, caste, parental <b>alcohol</b> <b>use,</b> and rural residence. Conclusions: The study documented prevalence, <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and determinants <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> risk behavior. Efforts, targeting the most vulnerable and using Health promotion, health education and behavior change communication as tools, can prove valuable for effective control <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> risk behavior and related mortality/morbidity...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the causes of alcoholism are bio-socio-psycho-faceted. The present of psychological dysfunctions which are subsequently followed by alcohol-use can result in alcoholism (second line causes of alcohol-related problems) [1, 2]. But many studies have failed to recognize the fact that psycho-behavioral <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> people (without any psychological dysfunctions) can lead to <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> and maybe subsequently, alcohol related problems. Stacy and coauthors have noted that cognitive motivations of a person might be necessary for many behavioral patterns (drug or <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> etc). The expected consequences and perception determine whether the individual starts to <b>use</b> <b>alcohol</b> or not, regularly or misuse it, consequently leading to alcohol problems or not. Expectations and motives are the proximal factors in <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> [2 - 4]. Many theories have been used to explain the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> in the society. The self-effectiveness and motivational theories have been widely used to explain why people <b>use</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Alcohol users are mostly affected by the motives they prefer. For example, social factors are mostly associated with <b>alcohol</b> misuse. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>use</b> to reduce stress is associated with solitary drinking [3, 4] [5]. As in many other countries, <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> is a major public health problem in Belarus. The aim of this survey was to unravel the psycho-behavioral <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> young people towards alcohol-use and to identify the major first-line causes <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> related problems among young adults in Belarus.
