The compounds were identified by conventional spectroscopic methods such as NMR-H 1 and C 13 and identified as 5, <b>7</b> -dihydroxy- 6, <b>8,</b> <b>4</b> ′-trimethoxyflavonol (1), 5 -hydroxy- 3, 6, <b>7,</b> <b>8,</b> <b>4</b> ′-pentamethoxyflavone (2), and tormentic acid (3). Both hexane and dichloromethane fractions showed selectivity for multidrug-resistant ovary cancer cell line (NCI-ADR/RES) with total growth inhibition values of 11. 1 and 12. 6 [*]μg/ml, respectively. Compound 1 also showed selective activity against the same cell line (18. 8 [*]μg/ml); however, it was especially effective against glioma cells (2. 8 [*]μg/ml), suggesting that this compound may be involved with the in vitro antiproliferative action...|$|R

The antioxidant activity of coumarins assayed {{in the present study was}} measured by different methods, namely the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH •) method, cyclic voltammetry and the antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) method.

Their structures were established by means of spectroscopic methods. In this paper we reveal {{for the first time}} the occurrence of styrylpyrones in East African biodiversity. (+)- 6 -Styryl- <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -epoxy- <b>4</b> -methoxypyran- 2 -one (2) and the dihydroxystyrylpyrone enantiomer (3) showed in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans at a concentration of 24.4 and 26.2  µM with zones of inhibition of 17 and 9  mm, respectively. Compound 2 exhibited strong activity in the brine shrimp test with LC 50  =  1.7  µg/mL. Their high cytotoxic and antifungal activities render them candidates for further scientific attention for drug development programs against cancer and microbial infections.|$|R
