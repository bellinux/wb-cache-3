5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km <b>physical</b> <b>dimensions</b> and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given <b>physical</b> <b>dimensions.</b> His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational system of units with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their <b>physical</b> <b>dimensions</b> with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is not a}} human invention, and may be {{observed}} in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in <b>physical</b> <b>dimensions</b> takes place.|$|E

5|$|In late 2007 {{plans were}} {{announced}} {{to create a}} stud book for the breed, a collaborative venture between the Marwari Horse Society of India and the Indian government. A registration process was initiated in 2009, {{when it was announced}} that the Marwari Horse Society had become a government body, the only government-authorized registration society for Marwari horses. The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which unique identification marks and <b>physical</b> <b>dimensions</b> are recorded. After the evaluation, the horse is cold branded with its registration number and photographed. In late 2009 the Indian government announced that the Marwari horse, along with other Indian horse breeds, would be commemorated on a set of stamps issued by that country.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into <b>physical</b> <b>dimensions</b> for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E

25|$|While a {{four-stroke}} {{piston engine}} completes one combustion stroke per cylinder for every two rotations of the crankshaft (that is, one-half power stroke per crankshaft rotation per cylinder), each combustion chamber in the Wankel generates one combustion stroke per driveshaft rotation, i.e. one power stroke per rotor orbital revolution and three power strokes per rotor rotation. Thus, the power output of a Wankel engine is generally {{higher than that}} of a four-stroke piston engine of similar engine displacement in a similar state of tune; and {{higher than that of}} a four-stroke piston engine of similar <b>physical</b> <b>dimensions</b> and weight.|$|E

25|$|The small <b>physical</b> <b>dimensions</b> of PET film {{capacitors}} are {{the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of polyester film capacitors is relatively high compared to other film capacitors, ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitors is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitor types.|$|E
25|$|The {{study found}} {{significant}} differences in overall wing size and in the <b>physical</b> <b>dimensions</b> of wings. Males tended to have larger wings than females, and were heavier than females, on average. Both males and females had similar thorax dimensions (wing muscles are contained in the thorax). Female monarchs tended to have thicker wings, which is thought to convey greater tensile strength. This would make female wings {{less likely to be}} damaged during migration. Also, females had lower wing loading than males (wing loading is a value derived from the ratio of wing size to body weight), which would mean females require less energy to fly. A table with the average measurements of each variable is shown.|$|E
25|$|His next {{work was}} {{published}} in 1933 titled The <b>Physical</b> <b>Dimensions</b> of Consciousness; he attempts an accommodation with behaviorism by viewing sensations through their physical mechanisms. In this Boring expresses his monist physicalism perspective, similar to operationalism’s emphasis on measurement {{in order to understand}} the meaning of concepts. Boring himself was surprised by his view being in direct opposition to his deeply respected mentor Titchener. However Titchener was dead by this time and Boring was now free to express his views. The mentalist and dualist perspective of Titchener seemed insecure to Boring, he focused on a physical brain rather than the abstract mind. One of the purposes of this book was try to clarify such complex terms as consciousness and sensation, questions that had been plaguing him since his automobile accident. Boring wanted to define what these phenomena actually meant physically.|$|E
