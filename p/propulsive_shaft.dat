40|$|The {{document}} {{describes a}} manipulator for a wheel excavator. The {{purpose of the}} manipulator is to handle with the <b>propulsive</b> <b>shaft</b> of a crushing machine and the tension cylinder of an interchanging conveyor-belt during the assembling and maintenance. The objective of the master's thesis is the strength analysis of the manipulator components and the telescopic arm with using the finite element method. The thesis also comprises the assembly drawing of the manipulator with additional devices and the propulsion system calculation. The project is carried out {{with the cooperation of}} NOEN a. s...|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{gas turbine}} engine system, patent number 5,867,979, is a {{gas turbine engine}} that is mounted on an aircraft, which the system generates and utilizes electrical and other power. The gas engine turbine systemâ€™s core {{is made up of}} a compressor, a three <b>shaft</b> <b>propulsive</b> gas turbine engine, which has three electrical generators. Each generator is connected to one segment of the shaft, {{which is part of the}} engine. Then a propulsive fan is driven by the compressor and the generators. [...] The engine including many independent shafts is connected to the turbine engine, which is connected to the compressor that is connected to the fan. Each of the shafts independently and directly is powered by an electrical generator.|$|R
