5|$|For random initial conditions, the {{boundaries}} between the trees formed in this way themselves shift in a seemingly random pattern, and trees frequently die out altogether. But {{by means of the}} theory of shift registers he and others were able to find initial conditions in which the trees all remain alive forever, the pattern of growth repeats <b>periodically,</b> and all of the clearings can be guaranteed to remain bounded in size.|$|E
