2500|$|The George Conrad Hutzler Farm, {{also known}} as the Conrad Hutzler Farm, is a {{historic}} farmstead located on South Manitou Island in Lake Michigan. [...] One of the farm's owners, George Conrad Hutzler, Jr., was the first to experiment with hybridization of Rosen rye and Michelite pea beans; within 20 years of his experimentation, 80% of the <b>pea</b> <b>bean</b> crop in the United States was descended from Michelite seeds grown on South Manitou Island. [...] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|George Conrad Hutzler died in 1896 and {{was buried}} on the farm. His son George Conrad Jr.(born {{on the island}} in 1872) took over {{ownership}} of the farm.

40|$|Preparation and {{characterization}} of antisera against lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., cv. Grand Rapids) and pea (Pisum sativum L., cv. Alaska) phytochrome is described. These antisera, together with previously obtained antisera against zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L., cv. Black Beauty) and oat (Avena sativa L., cv. Garry) phytochrome, {{were used to}} compare by Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion phytochrome isolated from etiolated lettuce, <b>pea,</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L., cv. Taylor Horticultural Bush), zucchini, oat and rye (Secale cereale L., cv. Balbo) seedlings. Cross reactivity between monocotyledonous phytochrome and antidicotyledonous-phytochrome serum and between dicotyledonous phytochrome and antimonocotyledonous-phytochrome serum was always weak or not perceptible by this assay. Among the four dicotyledonous phytochromes examined, pea and bean were the most similar immunochemically as anticipated. Pea and lettuce phytochrome somewhat unexpectedly also exhibited similar immunochemical reactivity. Zucchini phytochrome by contrast was immunochemically distinct from <b>pea,</b> <b>bean,</b> and lettuce phytochrome, although it did react with all three antidicotyledonous-phytochrome sera. Initial attempts to identify immunoglobulins that would recognize phytochrome regardless of its source indicated that they may exist. Such immunoglobulins are of interest because they might react {{with one or more}} determinants that could be part of an active site of phytochrome. These immunoglobulins, once isolated, could thus serve as a potential probe for the active site of phytochrome...|$|E
40|$|A facile {{method was}} {{developed}} to establish milling settings that optimally separate starch granules from protein bodies and cell wall fibres for starch-rich legumes. Optimal separation was obtained for <b>pea,</b> <b>bean,</b> lentil and chickpea when the particle size distribution curve of flour and isolated starch granules overlap maximally. This outcome was based on scanning electron microscopy, protein content of the fine fraction and particle size distribution curves. Milling settings differed between legumes due to variances in seed hardness and starch granule size. The protein content of the fine fraction was legume specific as well and {{could be explained by}} differences in particle density, seed hardness, starch granule size, fat content and flour dispersibility...|$|E

40|$|Wild {{relatives}} of domesticated crop species harbor multiple, diverse, disease resistance (R) genes {{that could be}} used to engineer sustainable disease control. However, breeding R genes into crop lines often requires long breeding timelines of 5 – 15 years to break linkage between R genes and deleterious alleles (linkage drag). Further, when R genes are bred one at a time into crop lines, the protection that they confer is often overcome within a few seasons by pathogen evolution 1. If several cloned R genes were available, it would be possible to pyramid R genes 2 in a crop, which might provide more durable resistance 1. We describe a three-step method (MutRenSeq) -that combines chemical mutagenesis with exome capture and sequencing for rapid R gene cloning. We applied MutRenSeq to clone stem rust resistance genes Sr 22 and Sr 45 from hexaploid bread wheat. MutRenSeq can be applied to other commercially relevant crops and their relatives, including, for example, <b>pea,</b> <b>bean,</b> barley, oat, rye, rice and maize...|$|E
40|$|While not {{a staple}} in the American diet, nuts are {{consumed}} by many Americans. This Nutrition Insight examines the contribution nuts can make to a diet, consumption of nuts, characteristics of people who eat nuts, and the association of nut consumption with diet quality. Nuts are generally {{divided into two groups}} [...] tree nuts (almonds, pecans, etc.) and peanuts. Peanuts, technically a legume (a dried <b>pea,</b> <b>bean,</b> or lentil), are typically included in the nut group because they are used in a manner comparable to nuts and have a similar nutrient profile.

40|$|A growing {{interest}} has manifested itself {{within the past}} {{two or three years}} in 2 ̆ 2 phytin 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 phytic acid 2 ̆ 2, and in some of the compounds of the latter. Posternak first isolated this substance from the seeds of the red fir, pumpkin, <b>pea,</b> <b>bean,</b> white and yellow lupine and potato. Patten and Hart obtained the substance from wheat bran, and Hart and Tottingham found it in corn meal, oats and barley. The organic phosphorus materials obtained by alcoholic precipitations of aqueous or dilute acid extracts from these various sources are not identical, but ultimate analyses show a fair degree of similarity. Thus the phosphorus varies between 14 and 17 per cent, and they all contain varying amounts of magnesium, potassium and calcium. There has been prepared also, from the phytin from most of these sources, the free 2 ̆ 2 phytic acid 2 ̆ 2, corresponding to the formula C 2 H 8 P 2 O 9, (an-hydro-oxy-methylene-phosphoric acid, Posternak), or C 6 H 24 P 6 O 27, (Neuberg, Starkenstein) ...|$|E

40|$|A land {{evaluation}} using unsophisticated data successfully predicted yield ranges of various crops in Burundi. Yields of wheat, <b>pea,</b> <b>bean,</b> maize and potato predicted from data for climate, soil {{and land use}} technology were compared with observed yields from farm trials and from seed station and research station trials. The predicted range of yield for each crop suitability class enclosed the mean farm yields 13 times out of 16 and yields on seed stations and research stations 10 times out of 15 and 14 times out of 21 respectively. The variability of the observed yields exceeded the predicted range of yields. The method is considered as validated. The method appears to be applicable for multi-year studies at a broad scale, but yield variation according to the weather {{from year to year}} is not accounted for. The variances of the yields on farms are greater than the variances in seed station and research station trials. Since the method predicts correctly the mean regional farm yields, it could be useful for land use planning, research into optimal regional cropping specialisation, studies on food policy, and for evaluation of economic return and sustainability of different crops...|$|E
40|$|Extractability, {{extractable}} protein compositions, technological-functional {{properties of}} pea (Pisum sativum) proteins from six genotypes grown in Serbia were investigated. Also, {{the relationship between}} these characteristics was presented. Investigated genotypes showed significant differences in storage protein content, composition and extractability. The ratio of vicilin:legumin concentrations, as well as the ratio of vicilin + convicilin: Legumin concentrations were positively correlated with extractability. Our data suggest that the higher level of vicilin and/or a lower level of legumin have a positive influence on protein extractability. The emulsion activity index (EAI) was strongly and positively correlated with the solubility, while no significant correlation was found between emulsion stability (ESI) and solubility, nor between foaming properties and solubility. No association was evident between ESI and EAI. A moderate positive correlation between emulsion stability and foam capacity was observed. Proteins from the investigated genotypes expressed significantly different emulsifying properties and foam capacity at different pH values, whereas low foam stability was detected. It appears that genotype has considerable influence on content, composition and technological-functional properties of <b>pea</b> <b>bean</b> proteins. This fact can be very useful for food scientists in efforts {{to improve the quality of}} peas and pea protein products...|$|E
