Jacqui Cowderoy became the first Australian to break into the top 20 in a skiing event, placing 17th in the slalom. The brother-and-sister <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> Peter and Elizabeth Cain, Australia's first representatives in figure skating in 20 years, came 11th.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his batting, Brown was a highly regarded fieldsman known for his fitness. He developed his skills through persistent training with professional sprinters {{in order to improve}} his anticipation and speed off the mark. Brown often fielded at slip or in the covers. With Australia boasting the leg spin <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> O'Reilly and Grimmett in the 1930s, close-catchers were frequently used. Along with Fingleton, Brown often fielded in the leg trap position.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, drivers who had reached Formula One often {{continued}} {{to compete in}} Formula Two.

The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races {{in the hands of}} the Formula One <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> Brabham and Hulme.

Although it received mediocre reviews, Romberg's cult status and popularity helped make the film a hit financially.|$|E
