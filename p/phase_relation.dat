40|$|Synchronous {{oscillations}} {{have become}} a widespread hypothetical ‘‘mechanism’’ to explain how brain dynamics give rise to neural functions. By focusing on synchrony one leaves the <b>phase</b> <b>relations</b> during moments of desynchronous oscillations either without a clear functional role or with a secondary role such as a transition between functionally ‘‘relevant’’ synchronized states. In this work, rather than studying synchrony we focus on desynchronous oscillations and investigate their functional roles {{in the context of}} a sensorimotor coordination task. In particular, we address the questions: a) how does the informational content of the sensorimotor activity present in a complete dynamical description of <b>phase</b> <b>relations</b> change as such a description is reduced to the dynamics of synchronous oscillations? and b) to what extent are desynchronous oscillations as causally relevant as synchronous ones to the generation of functional sensorimotor coordination? These questions are addressed with a model of a simulated agent performing a functional sensorimotor coordination task controlled by an oscillatory network. The results suggest that: i) desynchronized <b>phase</b> <b>relations</b> carry as much information about sensorimotor activity as synchronized phase relations; and ii) <b>phase</b> <b>relations</b> between oscillators with near-zero frequency difference carry a relatively higher causal relevance than the rest of the <b>phase</b> <b>relations</b> to the sensorimotor coordination; however, overall a privileged functional causal contribution can not be attributed to either synchronous or desynchronous oscillations...|$|R

50|$|Quantum {{decoherence}} is {{the loss}} of quantum coherence. In quantum mechanics, particles such as electrons behave like waves and are described by a wavefunction. These waves can interfere, leading to the peculiar behaviour of quantum particles. As long as there exists a definite <b>phase</b> <b>relation</b> between different states, the system is said to be coherent. This coherence is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, and is necessary for the functioning of quantum computers. However, when a quantum system is not perfectly isolated, but in contact with its surroundings, the coherence decays with time, a process called quantum decoherence. As a result of this process, the quantum behaviour is lost.Decoherence was first introduced in 1970 by the German physicist H. Dieter Zeh and has been a subject of active research since the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The {{interaction}} of matter with light, i.e., electromagnetic fields, {{is able to}} generate a coherent superposition of excited quantum states in the material.Coherent denotes {{the fact that the}} material excitations have a well defined <b>phase</b> <b>relation</b> which originates from the phase of the incident electromagnetic wave.Macroscopically, the superposition state of the material results in an optical polarization, i.e., a rapidly oscillating dipole density.The optical polarization is a genuine non-equilibrium quantity that decays to zero when the excited system relaxes to its equilibrium state after the electromagnetic pulse is switched off.Due to this decay which is called dephasing, coherent effects are observable only for a certain temporal duration after pulsed photoexcitation. Various materials such as atoms, molecules, metals, insulators, semiconductors are studied using coherent optical spectroscopy and such experiments and their theoretical analysis has revealed a wealth of insights on the involved matter states and their dynamical evolution.|$|E

50|$|Now let us {{consider}} the homodyne tomography detector as depicted in figure 4. The signal photon (this is the quantum state we want to reconstruct) interferes with the local oscillator, when they are directed onto a 50-50% beamsplitter. Since the two beams originate from the same so called master laser, {{they have the same}} fixed <b>phase</b> <b>relation.</b> The local oscillator must be intense, compared to the signal so it provides a precise phase reference. The local oscillator is so intense, that we can treat it classically (a = α) and neglect the quantum fluctuations. The signal field is spatially and temporally controlled by the local oscillator, which has a controlled shape. Where the local oscillator is zero, the signal is rejected. Therefore, we have temporal-spatial mode selectivity of the signal. The beamsplitter redirects the two beams to two photodetectors. The photodetectors generate an electric current proportional to the photon number. The two detector currents are subtracted and the resulting current is proportional to the electric field operator in the signal mode, depended on relative optical phase of signal and local oscillator.|$|E

Of particular interest are zero energy Majorana bound states that form at a phase difference of π.

At high temperatures, the SQUID oscillations revert to conventional behaviour, ruling out asymmetry. The node lifting of the SQUID oscillations is consistent with low energy Andreev bound states exhibiting a nonsinusoidal current <b>phase</b> <b>relation,</b> coexisting with states possessing a conventional sinusoidal current <b>phase</b> <b>relation.</b> However, the finite nodal currents in the single junction diffraction pattern suggest an anomalous contribution to the supercurrent possibly carried by Majorana bound states, although we also consider the possibility of inhomogeneity.
