50|$|The {{majority}} of modern-day home sewing patterns contain multiple sizes in one pattern. Once a pattern {{is removed from}} a package, you can either cut the pattern based on the size you will be making or you can preserve the pattern by tracing it. The pattern is traced onto fabric using one of several methods. In one method, tracing paper with transferable ink on one side is placed between the pattern and the fabric. A tracing wheel is moved over the pattern outlines, transferring the markings onto the fabric with ink that is removable by erasing or washing. In another method, tracing paper is laid directly over a purchased pattern, and the pieces are traced. The pieces are cut, then the tracing paper is pinned and/or basted to the fabric. The fabric can then be cut to match the outlines on the tracing paper. Vintage patterns may come with small holes pre-punched into the <b>pattern</b> <b>paper.</b> These are for creating tailor's tacks, a type of basting where thread is sewn into the fabric in short lengths {{to serve as a}} guideline for cutting and assembling fabric pieces.|$|E

50|$|In American Colonial times, quilts were {{predominantly}} wholecloth quilts-a {{single piece of}} fabric layered with batting and backing held together with fine needlework quilting. Broderie perse quilts were popular during this time {{and the majority of}} pierced or appliqued quilts made during the 1170-1800 period, were medallion-style quilts (quilts with a central ornamental panel and one or more borders.)). Patchwork quilting in America dates to the 1770s, the decade the United States gained its independence from England. These late-eighteenth- and nineteenth-century patchwork quilts often mixed wool, silk, linen, and cotton in the same piece, as well as mixing large-scale (often chintz) and small-scale (often calico) patterns. Some antique quilts made in North America have worn-out blankets or older quilts as the internal batting layer, quilted between new layers of fabric and thereby extending the usefulness of old material. During American pioneer days, paper quilting became popular. Paper was used as a pattern and each individual piece of cut fabric was basted around the paper <b>pattern.</b> <b>Paper</b> was a scarce commodity in the early American west so women would save letters from home, newspaper clippings, and catalogs to use as patterns. The paper not only served as a pattern but as an insulator. The paper found between the old quilts has become a primary source of information about pioneer life.|$|E
50|$|A {{section of}} the glass is heated until it is malleable; then it is bent into shape and aligned to a neon sign <b>pattern</b> <b>paper</b> {{containing}} the graphics or lettering that the final product will ultimately conform to. This is where the real art of neon comes in, that takes some artisans from a year up to several years of practice to master. A tube bender corks off the hollow tube before heating and holds a latex rubber blow hose at the other end, through which he gently presses {{a small amount of}} air to keep the tube diameter constant as it is bending. The trick of bending is to bend one small section or bend at a time, heating one part of the tubing so that it is soft, without heating some other part of the tube as well, which would make the bend uncontrollable. A bend, once the glass is heated, must be brought to the pattern and fitted rapidly before the glass hardens again because it is difficult to reheat once completely cooled without risking breakage. It is frequently necessary to skip one or more bends and come back to it later, by measuring carefully {{along the length of the}} tube. One tube letter may contain 7-10 small bends, and mistakes are not easily corrected without going back and starting all over again. If more tubing is required, another piece is welded onto it, or the parts can be all welded onto each other at the final step. The finished tube must be absolutely vacuum tight to operate, and it must be vacuum clean inside. Once the tube is filled with mercury, if any mistake is made after that, the entire tube has to, or should be, started over anew, because breathing heated mercury impregnated glass and phosphor causes long term heavy metal poisoning in neon workers. Sticks of tubing are joined until the tube reaches an impractical size, and several tubes are joined in series with the high voltage neon transformer. Extreme ends of the electrical circuit must be isolated from each other to prevent tube puncture and buzzing from corona effect.|$|E

40|$|Dental caries is an {{irreversible}} {{and potentially}} debilitating disease that can {{ultimately lead to}} the loss of the affected tooth structure. Due to a lack of awareness, caries is detected much later after its onset. Moreover, people {{do not have access to}} dental care or information in the rural areas of several developing countries. Hence, there is a need for a cheap and disposable point-of-care screening test to determine one's oral health. To cater to this unmet need, we have developed a paperfluidic chip that measures salivary pH to estimate its buffering capacity and also tests susceptibility to caries by checking for salivary reductase. The results of our paper-based reductase assay of 72 samples correlated well with the results obtained using the standard tube-based assay performed in dental clinics. Further, the results of the paper-based pH test matched with those of the caries test, i. e. those with lower saliva pH showed higher susceptibility to caries (since acidic environments promote caries).

The height of microwells and microchannels can also be tailored flexibly by adjusting the liquid filling volume. This method for prototyping PDMS microdevices has some favorable merits including simple operation procedures, fast concept-to-device time, and low cost, indicating its potential for simple PDMS microdevice fabrication and applications...|$|R

40|$|Studies of Sunscreens: Percutaneous Absorption of Benzophenone- 3 and Photostability Helena Gonzalez Department of Dermatology and Venereology Institute of Clinical Sciences The Sahlgrenska Academy at Göteborg University Göteborg, Sweden Abstract Aim: To {{learn more}} about {{percutaneous}} absorption of the photoactive compound benzophenone- 3 (BZ- 3) and to study the excretion pattern of BZ- 3 and its metabolite dihydroxy benzophenone (DHB). We also got {{the opportunity to develop}} a reverse-phase HPLC method to analyze BZ- 3 and DHB. The photostability of seven commercial sunscreens was also studied. Material and methods: Paper I: 11 participants applied a sunscreen, 2 mg/cm 2, containing 4 % BZ- 3. They collected urine for 48 hours after the application. Paper II: 26 participants applied a sunscreen, 2 mg/cm 2, containing 4 % BZ- 3 morning and night for five days. Half of the participants were exposed to UV radiation (UVR). They collected urine for the five days the sunscreen was applied and an additional five days after the last application. Paper III: The assay uses: solid-phase extraction with C 8 columns; a Genesis C 18 column (4. 6 mm x 150 mm); a gradient acetonitrile-water mobile phase; a UV-detector set at 287 nm. Paper IV: Seven commercial sunscreens were studied with absorption spectrophotometry. Sunscreen product, 0. 5 mg/cm 2, was placed between plates of silica. The area under the curve (AUC) in the spectrum was calculated for the different UV regions. AUC before (AUCbefore) and after (AUCafter) artificial UV exposure and before and after natural UV exposure were calculated. If the AUC Index (AUCI), defined as AUCI=AUCafter/AUCbefore, was > 0. 80, the sunscreen was considered photostable. Results: Paper I: The average total amount excreted was 11 mg, median 9. 8 mg, which is approximately 0. 4 % of the applied amount BZ- 3. Paper II: The volunteers excreted 1. 2 - 8. 7 % BZ- 3 of the total applied amount. The mean value found was 3. 7 %. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups; p 0. 99, with detection limits for BZ- 3 and DHB of 0. 01 µmol/l and 0. 16 µmol/l respectively. Relative standard deviation was less than 10 % for BZ- 3 and less than 13 % for DHB. The excretion pattern varied among the human volunteers, different patterns were discerned among the individuals. Paper IV: Three sunscreens were unstable after 90 min of natural UV, in the UVA range the AUCI was between 0. 41 and 0. 76. In the UVB range, one of these sunscreens was unstable with an AUCI of 0. 75 after 90 min. Three sunscreens were photostable after 120 min of natural UV, in the UVA range the AUCI was between 0. 85 and 0. 99 and in the UVB range between 0. 92 and 1. 0. Conclusions: Paper I: BZ- 3 is absorbed by the skin and excreted in the urine after one topical application of a sunscreen containing 4 % BZ- 3. There are individual differences in the amount excreted and in the excretion <b>pattern.</b> <b>Paper</b> II: Repeated topical applications of a sunscreen containing 4 % BZ- 3 lead to a higher excretion of BZ- 3. There was no statistical difference after exposure to UVR. Paper III: The developed reverse-phase HPLC-method was reliable and suitable to handle a large number of samples. BZ- 3 and DHB were excreted in a similar <b>pattern.</b> <b>Paper</b> IV: Three of the seven investigated sunscreens were photounstable in the UVA region.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} work completed during the eleventh year of the Borehole Acoustics and Logging Consortium in the Earth Resources Laboratory at M. LT. We continued our trend toward more general borehole acoustics instead of just full waveform logging. In this report we have papers related to borehole radiation as well as reception patterns, {{as well as more}} theoretical work on the Green's function of an anisotropic medium. The borehole reception <b>pattern</b> <b>paper</b> is the continuation of the work from last year, where we dealt with the receiver pattern in an open borehole. This year the work is extended to include cased boreholes. On the subject of borehole radiation, this year we have two papers dealing with the radiated seismic wavefield away from a borehole. The interest is in the areas of downhole sources as applied to single hole imaging, measurement while drilling, reverse vertical seismic profiling, as well as cross borehole tomography. In all these areas how the source energy is coupled into the borehole under different situations is of tremendous interest. On the more traditional full waveform acoustic logging side, we have a paper dealing with logging in a randomly heterogeneous formation, and one on the effect of permeability heterogeneity on the measured Stoneley wave velocity and attenuation. We also have a paper on the ultrasonic modeling of shear wave logging in an azimuthally anisotropic formation. On the numerical side, we have one paper on a fourth-order staggered-grid finite difference formulation of full waveform logging in a transversely isotropic formation with vertically varying properties, and one on the formulation of an optimal absorbing boundary condition for finite difference elastic wave propagation algorithms. Finally, as a continuation of previous work, we are working to improve our algorithm to location microearthquakes generated by hydraulic fracturing and thus provide a better location of the fracture in a three-dimensional space.

40|$|Pulsed tissue Doppler {{is a new}} technique, {{which can}} {{investigate}} longitudinal left ventricular(LV) function, by measuring tissue velocities and timings. Patients with acute coronarysyndromes (ACS) frequently display a reduced longitudinal function. They also developglobal LV filling impairment. This pathology involves an elevated LV filling pressure (FP),left atrial (LA) enlargement and elevation of right ventricular pressure (RVp). We aimed toinvestigate the relative timing of the onsets of the LV early diastolic longitudinal wall motionand blood flow, and further, to evaluate clinical tools to assess global LV filling. We studied 160 ACS patients and 60 controls with echocardiography, including pulsed tissueDoppler. Using pulsed blood pool Doppler, we semi-quantitatively classified the patients withrespect to LV filling: normal (group 0); delayed relaxation (group 1); isolated pathologicalmitral-pulmonary venous-A-wave-duration difference (group 2); pseudo normal (group 3); ora restrictive (group 4) filling pattern. The temporal onset relationship of the LV early diastolicwall lengthening (e) and the mitral inflow (E) was explored, for a regional wall analysis(paper I). In order to evaluate a recent application, suggested to predict pulmonary capillarywedge pressure (PCWP) through the formulas tau= 32 + 0. 7 x (e-E) and PCWP = LV endsystolicpressure x e-IVRT/ tau (IVRT=the isovolumic relaxation time), we tested these formulasin normal individuals, at rest and during non-pharmacological preload alterations (Paper IV). The sensitivity of a new LV filling variable, the E/e (=E/E) filling index was investigatedby comparing E/e to RVp in their identification of a Doppler-assumed elevated LVFP, i. e. apseudo normal or a restrictive filling <b>pattern</b> (<b>Paper</b> II). We compared the intraindividual atrialsize difference and absolute LA size, as detectors of LA enlargement (Paper III). In the patients, e started later than E (12 ± 30 vs. 2 ± 19 ms later, p 15 and an RVp > 30 mmHg had the following (%) sensitivity (32 / 94),specificity (95 / 76), positive (68 / 59), and negative (80 / 97) predictive value of a diagnosedgroup 3 or 4. Absolute LA area, LA area/body height and LA-right atrial area indicated aLA enlargement in; for controls: 2 %, 2 % and 4 %; and for patients: group 0 and 1 : 15 %, 17 %and 46 %; group 2 : 26 %, 29 % and 52 %; and group 3 and 4 : 42 %, 38 % and 54 %. In ACS patients, the early diastolic LV tissue- to blood temporal relationship may reveal anasynchronous, and {{in relation to the}} mitral inflow delayed, initial LV wall lengthening. The formulas to predict PCWP failed to render plausible values in normal individuals. TheE/e filling index > 15, as a single variable, may have a limited sensitivity of an elevated LVFP.
