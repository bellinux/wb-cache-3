Shortly: the family of <b>power</b> <b>means</b> is a scale. If I is an interval and f I →R is a continuous, strictly monotone function then f^- 1 (1 n∑ f(v_i)) is a natural generalization of <b>power</b> <b>means,</b> so called quasi-arithmetic mean generated by f. A famous folk theorem says that the only homogeneous, quasi-arithmetic <b>means</b> are <b>power</b> <b>means.</b> We prove that, upon replacing the homogeneity requirement by an invariant-type axiom, one gets a family of quasi-arithmetic means building up a scale, too.
