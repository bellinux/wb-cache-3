25|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues was whether the state would support the church financially. Advocating such a policy were the ministers and {{most members of the}} Congregational Church, which had been established, and hence had received <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>support,</b> during the colonial period. The Baptists, who had grown strong since the Great Awakening, tenaciously adhered to their ancient conviction that churches should receive no support from the state.|$|E
25|$|There {{are over}} 150 city bus lines called Colectivos, each one managed by an {{individual}} company. These compete with each other, and attract exceptionally high use with virtually no <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>support.</b> Their frequency makes them equal to the underground systems of other cities, but buses cover a far wider area than the underground system. Colectivos in Buenos Aires {{do not have a}} fixed timetable, but run from four to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day. With inexpensive tickets and extensive routes, usually no further than four blocks from commuters' residences, the colectivo is the most popular mode of transport around the city.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, 'modernisers' in {{the party}} claimed that the {{association}} between social conservatism and the Conservatives (manifest in policies such as tax incentives for married couples, {{the removal of the}} link between pensions and earnings, and criticism of <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> {{for those who do not}} work) played a role in the electoral decline of the party in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade). Since 1997, a debate continued with{{in the party}} between 'modernisers' such as Alan Duncan, who believe that the Conservatives should modify their public stances on social issues, and 'traditionalists' such as Liam Fox and Owen Paterson, who believe that the party should remain faithful to its traditional conservative platform. This may have resulted in William Hague's and Michael Howard's pre-election swings to the right in 2001 and 2005, as well as the election of the stop-Kenneth Clarke candidate, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2001. Iain Duncan Smith, however, remains influential. It has been argued by analysts that his Centre for Social Justice forced Cameron to the right on many issues, particularly crime and social welfare.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of individual inventors trying to protect, patent, and utilize their inventions. The paper also examines {{the extent to which}} inventors received public support. Drawing on an analysis of 33 case studies of Finnish independent inventors, the study explores {{the extent to which the}} inventor types correspond with access to certain support measures and commercialization success. The findings suggest that different types of inventors and their patents concur with different levels of access to and use of support measures. Access to innovation support does not necessarily coincide with commercialization success. At times, inventor categories with some success in utilizing patented inventions coincided with little support and advice from public organizations.
