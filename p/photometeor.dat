50|$|A <b>photometeor</b> is a {{topic in}} {{atmospheric}} optics. These can be bright objects or phenomena appearing in Earth's atmosphere when sunlight or moonlight creates a reflection, refraction, diffraction or interference under particular circumstances. The most frequent are halos, rainbows, fogbows, cloud iridescences (or irisation), glories, Bishop's rings, coronas, crepuscular rays, parhelia, light pillars, mirages, scintillations, green flashes, etc.|$|E
5000|$|In meteorology, irisation, {{a type of}} <b>photometeor,</b> is {{multiple}} mixed iridescent colors {{caused by}} sunlight being diffracted in clouds. The colors are often brilliant and mingled together, sometimes similar to mother-of-pearl. They sometimes appear as bands parallel {{to the edge of}} the clouds. Irisation is caused by very uniform water droplets diffracting light (Within 10 degrees from the Sun) and by first order interference effects (Beyond about 10 degrees from the Sun). It can extend up to 40 degrees from the Sun. Irisation is sometimes seen along the borders of lenticular clouds. Irisations are named after the Greek goddess Iris, goddess of rainbows and messenger of Zeus and Hera to the mortals below.|$|E

Eponyms for this release meteor The terms for the omics community in our envoEmpo. owl subset This release features {{a wide range of}} new classes and improved axiomatisation across ENVO; however, it is primarily driven by requests from the Earth Microbiome Project to axiomatise and integrate the project's EMPO vocabulary into ENVO and other ontologies. Several lake-releated classes are being created to support the AquaDiva project and foundational semantics for extending atmospheric semantics have been developed. The continuation of work with CESAB and the generation of this synthesis centre's subset In addition, more upper-level classes from BFO have been imported to begin the restructuring of ENVO's branches for improved axiomatisation, interoperation with other OBO resources, and clarity. Users should prepare for the environmental feature branch to be markedly restructured (most individual PURLs will not be affected, only their positioning and axioms). :warning: Dead Simple Design Patterns were used to generate classes not mentioned in this note. Work is underway to integrate reporting into future release notes.

50|$|<b>Photometeors</b> are not {{reported}} in routine weather observation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{luminance}} or {{brightness of}} a cloud {{is determined by}} how light is reflected, scattered, and transmitted by the cloud's particles. Its brightness may also {{be affected by the}} presence of haze or <b>photometeors</b> such as halos and rainbows. In the troposphere, dense, deep clouds exhibit a high reflectance (70% to 95%) throughout the visible spectrum. Tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out, giving a cloud its characteristic white color, especially when viewed from the top. Cloud droplets tend to scatter light efficiently, so that the intensity of the solar radiation decreases with depth into the gases. As a result, the cloud base can vary from a very light to very-dark-grey depending on the cloud's thickness and how much light is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer. [...] High thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of the comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off-white appearance. [...] However, a thick dense ice-crystal cloud appears brilliant white with pronounced grey shading because of its greater reflectivity.|$|R
