50|$|Economic or {{industrial}} espionage {{takes place in}} two main forms. In short, the purpose of espionage is to gather knowledge about (an) organization(s). It may include the acquisition of intellectual property, such as information on industrial manufacture, ideas, techniques and processes, recipes and formulas. Or it could include sequestration of proprietary or operational information, such as that on customer datasets, pricing, sales, marketing, research and development, policies, <b>prospective</b> <b>bids,</b> planning or marketing strategies or the changing compositions and locations of production. It may describe activities such as theft of trade secrets, bribery, blackmail and technological surveillance. As well as orchestrating espionage on commercial organizations, governments can also be targets — for example, to determine {{the terms of a}} tender for a government contract so that another tenderer can underbid.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the lessons learnt by London Underground (LU), {{the public sector}} contracting authority, when a tied supply chain arrangement, namely where shareholders are also commercial beneficiaries from sub-contracted delivery, was utilised by a consortium to upgrade its system under an innovative Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model. Research on tied supply chains and their application in PPP agreements is significantly under reported. The paper sets out insights from industry using secondary sources, which include parliamentary reports and reviews. The paper postulates that different models of tied supply chains might exist, from those that rely on some form of equity structure to those that rely only on the collective reputation of the supply network. Five lessons learnt from the contracting authority's perspective are highlighted {{on the use of}} tied supply chains in PPP contractual arrangements. Whilst tied supply chains can be effective, they are better utilised in PPP contractual arrangements where there is certainty with the scope of works and required resources. During the bid evaluation stage the contracting authority must evaluate whether <b>prospective</b> <b>bidding</b> consortiums have satisfactory governance arrangements at Board level and across its tied supply chain. Furthermore, the contracting authority must include governance safeguards within the contractual documents and strictly regulate the tied supply chain to prevent failure. This paper provides a new insight into tied supply chains and their governance with respect to Public-Private-Partnership models, and other forms of procurement...|$|R
2500|$|On 1 September, the Board of West Ham confirmed, {{following}} press speculation, {{that they}} were in takeover talks with an unnamed party. They announced that there was no link between this <b>prospective</b> takeover <b>bid</b> and the signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano the day before. Media Sports Investment (MSI), the company which owns the contracts of those two players and which chose to bring them to West Ham, confirmed that it had no interest in investing in European football clubs, thereby ruling itself out of being behind these talks. However, a consortium headed [...] by former MSI frontman Kia Joorabchian entered into talks with the club on 5 September. These talks broke down in early November after further debts that had not been declared by West Ham were revealed in the due diligence process. This was compounded by the announcement that West Ham would be unable to move into London's Olympic Stadium after the event, which was to be reserved for athletics use.|$|R
40|$|In {{combinatorial}} auctions, <b>prospective</b> buyers <b>bid</b> on {{bundles of}} items for sale, including {{but not limited}} to singleton bundles. The bid price given by a buyer on a particular bundle reflects his/her perceived utility of the bundle of items as a whole. After collecting all the bids, the auctioneer determines the revenue-maximizing assignment of winning bidders to bundles subject to nonoverlapping of bundles. To accomplish this, the auctioneer needs to solve a winner determination problem (WDP). The exactly same way of thinking can be taken to the context of min-sum scheduling, where jobs can be viewed as bidders who bid on bundles of discrete time periods on machines. Particular problems often permit only a subset of bundles. By putting appropriate restrictions on the collection of permissible bundles, we can derive from the WDP, various integer programming (IP) formulations for nonpreemptive as well as preemptive min-sum scheduling problems. We thus obtain the well-known time-indexed IP formulation in the nonpreemptive case, and further, a new strong IP formulation in the preemptive case...|$|R

40|$|We examine {{effects of}} urban {{passenger}} rail upgrades to Auckland's Western Line, including double tracking, station development, and related urban renewal projects. The results {{are used to}} assess anticipated net benefits of the developments. The rail-related upgrades {{are expected to be}} completed in late 2010, but have been well publicised and so should already be factored into people's location and pricing decisions. Our analysis compares developments near Western Line stations with developments elsewhere in Auckland, thus controlling for wider regional and macroeconomic impacts. As well as describing developments, we estimate the impact on property values of station proximity. Changes in property values are used to identify benefits due to the upgrades since <b>prospective</b> property buyers <b>bid</b> up the price of a property to include the net benefits; otherwise they would be outbid by another prospective buyer. "Net benefits" include gross benefits less direct additional property-tax costs due to the project but do not include costs borne elsewhere (though these can be accounted for separately). We utilise actual property sale prices using a repeat sales methodology to measure price appreciation. Specifically, we examine whether price appreciation is affected by proximity to Western Line stations, allowing for different effects at each station. Our main focus is on residential values but we refer also to commercial and industrial applications...|$|R
5000|$|Given {{that the}} National Football League was not {{planning}} on expanding the developers {{of the new}} stadium stated on their website that their tenant would be an existing team [...] "that needs to move because they cannot build a new stadium or financially they are not successful in their current market. We can not disclose which teams we are talking with." [...] The three teams which used to play in Los Angeles but moved elsewhere (the San Diego Chargers, St. Louis Rams and Oakland Raiders, the first two of which would eventually move back to Los Angeles) were suspected possible tenants. The Jacksonville Jaguars and the Minnesota Vikings had also been identified by Roski and others as possible prime tenants of the new stadium. The Minnesota Vikings were officially {{taken out of the}} race after a financial package providing for construction of a new stadium in Minneapolis was approved by both the Minnesota State Legislature and the Minneapolis City Council. The Jaguars also became no longer an option for Roski. Wayne Weaver, during his press conference announcement of selling the Jaguars to Shahid Khan during mid-season in 2011, explained that Roski did call him in an attempt to buy the team, but was instantly turned down, saying [...] "It was a waste of my time and his". Khan said that he wants to put the city of Jacksonville on the map and had no plans to move the team. The Buffalo Bills were also considered a potential relocation candidate, but the city of Buffalo was able to force the team to sign an ironclad lease in 2012 prohibiting them from relocating and, through political and community pressure, dissuaded all Los Angeles-based <b>prospective</b> buyers from <b>bidding</b> on the team when it came up for sale in 2014, eventually selling to Terry and Kim Pegula.|$|R
2500|$|After PRR control, the B was {{profitable}} {{again and}} became a stronger railroad. The PRR allowed the newly developed New Jersey, New York and Staten Island properties to remain intact. For a short while in 1900, the SIRT operated a B connection passenger train from St. George to Plainfield, NJ. Within a few years, the B was profitable again and emerged from PRR control as a stronger railroad. The PRR bought four large double-decker steamers to cut the travel time on the Staten Island Ferry in half. Even though the PRR improved ferry service, the B was ejected from Whitehall Street terminal on October 25, 1905, when the city took ownership of the ferry and terminals. A new Saint George Terminal was then built by the city for $2,318,720. The PRR {{increased the number of}} daily trips to 28, and in 1902, it began contemplating the electrification of the rail line. The PRR's investment in the southern portion of the Perth Amboy sub-division was credited for the increased development of the South Shore of Staten Island. As such, a new station was constructed, Whitlock, circa 1902 to serve a new community being built by the Whitlock Realty Company on the South Shore of Staten Island. The development company incentivized <b>prospective</b> buyers to <b>bid</b> on newly-built houses by promising free commutation between Manhattan and Whitlock for the first year for the first 25 houses. In December 1912, the SIRT petitioned the Public Service Commission (PSC) to allow the railway to abandon the station {{and replace it with a}} station named Bay Terrace [...] to the south. The change was made anticipating a shift in the center of population in the community. After 1900, several new houses were built in the community of Annadale, several part of the Little Farms development. In 1910, As part of the development, the building company built a new railroad station. As a result, on March 22, 1910, the SIRT petitioned the PSC to allow it to discontinue its service at Annadale station and replace it with a new station, of the same name, [...] to the west.|$|R
40|$|The Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) manages 2. {{1 million}} acres of timberland. Timber {{harvested}} from these lands has averaged 12 percent of Washington’s total annual timber harvest level from 1989 through 2003. Management plans have incorporated more ecosystems goals such as promoting ecosystem health, habitat conservation, and increasing the structural complexity of the timberland. The management plan adhered to by the DNR will likely result in more heterogeneous stands of timber and thus timber sales of more heterogeneous saw timber. The goal {{of the study was}} to examine how the diversity of saw timber in a given timber sale impacted the final sale value in lump sum sales of western Washington. Saw timber diversity was defined by the distribution of volume among different species and saw log grades in a given sale. Prior research predominately located in the U. S. South had shown a reduction in timber sale value as sales included a greater level of saw timber diversity. This result is based on the theory that increasing transaction costs associated with the processing of more heterogeneous stands led to a less desirable timber sale characteristic per sale. These processing costs include harvesting, sorting and the reselling of undesirable timber. The study focused on lump sum state timber sales in western Washington. Lump sum sales require <b>prospective</b> buyers to <b>bid</b> on the right to harvest an entire timber sale. A parcel is first advertised and then auctioned as one unit, establishing a fixed payment for the timber sale by the winning bidder. Since this method of sale requires the buyer to purchase and harvest all timber advertised in a sale, it can result in forcing buyers to purchase timber species and saw log grades that they have little or no interest in. This rationale led to the hypothesis that a negative relationship would be observed between increasing saw timber diversity and the final sale value of lump sum timber sales in the data. The detailed inventory information provided by the DNR enabled the calculation of an index value for saw timber diversity that could be used as a metric in empirical examination of the relationship between diversity and the final sale value. A diversity variable was created to facilitate examination of the impact increased heterogeneity of saw timber in a tract has on the final sale value of lump sum timber sales. This required the calculation of a diversity variable that would account for the species and grade characteristics of each individual timber sale. To this end the Shannon- Wiener index was selected as the best method for calculating this variable. It was an appropriate choice for this data because it could be calculated using the detailed inventory information. In this research stand diversity or heterogeneity applied only to the species of trees and log grades that were included in the timber sale data. Wildlife and other facets of a timber stand were not included in the calculation of the diversity index. The diversity index created had a range of 0 for a completely homogeneous timber sale to 3. 689 for a completely heterogeneous timber sale. Slightly less than 800 sales had values from 1. 4 and 1. 7. Another 700 sales included values from 0. 7 and 1. 3. About 500 sales had values from 1. 8 to 2. 2. The remaining sales were distributed above and below these ranges. A total of 2194 sales were included in the study. Other variables examined in the model to explain the final sold value of the timber sale included the total number of bidders on a timber sale, the total acreage of the timber sale, the contract length of the timber sale, the total number of miles of required road reconstruction, the Douglas fir volume of the saw log grades P, 2 P, 3 P, SM, 1 S, the Douglas fir volume of the saw log grade 2 S, the Douglas fir volume of the saw log grade 3 S, the Western Hemlock volume of the saw log grades P, 2 P, 3 P, SM, 1 S, the Western Hemlock volume of the saw log grade 2 S, the Western Hemlock volume of the saw log grade 3 S, all other volume included in the timber sale, and the WWPA lumber index price of Douglas fir. During the process of model fitting a diversity measure of the timber sale accounting for only the distribution among eight possible tree species and a diversity measure of the timber sale accounting for only the distribution among the five possible saw log grades were used in alternative model comparisons. The final sold value of a timber sale in U. S. dollars represented the winning bid of a timber sale. By including the volume found in the three highest grades of both dominant and co-dominant species, as well as the other sale volume on the right hand side of the equation, the problem of scale with respect to the dependant variable was alleviated. In other words, the existence of large bid values skewing estimates simply due to large volumes was eliminated. Seven models were estimated with alternative sets of independent variables. There was consistent evidence that the final value of DNR timber sales located in western Washington were negatively influenced by increases in the level of saw timber heterogeneity over the period of study. Heterogeneity among tree species was found to impact final sale value more than heterogeneity among saw log grades. A possible reason for this result is that commodity producers generally focus on a tree species or a certain range of grade classes. For instance a sawmill may be best geared to mill # 2 and # 3 saw logs, or perhaps a commodity producer uses only Douglas fir in the manufacture of its products. Increasing heterogeneity of saw timber in a lump sum framework forces these bidders to bid on greater volumes that they are not interested in and may in fact have to resell. This is believed to be viewed negatively by bidders as an additional cost of doing business. Alternative theories are likely to exist as well that can increase the cost of harvesting and marketing logs. The impacts of saw timber heterogeneity are not well serviced by the lump sum method of timber sale. Timber sales in which greater levels of saw timber diversity are observed may return greater revenues to the DNR if another method of sale is instituted. Additional empirical work on heterogeneous timber sales focusing on how the DNR can create bundles of timber from these sales attractive to different bidders would be pertinent. In addition to the effect of saw timber diversity, this study found significant evidence that an increased pool of bidders and therefore increased competition for a timber sale had a positive impact on the market value. However, the data indicates that the level of competitiveness declined over the period of study. The existence of a competitive framework among bidding firms is a key to achieving a final timber sale value at or near its true market value. Declines in the average number of bidders on timber sales in the data set may be caused by a number of factors. Regardless, these declines may be cause for concern and further research into why they are occurring and what can be done to alleviate the impacts would be relevant. The total acreage of timber sales in the study region displayed diseconomies of scale. While this result was not predicted, it is not uncommon in the literature. Munn and Rucker (1995) and Boltz et al. (2002) both found significant evidence that parcel size negatively impacts final sale value. However, this variable presents a clear focus for future study to explore why increasing parcel size results in reduced final sale value in western Washington. In understanding the implications of this variable it is important to consider who purchases DNR timber and industry shifts over the period of study. Research regarding how the DNR could increase the number of bids offered on its timber sales and alter its methods of sale would also be valuable. While increasing the competition among bidders is a good way of increasing the timber revenues annually generated by the DNR’s timber sale program, mill consolidation in the state of Washington suggests that there may not be a lot of room for this to occur. Additionally, the DNR would not want to adversely impact business relationships it has developed with large commodity producers. They represent a steady demand for the states timber as well as important sources of employment. Future economic research is needed to determine the feasibility and impact of attempts to improve competitiveness and marketing of DNR timber sales...|$|R
