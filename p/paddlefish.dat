5|$|<b>Paddlefish</b> (family Polyodontidae) are basal Chondrostean ray-finned fish.|$|E
5|$|American <b>paddlefish</b> are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} {{directed}} laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American <b>paddlefish</b> have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Chondrostean fish (sturgeons, <b>paddlefish,</b> and bichirs) {{possess a}} major {{site for the}} {{production}} of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the meninges (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, reticular cells and a small number of macrophages. The chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.|$|E
5000|$|Acipenseriformes [...] is {{an order}} of basal ray-finned fishes that {{includes}} the sturgeons and <b>paddlefishes,</b> {{as well as some}} extinct families.|$|R
5000|$|Actinopteri is {{the sister}} group of Cladistia. Dating {{back to the}} Permian period, the Actinopteri {{comprise}} the Chondrostei (sturgeons and <b>paddlefishes)</b> and the Neopterygii (bowfin, gars, and teleosts). In other words, the Actinopteri include all extant Actinopterygians, minus the Polypteridae (bichirs). The Actinopteri includes: ...|$|R
25|$|Ray-finned fishes, class Actinopterygii, {{differ from}} lobe-finned fishes in that their fins consist of webs of skin {{supported}} by spines ("rays") made of bone or horn. There are other differences in respiratory and circulatory structures. Ray-finned fishes normally have skeletons made from true bone, {{though this is}} not true of sturgeons and <b>paddlefishes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mammals in {{this area}} include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, and prairie dogs. The state bird, the ring-necked pheasant, has adapted well to the area after being {{introduced}} from China. Growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state, especially near the Missouri River. Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, bass, and other species. The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic <b>paddlefish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mammals in {{this area}} include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, beavers, and prairie dogs, while {{reptiles}} include the snapping turtle, the box turtle, and various types of snakes. The prairie rattlesnake is South Dakota's only venomous snake. Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, and bass, along with other species. The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic <b>paddlefish,</b> and chinook salmon, native to the Pacific Northwest, have been successfully introduced in Lake Oahe.|$|E
25|$|Dinosaur Provincial Park {{preserves}} {{an extraordinarily}} {{diverse group of}} freshwater vertebrates. Fish include sharks, rays (such as the durophage Myledaphus), <b>paddlefish,</b> bowfins, gars, and teleosts. Amphibians include frogs, salamanders, and the extinct albanerpetontids. Reptiles include lizards (such as the large monitor Palaeosaniwa), {{a wide range of}} turtles, crocodilians, and the fish-eating Champsosaurus. Mammal fossils from the park are relatively rare and consist of isolated teeth, fragmentary jaws with teeth, and tooth fragments from mouse-sized and shrew-sized animals. They include representatives of placental, marsupial, and multituberculate mammals.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{international}} wildlife {{trade is}} a key threat to biodiversity. Temporal genetic marketplace monitoring can determine if wildlife trade regulation efforts such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) are succeeding. Protected under CITES effective 1997, sturgeons and <b>paddlefishes,</b> the producers of black caviar, are flagship CITES species. Methodology/Principal Findings: We test whether CITES has limited the amount of fraudulent black caviar reaching the marketplace. Using mitochondrial DNA-based methods, we compare mislabeling in caviar and meat purchased in the New York City area pre and post CITES listing. Our recent sampling of this market reveals a decrease in mislabeled caviar (2006 – 2008; 10 %; n = 90) compared to pre-CITES implementation (1995 – 1996; 19 %; n = 95). Mislabeled caviar was found only in online purchase (n = 49 online/ 41 retail). Conclusions/Significance: Stricter controls on importing and exporting as per CITES policies may be having a positive conservation effect by limiting the amount of fraudulent caviar reaching the marketplace. Sturgeons and <b>paddlefishes</b> remain a conservation priority, however, due to continued overfishing and habitat degradation. Other marine and aquati...|$|R
50|$|This {{group has}} at times been {{classified}} with the sharks: {{this because the}} chondrosteans, like the latter, mostly lack bone, and their structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than of other bony fish; further, both groups lack scales (excluding the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include spiracles and, in sturgeons and <b>paddlefishes,</b> a heterocercal tail (the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin). However the fossil record suggests these fish have more characters {{in common with the}} Teleostei than their external appearance might suggest.|$|R
50|$|Chondrostei are {{primarily}} cartilaginous fish showing {{some degree of}} ossification. It is thought that the cartilaginous condition is derived, and that the ancestors of this group were bony fish with fully ossified skeletons. Members of this group share with the Elasmobranchii certain features such as the possession of spiracles, a heterocercal tail {{and the absence of}} scales. Nevertheless, the fossil record suggests they {{have more in common with}} the teleosts. The Chondrostei is probably a paraphyletic grouping; the fifty-two living species are divided among two orders, the Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and <b>paddlefishes),</b> and the Polypteriformes (reedfishes and bichirs).|$|R
25|$|Much of the state's lands {{were formed}} from {{sediment}} washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets. There are also {{many species of}} tree frogs, and fish such as sturgeon and <b>paddlefish.</b> In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape, and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four {{that have not yet}} received recognition.|$|E
25|$|Montana {{has been}} a {{destination}} for its world-class trout fisheries since the 1930s. Fly fishing for several species of native and introduced trout in rivers and lakes is popular for both residents and tourists throughout the state. Montana {{is the home of}} the Federation of Fly Fishers and hosts many of the organizations annual conclaves. The state has robust recreational lake trout and kokanee salmon fisheries in the west, walleye can be found {{in many parts of the}} state, while northern pike, smallmouth and largemouth bass fisheries as well as catfish and <b>paddlefish</b> can be found in the waters of eastern Montana. Robert Redford's 1992 film of Norman Mclean's novel, A River Runs Through It, was filmed in Montana and brought national attention to fly fishing and the state.|$|E
500|$|Chinese <b>paddlefish</b> are {{the closest}} extant {{relative}} of American <b>paddlefish.</b> [...] They are currently listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. [...] Several reports {{have suggested that}} Chinese <b>paddlefish</b> may now be extinct. The primary reasons for their decline {{are similar to those}} of American <b>paddlefish</b> and include overfishing, the construction of dams, and destruction of habitat. Unlike the planktivorous American <b>paddlefish,</b> Chinese <b>paddlefish</b> are strong swimmers, grow larger, and are opportunistic piscivores that feed on small fishes and crustaceans. [...] Some distinct morphological differences of Chinese <b>paddlefish</b> include a narrower, sword-like rostrum, and a protrusible mouth. [...] They also have fewer, thicker gill rakers than American <b>paddlefish.</b> The last confirmed sighting of a live Chinese <b>paddlefish</b> was made on the Yangtzee River on January 24, 2003. [...] From 2006 to 2008, scientists conducted surveys in an effort to locate the fish. [...] They used several boats, deployed 4762 setlines, 111 anchored setlines and 950 drift nets covering [...] on the upper Yangtze River, most of which lies within the protected area of the Upper Yangtze National Nature Reserve. [...] They did not catch a single fish. [...] They also used hydroacoustic equipment to monitor active sound in water (sonar), but were unable to confirm the presence of <b>paddlefish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ganoid {{scales are}} found in the sturgeons, <b>paddlefishes,</b> gars, bowfin, and bichirs. They are derived from cosmoid scales, with a layer of dentine in the place of cosmine, and a layer of {{inorganic}} bone salt called ganoine in place of vitrodentine. Most are diamond-shaped and connected by peg-and-socket joints. They are usually thick and have a minimal amount of overlap as compared to other scales. In sturgeons, the scales are greatly enlarged into armour plates along the sides and back, while in the bowfin the scales are greatly reduced in thickness to resemble cycloid scales (see above).|$|R
40|$|Sensory {{pathways}} implement filters that extract {{relevant information}} from the environment [1]. These filtering properties depend in intricate ways on the biophysical parameters of the underlying neuronal architecture. Understanding the link between computational aspects, such as response properties or spike statistics, and the underlying biophysics {{is a question that}} can be addressed with theoretical methods. Many primary sensory neurons operate in a mean-dri-ven regime, where mean intensity is represented by the average firing rate, while the temporal structure of the stimulus around its mean is encoded into the particular structure of the spike train in analogy to an irregular sampler [2]. Examples of neurons applying this strategy include the <b>paddlefish’s</b> electrosensory system [3], grass...|$|R
40|$|Jawed fishes that {{possess an}} {{elongated}} rostrum {{use it to}} either sense prey or to manipulate it, but not for both. The billfish rostrum, for instance, lacks any sensory function and is used to stun prey, while <b>paddlefishes</b> use their rostrum to detect and orient towards electric fields of plankton. Sturgeons search through the substrate with their electroreceptive rostrum, and engulf prey by oral suction. Here, we show that juvenile freshwater sawfish Pristis microdon are active predators that use their toothed rostrum — the saw — to both sense prey-simulating electric fields and capture prey. Prey encountered {{in the water column}} is attacked with lateral swipes of the saw that can stun and/or impale it. We compare sawfish to shovelnose rays, which share a common shovelnose ray-like ancestor and lack a saw. 2 page(s...|$|R
500|$|The American <b>paddlefish</b> (Polyodon spathula) is {{a species}} of basal ray-finned fish closely related to {{sturgeons}} in the order Acipenseriformes. Fossil records of <b>paddlefish</b> date back over 300million years, nearly 50million years before dinosaurs first appeared. [...] American <b>paddlefish</b> are smooth-skinned freshwater fish commonly called <b>paddlefish,</b> but are {{also referred to as}} Mississippi <b>paddlefish,</b> spoon-billed cats, or spoonbills. [...] They are one of only two extant species in the <b>paddlefish</b> family, Polyodontidae. The other is the critically endangered Chinese <b>paddlefish</b> (Psephurus gladius) endemic to the Yangtze River basin in China. [...] American <b>paddlefish</b> are often referred to as primitive fish, or relict species because they retain some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors, including a skeleton that is almost entirely cartilaginous, a paddle-shaped rostrum (snout) that extends nearly one-third their body length, and a heterocercal tail or caudal fin, much like that of sharks. American <b>paddlefish</b> are a highly derived fish because they have evolved with adaptations such as filter feeding. [...] Their rostrum and cranium are covered {{with tens of thousands of}} sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton, which is their primary food source.|$|E
500|$|American <b>paddlefish</b> are {{a popular}} sport fish where their populations are {{sufficient}} to allow such activity. [...] Areas {{where there are}} no self-sustaining populations rely on state and federal restocking programs to maintain a viable fishery. A 2009 report includes the following states as allowing American <b>paddlefish</b> sport fishing per their respective state and federal regulations: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota and Tennessee. [...] Since American <b>paddlefish</b> are filter-feeders, they will not take bait or lures, and must be caught by snagging. The official state record in Kansas is a [...] American <b>paddlefish</b> snagged in 2004; Montana, a [...] American <b>paddlefish</b> snagged in 1973; and in North Dakota, a [...] American <b>paddlefish</b> snagged in 2010.

500|$|The roe of American <b>paddlefish</b> can be {{processed}} into caviar similar in taste, color, size and texture to sevruga sturgeon caviar from the Caspian Sea. [...] Several cases of mislabeled American <b>paddlefish</b> roe sold as Caspian Sea caviar have been prosecuted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). [...] State and federal regulations restricting {{the harvest of}} American <b>paddlefish</b> populations in the wild, and the illegal trafficking of their roe are strictly enforced. Related violations such as the illegal transport of American <b>paddlefish</b> roe have resulted in convictions with substantial fines and prison sentences. <b>Paddlefish</b> are also protected under CITES, (Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora).|$|E
50|$|Until recently, electroreception {{was known}} only in vertebrates. Recent {{research}} has shown that bees can detect the presence and pattern of a static charge on flowers. Electroreception is found in lampreys, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, chimaeras), lungfishes, bichirs, coelacanths, sturgeons, <b>paddlefishes,</b> catfishes, gymnotiformes, elephantfishes, monotremes, and at least one species of cetacean. The electroreceptor organs in all these groups are derived embryologically from a mechanoreceptor system. In fishes they are developed from the lateral lines. In most groups electroreception is passive, where it is used predominantly in predation. Two groups of teleost fishes are weakly electric and engage in active electroreception; the Neotropical knifefishes (Gymnotiformes) and the African elephantfishes (Notopteroidei). A rare terrestrial exception is the Western long-beaked echidna which has about 2,000 electroreceptors on its bill, compared to 40,000 for its semi-aquatic monotreme relative, the duck-billed platypus.|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic fields (EMF) {{originate}} from {{both natural and}} anthropogenic sources. In the sea, natural sources include the Earth’s magnetic field, sea and tidal currents traveling through that field, and various processes within organisms. Electricity moving along cables and various other devices (as a part of renewable offshore energy development) produces both electric and electromagnetic fields. In addition, water currents and organisms moving through human-induced EMF create electric fields. The larger the organism and the closer {{it is to the}} cable, the larger the induced electric field. A potential issue is that some organisms detect electric and/or magnetic fields. Electric fields are detected by cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, and rays), as well as ratfishes, sturgeons, and <b>paddlefishes.</b> Some experiments imply that sea lamprey, European river lamprey, European eels, and Atlantic salmon can also detect these fields, although these taxa appear to be much less sensitive than the cartilaginous fishes, sturgeons, and <b>paddlefishes.</b> These animals use this capability for prey and mate detection and perhaps orientation. Among marine organisms, the ability to detect magnetic fields is known to occur in fishes (e. g., eel, trout, salmon, tuna, and sharks) as well as lobsters, turtles, and cetaceans. Several behavioral and physiological experiments imply that rockfishes and flatfishes might also be able to sense magnetic fields. Research implies that organisms may be able to sense EMF down to a few microteslas. Magnetic field detection is likely used by these organisms for orientation, navigation, and homing. It has been hypothesized that anthropogenic EMF might have {{some or all of the}} following effects on marine organisms: 1) Disrupt migrations and movements of marine organisms; 2) Disrupt successful search for prey; 3) Disrupt successful search for mates; 4) Disrupt successful avoidance of predators. To this end, we will first discuss the quite limited laboratory and field research available on this issue. We will then present the early results of our surveys that compare the fish and invertebrate assemblages inhabiting electrified and non-electrified cables in the Santa Barbara Channel, southern California...|$|R
5000|$|Sturgeons {{are among}} {{the largest and most}} ancient of ray finned fishes. They are placed, along with <b>paddlefishes</b> and {{numerous}} fossil groups, in the infraclass Chondrostei, which also contains the ancestors of all other bony fishes. The sturgeons themselves are not ancestral to modern bony fishes but are a highly specialized and successful offshoot of ancestral chondrosteans, retaining such ancestral features as a heterocercal tail, fin structure, jaw structure, and spiracle. They have replaced a bony skeleton with one of cartilage, and possess a few large bony plates instead of scales. Sturgeons are highly adapted for preying on bottom animals, which they detect with a row of sensitive barbels on the underside of their snouts. They protrude their very long and flexible “lips” to suck up food. Sturgeons are confined to temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Of 25 extant species, only two live in California, the green sturgeon and the white sturgeon (A. transmontanus). (Moyle 2002) ...|$|R
500|$|American <b>paddlefish</b> {{have small}} undeveloped eyes that are {{directed}} laterally. Unlike most fishes, American <b>paddlefish</b> hardly respond to overhead shadows or changes in illumination. Electroreception {{appears to have}} largely replaced vision as a primary sensory modality, which indicates a reliance on electroreceptors for detecting prey. [...] However, the rostrum is not their only means of food detection. [...] Some reports suggest a damaged rostrum would render American <b>paddlefish</b> less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health, but laboratory experiments and field research indicate otherwise. [...] As well as electroreceptors on the rostrum, American <b>paddlefish</b> have sensory pores covering {{nearly half of the}} skin surface extending from the rostrum {{to the top of the}} head down to the tips of the operculum flaps. Studies have indicated that American <b>paddlefish</b> with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health.|$|E
500|$|Fossil paddlefishes with {{recognizable}} rostrums {{date from}} the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene periods 65million years ago. [...] An elongated rostrum is a morphological characteristic of Polyodontidae, but only the genus Polyodon (P. spathula and the extinct P. tuberculata) have characteristics adapted specifically for filter feeding, including the jaw, gill arches, and cranium. [...] The gill rakers of American <b>paddlefish</b> are composed of extensive comb-like filaments believed to have inspired the etymology of the genus name, Polyodon, a Greek compound word meaning [...] "many toothed". [...] Adult American <b>paddlefish</b> are actually toothless, although numerous small teeth less than [...] were found in a juvenile <b>paddlefish</b> measuring [...] Spathula references the elongated, paddle shaped snout or rostrum.

40|$|Sturgeons (Chondrostei: Acipenseriformes) display {{markedly}} disjunct distributions {{with a wide}} {{occurrence in}} the northern hemisphere. Their unique benthic specializations, conserved morphology, evolutionary age, the variation in their basic diadromous life history, and the large public interest due to their near extinction or critically endangered status make sturgeons and <b>paddlefishes</b> {{one of the most}} interesting group of vertebrates. In addition to that, ploidy diversity of Acipenseriformes possessing three ploidy groups having ~ 120 chromosomes, ~ 240 ? 270 chromosomes and ~ 360 chromosomes provides unique model for investigation of evolutionary processes which were going through the genome duplication events. Sturgeons are also notoriously known for their strong propensity to interspecific and intergeneric hybridization which can result in hybrids with various ploidy levels. All these facts make sturgeon genetics and cytogenetics a thriving but also complicated area for research. In the present work, the role of genome duplication and functional reduction evens in evolution of sturgeon species as well as sturgeons? ploidy levels and ploidy relationships among Acipenseriformes were investigated using molecular markers. In addition to that, clarification of origin of abnormal ploidy levels and observation of segregation pattern of microsatellite alleles in the course of hybridization of polyploid sturgeon species were included into this study. With regard to the all considerations and observations provided by this study we concluded that evolution of sturgeon species is still widely dynamic and ongoing process which might goes through the allopolyplodization as well as autopolyplidization events...|$|R
