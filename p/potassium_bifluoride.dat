25|$|Elemental fluorine, F2, is {{prepared}} by electrolysis {{of a solution}} of HF and <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride.</b> The <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> is needed because anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not conduct electricity. Several million kilograms of F2 are produced annually.|$|E
25|$|French chemist Henri Moissan, {{formerly}} one of Frémy's students, {{continued the}} search. After trying many different approaches, he built on Frémy and Gore's earlier attempts by combining <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> and hydrogen fluoride. The resultant solution conducted electricity. Moissan also constructed especially corrosion-resistant equipment: containers crafted from {{a mixture of}} platinum and iridium (more chemically resistant than pure platinum) with fluorite stoppers.|$|E
25|$|Edmond Frémy {{thought that}} passing {{electric}} current through pure hydrofluoric acid (dry HF) might work. Previously, hydrogen fluoride was only {{available in a}} water solution. Frémy therefore devised a method for producing dry hydrogen fluoride by acidifying <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> (KHF2). Unfortunately, pure hydrogen fluoride did not pass an electric current. Frémy also tried electrolyzing molten calcium fluoride and probably produced some fluorine (since he made calcium metal at the other electrode), but {{he was unable to}} collect the gas.|$|E
50|$|Other {{inorganic}} fluorides made {{in large}} quantities include cobalt difluoride (for organofluorine synthesis), nickel difluoride (electronics), lithium fluoride (a flux), sodium fluoride (water fluoridation), potassium fluoride (flux), and ammonium fluoride (various). Sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluorides</b> are significant to the chemical industry.|$|R
50|$|All the {{alkali metals}} form monofluorides. All have the sodium {{chloride}} (rock salt) structure and are {{soluble in water}} and even some alcohols. Because the fluoride anion is highly basic, many alkali metal fluorides form bifluorides with the formula MHF2. Sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluorides</b> are significant to the chemical industry. Among other monofluorides, only silver(I) and thallium(I) fluorides are well-characterized. Both are very soluble, unlike the other halides of those metals.|$|R
25|$|The {{first attempt}} at {{trying to find the}} {{covalent}} radius of fluorine was in 1938, by Brockway. Brockway prepared a vapour of F2 molecules by means of the electrolysis of <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> (KHF2) in a fluorine generator, which was constructed of Monel metal. Then, the product was passed over potassium fluoride so as to remove any hydrogen fluoride (HF) and to condense the product into a liquid. A sample was collected by evaporating the condensed liquid into a Pyrex flask. Finally, using electron diffraction, it was determined that the bond length between the two fluorine atoms was about 145pm. He therefore assumed that the covalent radius of fluorine was half this value, or 73pm. This value, however, is inaccurate due to the large electronegativity and small radius of fluorine atom.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{studies on}} {{fluorine}} were so dangerous that several 19th-century experimenters were deemed [...] "fluorine martyrs" [...] after misfortunes with hydrofluoric acid. Isolation of elemental fluorine was hindered by the extreme corrosiveness of both elemental fluorine itself and hydrogen fluoride, {{as well as}} the lack of a simple and suitable electrolyte. Edmond Frémy postulated that electrolysis of pure hydrogen fluoride to generate fluorine was feasible and devised a method to produce anhydrous samples from acidified potassium bifluoride; instead, he discovered that the resulting (dry) hydrogen fluoride did not conduct electricity. Frémy's former student Henri Moissan persevered, and after much trial and error found that a mixture of <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> and dry hydrogen fluoride was a conductor, enabling electrolysis. To prevent rapid corrosion of the platinum in his electrochemical cells, he cooled the reaction to extremely low temperatures in a special bath and forged cells from a more resistant mixture of platinum and iridium, and used fluorite stoppers. In 1886, after 74 years of effort by many chemists, Moissan isolated elemental fluorine.|$|E

50|$|Some HF2− salts are common, {{examples}} include <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> (KHF2, also called potassium hydrogen fluoride) and ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2).

50|$|Fluorine is {{produced}} by the electrolysis of molten <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride.</b> This electrolysis proceeds more efficiently when the electrolyte contains a few percent of LiF, possibly because it facilitates formation of Li-C-F interface on the carbon electrodes. A useful molten salt, FLiNaK, consists of a mixture of LiF, together with sodium fluoride and potassium fluoride. The primary coolant for the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment was FLiBe; LiF-BeF2 (66-33 mol%).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Efficient {{cleavage}} of sterically hindered boronic esters of asymmetric diols {{to recover}} both the diol {{and a more}} reactive borane derivative has been a challenging problem. A remarkable borosilicate glass-catalyzed cleavage with thionyl chloride and imidazole proved less useful than hoped for. <b>Potassium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> converts boronic esters to diols and alkyltrifluoroborates. These with chlorosilanes yield alkyldifluoroboranes, which with alkyl azides form secondary amines in high enantiopurity...|$|E

These gold bifluorides were shown to be efficient catalysts in the hydrofluorination of symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes, thus affording fluorinated stilbene analogues and fluorovinyl thioethers in good to excellent yields with high stereo-and regioselectivity.

40|$|Observations on the {{reflection}} spectrum of <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> {{have recently been}} reported [1] which appear to confirm the symmetrical linear structure of the bifluoride ion in this crystal. Some time ago absorption spectra of single crystals of KHF 2 using polarized infrared radiation were obtained in this laboratory which both confirm this work and supplement it. Owing to the improved resolution of complex absorption regions which we obtained at low temperatures it seems worthwhile to present these results briefly. The spectrum is possibly unique in the wealth of combination and overtone bands which arise from a crystal of structure so simple that a detailed interpretation may be anticipated...|$|E
40|$|The {{potassium}} pentafluorophenylfluoroborates {{were prepared}} by hydroxy-fluoride-substitution of fluoroorganoalkoxyboranes and -borates with <b>potassium</b> <b>bifluoride.</b> Those intermediate boranes and borates {{were obtained by}} the reaction of fluoroorganomagnesium reagents and alkoxyboranes. The introduction {{of one or two}} pentafluorophenylgroups into various alkoxyboranes is investigated to optimize the yield of potassium pentafluorophenyltrifluoroborate and bis(pentafluorophenyl) difluoroborate. Reactions of pentafluorophenylfluoroborates with the Lewis acids borontrifluoride and tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane show the Lewis acidity of pentafluorophenyldifluoroborane compared with borontrifluoride and tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane. Pentalfuorophenylfluoroborate salts reacted with iodinepentafluoride by transfer of a pentafluorophenylgroup to iodinepentafluoride. To develop an alternative method to fluorooganofluoroborates systematic investigations on the reactivity of fluoroorganoboranes to fluorides were undertaken. Potassium- 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctyltrifluoroborate is prepared by the reaction of an organogrignard reagent with chlorodimethoxyborane and hydrolysis and hydoxy-fluoride-substitution of the product.
