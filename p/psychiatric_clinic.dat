5|$|Because {{he was a}} war veteran, Reich {{was allowed}} to {{complete}} a combined bachelor's and M.D. in four years instead of six, and graduated in July 1922. After graduating he worked in internal medicine at the city's University Hospital, and studied neuropsychiatry from 1922 to 1924 at the hospital's neurological and <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinic</b> under Professor Julius Wagner von Jauregg, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, William Payne Whitney's $27 million {{donation}} led to {{the building}} of the Payne Whitney <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>Clinic,</b> which became the name for Weill Cornell's large psychiatric effort. That same year, the college became affiliated with New York Hospital and the two institutions moved to their current joint campus in 1932. The hospital's Training School for Nurses became affiliated with the university in 1942, operating as the Cornell Nursing School until it closed in 1979.|$|E

5|$|In April 1930, Zelda was {{admitted}} to a sanatorium in France where, after months of observation and treatment and a consultation with one of Europe's leading psychiatrists, Doctor Eugen Bleuler, she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Initially admitted to a hospital outside Paris, she was later moved to a clinic in Montreux, Switzerland. The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was moved to a psychiatric facility, in Prangins {{on the shores of}} Lake Geneva. She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's bereavement, Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated. By February 1932, she had returned to living in a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinic.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 2001, Bouchard's {{successor}} Bernard Landry, who had {{until then}} {{lived in a}} three-room apartment, {{announced that he would}} accept the SITQ offer of the Édifice Price apartment, and took up occupancy in November. The choice, although praised for its symbolic location, attracted criticism that the apartment, rather small and poorly lit, could not accommodate a family (Landry was widowed from his first wife at the time). Some also noted that the former Lieutenant-Governor's residence, located at 1010 Chemin Saint-Louis and sold in 1996 for a fraction of its estimated value, would have made an excellent choice. From 1997 an exclusive <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinic</b> had occupied the Price Building's second and third floors. This was moved out in 2002; the administration strongly affirmed the timing with the Premier's installation to be a complete coincidence.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, he {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} come to the United States and work under Adolf Meyer at the Phipps <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>Clinic</b> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.

He moved to New York City in 1932 to accept a senior staff position at the Bellevue Mental Hygiene Clinic, the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinic</b> connected with the New York Court of General Sessions in which all convicted felons received a psychiatric examination that was used in court. In 1935 he testified for the defense in the trial of Albert Fish, declaring him insane. In 1946, Wertham opened the Lafargue Clinic in the basement of St. Philip's Church in Harlem, a low-cost <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinic</b> specializing in black teenagers.

40|$|Abstract Objective We {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) on disability and health-related {{quality of life in}} outpatients treated in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinics</b> via a secondary analysis conducted in 799 patients from a cross-sectional study of prevalence of GAD in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinics.</b> Methods Patients were allocated into two groups: follow-up (15. 7 %) and newly diagnosed patients (84. 3 %), and were administered the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and 36 -item short form structured quality of life questionnaire (SF- 36) scales. Results The newly diagnosed group showed higher significant intensity of anxiety (56. 9 % vs 43. 0 % (HAM-A > 24)), psychiatrist's CGI Severity (CGI-S) scores (4. 2 vs 3. 7), and perceived stress according to SDS (5. 7 vs 5. 2). They also showed lower scores in mental health-related quality of life: 25. 4 vs 30. 8. Statistical differences by gender were not observed. GAD was shown to {{have a significant impact on}} patient quality of life and disability, with a substantial portion having persistent, out of control symptoms despite treatment. Conclusions These results suggest that there is still room for improvement in the medical management of patients with GAD treated in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinics.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|This article aims to {{contribute}} to the understanding concerning the introduction of crisis psychotherapy in the 1970 s in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinics</b> in Sweden. The article discusses how this psychotherapy became central {{in the work of the}} clinics in supporting patients to well-being and inner growth. The ambition was that patients in an acute crisis-situation would be offered care immediately, aiming at a short and intensive contact with the professionals to avoid hospitalization and long-term sick leave. These ideas were by no means new; in the 1960 s, a Western debate had emerged in which the hospitalization in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinics</b> had received criticism. In Sweden, the psychiatrist Johan Cullberg was a key actor during the 1970 s in the introduction of the psychiatric crisis perspectives. Here, his publication ‘The psychic trauma’ from 1971 is analysed. The publication inspired <b>psychiatric</b> <b>clinics</b> to introduce crisis psychotherapy in three different pilot projects. The projects were presented in articles in the Swedish Medical Journal. These articles have also been analysed here. Self-care is highlighted through this material as a concept to be analysed. The question is discussed as to how the concept of the psychiatric crisis initiated and institutionalized a new form of social classification in which the patients were to take more responsibility for their own inner growth...|$|R
