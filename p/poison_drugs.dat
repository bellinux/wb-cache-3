40|$|BACKGROUND The Slovenian Register of Intoxications {{managed by}} the Poison Control Centre at LjubljanaUniversity Medical Centre was {{established}} in 2001. It offers a continuous review ofpoisoning in Slovenia. Our aim was to study the epidemiology of acute <b>drug</b> <b>poisoning</b> inadult patients admitted to hospitals in Slovenia. METHODS We analyzed the data of reported acutely poisoned patients older than 16 years who weretreated in hospitals in Slovenia between 2001 and 2005. RESULTS A total of 1, 838 adult acutely poisoned patients were reported to the Register of Intoxicationsbetween 2001 and 2005, of whom 1, 234 (67 %) were <b>poisoned</b> by <b>drugs.</b> 67 % ofpatients <b>poisoned</b> by <b>drugs</b> were women and 76 % of patients ingested drugs at home 85 % of patients ingested drugs in suicide attempts. Anxyolytics, hypnotics, sedatives, antipsychoticsand antidepressants represented 68 % of all ingested drugs due to self-poisoning. Drugs for the musculo-skeletal system and drugs for the cardiovascular system followedpoisoning by these drugs. There were 6 benzodiazepines and related drugs betweenthe 10 most commonly ingested drugs due to self-poisoning. The most common signs ofacute <b>drug</b> <b>poisoning</b> were somnolence and coma (75 %). A gastric lavage was performedin 64 % of patients, active charcoal was given to 73 % of patients and 35 % of patients weretreated with an antidote. CONCLUSIONS <b>Poisoning</b> by <b>drugs</b> for the nervous system, particularly benzodiazepines, is the most commonform of <b>poisoning</b> by <b>drugs</b> in Slovenia. It {{would be necessary to}} report all acutelypoisoned patients to the Register of Intoxications, since we need data about all poisoningin Slovenia to improve their prophylaxis and treatmen...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: Acute <b>drug</b> <b>poisoning</b> is a {{major public}} health problem in the world. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{investigate}} the trends and characteristics of acute <b>drug</b> <b>poisoning</b> and to compare that with other poisonings in Gorgan, Iran. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was done from March 2008 to march 2015. Data were obtained from medical records. Stata software and Pearson's chi-squared test were used for data analysis. Results: A total of 800 poisoning cases, 573 cases were due to <b>drug</b> <b>poisoning.</b> The majority of the 573 patients (50. 8 male) were in the age range of 20 - 29 years (47. 8) and 78 of them were living in urban areas. The maximum number of poisoning occurred during summer season (27). The most common agents involved in acute <b>drug</b> <b>poisoning</b> were sedatives-hypnotics <b>drugs,</b> especially BZDs (37. 2), followed by Tramadol (17. 3) and Cardiac <b>drugs</b> (13. 1). <b>Poisoning</b> most commonly occurred as ingestion of single drug (55). More than half (77. 1) of the cases were intentional poisoning (suicide), followed by overdose (63. 1), drug abuse (51. 9) and accidental poisoning (17. 3). Moreover, the most common drug involved in intentional poisoning was BZDs (44). 9 patients (1. 6) died, of which 3 (33. 3) were due to Narcotic drugs. Conclusion: Drugs were the most common cause of poisonings and the majority of acute <b>drug</b> <b>poisoning</b> in Gorgan was associated with suicide attempts.
