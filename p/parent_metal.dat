40|$|Abstract: Ultrasonic {{inspection}} of dissimilar welds {{is still a}} challenge due to the different acoustic impedances across the interfaces between <b>parent</b> <b>metals,</b> welded, butter or cladded regions. Typically <b>parent</b> <b>metals</b> are fine grained carbon/ferritic/ 20 MnMoNi 55 steel, which show isotropic character. Whereas weld/butter/cladded metals are INCONEL / austenitic steel, which exhibit anisotropic character, attributed to their columnar grained texture resulting from the high thermal inputs during welding process. The ultrasound wave propagation through such anisotropic materials is not straightforward due to the skewing of energy flow direction {{with respect to the}} direction of phase velocity. Therefore the analysis of the experimental data necessitates many years of experience. A simple theoretical model based on ray-tracing concepts can help to optimize the ultrasonic experimental procedures for the detection of transverse defects (defects with their orientation perpendicular to the welding direction) at the inner surface of the pipe in the circumferential weld.

50|$|There {{has been}} much {{interest}} in determining the mechanisms that govern the increase of thickness of the oxide layer over time. Some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to {{the volume of the}} <b>parent</b> <b>metal,</b> the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the <b>parent</b> <b>metal,</b> and the relative chemical potential of the oxide. Boundaries between micro grains, if the oxide layer is crystalline, form an important pathway for oxygen to reach the unoxidized metal below. For this reason, vitreous oxide coatings - which lack grain boundaries - can retard oxidation. The conditions necessary (but not sufficient) for passivation are recorded in Pourbaix diagrams. Some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer {{on the surface of the}} metals to which they are applied. Some compounds, dissolving in solutions (chromates, molybdates) form non-reactive and low solubility films on metal surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is {{commonly}} used for fabricating large diameter linepipes, pressure vessels and wind turbine towers due to its high deposition rate, high quality welds, ease of automation and low operator skill requirement. In order to achieve high melting efficiency required for high productivity, best weld quality and good mechanical properties in manufacturing industries, the welding process parameters need to be optimized. In this study, the effect of SAW current and speed on the physical and mechanical properties of ASME SA 516 Gr. 70 (pressure vessel steel) and ASTM A 709 Gr. 50 (wind turbine tower steel) were investigated. Three welding currents (700 A, 800 A and 850 A) and four travel speeds (5. 9, 9. 3, 12. 3 and 15. 3 mm/s) were used to weld sample plates measuring 915 mm x 122 mm x 17 mm. The weld quality and properties were evaluated using weld geometry measurements, visual inspection, ultrasonic inspection, hardness measurements, optical microscopy, tensile testing, Charpy impact testing and scanning electron microscopy. It {{was found that the}} physical and mechanical properties of the weldments were affected by SAW parameters. Severe undercuts were found at high travel speed and welding current. Low heat input caused lack of penetration defects to form in the weldments. The welding process melting efficiency (WPME) achieved was up to 80 %. The hardness of the coarse grain heat affected zone (CGHAZ) and the weld metal increased with travel speed. The toughness of both materials increased with increasing travel speed and welding current. The yield and tensile strengths of the weldments of SA 516 Gr. 70 and A 709 Gr. 50 steels were within the same range as those of their respective <b>parent</b> <b>metals</b> because all test specimens broke in the <b>parent</b> <b>metals.</b> Also, the <b>parent</b> <b>metals</b> of both steels had the highest fracture strain and percent elongation.

40|$|Preferential weld {{corrosion}} (PWC) has posed {{a problem}} to {{the oil and gas}} industry for a number of years. The general consensus from authors is that environmental effects take precedence over the weld chemical composition and microstructure. Therefore, the primary approach is to ensure the correct corrosion inhibitor selection and application to prevent PWC. Although there has been considerable focus directed toward the effect of flow rate on PWC in inhibited carbon dioxide (CO 2) -saturated environments, the consideration of a higher, localized turbulence over the weld material and the implications this has on PWC appears minimal. This paper considers this effect by reviewing the performance of a commercially available, film-forming oilfield corrosion inhibitor using a submerged impinging jet (SIJ). The dual nozzle arrangement of the SIJ allowed a carbon steel <b>parent</b> <b>metal</b> and a 1 % Ni, 0. 25 % Mo weld material to be subjected to the same brine chemistry, but different flow conditions. The velocity over the <b>parent</b> <b>metal</b> was kept constant at 7 m/s while the weld material was subjected to velocities of 7, 8. 8, and 11. 4 m/s to simulate different severities of turbulence. Galvanic current and linear polarization resistance (LPR) measurements were used to assess the weld resistance to PWC. Although the weld was shown to be cathodic to the <b>parent</b> <b>metal,</b> increasing velocity and turbulence at the weld relative to the <b>parent</b> <b>metal</b> was found to reduce the galvanic current, suggesting increased susceptibility of the weld to corrosion. The addition of inhibitor at 100 ppm accentuated this effect and led to a reversal of the galvanic current when the relative velocities were 7 m/s and 11. 4 m/s for the <b>parent</b> <b>metal</b> and weld, respectively.

Corresponding variations of the surface chemical composition have been monitored using AES and SSIMS. On the basis of these results and of previously obtained SEY results on metals and metal oxides the origin of the SEY variations is discussed. The SEY increase, which is generally observed during long lasting air exposures of clean metals, is mainly caused by the adsorption of an airborne carbonaceous contamination layer. The estimated value of about 3 for the maximum SEY of this layer is higher than that of all pure metals. Only in some cases the air-formed oxide can contribute to the air exposure induced SEY increase while many oxides have a lower SEY than their <b>parent</b> <b>metals.</b> From the experimental data it can also be excluded that the SEY increase during air exposures is mainly due to an increased {{secondary electron}} escape probability...|$|R
