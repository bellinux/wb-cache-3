One of the main challenges in this domain consists in efficiently and safely managing dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) resources. This paper focuses on {{the management of the}} reconfiguration by an hypervisor on an ARM-FPGA platform. Using the virtualization approach, virtual machines (VM) may access resources independently, being unaware of the existence of other VMs. The purpose of our work is to provide an abstract and transparent interface for virtual machines to access reconfigurable resources. The underlying infrastructure of partial reconfiguration management is hidden from the virtual machines, so that software developers do not need to consider the implementation details. We propose a framework where DPR accelerators are presented as virtual devices, which are universally mapped in each VM space as ordinary peripherals. The hypervisor automatically detects VM's requests for DPR resources and handles them dynamically according to a <b>preemptive</b> <b>allocation</b> mechanism. Our custom hypervisor guarantees the independent and isolation of VM domains. We also evaluate the efficiency of our framework by measuring the critical overheads during DPR management and allocations. The results demonstrate that our mechanism is implemented with low overhead. © 2016 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the scheduling of multiclass jobs with deadlines to {{the completion of}} their service. Deadlines are deterministic and job arrivals in each class occur at the times of deadline expirations in the respective class. Assuming geometric service times with class dependent means, we derive structural properties of <b>preemptive</b> server <b>allocation</b> policies that maximize the expected number of job completions. Our work extends results that {{have appeared in the}} real-time wireless scheduling literature...|$|R

The objective is to minimize the makespan (i. e., the completion time of the last job to finish executing). We characterize a parallel job, J i,bytwo parameters: its execution time, l i,and its parallelism, P i, which may vary over time. The preemption and reallocation of processors can take place at any time. We devise a preemptive policy which achieves the best possible competitive ratio and then derive upper and lower bounds for scheduling N parallel jobs on P processors. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} perform lot arrival {{forecast}} at work center level is a key requirement for pro-active FAB operation management. Visibility to this information enables <b>preemptive</b> resource <b>allocation</b> and bottleneck management. Today, the work center lot arrival forecast is achieved {{through the use of}} short term simulation technique in Infineon Dresden. High fidelity simulation model that includes detailed modeling feature such as attribute-based sampling procedure, dedication and temporary tool blocking is built automatically through the transformation of data queries from data sources. In this paper, we present the results of our model validation work, comparing the FAB and forecasted lot arrival of the defect density measurement work center. Due to the high capacity demand of automotive product that requires more than 20 inspection steps; engineering lots and preventive maintenance of DDM must be scheduled at the right time. This can only be achieved with high quality lot arrival forecast. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} <b>preemptive</b> channel <b>allocations</b> (PCA) for multiple-sector cellular networks, where directional antennas {{are used}} to divide the coverage of a cell {{into a number of}} same-sized sectors. When traffic in a sector unexpectedly increases, call blocking probability will increase accordingly. To remedy channel insufficient problem in a single sector, two aspects of channel preemptions are utilized. First, to reduce the blocking probability of new calls, the proposed PCA allows a new call to preempt an ongoing call when the ongoing call is located in the overlapping regions of two adjacent sectors or two neighboring cells. Second, the reserved channels not only can be used by the handoff calls, but also by the preempted calls. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we build an analytical model with four-tuple Markov chains. Numerical results show that the proposed PCA scheme improve the system performance in terms of the blocking and preemption probabilities.
