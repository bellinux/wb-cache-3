40|$|This master thesis {{was carried}} out at ELFA, {{one of the largest}} {{catalogue}} distributors of electronics in northern Europe. ELFA offers a wide selection of products such as measuring instruments, fuses and screwdrivers. The master thesis handles the possibilities of an increase in the internal flow of products. The background to this problem is ELFA’s acquisition of two new companies, which brought the product range in the warehouse from 55 000 to 80 000 products. This increase brought a bigger flow through all the functions of the company. To be able to keep the expense at today’s level, an increase in capacity was wished for, without any increase in workforce, which resulted in that the efficiency had to increase. While mapping the flow, the function for unpacking and registering of the goods was discovered to be the bottleneck of the flow and therefore focus was set on this part for a deeper mapping. The goods deliveries to ELFA are uneven, not only between days but also during the hours of the day. This causes problem when there during some periods are overcapacity and during other are there not enough capacity {{to be able to keep}} the goals that are set. Making better use of the available capacity in the unpacking function is thus necessary. It is therefore important to even out the flow. The analysis of the bottleneck resulted in a couple of proposals for improvement. These include higher demands on suppliers and proposals for a better use of the capacity in the bottleneck. The higher demands on suppliers mainly address their <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> <b>marking</b> of their products. To that comes demands on suppliers to deliver in a smaller delivery window and more accurate deliveries in time. The suggestions for even out the flow mainly consist of making the selection process of products with shortage better to be able to make a separate buffer for these products. These would then be taken care of before the products without a shortage. The other buffer, with products without a shortage, would fill the purpose of even out the flow. In addition, other smaller proposals have also been presented in the purpose of increasing the capacity. If the proposals that have been presented are carried out in full, the writers believe that a significant increase in the capacity is possible and will solve the problems that today limits ELFA in their work...|$|E
40|$|The {{name and}} the topic of this diploma thesis, Crash {{simulation}} vehicle carrying explosives, impacts and solutions, illustrates its main goal. That is, using the TerEx software program, to simulate a crash of vehicle transporting explosives, the impacts resulting from such an incident and, as a secondary goal, to propose solutions of such an incident for the Emergency Service units, with the connection to public safety. After resolving these tasks, {{it will be possible}} to answer the research question: What are the dangers of a crash of vehicle transporting explosives? In the beginning, the theoretical part of the thesis focuses on explosives as such. The history of their inventions, usage and development is outlined. In the next chapter, explosives are defined as substances capable of explosive transformation that can release a large amount of energy in a very short time upon a sudden external impulse. For the classification of explosives, it was necessary to characterize types of explosive transformations and general principles that lead to releasing energy. Very important are then the theoretical chapters of this thesis, where are described in detail the effects and phenomena of an explosion, which are necessary for the identification of imminent harmful effects and impacts on the environment in the case of their unwanted initiation. These phenomena include shock wave, thermal and fragmentational effect, recoil, routing, blocking and multiplication of the shock wave. Follows the part, where explosives are classified according to various aspects, from which the most important is the aspect of speed of explosive transformation, which cardinally affects the explosives' properties. This part is followed by a chapter that describes those characteristics. The second half of the theoretical part is concerned with transportation of hazardous materials, especially explosives. <b>Packing</b> <b>and</b> <b>marking</b> requirements, duties of transportation participants and training of the participants are specified there. One must not forget traffic requirements and other necessities connected with transportation, including the need for accompanying documents, transport staff, traffic unit, its construction and equipment and the course of transportation. The last section of the theoretical part of this thesis is dedicated to specific rules of explosives' transportation, which in the Czech Republic are set by the law. It includes mainly a duty to notify the Police Prezidium of the Czech Republic at least 24 hours prior to transportation of explosives and the duty for the vehicle used for transportation to be equipped with a tracking device. In this sense the explosives are the only group of hazardous materials, for which these stricter rules apply. In order to find an answer to the research question, it was necessary in the empirical part of the thesis to gather input data for the TerEx program, where the event was then simulated. These data were collected by an analysis of usage and occurrence of explosives in the area of the South Bohemian region. On the basis of this analysis, a highly brisant explosive NKG- 500, which is commonly used for quarrying, special destructive works, underwater tasks and for priming of industrial explosives. It is a place, where the density and complexity of traffic has not yet been tackled accordingly. On the basis of output from thus performed simulation it was possible to assess that in such a densely populated area with the large number of residential and administrative buildings an accident of vehicle transporting explosives poses a considerable threat. In connection with the threats and impacts discovered in relation with such an incident, a unified course of action of the Emergency Service for their solution was designed, whereupon specific actions of its respective units were considered...|$|E

5000|$|Up {{until the}} early 1870s, Australian {{football}} was typically played {{low to the ground}} in congested rugby-style <b>packs,</b> <b>and</b> as such <b>marks</b> were generally taken on the chest. Occasional high marks were recorded; as early as 1862 a Melbourne Football Club player was praised for leaping [...] "wonderfully high into the air" [...] to mark the ball. Spectacular marks became more common in the 1880s, a time in which the game's style of play opened up and teams adopted positional structures resembling those in use today. Essendon's Charlie [...] "Commotion" [...] Pearson was a prominent high flyer of this period. An 1886 match report captured the excitement his aerial skills were generating: [...] "Mr Pearson ... gave spectators many thrilling moments with his phenomenal leaps skyward. What a thrill the game would become as a spectacle if all players tried out this new idea." [...] Albert Thurgood was a later exponent {{at the turn of the}} century. Dick Lee pulled down consistent high marks in the early 1900s. In South Australia Harold Oliver was considered the best exponent of the high flying mark prior to World War I.|$|R
