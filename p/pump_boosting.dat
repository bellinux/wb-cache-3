50|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} {{obtained}} by tapping {{the heat of}} the earth itself. Most systems in Scotland provide heating through a ground source heat pump which brings energy to the surface via shallow pipe works. An example is the Glenalmond Street project in Shettleston, which uses a combination of solar and geothermal energy to heat 16 houses. Water in a coal mine 100 m below ground level is heated by geothermal energy and maintained at a temperature of about 12 °C (54 °F) throughout the year. The warmed water is raised and passed through a heat <b>pump,</b> <b>boosting</b> the temperature to 55 °C (131 °F), and is then distributed to the houses providing heating to radiators.|$|E
40|$|Experimental results: To {{verify the}} {{effectiveness}} of the charge <b>pump</b> <b>boosting</b> circuit, one PLL with a charge <b>pump</b> <b>boosting</b> cir-cuit and another one without a boosting circuit (the same as the conventional PLL) have been implemented in a 0. 8 ~ CMOS technology. Fig. 3 shows the maximum frequency to which both PLLs can lock with a supply voltage change. The proposed PLL can be locked to 672 MHz at 3. 3 V supply, which is- 1. 9 times the maximum frequency of the conventional PLL. The jitter measure-ment results are as follows. When the supply noise is not injected, the rms jitter is 8. 3 ps and the peak-to-peak jitter is 56 ps. When 0. 6 V peak-to-peak supply noise is superposed with Vdd, the rms jit-ter is 67 ps and the peak-to-peak jitter is 270 ps when the operating frequency is 592 MHz, the source follower enters the linear region. As the PLL does not have enough noise margin at that condition, the jitter becomes larger abruptly, resulting in 161 ps (rms) and 512 ps (peak-to-peak) jitter. 700 I...|$|E
40|$|District {{heating systems}} are {{important}} components in an energy efficient heat supply. With {{increasing amounts of}} renewable energy, the foundation for district heating is changing and the approach to its planning will have to change. Reduced temperatures of district heating are proposed {{as a solution to}} adapt it to future renewable energy systems. This study compares three alternative concepts for district heating temperature level: Low temperature (55 / 25 oC), Ultra-low temperature with electric boosting (45 / 25 oC), and Ultra-low temperature with heat <b>pump</b> <b>boosting</b> (35 / 20 oC) taking into account the grid losses, production efficiencies and building requirements. The scenarios are modelled and analysed in the analysis tool EnergyPLAN and compared on primary energy supply and socioeconomic costs.

50|$|In the APU, a fuel <b>pump</b> <b>boosted</b> the {{hydrazine}} {{pressure and}} fed it to a gas generator.

The gearbox drove the fuel pump, its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump. As described so far, the system could not self-start, since the fuel pump was driven by the turbine it supplied fuel to. Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the fuel pump outlet pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the fuel pump.|$|R
