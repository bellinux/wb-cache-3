2500|$|According to Dov Yosef {{the turning}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Nachshon was {{the death of}} Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni on 8 April. 30,000 people {{attended}} his funeral at the Haram al-Sharif and subsequently the morale of his forces collapsed. The end of the siege came {{with the opening of}} the [...] "Burma Road" [...] in June. In Yosef's words, [...] "by the time the first truce (11 June 1948) came it had already broken the siege." [...] This alternative route had been conceived in April after the failure of Nachshon to secure the entrance to the road to Jerusalem at Latrun. Work started on 18 May using bulldozers and several hundred quarrymen from Jerusalem. The major problem was a very steep section at the beginning of the ascent. After two weeks some supplies came through using mules and 200 men from the Home Guard (Mishmar Ha'am) to cover the three miles which were impassable to vehicles. These men, mostly conscripts in their fifties, each carried a 45-pound load and made the trip twice a night. This effort lasted for five nights. Three weeks later, 10 June, the steepest section was opened to vehicles, though they needed assistance from tractors to get up it. By the end of June the usual nightly convoy delivered 100 tons of supplies a night. Harry Levin in his diary entry, 7 June, says that 12 tons a night were getting through and he estimated that the city needed 17 tons daily. On 28 July he notes that during the first truce, 11 June to 8 July, 8,000 truckloads arrived. This remained the sole supply route for several months until the opening of the Valor Road (Kvish Hagevurah).|$|E
