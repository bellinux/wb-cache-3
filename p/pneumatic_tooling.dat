5000|$|A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool,</b> air tool, air-powered tool or pneumatic-powered tool {{is a type}} {{of power}} tool, driven by {{compressed}} air, supplied by an air compressor. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> can also be driven by compressed carbon dioxide (...) stored in small cylinders allowing for portability. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> are safer to run and maintain than their electric power tool equivalents, and have a higher power-to-weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task. General grade <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> with short life span are commonly cheaper and are also called disposable tools in tooling industries while industrial grade <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> with long life span are more expensive. In general, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> are cheaper than the equivalent electric-powered tools.|$|R

40|$|A {{simulated}} drywall plastering {{task was}} used in this study to evaluate the potential health and safety benefits of using a pneumatic drywall finishing system. The plastering task was performed in a controlled job setting. Muscular exertion while performing the plastering task was measured using electromyography (EMG). Usability questionnaires were given to all participants. Mixed findings were observed for the EMG dependent variables. Significant reduction in the number and duration of muscular rest and static load level were observed for the left forearm flexor muscles when working with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> However, significant increase in the median and peak load level were observed in the right forearm flexor muscle when working with the Apla-Tech <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> The usability questionnaire indicated {{that a majority of the}} workers preferred the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> The use of ladders and rolling scaffolds was reduced when working with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> because the tool allowed all workers to reach higher corners and ceiling height. Based on the EMG measures, tool preference and reduction of risk of traumatic slips and falls indicate that the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> is an effective tool for applying compound onto drywall joints. Further studies in the field setting to verify the effectiveness of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> should be conducted...|$|R

5000|$|Chicago Pneumatic is a {{brand name}} in the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> {{industry}} with a history traced back to 1889. John W. Duntley had in mind the idea of sourcing and selling construction tools [...] "that werenâ€™t yet available". In 1894, he established the Chicago <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tool</b> Company, with an office in Chicago. The first plant to begin manufacturing product specifically for CP was the Boyer Machine Shop in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1901, Duntley met steel magnate Charles M. Schwab, who invested heavily in the company. On December 28, the company was incorporated and the first single-valve pneumatic hammer was patented.|$|R

Atlas Copco then {{became one of the}} world's largest manufacturers of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> and monitoring systems. At the end of the 1980s the company's geographical foothold grew and assortments expanded due to several acquisitions including the French company Ets.

40|$|The United States Navy {{incorporates}} {{many different}} occupations to ensure it achieves its overall mission. These occupations are extremely diversified and present {{a wide spectrum}} of occupational exposures. Many of these exposures have been well studied and documented. However, shipboard <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> hand-arm vibration, (HAV) and how it relates to different body postures is an area of occupational exposure that has received little attention. The chief objective {{of this study was to}} assess whether there is a difference in hand-arm vibration levels, while working on one of two surface orientations (e. g., horizontal and vertical) among distinctly different <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> while cleaning or not cleaning. The design of the study evaluated three <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> cleaning both horizontal and vertical surfaces and the fourth tool only cleaning a horizontal surface. HAV levels were measured to identify the effect horizontal and vertical surface orientations had on the tool. Five subjects were used in the evaluation of the four tools by a random sequencing order. Each subject was required to hold the tool in an idle condition, an activated without cleaning condition, and an activated cleaning condition, (surface contact) for 20 seconds each. These conditions were evaluated in two different surface orientations; horizontal and vertical (except for the 4 th tool). Each subject repeated each of the cleaning/not cleaning conditions three times for a total of 7 measurements per surface. The idle condition was only conducted one time for each tool and surface. The measurements were collected from a Quest, HAVPro instrument using an accelerometer on the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> following ISO 5349 - 1 : 2001 and ISO 5349 - 2 : 2001 methods. A three-way ANOVA (subjects by tool, by condition, (cleaning vs. not cleaning) and tool vs. condition) with replicates (not including idle conditions) was conducted on the data. The analysis included the main effects and the interaction of tool and surface orientation. The subjects were treated as a blocking variable. All the main effects and the interaction were significant at p 3 Ì†c 0. 0001, except for surface, p 3 Ì†c 0. 6396. Surface orientation does not affect HAV levels in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools...</b>|$|R
