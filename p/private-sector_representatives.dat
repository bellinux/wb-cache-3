40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the private sector}} on education has been and continues to be significant. The use of scientific management in education, which led to standardized testing, accountability, and educational administration, came from the private sector. In recent times, many businesses have formed charitable and professional support partnerships with schools and school districts. This interest has widened into the area of educational reform. In some locations, <b>private-sector</b> <b>representatives</b> have been appointed to government educational bodies. In January 1992, a nationwide survey was conducted of 50 private-sector coalitions involved in statewide educational reform, promoting educational priorities by influencing state-level policy makers, and having voluntary individual or corporate memberships. The survey revealed that most of the coalitions were 5 years old or newer. The majority of the coalitions also consulted primarily business and state-level resources to shap...|$|E

40|$|Using {{theoretical}} and empirical analyses, this paper shows that the expectation dynamics induced by information asymmetry between the Central Bank (CB) and the public can cause the price puzzle. The signalling and learning dynamics between the CB and a <b>representative</b> <b>private-sector</b> agent under asymmetric information is investigated. Inflation positively reacts to contractionary monetary policy because {{the change in the}} interest rate is perceived as a signal of the CB's private information about higher future inflation and output by the public. The empirical section of the paper validates this theoretical argument using a VAR specification about the US economy. Besides providing an explanation for the price puzzle, the results of this paper has practical implications about transparency and monetary policy. The {{theoretical and}} empirical findings indicate that asymmetric information causes significant frictions in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. These frictions induce short-run undesired effects like increase in expected inflation and actual inflation as a response to contractionary monetary policy which is identified as "the price puzzle".

40|$|The 2008 Washington International Renewable Energy Conference (WIREC) {{was held}} in Washington, D. C., from March 4 - 6, 2008, and {{involved}} nearly 9, 000 people from 125 countries. The event brought together worldwide leaders in renewable energy (RE) from governments, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, {{and the private sector}} to discuss the role that renewables can play in alleviating poverty, growing economies, and passing on a healthy planet to future generations. The conference concluded with more than 140 governments, international organizations, and <b>private-sector</b> <b>representatives</b> pledging to advance the uptake of renewable energy. The U. S. government authorized the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to estimate the carbon dioxide (CO 2) savings that would result from the pledges made at the 2008 conference.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "A competitive national economy depends on providing individuals with marketable skills and employers with access to qualified workers. In the past, the nation's job training system was fragmented and did not serve job seekers or employers well. The Workforce Investment Act in 1998 created a system that links employment, education, and training services to better match workers and labor market trends. The act represented a significant change from earlier workforce development efforts. Many of the act's provisions took effect in July 2000, {{and state and local}} organizations are at different stages of implementing them. Although the act's mandatory partners are making efforts to participate in the one-stops, programmatic or financial concerns are affecting the partners' level of participation as well as their ability to fully integrate their services at the one-stop. As implementation of the act progresses, training options for job seekers may be diminishing rather than improving, as trained providers reduce the number of courses offered to job seekers. <b>Private-sector</b> <b>representatives</b> may be discouraged from participating on workforce investment boards as a result of how states and localities are operating their boards and associated entities. ...|$|E
40|$|Income {{inequality}} {{has become}} an increasingly important public policy issue in industrialized countries in recent years. Although macroeconomic conditions have been favorable {{in many of these}} countries, the distribution of income within and across countries has remained uneven. In fact, in several countries, income inequality has risen. As a result, policymakers have become concerned that large segments of the population are not reaping the benefits of economic growth. > To {{gain a better understanding of}} these issues, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City sponsored a symposium titled "Income Inequality: Issues and Policy Options" held at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 27 - 29, 1998. The symposium brought together a distinguished group of public officials, academics, and <b>private-sector</b> <b>representatives.</b> The discussion was far-ranging and insightful. As moderator Alice Rivlin noted toward the end of the conference, while there was a divergence of opinion in several areas, there was a consensus that "poverty, deprivation, and lack of opportunity are things that ought to be of great concern to us. "> Weiner and Monto summarize the papers and commentary presented at the symposium. The first section reviews the changes in income inequality patterns over the past two decades. The second explores the reasons for these changes. Monetary policy links and the economic impact of distributional change are taken up in the following two sections. The final section considers policy options and summarizes the remarks of an overview panel. Income; Income distribution...|$|E
40|$|Public {{spaces in}} Dutch city centres are {{increasingly}} subject to facelifts. The car parking that dominated city squares until the 1980 s {{has been removed}} and replaced by modern street furniture, city stages, and an abundance of sidewalk caf鳮 At the same time, public spaces are more controlled by camera surveillance and strict regulation. Why and how do these makeovers occur? It has been the central aim {{of the present study}} to answer this question; that is, to elucidate the social antecedents (background) of the redevelopment of Dutch city squares and to chart its course (process). To this end, we have portrayed the historical development and the main current trends in the design and management of Dutch public space (Chapter 2 and 3). In addition, we have investigated the increasing involvement of the private sector in redevelopment processes and have explored to what extent this might affect the design and management of public space (Chapter 4). Through this actor approach, the thesis complements the main body of public-space literature, which tends to focus on the users (the ‘demand side’) rather than reviewing the role and objectives of the responsible actors (the ‘supply side’). The empirical section (Chapter 6 - 8) outlined the results of case-study research performed in the city centres of Rotterdam, Dordrecht, Enschede, and ’s-Hertogenbosch. In each of these four cases, the redevelopment of a cluster of two squares has been investigated: respectively the Schouwburgplein and Beurstraverse, the Grote Markt and Statenplein, the Oude Markt and Van Heekplein, and the Markt and Loeffplein. The research is conducted by means of desk research, semi-structured interviews with key persons engaged in the redevelopment of public space, observations, and policy analysis. The research results indicate that recent redevelopment tends to occur in public spaces located within or very close to the historic city centre, yet lack historicity themselves. Consequently, they could be thoroughly upgraded without much resistance from the local population and thus offered much freedom to the actors involved to create spaces that fit the needs of the current society and the main stakeholders. The private sector has been involved in the redevelopment of four out of eight squares, but its tasks were limited. Except for the Beurstraverse, the role of the local government was still extensive regarding all redevelopment tasks, especially process and maintenance. The private sector’s financial involvement was mainly limited to indirect contributions via the price paid for the land. <b>Private-sector</b> <b>representatives</b> regarded these as tangible financial payments, while the public sector did not. Private-sector involvement improves the coherence between buildings and public space and has no negative effect on the duration of redevelopment processes. It leads to restricted accessibility, but only in areas that are private rather than public space. The involvement of the private sector in the redevelopment of public space needs further questioning in urban policy and future public space-research, because {{in the long run it}} could effectuate spatial differences in quality and homogenisation in function and design of the city centre...|$|E
