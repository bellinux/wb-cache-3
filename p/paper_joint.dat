The algebra they constructed is also called a Super-Poincaré algebra. In {{the very same}} paper they presented the ﬁrst four-dimensional supersymmetricgauge ﬁeld theory - supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics with the mass term of the photon/photino ﬁelds, plus two chiral matter supermultiplets (for a more detailed version see the Tamm Memorial Volume cited below; English translation is presented in.) ...|$|E

5000|$|In his [...] "Feasibly Constructive Proofs and the Propositional Calculus" [...] paper {{published}} in 1975, he introduced the equational theory PV (standing for Polynomial-time Verifiable) to formalize {{the notion of}} proofs using only polynomial-time concepts. He made another major contribution to the field in his 1979 <b>paper,</b> <b>joint</b> with his student Robert A. Reckhow, [...] "The Relative Efficiency of Propositional Proof Systems", in which they formalized the notions of p-simulation and efficient propositional proof system, which started an area now called propositional proof complexity. They proved {{that the existence of}} a proof system in which every true formula has a short proof is equivalent to NP = coNP. Cook co-authored a book with his student Phuong The Nguyen in this area titled [...] "Logical Foundations of Proof Complexity".|$|E
50|$|Mudding {{is usually}} done in three layers {{and it is}} {{important}} to use the correct type of mud for the first and last layer though a multi-purpose compound may be adequate for all coats: Bedding coat or taping coat where the mud is applied to seams and corners and <b>paper</b> <b>joint</b> tape is pressed into the mud (if using a fiberglass mesh tape the self-adhering tape is applied to the joints first and the mud pressed through the tape). The mud used here needs to adhere well and be strong and is called a taping compound; filler coat where the tape is covered and roughly smoothed; and the finish coat or topping coat which is very smooth. A topping compound is soft, smooth and easy to sand. Some sanding of the finish coat is usually required to get a smooth surface. Sheets of drywall usually have tapered edges to provide space for the thickness of the tape and mud at the seams.|$|E

A study on a wire rope joint is first presented to determine its mechanical behavior with experimental, theoretical, and numerical approaches. An analysis is then performed on a bidimensional structure to propose the specific modeling of introducing prestress to the joints. The method is applied to a spatial system in an analysis that uses static equilibrium and kinematic deployment simulations. The results show good concordance among the different approaches...|$|R
