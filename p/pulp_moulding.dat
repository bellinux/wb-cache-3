40|$|Paper pulp molds are now {{commonly}} {{applied in}} the technology of modern packing {{for a wide range}} of products. The technological process of producing the paper molds has three basic phases: paper pulp preparation, in which water and waste paper are the basic raw materials, the formation of product in tool <b>pulp</b> <b>moulding</b> machines and process drying. The firm "SERVOTEH" from Belgrade has developed various <b>pulp</b> <b>moulding</b> machines for different operating conditions (manual, semiautomatic and automatic operation), different manufacturing capacities and an alternative number of tools. The system of "SERVOTEH" <b>pulp</b> <b>moulding</b> machines covers several construction solutions: a sinking system, veer system and rotation system. This paper presents the technological process, as well as the integral and concept approach to the design of <b>pulp</b> <b>moulding</b> machines and system tools...|$|E
40|$|Packaging is a {{ubiquitous}} commodity that {{is being}} used in increasing quantities. This increased use has led to a problem with disposal, with increased quantities of used packaging being sent to landfill. One sustainable solution suggested is the use of biobased, biodegradable packaging. An example of this is paper based <b>pulp</b> <b>moulded</b> products which have been used previously for a number of packaging applications. In this paper the feasibility of replacing paper fibre with waste cereal straw fibre is examined. The aim was to produce materials {{that could be used to}} form flat, round trays, such as those used in supporting shrink wrapped food items. The material was required to have properties that matched existing alternatives, such as expanded polystyrene, in terms of physical and mechanical characteristics but with an enhanced level of biodegradability. The data showed that the <b>pulp</b> <b>moulded</b> material containing up to 80 % straw performed significantly better compared to expanded polystyrene in tensile properties (modulus of 0. 47 MPa for an 80 % straw mix compared to 0. 16 MPa for EPS). Modulus under bending was shown to be lower for straw based materials compared to EPS (0. 015 MPa compare to 0. 035 MPa). Adjustments in product thickness allowed performance parameters to be met. Wet end addition of chemicals was successfully used to provide water resistance without affecting other variables. In addition to exhibiting good performance characteristics the <b>pulp</b> <b>moulded</b> material was shown to be biodegradable, exhibiting 20 % mass loss after only 4 weeks covered in unsterile soil...|$|R
50|$|Molded <b>pulp,</b> {{also named}} <b>moulded</b> <b>pulp</b> or molded fibre, is a {{packaging}} material, typically {{made from recycled}} paperboard and/or newsprint. It is used for protective packaging or for food service trays and beverage carriers. Other typical uses are end caps, trays, plates, bowls and clamshell containers.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of, and impediments to, {{effective management}} of newspaper waste in Australia are addressed. It is appreciated {{that it is}} vital to establish facilities to recycle and reprocess newspaper as an avenue for appreciating the value of newspaper. The existence of collection industries depends on the creation of markets for the reprocessed material. Options for reprocessing waste newspaper are identified, and include the manufacture of <b>pulp</b> <b>moulded</b> products, building materials, animal bedding, animal fodder and file folders. Newspaper can also be used as a dewatering agent and as an industrial and domestic fuel source. The viability of establishing reprocessing facilities in Tasmania is considered on environmental, technical and economic grounds. On purely economic terms, {{it was found that the}} use of newspaper as a source of industrial fuel and in the production of non-adhesive bonded panel board are the most attractive means of generating a demand for waste newspaper. Avenues for governmental, community and industrial intervention to encourage further use of waste newspaper are examined...|$|R
50|$|Punnets were {{originally}} a round woodchip basket but typically are now rectangular {{and made of}} plastic; increasingly <b>moulded</b> <b>pulp</b> and corrugated cardboard are being used as they {{are perceived to be}} more sustainable materials. Decorative punnets are often made of felt and seen in flower and craft arrangements.|$|R
40|$|Plastic is a {{very broad}} family of {{materials}} that may provide {{a wide array of}} mechanical properties depending on the plastic or production method in question. This is why many industries have chosen plastic as their material of choice for the production of anything from plastic bags to underground piping. There is, however, a prominent issue concerning the heavy environmental impact of plastic. This is both due to the processing of crude oil and lack of biodegradability which in turn impact nature if the plastic is not processed in a proper waste disposal stream. In some applications such as food trays and food containers, <b>moulded</b> <b>pulp</b> {{has been used as a}} sustainable and more environmentally friendly alternative to conventional plastic products for quite some time already. The applications of <b>moulded</b> <b>pulp</b> do however not expand very far at the current time and that is why this thesis seeks to assess the properties of <b>moulded</b> <b>pulp</b> samples to evaluate the potential for replacing plastics in new mass production settings. <b>Moulded</b> <b>pulp</b> does not only have an environmental motivation but it also shows promise of being more economically viable in certain settings and the paper industry is always looking for new applications for them to use the pulp they are manufacturing. There are, of course, many applications where it is not viable or desired to replace plastic at all but the motivation is strong for replacing plastics in applications where it is possible. This is especially due to a general shift in society towards environmental awareness which is a major driving force in changing industries. If people want change, the industry will in most cases have to adapt in order to remain profitable. For this thesis, the focus was on assessing the mechanical properties of <b>moulded</b> <b>pulp</b> and how the fibres and the material behave when thermoformed in a fashion similar to that of thermoformed plastic. This was primarily done through the means of tensile testing of paper sheets and moulded specimens. In addition to this, the effect of reinforcement from microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) was also explored. In the end, the results of all the tests were very promising and the strength of the moulded samples was on par with quite a few of the most common plastics used today. The thermoforming, which is one of the most promising methods for moulding paper, also showed its capabilities of producing excellent samples and the future development of thermomoulding processes could result in highly efficient moulding methods down the line. This thesis did not have any specific applications in mind when the research was conducted but when considering the results it is clear that with further research, this material could possibly be used for a wide array of applications and it could possibly be used in a laminate construction to greatly enhance the strength and make the material viable for even structural components...|$|R
40|$|In this study, an {{environmental}} {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) is performed, in which a sugar cane bagasse food tray (produced by Roots Biopack) is compared to food trays made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polylactide (PLA) and <b>moulded</b> <b>pulp.</b> This LCA study has been conducted both for the system boundary "cradle-to-factory gate" and "cradle-to-grave". As default case, electricity from Wind energy is assumed for the bagasse tray factory in China. The cradle-to-factory gate {{results show that the}} bagasse tray has lowest impacts for non-renewable energy use (NREU) global warming, abiotic depletion and acidification. The PET tray has highest environmental impacts for NREU, global warming and abiotic depletion. Compared to PLA, the bagasse tray has lower impacts for NREU, abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming and land use, but higher impacts for renewable energy reuse (REU) and photochemical oxidant formation. If incineration with energy recovery is applied in the waste stage, the environmental impacts decrease, except for global warming. A contribution analysis of the full life cycle of the bagasse tray (cradle-to-grave) shows that waste management and the production of the sugar cane bagasse contribute most to the total environmental impacts. All in all, it can be concluded that the bagasse tray has good environmental performance...|$|R
