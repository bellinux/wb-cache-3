50|$|George C. Beidler of Oklahoma City {{founded the}} Rectigraph Company in 1906 or 1907, {{producing}} the first <b>photographic</b> <b>copying</b> machines; he later moved {{the company to}} Rochester, New York in 1909 {{to be closer to}} the Haloid Company, his main source of photographic paper and chemicals.|$|E
5000|$|The Photostat brand machine, differing in {{operation}} from the Rectigraph {{but with the}} same purpose of the <b>photographic</b> <b>copying</b> of documents, was invented in Kansas City by Oscar T. Gregory in 1907. A directory of the city from 1909 shows his [...] "Gregory Commercial Camera Company". By 1910, Gregory had co-filed a patent application with Norman W. Carkhuff, of the photography department of the United States Geological Survey, for {{a specific type of}} photographic camera, for quickly and easily photographing small objects, with a further object [...] "to provide a camera of the type known as 'copying cameras' that will be simple and convenient ..." [...] In 1911, the Commercial Camera Company of Providence, Rhode Island, was formed. By 1912, Photostat brand machines were in use, as evidenced by a record of one at the New York Public Library. By 1913, advertisements described the Commercial Camera Company as headquartered at Rochester and with a licensing and manufacturing relationship with Eastman Kodak. The pair filed another U.S. patent application in 1913 further developing their ideas. By 1920, distribution agency in various European markets was by the Alfred Herbert companies. The Commercial Camera Company apparently became the Photostat Corporation around 1921, for [...] "Commercial Camera Company" [...] is described as a former name of Photostat Corporation in a 1922 issue of Patent and Trade Mark Review. For at least 40 years the brand was widespread enough that its name was genericized by the public.|$|E
40|$|The Buchen are {{performers}} of rituals, exorcists, actors, storytellers {{and musicians}} {{unique to the}} Pin Valley in Spiti. Historically, Buchen troupes have toured the villages of Spiti, Upper Kinnaur and parts of Ladakh (and formerly western Tibet) to spread the message and teachings of the Buddha {{through the medium of}} entertainment. Buchen are most famous for performing the exorcism ritual entitled the Ceremony of Breaking the Stone, photographed by John Coldstream a century ago, described in detail by the Tibetologist Georges de Roerich in 1932 and contextualised in much greater detail by Pascale Dollfus in 2004. Although the ceremony is now well known and increasingly performed for visiting trekkers and film crews or within local arts and cultural programmes, their winter tours, narrations and theatrical performances of moral and religious folk tales are significantly less researched and possibly disappearing. In 2014 I returned to Spiti to photograph and record their material culture, specifically the objects connected to Buchen performances and still extant within active and dormant Buchen households: the narrative and ritual texts, thangkas, musical instruments, statues, costumes, masks and ritual objects that Buchen utilise. For a reportage photographer, this process of <b>photographic</b> <b>copying</b> held precious little excitement, but the opportunity to talk around the history and ownership of these objects and to delve into family memories revealed some new understanding of Buchen history, roles, interconnections and status...|$|E

5000|$|In 1927 Schenker and Hoboken {{undertook}} a project {{on behalf of}} the Austrian National Library to create an archive containing <b>photographic</b> <b>copies</b> of the musical manuscripts of the great composers ("Archiv für Photogramme musikalischer Meisterhandschriften"; [...] "Archive for Photographic Images of Musical Master Manuscripts"). Their appeal to other libraries for participation emphasized two points. First, contemporary editions of the music were rife with interpolated material not in the original (see Urtext edition) and the availability of <b>photographic</b> <b>copies</b> would facilitate the preparation of more accurate editions. Second, they noted that historical manuscripts are vulnerable to destruction or loss. The latter point was prescient, as the Second World War, which broke out twelve years later, resulted in extensive damage and theft in the scholarly archives of Europe; a number of documents survive today solely {{as a result of the}} Meister-Archiv project.|$|R
25|$|However, the {{community}} limited direct {{observation of the}} manuscript by outsiders, especially by scholars in modern times. Paul E.
