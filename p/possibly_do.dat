[...] The CIA also believed that it could better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little information. Although there had been an active communist movement in Latin America since 1919, it had largely been a clandestine movement, and the CIA knew little about the methods that parties like the PGT used.

500|$|Professor Shiela Bird, a {{statistician}} at the Medical Research Council, {{suggested the}} ban of mephedrone {{may lead to}} more cocaine-related deaths. In {{the first six months}} of 2009, the number of cocaine-related deaths fell for the first time in four years, and fewer soldiers tested positive for cocaine in 2009 than in 2008. She suggested this may have been due to users switching to mephedrone from cocaine, but cautioned that before full figures are available for 2009 and 2010, it will be difficult to determine whether mephedrone saved lives, rather than cost them. Other supposedly legal drugs have filled the gap in the market since mephedrone was made illegal, including naphyrone (NRG-1) (since made illegal) and Ivory Wave, which has been found to contain MDPV, a compound made illegal at the same time as mephedrone. However, some products branded as Ivory Wave <b>possibly</b> <b>do</b> not contain MDPV. When tested, some products sold six weeks after mephedrone was banned, advertised as NRG-1, NRG-2 and MDAI, were found to be mephedrone. A Drugscope survey of drugs workers at the end of 2012 reported that mephedrone use was still widespread in the UK and that there increasing reports of problematic users. It was being taken as not only a [...] "poor man's cocaine" [...] but also amongst users of heroin and crack cocaine. Cases of intravenous use were also reported to be on the increase.|$|E
500|$|Castiel {{typically}} displays {{very little}} emotion and always exhibits an extremely somber disposition. Although {{it has been}} suggested angels <b>possibly</b> <b>do</b> not possess the ability to truly feel emotion, Castiel frequently exhibits affection towards Dean. This attachment and growing ability to feel even causes him to be [...] "demoted", as his superiors fear emotions are clouding his judgment. Throughout his appearances in the fourth season, he also seems to, at the very least, come close to expressing regret, hesitance, and anger several times, and has once quietly laughed at a joke Dean made in [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester". Actor Misha Collins feels, through Dean, [...] " [...] learning a little bit about humanity and re-learning something about [...] own humanity from that exposure. So...there's a humanizing of Castiel going on." [...] Castiel begins having an internal struggle between what is right and what is wrong, and whether or not to obey orders from Heaven. Collins feels this is because interactions with Sam and Dean have made the angel [...] "uncertain" [...] and [...] "more fragile". Collins believes Castiel envies Dean's decisiveness and desires to emulate him. Having lost his connection to Heaven in the fifth season, Castiel's humanization seems to have quickened by the episode [...] "Free to Be You and Me", as he appears extremely anxious while in a whorehouse, is visibly distraught when asking Dean for help, and refers to the Archangel Raphael as [...] "my little bitch". Despite becoming very arrogant when he becomes the [...] "new God", Castiel still shows his caring side and ultimately returns the souls to Purgatory and shows remorse for his actions, promising to Dean {{to find a way to}} redeem himself in Dean's eyes, showing that he cares about how Dean views him. After losing his memory, Castiel is more human than ever, but still displays some of his emotionless side. [...] After his memory returns, he shows real regret when he can't undo the damage he did to Sam and essentially sacrifices himself to save him out of remorse for his actions. After Castiel wakes up from his catatonic state, he is now depicted as insane with tendencies to ramble about random topics. [...] However, parts of Castiel's original personality are still shown with him still being happy to help Sam and Dean out and still knowledgeable about various supernatural things, but not willing to actually fight anymore even when his life is threatened. Castiel describes himself as [...] "bad luck" [...] and doesn't believe he should be around the Winchesters as a result. After traveling to Purgatory, Castiel regained his sanity, but still carries a lot of guilt about his previous actions. He is also now less distant from Sam and Dean and more appreciative of human things such as television.|$|E
500|$|Hogan's {{obituary}} stated that, at {{some point}} in his playing career, he set a record for baserunning. [...] Several sources trace this record to a field day event held in Indianapolis in 1895, when he reportedly rounded the bases in 13.2 seconds. The World Almanac and Encyclopedia 1906, for instance, reported that Hogan [...] "lowered the base-running record" [...] in 1895, noting that [...] "he distance around the bases is 120 yards". [...] In January 1906, Sporting Life reported that Hogan had [...] "taken steps to have the base running record awarded to him". [...] The report added, [...] "Under proper conditions [...] turned the route in 13 15 seconds at Indianapolis in 1895". [...] Some observers questioned the veracity of the record, however. [...] In 1907, for instance, Washington Post sports columnist J. Ed Grillo conceded that [...] "Hogan was a great sprinter" [...] but described his unofficial record as [...] "out of reason". [...] Grillo, who argued that [...] "the fastest runners in baseball failed to come anywhere near the mark", lent his support to an official record of 14.1 that had been set more recently by Eastern League player Wally Clement. [...] An article published in the Washington Herald days earlier also raised questions about Hogan's baserunning record. [...] In this case, however, the writer claimed that the most [...] "authentic" [...] record had been set by Harry Berthrong in the 1860s. [...] The article stated that, while Hogan was [...] "said to have beaten Berthrong's base-circling record of 13 25 seconds by a fifth of a second", this alleged feat was not [...] "performed under official sanction". [...] One year earlier, in 1906, Berthrong, himself, weighed in on the debate. [...] According to an article that appeared in [...] Sporting Life in March of that year, Berthrong disputed Hogan's claim. [...] "My time...around the bases was made in Washington, D.C., in July 1868, after the old Nationals of Washington, D.C., had played a game with the Pastimes of Baltimore, Md.", Berthrong was quoted as saying in an interview. [...] "Three stop watches were held over me, the slowest giving me 14 1/4". [...] The retired player added: [...] "I am skeptical about this man Hogan doing the bases in 13 1-5: nobody but an Arthur Duffey could <b>possibly</b> <b>do</b> it, and I doubt if he could". [...] For reasons that are unclear, the article indicated that Hogan claimed to round the bases in 1889, six earlier than other reports. (A similar description of Hogan's claim appeared elsewhere in the same edition of Sporting Life; a brief news item suggested he claimed to set the record [...] "in Indianapolis in the 80's".) Baseball historian Jon Daly traced Hogan's contested record to 1898; he speculated that Ben Morgan, an official of the National Association, [...] "disputed that claim when doing a study of field day records". [...] The most widely accepted national baserunning record was set by Evar Swanson, who rounded the bases in 13.4 seconds in 1929. [...] Despite questions surrounding Hogan's baserunning record, he became popularly known as the [...] "Indianapolis Ringer". [...] Newspaper reports suggest he defended his position as baserunning champion of the Western League in various pre-game competitions. [...] On August 2, 1895, the Vindicator noted that the outfielder had [...] "a rival for the base running honors in the western league in George Nichol of the Milwaukees who, it is claimed, can get down to first quicker than Hogan". [...] The article added, [...] "A race between the two is talked of". [...] Then, on August 17, 1895, the Vindicator reported that Hogan had defeated Detroit outfielder Frank Tower in a baserunning contest. [...] "The Hoosiers have in Mart Hogan a pretty good extra card", the article added. [...] "Indianapolis goes around the land, and their sprinting outfielder meets all comers in foot races before the game. [...] He has not yet been defeated". [...] Several days earlier, the same newspaper quoted a journalist from Sporting Life, who reportedly commented: [...] "Mart Hogan, the Indianapolis outfielder, is showing such astonishing speed that he will probably be taken to England next year for the Sheffield Handicap".|$|E

As the head of a party that depended upon the Bond for its support, he had to balance several different influences.

His public statements were hostile in tone to the policy that Chamberlain and Sir Alfred Milner pursued.

2500|$|Expression {{profiling}} is {{a logical}} next step after sequencing a genome: the sequence tells us what the cell could <b>possibly</b> <b>do,</b> while the expression profile tells us what it is actually doing {{at a point in}} time. Genes contain the instructions for making messenger RNA (mRNA), but at any moment each cell makes mRNA from {{only a fraction of the}} genes it carries. [...] If a gene is used to produce mRNA, it is considered [...] "on", otherwise [...] "off". [...] Many factors determine whether a gene is on or off, such as the time of day, whether or not the cell is actively dividing, its local environment, and chemical signals from other cells. For instance, skin cells, liver cells and nerve cells turn on (express) somewhat different genes and that is in large part what makes them different. [...] Therefore, an expression profile allows one to deduce a cell's type, state, environment, and so forth.|$|E
