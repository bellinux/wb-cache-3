It {{is characterized by a}} four-spored ascus, the production of a pellicle, lack of <b>pseudo-mycelium,</b> and the ability to assimilate glucose, sucrose, maltose and galactose but not lactose. * It has been named Debaryomyces marama. In the course of a survey of aerial yeasts, made with a Manning slit sampler, fifteen strains of a hitherto undescribed species of Debaryomyces were isolated. It is proposed to name this species D. marama, from the Maori adjective ' marama ' meaning ' light, not dark '. Debaryomyces marama sp. nov. Cellulae in culturis novis rotundae aut subovoidae, singulae aut in racemis parvis, gemmantes multifarium (2. 5 - 6. 5) x (2. 5 - 5 - 0) p. Pseudomycelium nullum observatum est, Pellicula tenuis sed tenax et arida, sursum repens per latera vasculorum in glucoso cum decoct 0 saccharomycetis (minus biduo 27 "). Culturae novae in agaro Sabouraudi abundantes, albae, aliae nitidiores, aliae hebetiores, saepe aetate fiunt flavalbidae et subcrispulatae. Copulatio cellularum iniquarum conformationi asci praecedit. Ascosporae rotundae aut subovoidae, glabrae, 1 - 4 in asco. In ascis tetrasporis sporae in tetrahedram formantur. Interdum fermentatio iniqua glucosi. Glucosum, sucrosum, mal-tosum, galactosum assimilantur. Lactosum, nitras kalicus non assimilantur. Non crescit (37 "). Cells from young cultures round to slightly oval, single or in small clusters. Budding multipolar. Cell size (2. 5 - 6. 5) x (2. 5 - 5. 0) p. No pseudomycelium observed. A light but persistent dry pellicle which spreads up the sides of the tubes in glucose yeast extract broth held a t 27 " for less than 2 days. Young cultures on Sabouraud agar abundant, white and glistening to matt, often becoming light fawn and wrinkled with age. Heterogamous conjugation pre-cedes ascus formation. Spores round to slightly oval, smooth, and one to four per ascus. In four-spored asci the spores arranged in tetrahedra. Glucose occa-sionally weakly fermented. Glucose, sucrose, maltose and galactose assimi-lated; lactose and potassium nitrate not assimilated. No growth a t 37 "...|$|E
