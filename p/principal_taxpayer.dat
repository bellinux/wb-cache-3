50|$|By the 13th {{century the}} medieval manor of Benwell had been subdivided, {{originally}} into two, but {{then one of}} the halves was further subdivided. So, although people usually refer to the three sections of Benwell Manor as ‘thirds’, this gives a misleading impression, because one of the ‘thirds’ was larger and wealthier than the other two. This third belonged to the Scot family, who were wealthy merchants from Newcastle and by 1296 they were the <b>principal</b> <b>taxpayers</b> in Benwell. The Scot family later went on to create a deer park in 1367, which later became Scotswood.In the 16th century Benwell village was arranged in two rows of houses on either side of a wide street or green. A plain oblong tower, three storeys high with battlements around the roof was also recorded as being built.|$|R
50|$|On {{the federal}} level, the <b>taxpayer's</b> <b>principal</b> {{residence}} may in general include a houseboat, a house trailer, or {{the house or}} apartment that the taxpayer is entitled to occupy as a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation, {{in addition to the}} traditional house. Specifically, Treasury Regulation Section 1.121-1(b)(2) gives the following requirements:In the case of a taxpayer using more than one property as a residence, whether property is used by the taxpayer as the <b>taxpayer’s</b> <b>principal</b> residence depends upon all the facts and circumstances. If a taxpayer alternates between 2 properties, the property that the taxpayer uses a majority of the time during the year ordinarily will be considered the <b>taxpayer’s</b> <b>principal</b> residence. In addition to the taxpayer's use of the property, relevant factors in determining a <b>taxpayer's</b> <b>principal</b> residence, include, {{but are not limited to}} - (i) The taxpayer's place of employment; (ii) The principal place of abode of the taxpayer's family members; (iii) The address listed on the taxpayer's federal and state tax returns, driver's license, automobile registration, and voter registration card; (iv) The taxpayer's mailing address for bills and correspondence; (v) The location of the taxpayer's banks; and (vi) The location of religious organizations and recreational clubs with which the taxpayer is affiliated.|$|R

50|$|Many systems allow a {{deduction}} for loss on sale, exchange, or abandonment of both business and non-business income producing assets. This deduction {{may be limited}} to gains from the same class of assets. In the U.S., a loss on non-business assets is considered a capital loss, and deduction of the loss is limited to capital gains. Also, in the U.S. a loss {{on the sale of}} the <b>taxpayer's</b> <b>principal</b> residence or other personal assets is not allowed as a deduction except to the extent due to casualty or theft.|$|R
50|$|The {{foreign debt}} {{of the country}} reached its peak in 2003 with an {{outstanding}} US$57.6 billion, {{which is more than}} the combined borrowings of the last two governments. According to the Freedom from Debt Coalition (FDC) In a span of 14 years, the Aquino, Ramos, and Estrada administrations contracted a total of Php1.51 trillion in debts, Php2.03 trillion less than what Arroyo has borrowed in her first six years in office. Under Arroyo, the FDC estimates that based on 2007 interest and <b>principal</b> payments, <b>taxpayers</b> carry a debt servicing burden of Php1.2 million every minute. Today, the FDC adds, every Filipino man, woman, and child owes creditors Php42,819.42. This eventually led to a state of fiscal crisis due to the huge amount of the deficit, as admitted by President Arroyo in 2004. As a response to this crisis, the option of an automatic appropriation policy that would allocate funds for debt service payments was questioned.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of a recent Supreme Court decision, Commissioner v. Soliman, stricter {{guidelines}} have been imposed upon taxpayers regarding their eligibility to take a home office deduction under the "principle place of business" election. As {{a result of}} Soliman, determining a <b>taxpayer's</b> <b>principal</b> place of business went from a "facts and circumstances" test, tailored to each individual case, to tests that consider only two factors. Several pronouncements and publications have prescribed guidelines and examples that explain this decision. Soliman, however, has been subject to criticism by the tax profession. Some professionals believe these tests are too strict. The pronouncements have also been subject to scrutiny for being vague. The purpose of this thesis was to gather information from the practicing tax profession to determine what its views were regarding Soliman and the subsequent pronouncements. Surveys were given to fifteen tax professionals. The purpose of the surveys was to determine whether Soliman provided adequate guidelines for determining a <b>taxpayer's</b> <b>principal</b> place of business, as well as to analyze whether the recent IRS pronouncements are consistently interpreted and applied. Survey results support the finding that the effects of Soliman are not universally accepted, and that interpretation of its guidelines do not always produce consistent and dependable conclusions. Therefore, it is proposed that the courts revert to the "facts and circumstances" test that was used prior to Soliman. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses taxpayers' use of the First-time Homebuyer Credit (FTHBC) and the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) implementation and compliance challenges. As {{an important part of}} the recent economic stimulus efforts, Congress enacted the FTHBC to assist the struggling real estate market and encourage taxpayers to purchase their first home. The credit initially was enacted by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Housing Act) and revised by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). The 2008 FTHBC provided taxpayers a credit of up to $ 7, 500 that must be paid back over 15 years. The Recovery Act increased the maximum credit for the 2009 FTHBC to $ 8, 000, with no payback required unless the home ceases to be the <b>taxpayer's</b> <b>principal</b> residence within 3 years. This $ 8, 000 credit is a refundable tax credit that is paid out even if there is no tax liability or the credit exceeds the amount of any tax due. The 2009 FTHBC was enacted into law on February 17, 2009, but eligibility was made retroactive for homes purchased beginning January 1, 2009. This testimony today, based on on-going work, describes two issues: (1) the extent to which taxpayers are using the FTHBC, including breakouts by state and income; and (2) IRS's implementation and compliance challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2009 credits. ...|$|R
