5|$|The AW101 is {{typically}} {{operated by a}} crew of three: a pilot, an observer, and a crewman/operator. The <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> able to fly {{for the majority of}} a mission in a hands-off mode, enabled by the sophisticated autopilot. All crew members have individual access to management computers and tactical information.|$|E
50|$|From its {{founding}} in the 1980s until 1994, <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> an independent software company. In 1994 <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> acquired by Dun & Bradstreet corporation. Over time D&B began to break itself apart, {{and as part of}} that reorganization <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1997 to Platinum Equity Holdings. In 2000 <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> again sold, this time to Accrue Software. Accrue later went through significant business challenges, and in 2002 the assets of <b>Pilot</b> <b>were</b> purchased by <b>Pilot</b> management and Pilot again became an independent software company.|$|R
50|$|Early on, <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> {{normally}} fabricated of bars {{mounted on}} a frame; later on, sheet metal <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> often used for their additional smoothness, and some cast steel <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> employed for their mass and smooth shape. Early diesel locomotives followed the same plan.|$|R

5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of a pilot in the ranks of the Galactic Terran–Vasudan Alliance (GTVA). While the {{appearance}} and name of the pilot can be customized by the player, the player never gets to personally interact with other characters in the game. The <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> also never shown in the game's cinematics or any other media.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} Idaho {{and meet with}} Budahas' wife, Anita, who claims her husband {{exhibited}} erratic behavior before his disappearance. She takes them to a neighbor whose husband, also a test <b>pilot,</b> <b>is</b> behaving similarly. Scully makes an appointment with the base's director, Colonel Kissell, but he refuses to talk when they visit his home. They subsequently meet local reporter Paul Mossinger, who refers them to a local UFO-themed diner; there, they discuss UFOs with the owner, who believes she has witnessed several nearby.|$|E
5|$|The American pilot {{has been}} heavily bootlegged, {{but it has}} never been {{broadcast}} on TV in any country. Excerpts from the first pilot are included in Dwarfing USA, a featurette on the making of the pilots included on the DVD release of Red Dwarf's fifth series. Because of rights clearance issues, no footage from the second <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> included in the featurette.|$|E
50|$|A second TV <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} in 2000, {{with a different}} cast and a professional television director involved. Again, the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> not taken up.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Army Air Forces {{originally}} favoured officer {{pilots and}} the few enlisted <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> usually civilian-qualified. The adoption of transport and strategic bombing missions meant that {{a larger number of}} <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> needed to perform monotonous and gruelling jobs. Officer <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> usually assigned to fly fighters and fighter-bombers and commanded units. Enlisted <b>pilots</b> usually <b>were</b> assigned to fly light reconnaissance and artillery-spotter aircraft, cargo aircraft, and medium- and heavy-weight bombers.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> never {{publicly}} screened if {{they fail}} to sell a series. If a series eventuates, <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> usually—but not always—broadcast as the introductory episode of the series.|$|R
5|$|On Enterprise, {{analysis}} of data gathered in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates that the <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> probably {{a member of the}} Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, seems unlikely, since the Aenar are few in number, reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern polar region of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down to contact the Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar do not want to get involved in a war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{introduces}} {{the survivors of}} Oceanic Flight 815, who experience a plane crash and end up on a mysterious island. Three of the characters, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), are featured before the crash in flashbacks of their experiences on the plane as it breaks apart in mid-air; this narrative technique would be reused in almost every subsequent episode of the series. The Lost <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most}} critically acclaimed television pilots of all time. Both parts earned high ratings, with Part 1 breaking the record for a pilot episode with 18.6 million viewers, and the episode would later win many awards and accolades.|$|E

5|$|Major interplanetary {{corporations}} {{known as}} Hammond Robotics—a major manufacturing, aerospace and defense contractor—used {{resources of the}} Frontier to make builds of mecha-combatants such as Titans and Spectres. Titans are descendants of present-day fledgling military exoskeletons. In addition to the obvious combat applications, unarmed forms of Titans are used in heavy industries like cargo transport and deep space ship salvage. They are also used in special applications such as deep space search and rescue, and are very effective in inhospitable environments. The use of Titans is widespread throughout the Frontier in both combat and civilian life. As with Titans, the Frontier contains Pilots of many different styles and experiences. Titan Pilots are rated by 'certifications', most of which apply to civilian applications, such as construction, shipping, and heavy salvage industries. The most prestigious {{of these is the}} Full Combat Certification - a widely published series of tests that grade a Titan Pilot's abilities. Because of the extreme physical and mental challenges of mastering both Titan combat & dismounted parkour movement, a fully combat certified Titan <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> a rare find, and the combat skills of active Pilots in the field varies widely throughout the Frontier.|$|E
5|$|With the drama's setting being a hospital, {{numerous}} {{medical personnel}} appear regularly on the show, {{as well as}} several other recurring characters. Joe (Steven W. Bailey), is first shown as the owner of the Emerald City Bar and Grill, {{across the street from the}} hospital, which is a common relaxation area for the physicians. Also introduced in the <b>pilot,</b> <b>is</b> the legendary former surgeon, Dr. Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), Meredith's Alzheimer's-stricken mother, who appeared on the show until her death in season three. In the first season, Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), a nurse who appeared on the show occasionally until getting laid off in the merger with Mercy West, engages in sexual activity with O'Malley, giving him syphilis. Serving as an assistant and secretary to the Chief of Surgery, former nurse Patricia (Robin Pearson Rose), has appeared on the show since its debut. Tyler Christian (Moe Irvin), a hospital nurse, makes occasional appearances throughout the series. Within the second season, Bailey becomes pregnant by her husband, Tucker Jones (Cress Williams), who makes frequent appearances on Grey's Anatomy, until their divorce in season five. While Bailey takes a sabbatical, due to her pregnancy, the cheerful Dr. Sydney Heron (Kali Rocha), fills her position as the resident supervising Grey, Yang, Karev, O'Malley, and Stevens, and makes occasional appearances until the fifth season.|$|E
