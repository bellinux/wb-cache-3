5|$|The Cat's Eye was {{the first}} {{planetary}} nebula to be observed with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864.

5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae,</b> molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo.

5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have {{encountered}} M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{astronomy}} employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200Å (10 to 320nm).

Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited {{to the study of}} thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae,</b> supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.|$|E

The <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> candidate was found during our systematic scans of the AAO/UKST Hα Survey of the Milky Way. Subsequent confirmatory spectroscopy of the nebula and central star reveals the remarkable nature of this object. The nebular spectrum shows emission lines with large expansion velocities exceeding 150 km s - 1, suggesting that perhaps the object is not a conventional <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula.</b> The central star itself is very red and is identified as being of the [WN] class, which makes it unique in the Galaxy.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> centered on the poorly studied symbiotic binary star DT Ser. In a few other symbiotic stars spatially resolved nebulae have been discovered: however, only one of them might be a genuine <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula,</b> while the others are likely to originate in complex mass ejections episodes from the interacting binary central stars, possibly related to nova-like outbursts. The rim of the <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> around DT Ser is severely distorted toward a brighter star, 5 arcsec away. In infrared WISE data, this star shows the presence of a detached cold dust shell such as those observed in post-AGB stars. The apparent association of the symbiotic star and its <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> with the nearby possible post-AGB object is discussed.

25|$|<b>Planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> {{are created}} when a {{red giant star}} ejects its outer envelope, forming an {{expanding}} shell of gas.

One hypothesis for the formation of a non-spherical shape is the effect of the star's magnetic field. Instead of expanding evenly in all directions, the ejected plasma tends to leave by way of the magnetic poles. Observations of the central stars in at least four <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> have confirmed that they do indeed possess powerful magnetic fields.|$|E

25|$|<b>Planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> {{may play}} a very {{important}} role in galactic evolution.

25|$|The {{issue of}} how such a diverse range of nebular shapes can be {{produced}} is a debatable topic.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{technological}} improvements {{helped to}} further the study of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae.</b> Space telescopes allowed astronomers to study light wavelengths outside those that the Earth's atmosphere transmits.

Charge-coupled device technology allowed much fainter spectral lines to be measured accurately than had previously been possible. The Hubble Space Telescope also showed that while many nebulae appear to have simple and regular structures when observed from the ground, the very high optical resolution achievable by telescopes above the Earth's atmosphere reveals extremely complex structures.|$|E
