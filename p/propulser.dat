40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} implementing a physician based surveillance system of occupational respiratory diseases (<b>PROPULSE)</b> in Québec with regard to physician participation rate, characteristics of reported cases, and comparison with official statistics from the Workers' Compensation Board (WCB). METHODS: All chest physicians and allergists in Québec were asked to report suspected new cases of occupational respiratory diseases, on a monthly basis, between October 1992 and September 1993. For each case, personal information was collected and the physician's opinion on whether the condition was related to work was categorised as highly likely, likely, and unlikely. RESULTS: Of the 161 physicians initially approached, 68 % participated. Physicians rated 48 % of suspected cases as highly likely, 29 % as likely, and 20 % as unlikely. The most often reported diagnosis was asthma (63 %), followed by diseases related to asbestos (16 %). Silicosis was less frequent (5 %) but it was reported for six workers under 40 of whom five were involved in sandblasting activities. The high proportion of cases of asthma probably reflects the increasing importance of this disease but may also reflect the different patterns of reporting among physicians with different expertise. The distribution of cases by diagnostic category is quite different between the <b>PROPULSE</b> system {{and that of the}} WCB (annual mean number of compensated cases during a four year period). Asthma and allergic alveolitis are more frequent in <b>PROPULSE,</b> reactive airways dysfunction syndrome are about the same in both systems, and other diseases are more frequent among compensated cases. The most frequent sensitising agents reported for asthma were the same in both systems (isocyanates, flour, and wood dust). 15 % of the <b>PROPULSE</b> cases were not covered by the WCB, and therefore would not be found in the board's official statistics. CONCLUSIONS: A physician based reporting procedure can be implemented as part of a surveillance system to supplement data from other sources and thus provide {{a better understanding of the}} occurrence of occupational respiratory diseases...|$|R
40|$|The <b>PROPULSE</b> 980 unit is a {{transportable}} {{processing plant}} that enriches aerospace grade hydrogen peroxide from 90 % to 98 % final concentration. The unit {{was developed by}} Degussa-H Is, in cooperation with Orbital, NASA Marshall Space Center, and NASA Stennis Space Center. The system is a self-contained unit that houses all of the process equipment, instrumentation and controls to perform the concentration operation nearly autonomously. It is designed to produce non-bulk quantities of 98 % hydrogen peroxide. The enrichment unit design also maintains system, personnel and environmental safety during {{all aspects of the}} enrichment process and final product storage. As part of the <b>Propulse</b> 980 checkout and final buyoff, it will be disassembled at the Degussa-H Is Corporation plant in Theodore, AL, transported to the Stennis Space Center, reassembled and subjected to a series of checkout tests to verify design objectives have been met.

50|$|Using {{electromagnets}} {{with electronic}} switching comparable to electronic speed control {{it is possible}} to generate electromagnetic fields moving in an arbitrary direction. As described in the section above about eddy current brakes, a non-ferromagnetic conductor surface tends to rest within this moving field. When however this field is moving, a vehicle can be levitated and <b>propulsed.</b> This is comparable to a maglev but is not bound to a rail.|$|R
30|$|The {{floating}} target on {{the other}} hand will show a different movement pattern. For one, it will follow the movement of the sea surface and will therefore exhibit a vertical oscillation with the frequency of the passing waves. Also, currents can cause it to move in a different direction from the waves, and when <b>propulsed</b> by the waves, its drag in the water will have it move at a slower speed than the passing waves.|$|R

5000|$|The HEMTT A3 is {{the first}} production-ready {{tactical}} defense vehicle to feature a diesel-electric drive system. The <b>ProPulse</b> system fitted uses a modular series-hybrid arrangement to simplify the transmission of power to the wheels. The diesel engine powers an electric generator, which provides direct power to the wheels, eliminating the torque converter, automatic transmission, transfer case, and drive shafts. A dedicated motor controlled from its own power converters drives each axle independently. <b>ProPulse</b> technology, it is claimed, can increase fuel economy by up to 40% over conventional power trains. The diesel engine is optimized to run at the most efficient speed based on power demand, and transient loads to the engine are eliminated using stored energy. This eliminates the inefficiency associated with changing rpm levels during acceleration and deceleration, and also reduces emissions. In stopping operations, the electric motors operate as generators, and energy is stored {{for use in the}} next acceleration. Other stated advantages of the system include the system acting as an on-board generator, providing enough electricity (up to 200 kW of AC power) to power a small airfield, hospital, or military command center. Since the system uses no batteries, they never need to be replaced, and the amount of fuel needed to supply ProPulse-equipped trucks will be less.|$|R
5000|$|Motive {{power for}} the JLTV variant of the L-ATV is {{provided}} by a digitally-controlled Gale Banks Engineering 866T V-8 diesel, this based on {{the architecture of the}} General Motors (GM) Duramax. Power output is undisclosed but estimated to be around 300 hp. In commercial use power output of the Duramax engine is currently up to 397 hp (296 kW) at 3000 rpm. An unspecified fully automatic six-speed Allison Transmission is fitted, this coupled to an Oshkosh transfer case. It is currently not known if this is a single-speed or two-speed (high/low ratio) transfer case. The L-ATV can be fitted with the Oshkosh <b>ProPulse</b> diesel-electric powertrain, previously fitted to the Oshkosh Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) and MTVR. According to Oshkosh literature, the <b>ProPulse</b> diesel-electric powertrain dramatically improves fuel economy by up to 35 percent in certain circumstances and serves as an on-board generator with enough output to power an entire airfield or hospital, generating up to 120 kW of AC power for external operations; the hybrid powertrain is not a requirement of the JLTV program. In a Limited User Test (LUT), the L-ATV demonstrated reliability of 7,051 [...] "Mean Miles Between Operational Mission Failure," [...] more than the Humvee and either other JLTV competitor.|$|R
