50|$|The {{flammability}} limits (4-75% {{of hydrogen}} in air at normal temperature, wider at high temperatures), its autoignition temperature at 571 °C, its very low minimum ignition energy, and its tendency to form explosive mixtures with air, require provisions {{to be made}} for maintaining the hydrogen content within the generator above the upper or below the flammability limit at all times, and other hydrogen safety measures. When filled with hydrogen, overpressure has to be maintained as inlet of air into the generator could cause a dangerous explosion in confined space. The generator enclosure is purged before opening it for maintenance, and before refilling the generator with hydrogen. During shutdown, hydrogen is purged by an inert gas, then the inert gas is replaced by air; the opposite sequence is used before startup. Carbon dioxide or nitrogen can be used for this purpose, as they do not form combustible mixtures with hydrogen and are inexpensive. Gas purity sensors are used to indicate the end of the purging cycle, which shortens the startup and shutdown times and reduces consumption of the <b>purging</b> <b>gas.</b> Carbon dioxide is favored as due to the very high density difference it easily displaces the hydrogen. The carbon dioxide is admitted {{to the bottom of the}} generator first, pushing the hydrogen out at the top. Then air is admitted to the top, pushing the carbon dioxide out at the bottom. Purging is best done with the generator stopped. If done on barring, the generator fans will mix the gases and greatly increase the time required to achieve purity.|$|E
40|$|A {{continuous}} hydrogen-removal method from aluminum melt, spray degassing, is presented. The equilibrium {{equation of}} this method is discussed theoretically. Theoretical equilibrium analysis shows that the final hydrogen content of the melt is only affected by the <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate and the melt mass flow rate. The hydrogen content of the outlet melt always contains a constant during the whole degassing time. The final hydrogen content of the melt decreases with increasing <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate and increases with increasing melt mass flow rate. Compared with the rotary impeller degassing method, spray degassing consumes less treatment time and <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> volume. Experiments were conducted using the method to remove the hydrogen in aluminum melt. The experimental results show that, the spray degassing is a good hydrogen-removal method.

Channels (2 - 4) opened {{in a direction}} of the gasket or the film is formed in parts (5. 1, 5. 2) of the housing at a region around the chamber. The channels are provided on or in the gasket. Inert <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> or fluid removed from a measuring cell is conducted through the channels {{in such a way}} that the <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> or the fluid immediately flows along a surface of the gasket and/or of the film.

Optical surfaces of infrared telescopes cooled to about 20 K should be considered to be covered with at least several deposition layers of condensible molecules without any contamination controls. The effectiveness of the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> method of contamination controls was discussed. This method attempts to drive condensible molecules from the telescope tube by impacts with a <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> in the telescope tube. For this technique to be sufficiently effective, the pressure of the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> must be more than 2 x. 000001 torr.

50|$|In cocurrent systems, the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> is 50 °F to 100 °F {{hotter than}} the soil {{discharge}} temperature. The {{result is that}} the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> exit temperature may range from 400 °F to 1,000 °F and cannot go directly to the baghouse. <b>Purge</b> <b>gas</b> first enters an afterburner to decontaminate the fine particles, then goes into a cooling unit prior to introduction into the baghouse. Because of the higher temperature and volume of the <b>purge</b> <b>gas,</b> the baghouse and all other downstream processing equipment must be larger than in a countercurrent system. Cocurrent systems do have several advantages over countercurrent systems: The afterburner is located upstream of the baghouse ensuring that fine particles are decontaminated; and because the heated <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> is introduced at the same end of the drum as the feed soil, the soil is heated faster, resulting in a longer residence time. Higher temperatures and longer residence time mean that cocurrent systems can be used to treat soils contaminated with heavier petroleum products. Cocurrent systems are effective for light and heavy petroleum products including No. 6 fuel oil, crude oil, motor oil, and lubricating oil.|$|R

The impact of several parameters, related to anodic electrode composition (20, 40 and 60 wt. % Co/CeO 2), cell temperature (700 – 800 °C), carrier gas composition (CO 2 /He mixtures), and total feed flow rate (10 – 70 cm 3 /min), was systematically examined. The effect of molten carbonates on DCFC performance was also investigated by employing a eutectic mixture of lithium and potassium carbonates as carbon additives. In {{the absence of}} carbonates, the optimum performance (∼ 10 mW cm− 2 at 800 °C), was achieved by employing 20 wt. % Co/CeO 2 as anodic electrode and pure CO 2 as <b>purging</b> <b>gas.</b> An inferior behavior was demonstrated by utilizing He instead of CO 2 atmosphere in anode compartment and by increasing <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate.

40|$|The tritium {{breeding}} blanket is one of {{the most}} important components of a fusion reactor because it directly involves both energy extraction and tritium production, both of which are critical to fusion power. Because of their overall desirable properties, lithium-containing ceramic solids are recognized as attractive tritium breeding materials for fusion reactor blankets. Indeed, their inherent thermal stability and chemical inertness are significant safety advantages. In numerous in-pile experiments, these materials have performed well, showing good thermal stability and good tritium release characteristics. Tritium release is particularly facile when an argon or helium <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> containing hydrogen, typically at levels of about 0. 1 %, is used. However, the addition of hydrogen to the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> imposes a penalty when it comes to recovery of the tritium produced in the blanket. In particular, a large amount of hydrogen in the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> will necessitate a large multiple-stage tritium purification unit, which could translate into higher costs.

A disadvantage is that these particles {{may not have been}} decontaminated and are typically recycled to the dryer. Countercurrent dryers have several advantages over cocurrent systems. They are more efficient in transferring heat from <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> to contaminated soil, and the volume and temperature of exit gas are lower, allowing the gas to go directly to a baghouse without needing to be cooled.

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the separation, with microfluidics, of the components of a ternary mixture, when using vacuum or <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> pervaporation. The ternary mixture considered is a mixture of methanol (MeOH), water (H 2 O) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). In a previous work (Ziemecka in Lab Chip 15 : 504 – 511, 2015), we presented the proof of concept of a microfluidic device, which was able to partially separate MeOH from the other components of such a mixture, by using vacuum pervaporation. Here, our goal is to optimize the operation of this device, by considering vacuum pervaporation, but also <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> pervaporation. First, we provide a mathematical model of the device. This model is used to discuss the influence of the operating parameters on the device operation. To apply this model to the considered mixture, we determined the MeOH and H 2 O permeability coefficients of PDMS membranes prepared from different concentrations of the curing agent. The model is then successfully compared to experimental data. The model and the experiments show that high efficiencies can be reached for both vacuum and <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> pervaporation, provided a fine-tuning of the operating parameters.
