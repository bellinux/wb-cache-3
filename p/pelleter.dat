50|$|Mosionier {{was born}} in St. Boniface, Manitoba, to Mary Clara <b>Pelleter</b> Mosionier. She is the {{youngest}} of four children. Mosionier grew up living in several foster homes in Winnipeg as a ward of the Children's Aid Society. She attended St. Charles Catholic School, and Gordon Bell High School, completing Grade 11.|$|E
50|$|George {{came back}} a victor {{for the third time}} in her career when she fought Selena <b>Pelleter</b> on November 20, winning by knockout, again in the first round. On March 26, 1999, she lost a rematch to Jeterm by a four round {{unanimous}} decision, in Cherokee, North Carolina. This marked the beginning of three losses in a row, including one by a four round unanimous decision to Summer DeLeon in Temecula, California.|$|E
40|$|The multi-paneled, serial {{works in}} Curiosité - Le chercheur de trésor {{were the last}} made by Robert <b>Pelleter</b> before his death. They were {{conceived}} from the débris of civilization, {{and many of them}} are enigmatic. With the intention of exaggerating the magnificence of rejected objects, he photographed their shape, their shades, and the deposits of sediments that covered them in a warm, brilliant light, bringing out many details that were invisible to the naked eye. The authors discuss the idea that the artist, beyond his aesthetic infatuation with these vestiges, brought out the feeling of an experience born of sleep through the metaphoric device of image-objects. They refer to the thoughts of psychoanalyst Serge Tisseron, for whom objects are fundamentally extensions of our minds, images are also objects, and it is up to the individual to decide whether an object has something to say to him or her...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{reduction}} of maize as starch source on flow rate of pellet in continuous production process ABSTRACT. This experience {{was conducted to}} determine effect of reduction of maize as starch source on flow rate of pellet in continuous production process. Design of the experiment used was a completely randomized design with 3 treatments and 3 replicates. The data is analyzed by using of ANOVA {{and if there is}} a significance among treatments would tested using by contrast orthogonal. The variables observed were angle of repose, loose bulk density, compacted bulk density, and flow rate. The results showed that the reduction of maize as starch source did not give the significant effect on the variable that observed. The analyzed angle of repose showed variation 24. 200 to 25. 690, loose bulk density showed variation 621. 6 kg/m 3 to 658 kg/m 3, compacted bulk density showed variation 668. 3 kg/m 3 to 676. 8 kg/m 3, and flow rate showed variation 449. 69 kg/minute to 491. 41 kg/minute. Based on the result that the reduction of maize as starch source (corn, sorghum, menir) did not give the significant effect on flow rate of pellet and the pellet treatment with menir has the fastest pellet production time so flowability pellet from <b>pelleter</b> to material hadling (bucket elevator) machine is faster. As higher the values of flow rate, so the time of material movement from bin to the package is shorter...|$|E
40|$|Alfalfa pellets {{have been}} known to {{generate}} dust and fines because of repeated handling and transport. During transport, this product loses or gains moisture which may affect its quality. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} manufacture pellets which are not prone to breakage but still can be palatable to animals. Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of chop quality, process and machine variables on the quality of alfalfa pellets. Three different qualities of alfalfa chops namely, low, intermediate and high quality, were used in the experiments. The chemical components and physical characteristics of alfalfa chops and grinds were determined. Pellets were made from alfalfa grinds and from alfalfa grinds mixed with binders. Durability and hardness of pellets were evaluated after manufacture and also after a period of storage at 28 °C and 90 % relative humidity. To study their compressibility, alfalfa grinds were compressed in a single <b>pelleter</b> and the tensile strength of pellets was determined by diametral compression test. Of four models considered, the Cooper-Eaton model provided the best fit to the particle compression data (volume or density of pellets versus applied pressure). Parameters determined from the Heckel and Cooper-Eaton models indicated that grinds from low quality alfalfa chops densified readily by particle rearrangement. Grinds from intermediate and high quality alfalfa chops produced pellets which required lower yield stress for plastic deformation (PY) and were, therefore, more compressible. The tensile strength of pellets increased with compression pressure during pellet formation and peaked at 100 MPa. Conditioner temperatures of 92 °C and above and conditioned grind moistures of 8. 5 to 10 % w. b. were ideal for pelleting. High durability pellets were produced in a high length-to-diameter ratio die. High temperature of pellets extruded out of the <b>pelleter</b> die resulted in high durability. The particle size of the grinds, die speed and pellet temperature were regressed to pellet durability, such relationships could be used for pellet mill control. Collagen protein, hydrated lime, lignosulfonate, bentonite and pea starch were the binders used with three chop qualities at inclusion rates depending on their cost. The durability of pellets made from low quality alfalfa chops was improved by addition of binders. However, the effect of binders on pellets made from intermediate and low quality chops was negligible. Hydrated lime and pea starch were identified as potential binders. Additional pelleting trials conducted showed that an inclusion rate of 0. 5 % of either hydrated lime or pea starch was adequate for improving the durability of low quality alfalfa pellets. Extending the conditioning time from the usual 17 - 22 s to 35 - 40 s did not affect binder performance nor did it improve the durability or hardness of pellets. Experiments were also conducted to determine the effect of high humidity storage on the physical characteristics of pellets. Moisture absorption data were modeled using the exponential model. Pellet durability decreased when the absorbed pellet moistures exceeded 10 or 12 %. Pellet hardness was sensitive to moisture change. In summary, the results from these experiments revealed that the physical quality of dehydrated alfalfa pellets was a function of both process and machine variables. Alfalfa chop quality also affected pellet quality and results showed that binder usage could help rectify variations in pellet durability...|$|E
