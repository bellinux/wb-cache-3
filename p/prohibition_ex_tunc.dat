5000|$|<b>Ex</b> <b>tunc</b> is a {{legal term}} derived from Latin, and means [...] "from the outset". It can be contrasted with ex nunc, which means [...] "from now on". An example of usage of the term {{can be found in}} {{contract}} law, where avoidance of a contract can lead to it either being void ex nunc, i.e. from then on, or <b>ex</b> <b>tunc,</b> in which case it is treated as though it had never come into existence.|$|R

Such circumstances justify above all the existence of the right to withdraw from the contract as an exception to the principle of pacta sunt servanda. This work is mainly focused on analysing the problems of the consequences of withdrawal, only a part urgently needed is concentrated on the assumptions of such an act so that the work forms a compact unit. Regarding the mentioned above, {{the first part of the}} work generally deals with the assumptions that must be met so that the authorized party can exercise their right to withdraw from the contract. The moment when the withdrawal takes its effect does not also remain forgotten in this section. Further, the core of the work deals with the consequences of the withdrawal itself.

40|$|One of the {{significant}} competences of the European Court of Justice is to issue a preliminary ruling on an issue which {{has been referred to}} this Court by the national courts of the EU Member States. In this procedure, the national courts are provided the necessary explanation on the applicable EU law, either through by interpreting some legal provisions or by assessing the validity of a legal act adopted by the EU institutions. The preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice is binding for the national court which referred the issue to the Court. The decision is also binding for all national courts which have jurisdiction to decide on legal remedies in this matter. On the other hand, the effect of the preliminary ruling on other national courts is not quite clear. In other words, there is a dilemma as to whether the preliminary ruling on a disputed issue posed in one proceeding is binding for all other courts, which have not been actually involved in this particular proceeding. As for the temporal effect of a preliminary ruling, there is a general rule that the Court's preliminary ruling has a retroactive effect. However, in some situation, the Court of Justice may limit the retroactive effect of its rulings if their <b>ex</b> <b>tunc</b> application is incompatible with the principle of legal certainty...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of administrative courts judgments considered in terms of their impact over time for selected forms of action and inaction (inactivity) of tax authorities relating to the implementation of tax liability on the basis of Tax Law. Furthermore, this paper analyzed the impact of such judgments in time for the parties to respect the legal situation for tax purposes. In the simplest terms, the impact of judgment at the time means to have an effect on the legal consequences in respect of the contested act, interpretation or action back (retroactive – <b>ex</b> <b>tunc)</b> or from the time of its announcement (ex nunc). By influencing the action or inaction (inactivity) of tax administration the judgment of administrative court has also impact on the legal situation (procedural and substantive) for both the authority as well as the recipient of that authority. The effectiveness of the impact at the time of the judgments of provincial administrative courts depends largely on whether the court upheld the complaint or dismiss it. In case of taking into account the effectiveness depends on the type of penalties leading to the overthrow of the contested act, interpretation or actions, provided for in the Law on proceedings before administrative courts. We should also take into account and distinguish the impact point on appeal challenged action or inaction (inactivity) of the tax authorities from the impact – in a certain sense indirect – on the tax law situation (procedural and substantive) of the entity. p. pietrasz@uwb. edu. plUniwersytet w Białymstoku, Wydział Praw...|$|R

40|$|Dutch {{administrative}} courts are, on the whole, {{not allowed}} to perform an ex officio judicial review of administrative decisions. The binding nature of nearly all rules of substantive administrative law and the specific characteristics of the administrative decisions involved, beg the question how {{and to what extent}} this prohibition can be justified. According to recent legal history a (more) reciprocal way of establishing and maintaining administrative relationships between citizens and administrative bodies provides the leading justification. The fact remains, however, that legally speaking administrative decisions are still taken unitarily by administrative organs. Furthermore, a more reciprocal approach is obstructed by the principle of legality, which determines the binding nature of administrative law, nor does reciprocity fit with the principles of proper administration. Consequently, reciprocity is not a plausible justification. The same may be said about an additional justification from legal history, of possible infringement by ex officio judgements of legal certainty of parties. Since ex officio judicial review barely intrudes upon obtained legal positions of parties, this argument cannot be considered as a plausible justification either. Furthermore, principles of procedural law (such as respect of the rights of defense, procedure within a reasonable time and impartiality of administrative judges) do not justify a <b>prohibition</b> of <b>ex</b> officio judicial. The evaluation of the arguments for the current <b>prohibition</b> of <b>ex</b> officio judicial review, is supplemented with a historical analysis of early doctrinal thoughts on the nature of administrative procedure and a comparative analysis {{of the nature of the}} law of civil procedure, given the overridingly reciprocal nature of civil law relationships. On the basis of the evaluation of the most important pro-prohibition arguments in legal literature, and the historical and comparative analysis, the overall conclusion must be that there’s no proper legal justification for the present strong constraints on ex officio reviewing by Dutch administrative courts...|$|R

500|$|Following James Brady's {{death on}} August 4, 2014, the District of Columbia Medical Examiner ruled the death a {{homicide}} stemming from wounds {{caused by the}} Hinckley assassination attempt. This ruling raised the possibility that Hinckley could face additional future murder charges. However, prosecutors declined {{to do so for}} two reasons. First, a jury had already declared Hinckley insane {{at the time of the}} shooting and the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy would preclude overturning this ruling on account of Brady's death. Second, in 1981 Washington, D.C. still had the common law [...] "year and a day" [...] rule in place. Although the year and a day rule had been abolished in the district prior to 2014, the constitutional <b>prohibition</b> against <b>ex</b> post facto law would preclude the upgrading of charges for deaths resulting today from acts committed while the rule was in effect (and, for that matter, would also prohibit the government from challenging Hinkley's successful insanity defense based on the current federal law).|$|R

His book was researched through the extensive use of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). As a then super-secret agency, NSA was concerned about its unveiling to the world; accordingly, the government reclassified certain documents in an effort to stop publication.

40|$|We {{consider}} an incomplete contracting model of bilateral trade in intellectual property (IP) with sequential investments in its quality and with financial constraints. A financially-constrained inventor invests in an idea which she then sells to a buyer. The buyer in turn invests in developing this idea into a marketable product. We propose a novel formulation of ex ante control rights of an IP buyer, over the financially-constrained IP seller. We do not assume alienability of the inventor’s ideas; the control right {{is defined as}} <b>ex</b> ante prescribed <b>prohibition</b> of <b>ex</b> interim financial contracting with third parties. We show that such an agreement strengthens the seller’s ex ante incentives {{to invest in the}} quality of her product which is to be traded at the interim stage. The enforcement of this control right is credible, or renegotiation-proof, only for the controlling buyer (a downstream user of the IP), and not for other potential partners of the seller, such as independent venture capitalists.
