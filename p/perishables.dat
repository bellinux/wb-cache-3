40|$|Effective {{management}} of <b>perishable</b> goods {{is a major}} problem faced by the retailers of <b>perishable</b> goods. Time-Temperature-Indicator (TTI) labels available today can indicate the remaining shelf life of these <b>perishable</b> products. This technology can change the way <b>perishable</b> goods inventory is managed today, from a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Fixed Sell-By-Date basis to Least Shelf Life First Out (LSFO). In this paper a futuristic solution combining TTI and wireless technologies is proposed. Although the TTI and wireless based solution proposed in the paper is considered better, the benefits of the proposed solution have to be analyzed in quantitative terms. These have been analyzed using a Petri Net based approach for system simulation. The analysis shows that a retailer of <b>perishable</b> goods can reduce the losses suffered due to the expiry of <b>perishable</b> items before they can be sold, by more than 90 % and increase the net profits by more than 10 % in the test scenario. Thus we can conclude that adoption of the proposed system will benefit the retailer to a great extent...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{management}} of <b>perishable</b> foods {{is crucial for}} retailers to survive and prosper in the food retail market, as they take account for up to 50 percent of the industry's overall sales and consumers use them as a criterion to choose a retailer. However, food retailers face a challenge in pricing <b>perishable</b> foods. With the present prevailing pricing strategies, which discount the price of <b>perishable</b> foods when the expiry date is imminent, and daily stock replenishment practice, retailers often face the difficult situation where the display stock of a specific <b>perishable</b> food has a different remaining shelf-life but the same price. This may increase the waste due to unsold product; therefore, more dynamic price management for <b>perishable</b> foods is needed to facilitate a more efficient selling process. Numerous studies have proposed dynamic pricing models for <b>perishable</b> products, which were designed to determine an ideal pricing structure to improve retailer performance, however, they have not considered consumer demand {{in relation to a}} situation where identical products have different values resulting in different prices being available at the same time. In addition, the available studies of dynamic pricing for <b>perishable</b> products evaluate the value of dynamic pricing from the retailers' perspective, in terms of profitability, and consumers' perceptions of such pricing have rarely been studied in the context of marketing studies. This thesis, therefore, alms to demonstrate the value of dynamic pricing strategies for <b>perishable</b> foods from consumers' perspective, and compare the performance of different forms of dynamic pricing strategies by considering consumer demand in relation to such situations. Interviews were conducted with three food retail managers in different leading food retailers in South Korea, to gather practical information about the {{management of}} <b>perishable</b> foods. This interview data was then used as an input to the choice of sample product types for formal surveys to investigate consumers' perceptions of dynamic pricing strategies, and the design of a simulation model developed to compare the performance of different pricing approaches. The results presented in this thesis offers a significant contribution to the literature, providing a better understanding on the impact of dynamic pricing strategies for <b>perishable</b> foods from the consumers' perspective, an area that has received little attention. Moreover, this thesis provides a new insight into consumer demand that is particularly applicable to the pricing of <b>perishable</b> foods. The results of this thesis {{can be used as a}} guide for retailers seeking an effective pricing strategy for <b>perishable</b> foods. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This paper investigates how inventory control of <b>perishable</b> items is managed and identifies the <b>perishable</b> inventory challenges. The paper includes a review of relevant literature and identification of models dealing with <b>perishable</b> inventory control. The paper {{is based on}} a case study in the retail industry in Denmark about how the current procedures are operating in the retail supply chain. Based on the case study and literature review it is found that product quality deterioration and the aftercare of the items in the retail stores are two important parameters in <b>perishable</b> inventories. Furthermore, the length of periods as well as the total cost and profit margin function of the inventory control models are does not often fit reality. Therefore {{there is a need for}} further research into models dealing with these parameters...|$|R

Variations exist, including open-topped versions covered by a fabric curtain are used to transport larger loads.

It was involved in long-distance trade between northern and southern Europe, involving luxury goods (as found in the burial mounds) and probably wine from the south, and amber, metals, as well as probably <b>perishables</b> like leather and fur, from the north.|$|E
25|$|People {{were not}} only {{consuming}} these <b>perishables</b> because it became easier for they themselves to store them, but because the innovations in refrigerated transportation and storage led to less spoilage and waste, thereby driving the prices of these products down.

25|$|In most invasions, even {{in modern}} times, many fresh {{supplies}} are {{gathered from the}} invaded territories themselves. Before the laws of war, invaders often relied heavily on the supplies they would win by conquering towns along the way. During the Second Punic War, for example, Hannibal diverted his army to conquer cities simply to gather supplies; his strategy in crossing the Alps necessitated traveling with as few provisions as possible, expecting the Roman stores to sustain them when they had breached the border. The scorched earth tactics used in Russia forced Napoleon to withdraw his forces {{due to lack of}} food and shelter. Today, the Law of land warfare forbids looting and the confiscation of private property, but local supplies, particularly <b>perishables,</b> are still purchased when possible for use by occupying forces, and airplanes often use parachutes to drop supplies to besieged forces. Even as rules become stricter, the necessities of war become more numerous; in addition to food, shelter, and ammunition, today's militaries require fuel, batteries, spare mechanical parts, electronic equipment, and many other things. In the United States, the Defense Logistics Agency employs over 22,000 civilians with the sole task of logistics support, and 30,000 soldiers graduate from the U.S. Army Logistics Management College each year.|$|E

Adolfo looked to technology as a way to remedy problems that would arise on the ranch. He was the first farmer to ever purchase a refrigerator, which at that time, would take up an entire room in the house. However, he was able to safely store <b>perishables</b> {{for the first time in}} his life. He also had multiple heaters installed throughout the house in hopes of providing more warmth to his family. The most beautiful room in the Camarillo Ranch house belonged to Adolfo's middle daughter Carmen. Carmen was an avid equestrian who learned how to care for and maintain the horses from the Ranch Manager, Meliton Ortiz. Up until Meliton Ortiz’ death in 2010, he would visit the Camarillo Ranch House frequently to provide stories and details about his life growing up on the ranch. The home was remodeled in 1914, when the oldest daughter Carmen married. They opened many rooms by taking down walls and changing the stair design. The grand parlor had the greatest changes from this, causing it to go from multiple to rooms to one giant open grand parlor. This was in the hopes that it would open up the house more.|$|E
