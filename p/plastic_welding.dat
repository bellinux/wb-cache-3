40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{describe}} the possibilities of thermovision technique to evaluate temperature distribution on heating tools surfaces of <b>plastics</b> <b>welding</b> machines and temperature distribution on heated surfaces of welded parts. Design/methodology/approach: Heating tools of butt fusion, socket fusion and infrared fusion machines were tested using thewrmovision camera. Interrelation was shown between temperature distribution on heating tools and welded parts surfaces. Findings: The quality of ready welds is essentially dependent on uniform heating of welded parts. Achieved results shown that thermography may be applied as a tool to quick temperature distribution evaluation on heating elements and welded parts. Research limitations/implications: In order to evaluate temperature distribution with thermovision camera complete surface of heating element must be “visible”. The maximum angle between camera axis and line perpendicular do scanned surface is 30 °. Practical implications: Achieved results showed that thermography may be applied in industrial practice to test heating elements of <b>plastics</b> <b>welding</b> machines.

50|$|New {{fiber laser}} {{technology}} {{allows for the}} output of longer laser wavelengths, with the best results typically around 2,000 nm, significantly longer than the average 808 nm to 1064 nm diode laser used for traditional laser <b>plastic</b> <b>welding.</b> Because these longer wavelengths are more readily absorbed by thermoplastics than the infra-red radiation of traditional <b>plastic</b> <b>welding,</b> {{it is possible to}} weld two clear polymers without any colorants or absorbing additives. Common Applications will mostly fall in the medical industry for devices like catheters and microfluidic devices. The heavy use of transparent plastics, especially flexible polymers like TPU, TPE and PVC, in the medical device industry makes transparent laser welding a natural fit.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years diode lasers have evolved into tools for {{industrial}} manufacturing for instance for soldering, <b>plastics</b> <b>welding,</b> transformation hardening and heat-conduction welding. The high efficiency, compactness and in particular the high modularity makes them superior to conventional CO 2 - or Nd:YAG-lasers for the applications mentioned above. In the low-power regime fiber-coupled diode lasers are dominating. In these systems a variety of different beam transformation techniques are common for the forming of the line-shaped beam of a diode-laser bar into a spot which can be efficiently coupled into an optical fiber of circular cross section. At higher output powers diode laser stacks are commonly used, supplied with micro-optical cylinder lenses for collimation and shaping of the individual beams. A major limitation of presently available high-power diode lasers is the limited beam quality, which still is more than an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional lasers. A broad spectrum of activities is necessary and currently performed in order to increase the brightness: - increase of power and beam quality of the diode laser bar, - increased quality of micro-optics and packaging, - wavelength and polarization coupling. By means of these techniques output-power as well as beam quality have already been considerably increased in {{the past few}} years. Further improvements will be achieved in the future. With the new diode lasers the range of applications in industrial manufacturing can be increased considerably. Diode lasers are currently used in more mature applications such as transformation hardening, soldering and <b>plastics</b> <b>welding</b> but due to the increased beam qualities are now able to weld and cut metals as well. The unique feature of modularity of diode lasers is used in applications such as simultaneous hardening, single shot welding and marking with individually addressable diode laser bars...|$|R
