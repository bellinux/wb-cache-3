40|$|The {{investigations}} of Sabin and her co-workerse 9 {{demonstrated that the}} tubercie <b>phosphatide</b> was the biologically most active fraction of the various split-products of the tubercle bacillus as separated by Anderson. 2 It produced epithelioid cell response and tubercle formation.

" 8 Thomas and Dessau, 40 however, demonstrated that mice reacted only slightly to the injection of the tubercle <b>phosphatide</b> and were able to eliminate it without the development of a long-continued cellular reaction. These observations suggested that the mouse cells or a group of them were able to break down the tubercle <b>phosphatide</b> rapidly and to change it into a biologically inactive substance, while those of the rabbit phagocytized the <b>phosphatide</b> but eliminated it at a slower pace, if at all.

This treatment involves giving three compounds; DHA, a <b>phosphatide</b> precursor; choline, another <b>phosphatide</b> precursor {{present in the}} rodents' diets but not varied in this study; and UMP, a precursor of CTP, the rate-limiting compound in Kennedy Cycle production of phosphatides. Their administration increases the quantities of phosphatides, the major constituent of neuronal membrane, per brain cell, as well as specific synaptic proteins, the number of dendritic spines; and the expression of genes related to hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission. Since such membrane is the predominant component of synapses, the treatment might also ameliorate the loss of synapses occurring in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. My study involves assessing the behavioral effects of the treatment in individual rats or gerbils subsequently shown to manifest its neurochemical effects (i. e., increased phosphatides).

40|$|Abstract. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) red cells lose {{membrane}} lipids excessively during incubation in vitro. Individual <b>phosphatides</b> {{as well as}} cholesterol {{are lost}} in proportion to their content in membranes, suggesting that fragments of membrane are removed. Supplementation of HS red cells with glucose during incubation has no consistent protective effect, whereas diminishing the excessive sodium flux through these cells by suspending them in either sodium-free or hypertonic media prevents membrane fragmentation. The characteristic excessive increase in osmotic fragility which occurs in in-cubated HS red cells results both from inordinate accumulation of intracel-lular sodium ions which produces osmotic swelling, and from depletion of surface material which generates microspherocytosis. Inhibiting both of these processes by incubating HS red cells in sodium-free media completely prevents increases in osmotic fragility despite prolonged incubation. Normal red cells rendered hyperpermeable to cations by exposure either to n-butanol or to inhibitors of membrane sulfhydryl groups, lose membrane lipid upon incubation {{in a similar fashion}} to untreated HS red cells; perfectly smooth microspherocytes, akin to those seen in HS, are thereby generated. I conclude that depletion of membrane lipids in HS which leads to mi-crospherocytosis is correlatable with the excessive cation flux and possibly to the stimulated metabolism of acidic <b>phosphatides</b> in these red cells. It is sug-gested that this relation is derived from the fact that these <b>phosphatides</b> are in some way involved in maintaining the proper alignment of repeating mem-brane lipoprotein units, and that this function is adversely affected when these molecules are turning over more rapidly in response to increased cation flux...|$|R

The development of silicic acid column chromatography {{as a tool for}} <b>phosphatide</b> analysis by Lea, Rhodes and Stoll in 1955 (1) led to rapid advances in <b>phosphatide</b> biochemistry.

The technique has been particularly helpful in investigations us-ing radioactive isotopes, since relatively large amounts of lipid may be separated (12, 13). While column chromatography is well suited to preparative work, quantitative paper chroma-tography, introduced in 1957 by Marinetti, Er-bland and Kochen (14), gives greater resolving power and thus was particularly useful in our investigation of plasma phosphatides which was begun in 1958.

40|$|SUMMARY. The protein, {{polysaccharide}} and phospholipid {{constituents of}} Nocardia asteroides have been partially purified and their immuno-genicity studied in mice. Humoral and cellular immune responses were demonstrated against a crude cytoplasmic protein fraction (CPF). Two fractions of CPF were prepared on a Sephadex G- 200 column; a high mol. wt fraction, fraction-l(F 1) {{was capable of}} eliciting both types of immune responses, whereas fraction- 2 (F 2) behaved more like a hapten. <b>Phosphatides</b> elicited only humoral responses whereas polysaccharides were non-immunogenic...|$|R
