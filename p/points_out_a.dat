5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E

Through the radio, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) reminds the {{tourists}} to fasten their seat belts, and <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{problem with the}} transport. The transport takes off, past a cluster of mirrors concealing the maintenance dock entrance, and turns a corner into the Chamber of Destiny, where guests are presented with three doors. One of the three doors begins to glow more brightly than the other two, and Mara announces which gift the passengers have chosen to receive. The doors open, and the passengers enter the Hall of Promise.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} The Mystery of Jack of Kent and the Fate of Owain Glyndŵr, Alex Gibbon {{argues that the}} folk hero Jack of Kent, also known as Siôn Cent – the family {{chaplain}} of the Scudamore family – was in fact Owain Glyndŵr himself. Gibbon <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> number of similarities between Siôn Cent and Glyndŵr (including physical appearance, age, education, and character) and claims that Owain spent his last years living with his daughter Alys, passing himself off as an aging Franciscan friar and family tutor. There are many folk tales of Glyndŵr donning disguises to gain advantage over opponents during the rebellion.|$|E
25|$|As argued by Michael Witzel and Alexander Lubotsky, {{there is}} a {{proposed}} substratum in Proto-Indo-Iranian which can be plausibly identified with the original language of the BMAC. Moreover, Lubotsky <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> larger number of words apparently borrowed from the same language, which are only attested in Indo-Aryan and therefore evidence of a substratum in Vedic Sanskrit. Some BMAC words have now also been found in Tocharian. Michael Witzel {{points out that the}} borrowed vocabulary includes words from agriculture, village and town life, flora and fauna, ritual and religion, so providing evidence for the acculturation of Indo-Iranian speakers into the world of urban civilisation.|$|E
25|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{feared the}} Court's ruling {{would limit the}} ability of police to combat {{domestic}} violence. Chief Justice Roberts {{also noted that the}} purpose of the Fourth Amendment was to protect individual privacy, but any person who shares a dwelling (or, as Chief Justice Roberts <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> <b>a</b> locker or a hard drive) with another person may anticipate that the other person sharing access to their belongings might turn them over to authorities. In short, to share a home with someone is to surrender privacy as to that person, who might then consent to an invasion of it. Roberts also asserted that the majority opinion was arbitrary, as previous case law had held an objecting resident who was being held in the police car, as opposed to in the house, could be ignored with respect to the search.|$|E

500|$|Davidson <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{potential}} {{connection between}} the descriptor apaldr (Old Norse [...] "apple tree") {{and the birth of}} King Völsung, which is described earlier in the Völsunga saga as having occurred after Völsung's father Rerir sits atop a burial mound and prays for a son, after which the goddess Frigg has an apple sent to Rerir. Rerir shares the apple with his wife, resulting in his wife's long pregnancy. Davidson states that this mound is presumably the family burial mound, and proposes a link between the tree, fruit, mound, and the birth of a child.|$|E
500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> tale from Iceland that {{features}} a female settler [...] "whose husband had died on the voyage out, establishing her claim {{to a piece of}} land by driving a young hiefer round it." [...] Davidson notes that in Landnámabók, this is recorded as a recognized method for a woman to claim land, and the work further details that [...] "she might not possess more than she could encircle in this way between sunrise and sunset on a spring day." [...] Davidson comments that [...] "this sounds like a ritual taking over of land rather than a legal requirement, like the custom of men lighting fires when taking new land, and {{it is possible that the}} women's custom was linked with the fertility goddess." [...] In addition, Davidson notes that Zealand is the most fertile region of Denmark.|$|E

500|$|Boys' Ranch {{has become}} one of Simon and Kirby's most {{critically}} acclaimed creations and is held in high esteem by both creators. R. J. Vitone qualifies the series as having [...] "much more depth than previous S & K kid-gang strips– the basic elements that had made the romance and crime books so thematically strong were applied here as well." [...] Mendryk <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> certain drop of quality in later issues: [...] "It was part of the Simon and Kirby modus operandi to make heavy use of Kirby’s talents in the early issues of a new title and afterwards make more frequent use of other artists. For Boys' Ranch the change seems much more dramatic then in other titles. The last three issues are good, but they are not the masterpieces that the earlier issues were." ...|$|E
500|$|A soprano recitative, [...] "" [...] (Alas! that {{my faith}} is yet so weak), adopts a {{modified}} version of the chorale melody as the continuo line. Gardiner notes the [...] "uncompromising" [...] way of changing the normal order: the soprano, usually singing a chorale cantus firmus (firm song) to the continuo, expresses weakness and insecurity here, marked [...] "a battuta", while the firm foundation is the chorale in the bass, to which the text of stanza three, [...] "" [...] (Therefore, I will hope in God), could be imagined. Gardiner <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> detail: the word [...] "Zeichen" [...] (sign) [...] "is given expressive, symbolic expression, a diminished seventh chord assigned to that word … formed by all three 'signs", one sharp (F-sharp), one flat (E-flat) and one natural (C). As Eric Chafe concludes, since St John's Gospel is known as the Book of Signs, and since the tonal plan of Bach's St John Passion appears to have been conceived as a form of play on the three musical signs (ie sharp, flat and natural key areas) this important detail in the plan of Aus tiefer Not perhaps possesses a wider significance, relating it to Bach's tonal-allegorical procedures in general.|$|E
500|$|During {{investigation}} phases, players control Edgeworth directly, {{either with}} the D-pad, or by sliding the map that is {{displayed on the}} bottom screen. The player has Edgeworth walk around crime scenes in search for evidence; they also meet witnesses and suspects during these phases, who they can talk to. As Edgeworth notices various things in the crime scene, they are saved as Edgeworth's thoughts. Using the [...] "logic" [...] function, the player can connect two such thoughts to gain new information; for instance, by connecting two bullet holes with a gun that has only been fired once, Edgeworth will conclude that two guns must {{have been at the}} crime scene. At some points, the player is able to control a cursor to examine parts of the crime scene; by using the [...] "deduction" [...] function at these points, the player is able to point out a contradiction between the crime scene and evidence. If the player successfully <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> contradiction, they gain access to new information. At certain points, a device called Little Thief can be used to create hologram reproductions of the crime scene; by investigating these reproductions, the player can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden. As more evidence is uncovered, the hologram is updated. After having examined an area sufficiently, the investigation phase ends, and the game moves on to a rebuttal phase.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} numerous cultural references. The song [...] "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" [...] by C+C Music Factory {{is played}} twice during the episode: first as the steel mill transforms into a disco, and second over the closing credits. Homer's record collection includes music by The New Christy Minstrels and The Wedding of Lynda Bird Johnson, the albums Loony Luau and Ballad of the Green Berets by Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler. The song that John picks {{out and he}} and Homer dance to is [...] "I Love the Nightlife" [...] by Alicia Bridges, and the song that Bart dances to is [...] "The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)" [...] by Betty Everett. When John is introduced, there is a plastic pink flamingo lying in the background, a reference to John Waters's film Pink Flamingos. Items in John's store include several buttons endorsing political campaigns of Richard Nixon, Dan Quayle, and Bob Dole {{as well as an}} issue of TV Guide owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis which features the title characters from the sitcom Laverne & Shirley on the cover. When John takes the Simpson family on a driving tour of Springfield's shopping district, he <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> store where he claims that the Mexican film actress Lupe Vélez bought the toilet she drowned in. This is a reference to the urban legend that Velez was found dead with her head in the toilet the night of her suicide in 1944.|$|E
500|$|Richard Fogle {{responded to}} the {{critical}} attack on Keats's emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by Garrod, Gerard, and others in 1953. His argument was similar to Brooks: that the poem was thematically coherent {{and that there is}} a poet within the poem that is different from Keats the writer of the poem. As such, Keats consciously chose the shift in the themes of the poem and the contrasts within the poem represent the pain felt when comparing the real world to an ideal world found within the imagination. Fogle also responded directly to the claims made by Leavis: [...] "I find Mr. Leavis too austere, but he <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> quality which Keats plainly sought for. His profusion and prodigality is, however, modified by a principle of sobriety." [...] It is possible that Fogle's statements were a defense of Romanticism as a group that was both respectable in terms of thought and poetic ability. Wasserman, following in 1953, claimed that [...] "Of all Keats' poems, it is probably the 'Ode to a Nightingale' that has most tormented the critic [...] in any reading of the 'Ode to a Nightingale' the turmoil will not down. Forces contend wildly within the poem, not only without resolution, but without possibility of resolution; and the reader comes away from his experience with the sense that he has been in 'a wild Abyss'". He then explained, [...] "It is this turbulence, I suspect, that has led Allen Tate to believe the ode 'at least tries to say everything that poetry can say.' But I propose it is the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' that succeeds in saying what poetry can say, and that the other ode attempts to say all that the poet can." ...|$|E
