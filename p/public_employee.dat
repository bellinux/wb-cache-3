5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a <b>public</b> <b>employee.</b> Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E

In September 2009, Cordray, on behalf of Ohio's largest <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> pension funds (State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio and the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System), the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and pension funds from Sweden and the Netherlands, filed suit alleging that Bank of America, its directors and four executives (Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Joe Price, accounting chief Neil Cotty and former Merrill chairman and CEO John Thain) acted to conceal Merrill's growing losses from shareholders voted to approve the deal the prior December.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reform offers {{economic}} {{gains for}} society at large, but can represent {{a threat to}} the interests of <b>public</b> <b>employees.</b> <b>Public</b> sector reform faces opposition from voters employed in public sector. Norwegian data allow for an analysis this interpretation. Survey data show that <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> prefer less reform {{than the rest of the}} population. The voting behavior of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> is more sensitive to reform than is that of other voters (the swing voter hypothesis), and hence: shares of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> in a local jurisdiction have a negative impact on the probability of reform. 1...|$|R

50|$|Controversies {{about the}} {{institution}} of the Civil Service in Greece are widespread. Typically, they concern the allegedly large numbers of <b>public</b> <b>employees,</b> the lack of adequate meritocracy in their employment, the strong ties that significant portions of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> maintain with political parties and the clientelism that this relationship incubates, internal inequalities of wages among <b>public</b> <b>employees,</b> and inequalities of the high income of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> relevant to that of private sector workers. The Civil Service payscale is also controversial given the conditions before the financial crisis that made being a civil servant a dream-job.|$|R
40|$|Surveys are a {{commonly}} used means of measuring transparency levels, {{but they are}} potentially vulnerable to perceptual biases. This study sought to examine perceptual differences by the respondents’ identities as general citizens or <b>public</b> <b>employees,</b> and the possible negative perceptions that one group may have of the other concerning responses to a survey-based measure of transparency. The survey was designed {{on the basis of}} existing literature, suggesting that transparency has up to six facets. Two samples were taken: from citizens who visited district offices to file civil applications during the survey period; and from <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> involved in processing these applications. A total of 472 surveys were used for analysis: 233 citizens and 239 <b>public</b> <b>employees.</b> The results indicated that the two groups had different understandings of transparency. Data from <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> produced a three-factor solution, which was labeled as Efficiency, Reliability, and Access. For citizens, a two-factor solution was a better fit, with the factors being described as Accessibility (a wider notion than Access) and Utility. The findings suggest that <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> adopt a somewhat technical view of transparency, whereas citizens have more practical concerns about it. Only citizens’ unfavorable perception of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> had a negative influence on the level of transparency. This study contributes to the understanding of how <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> and citizens have qualitatively different perceptions of transparency. Points for practitioners To assess progress in governmental transparency, we must measure it, and surveys offer an accessible and potentially cost-effective approach. However, the survey responses of citizens and <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> show that they understand transparency in qualitatively different ways, with citizens’ perceptions of transparency also influenced by their perceptions of <b>public</b> <b>employees.</b> If governments are to increase public trust in policymaking and administration, they must focus on improving transparency as it is understood by the public rather than how it is understood by public servants...|$|R

25|$|Souter also rebuked the {{majority}} for accepting the incorrect view that any statement {{made by a}} <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> constitutes, or should be treated as, the government’s own speech, because such a view is valid only when a <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> is hired to promote a particular policy by communicating a particular message. He further disagreed with {{the majority}}’s argument for limiting the Pickering doctrine, which held that the First Amendment protections were unnecessary {{in light of the}} existence of a comprehensive set of state and federal statutes that protected government whistle-blowers. Souter noted that speech that addressed official wrongdoing may well be unprotected under existing statutory protections (e.g., the teacher in Givhan would not qualify as a whistle-blower).|$|E
40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>employees</b> do {{not enjoy}} the same free speech rights under the First Amendment as do {{ordinary}} citizens. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals recently adopted a virtual per se rule precluding free speech rights for <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> while they are performing ordinary job duties. This Note argues that such a per se rule both lacks policy justification and, more importantly, would undermine {{the purposes of the}} First Amendment by impeding academic freedom and permitting viewpoint discrimination. Rejecting the per se rule best preserves the free speech rights of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> and in turn allows them to speak freely about governmental operations—an especially important function of <b>public</b> <b>employees,</b> who are firsthand witnesses to government activities...|$|R

Today 2 ̆ 7 s <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> have obviously concluded that enhancement of terms and conditions of employment can only be achieved through the negotiating process. The posture of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> was in 1919 (the time period dealt with by Russell) an unthinkable concept insofar as it impinged upon the sovereignty of government.
