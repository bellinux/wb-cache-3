5|$|Rivett's case made {{headlines}} around the world. Within {{days of the}} murder, newspapers reported on Veronica Lucan's statement to the police, with claims that she had <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> collude with her husband to ensure her safety. In January 1975 Veronica gave an exclusive interview to the Daily Express. She also appeared in a murder reconstruction, in the same newspaper, complete with posed photographs taken inside the house.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E
5|$|When {{the meat}} was shriveling, flaking, and falling off, one {{anonymous}} donor gave the gallery $260 for replacement meat. (This number was of some debate, with $350 worth of meat listed in one vegetarian magazine.) Because {{of the negative}} publicity the work had received, gallery staff <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be caterers when finding a butcher in the Ottawa area to provide replacement meat.|$|E
50|$|Teresa, meanwhile, decides that, to taunt Alfredo, {{she will}} <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> {{be in love}} with him, only to dash his hopes later on. Alfredo, who overhears this, {{declares}} that he will <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> reject Teresa. When she learns this, Teresa says that she will feign insanity. By this point, all of the major characters are <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> be something they are not. Alfredo <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> be a Duke married to Ultrice and indifferent <b>to</b> Teresa. Ultrice <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> be Duchess, married <b>to</b> Alfredo. Teresa <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> be insane with love for Alfredo. Bartolo and Nita <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> be clock-work Hamlet and Ophelia. The Tamorras <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> be monks. Minestra <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> be an old lady.|$|R
60|$|LORD DARLINGTON. [Still seated L.C.] Oh, {{nowadays}} so many conceited {{people go}} about Society <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> be good, that I {{think it shows}} rather a sweet and modest disposition <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> be bad. Besides, there is this to be said. If you <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> be good, the world takes you very seriously. If you <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> be bad, it doesn't.

5|$|After {{the battle}} the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan's name, proclaiming victory. These {{announced}} that the Sultan regretted that his current state of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign. His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> keep up communication with him. Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Ali Bhai visits Hyderabad and assassinates Narayana. He meets Pandu {{to discuss}} {{the murder of a}} {{minister}} by blowing up a balloon. Pandu rejects this as it would involve killing innocents. At the same time as they are arguing, Qadri arrests Ali Bhai and tortures him. Ali Bhai's henchmen retaliate by filming Qadri's daughter as she is enticed into sexual activity by the minister's son, and release it to the media. They also kidnap her, forcing the police to release Ali Bhai. At the same time, Pandu manages to catch the gangsters who <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> rape Shruti and she reconciles with him.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{was born}} Abisin Abbas in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, on 26February 1902. He gravitated toward {{traditional}} theatre {{at a young}} age after visits from the wandering Wayang Kassim and Juliana Opera stambul troupes; he <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> act with his friends in stage plays which they had seen. After completing his formal education up to the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (junior high school) level– first in Malay-language schools then Dutch ones– he moved to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He worked as a reporter for two daily newspapers, Bintang Timoer and Bintang Hindia; he may have also worked on a farm.|$|E

Mrs. Johnson <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> be in love with him, which we know she is not. And Johnson <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> be a very terrible person; and Mrs. Johnson pretends, till eleven o'clock, to believe it.

25|$|When a party <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> negotiate, but {{secretly}} has {{no intention}} of compromising, the party is considered negotiating in bad faith. Bad faith is a concept in negotiation theory whereby parties <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.|$|R
5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|During {{his long}} and tumultuous career, Paul was {{appointed}} an Orthodox bishop, sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices, <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, switched from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and back again, supported both the See of Rome and the Avignon anti-popes in the Western Schism, {{and managed to}} be named Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. In the end, his deceptions unmasked, he returned to Constantinople, where he repented and confessed his sins before a synod in 1394.|$|E
5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E

5|$|On the {{opposing}} side is Siam, a Siamese cat who controls all of West Ikebukuro {{and is the}} leader of the Siam Army. Siam's principal henchman and general of the Siam Army is Kline, who has a distinct hatred for humans and sees them only as her potential slaves. Acting as Siam's bodyguards are A-Ko and I-Ko, two Manx cats. Having been previously discriminated against for their lack of tails, A-Ko and I-Ko <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> have tails, fearing rejection from Siam.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{agreement}} was signed, the clauses calling for territorial negotiation {{and an end to}} military actions were unilaterally broken by Poland. Polish general Lucjan Żeligowski, acting under secret orders from Piłsudski, <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> disobey stand-down orders from the Polish military command and marched on Vilnius. The city was occupied on October 9. The Suwałki Agreement was to take effect at noon on October 10. Żeligowski established the Republic of Central Lithuania which, despite intense protests by Lithuania, was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic in 1923. The Vilnius Region remained under Polish administration until 1939.|$|E

5|$|While Wallis was {{researching the}} book, the Guardian's Office, Scientology's {{intelligence}} agency, investigated him. They assigned an individual as an undercover agent who <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be {{a student at}} Stirling University, where he was teaching. The agent inquired if Wallis was involved with illegal drugs. Wallis later discovered forged letters purportedly sent by him and designed to implicate him in controversial acts. Wallis assumed this was a reaction by the Guardian's Office to The Road to Total Freedom.|$|E
5|$|A seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the {{relationship}} between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing {{that he had made}} progress on his own towards realizing the Tao.|$|E
5|$|At {{the reunification}} summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis was actually the hostages. The true IRIS agents escaped and infiltrated the summit to kill all delegates. IRIS agents killed and replaced various security agents for a massacre. Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E

50|$|Several episodes show Janitor <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> be {{a doctor}} ("Dr. Ján Ĩtor") and he also greatly enjoys one {{occasion}} when he is asked to assist during a medical emergency.

5|$|Before {{the tunnel}} had been completed, the American POWs were {{transferred}} to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland. Juskalian estimated that if the tunnel had been dug for another 100feet, it would reach its destination {{at the bank of}} the Fulda River. Two American POWs <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and to continue working on the tunnel and ultimately escape. The two Americans, who eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in Oflag 64, relayed the news that the tunnel had been discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after planting a spy among the POWs.|$|E
5|$|Bret Hart was {{scheduled}} to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated {{that the only way}} to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to throw a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E
5|$|By {{established}} practice, Byzantine emperors did {{not personally}} lead troops into battle. Heraclius ignored this convention and joined with his general Priscus' siege of the Persians at Caesarea. Priscus <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be ill, however, {{and did not}} meet the emperor. This was a veiled insult to Heraclius, who hid his dislike of Priscus and returned to Constantinople in 612. Meanwhile, Shahin's troops escaped Priscus' blockade and burned Caesarea, much to Heraclius' displeasure. Priscus was soon removed from command, along with others who served under Phocas. Philippicus, an old general of Maurice's, was appointed as commander-in-chief, but he proved himself incompetent against the Persians, avoiding engagements in battle. Heraclius then appointed himself commander along with his brother Theodore to finally solidify command of the army.|$|E
