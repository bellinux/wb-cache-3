5|$|The son of {{an aristocratic}} family, de Hauteclocque {{graduated}} from the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, the French military academy, in 1924. After service with the French Occupation of the Ruhr and in Morocco, he returned to Saint-Cyr as an instructor. He was awarded the croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August 1933. During the Second World War he fought in the Battle of France. He then {{became one of the}} first to make his way to Britain to fight with the Free French under General Charles de Gaulle, adopting the nom de guerre of Leclerc so that his wife and children would not be <b>put</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> if his name appeared in the papers. He was sent to French Equatorial Africa, where he rallied local leaders to the Free French cause, and led a force against Gabon, whose leaders supported Vichy France. From Chad he led raids into Italian-controlled Libya. After his forces captured Kufra, he had his men swear an oath known today as the Serment de Koufra, in which they pledged to fight on until their flag flew over the Strasbourg Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is <b>put</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> as humans begin {{to destroy the}} forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E

25|$|Voynix: {{named after}} the Voynich manuscript. The voynix are biomechanical, self-replicating, {{programmable}} robots. They originated in an alternate universe, and were brought into the Ilium universe before 3000 A.D. The Global Caliphate somehow gained access to these proto-voynix and after replicating three million of them, battled the New European Union around 3000 A.D. In 3200 A.D., the Global Caliphate upgraded the voynix and programmed them to kill Jews. Using time travel technology acquired from the French (previously used to investigate the Voynich Manuscript and {{which resulted in the}} destruction of Paris), the Global Caliphate sent the voynix forward in time to 4600 A.D. Upon their arrival they begin to replicate rapidly in the Mediterranean Basin. As the post-human operations there were <b>put</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> Prospero and Sycorax created the calibani to fend off the voynix, and eventually Prospero reprogrammed them into inactivation. After the final fax, they were reprogrammed to serve the new old-style humans.|$|E
25|$|The villa {{received}} prominence {{at national}} level since the 1980s and more recently in 2001, when the lack of finance <b>put</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for {{the closure of the}} home. On 14 March of that year the Friars reached an agreement with the Ministry of Social Services, housed at Palazzo Ferreria, to receive financial social services from the Government of Malta and other sources. An agreement was reached under notary Eugene Montanaro with the condition that the home works hand in hand with Aġenzija Appoġġ. Soon after the agreement, the house was restructured and upgraded with modern facilities at a financial cost of Lm 50,000, of which Lm 31,148 were allocated from Appoġġ with finance paid by the government of Malta. The home was then still run by the Friars, but also assisted by Programme Manager Anna Maria Laurenti, who received her studies in London. The part of the property used for religious services was kept and restructured, and was this time open as Blessed Nazju Falzon Chapel. Falzon is a beatified Maltese and this house-church is the first and only place of worship dedicated to him. The chapel within the property has its own entrance and was inaugurated to the public on 30 May 2001 by provincial Bernard Bartolo.|$|E
25|$|Declines in the {{abundance}} of wild salmon due to over fishing placed greater pressure on hatcheries to increase production and restore the wild salmon stock to supply fisheries. The problem is that hatcheries can never truly replicate the environment of wild salmon, an issue which often results in physiological and behavioral differences between wild salmon and those reared in hatcheries. These differences are often the product of genetic changes associated with inbreeding, artificial selection, and natural selection as well as different environmental pressures acting on hatchery fish than wild populations. Due to the size selective nature of fishing favoring larger fish, a reduction in average size of the adult salmon has been observed over time. The smaller salmon make {{a greater proportion of}} the remaining individuals continuing the population, and problems arise when these hatchery-reared fish are introduced into the wild populations. Unlike wild salmon, larger salmon are selected for in hatcheries and are typically much larger than wild salmon. The result is that hatchery-produced salmon tend to out-compete wild salmon for space, food, and other resources. Some salmon species in hatcheries exhibit predatory behavior toward wild salmon because they grow to be much larger. Regardless of whether predation is observed, natural social interactions are disturbed by the release of large numbers of hatchery-reared salmon where wild populations are low because salmon in hatcheries naturally have a higher propensity towards aggressive behavior. Overall, natural salmon populations are <b>put</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> when hatchery-reared salmon populations are introduced due to competition for resources, predation by larger individuals, and negative social interactions that upset the natural order observed in wild salmon populations. As a result, wild salmon populations are steadily dropping as the pressure to continue breeding salmon in hatcheries increases. Conservation efforts that work to place limitations on hatcheries to increase the wild salmon populations are hindered by financial pressures because hatcheries effectively support many states economically by accounting for over 70% of the salmon harvested for recreational and commercial purposes.|$|E

His death revealed that Afonso suffered from epilepsy, as did his father. The grief of PedroII and his wife was enormous. It was feared that the shock might affect Teresa Cristina's health, as she was pregnant at the time with her third child. She later gave birth without complications on 13 July to a girl, who was christened Leopoldina. The devastated emperor wrote a letter to his stepmother, the Empress Amélia, dated 11 July 1847, telling her of Afonso's death: [...] "With the most piercing grief I tell you that my little Afonso, your godson, unfortunately died of convulsions, which he suffered during five hours on the 4th of last month; and a few days ago little Isabel was <b>put</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> by a strong attack of convulsions that greatly frightened me." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead, in August 1940, de Gaulle ordered de Hauteclocque to French Equatorial Africa, {{where the}} local leaders had {{declared}} themselves for Free France, {{as the governor}} of French Cameroon.

The Battle of Gabon lasted from 12 October to 12 November 1940, and ended with 20 dead and Gabon in Free French hands. Vichy prisoners were held as hostages in case Vichy France tried to retaliate against the families of Free Frenchmen.

500|$|The lead-up to Underbelly {{involved}} a heavy marketing campaign which covered radio, print, billboards {{and an increased}} online presence, {{including the use of}} social networking tools. At a reported cost of $500,000, both this marketing investment and potentially millions of dollars in advertising revenue were claimed to be <b>put</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> by the Victorian Supreme Court's injunction, as the series was expected to attract 800,000 to 1million viewers in Victoria alone. The injunction was put in place to ensure that upcoming criminal trials were not unfair to the accused, because the series contained fictionalised re-enactments of several disputed events. Underbelly began screening on 13 February 2008 on the Nine Network in all states and territories except Victoria. An edited version of the series premiered in Victoria on 14 September 2008 after the injunction was partially lifted, although only the first five episodes were shown. In 2011, the injunction was partially lifted and the series was screened as [...] "Underbelly: Uncut". This rebroadcast included scenes from the original DVD release, as well as several significant changes that were made to keep the show current, including a newly recorded final voiceover and the crediting of several characters that were previously uncredited (allowable due to the ending of related trials). Some previously named characters in the final episode however are now unable to be named, resulting in a continued banning of the sale of the video release in Victoria.|$|E

[...] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade. [...] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said {{the costs of the}} new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter. [...] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent. [...] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate, and had come {{in the face of a}} silence from the White House that had <b>put</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> her standing within the administration. [...] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination. [...] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor. [...] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions [...] "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura" [...] and Time magazine labelled Browner the [...] "Queen of Clean Air". [...] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns, Browner said: [...] "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125million Americans, including 35million children." ...|$|E
