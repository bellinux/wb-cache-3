40|$|Introduction: The article {{presents}} a rapid and simple analytical procedure for determination of four tetracyclines (oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, and doxycycline) in animal <b>medicated</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Material and Methods: Two-gramme samples were extracted by a Na 2 EDTA-McIlvaine buffer (pH 4) /methanol mixtures (40 / 60, v/v). The determination {{was achieved by}} liquid chromatography using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C 18 analytical column with mass spectrometer detection (LC-MS). Results: Recoveries of the antibiotics from spiked feed samples ranged from 78. 2 % to 113. 5 %. The LOD and LOQ for tetracyclines in feeds ranged from 2. 8 to 4. 2 and from 4. 3 to 5. 7 mg/kg, respectively. Conclusion: The method was successfully validated and proved to be efficient, precise, and useful for quantification of tetracyclines in <b>medicated</b> <b>feedingstuffs...</b>|$|R

Apart from active substances, premixes contain carriers which have a role in the homogenization of medicated feedstuffs. Wheat bran as a carrier may be a source of different, potentially harmful or toxic substances e. g. afl atoxin. In our study, 15 different batches of premixes with a wheat bran component were tested for afl atoxin B 1 (AFB 1) by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The samples tested showed contamination with AFB 1 ranging from 1. 5 to 35 ng/g (mean = 18. 79 ng/g). However, no correlation between AFB 1 levels and the month of collection or season of production was observed. Considering the composition of the premix, the only possible source of contamination with AFB 1 was wheat bran. Contamination probably occurred before the production of the premix, probably in the fi eld or during storage. Concentrations of active substances and citric acid (a neutralising agent for mycotoxins) were in accordance with the producer’s declaration.

Oxytetracycline (OTC) was recently demonstrated {{to be an}} effective therapeutant for WS-RLP infections and associated losses due to WS. In addition, a long duration of protection (approximately one year) was noted anecdotally. Part one of this study examined the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of OTC treatment in red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, held at 13. 4 oC. Medication was administered orally in an artificial diet containing 1. 85 % active OTC at a rate of 103. 4 mg/kg abalone for 10, 20 and 30 days. Control abalone were fed the same diet lacking OTC. Significant differences in prevalence and intensity of infection in both the post-esophagus and digestive gland were observed.

A novel drug delivery system creates additional patient benefits that will add new competitiveadvantages for a drug. Oral route is most convenient for the patient that’s why it is very popularin the society. Chewing gum delivery system is convenient, easy to administer - anywhere,anytime - and is pleasantly tasting making it patient acceptable. Medicated chewing gum offers awide range of advantages that make it an excellent alternative. The medicated gums are dosageforms given orally for both local and therapeutic effect. It also offers the possibility of rapidlyabsorbing the drug through the oral mucosa leading to fast onset of action and bioavailability. Also, it has superior sensorial properties compared with other dosage forms; it has a moreattractive appeal and offers the patient an active control over the treatment. Added to thetherapeutic effect of the drug there is a very positive synergistic effect brought on by the actionof chewing, which has a positive effect on the patient’s compliance.

The prevalence of the sleep apnea and hypopnea syndrome both in adult and pediatric population may be evaluated only approximately, as {{not all of the}} patients, suffering from this pathology, may call some adequate complaints, which, in their turn, help diagnose the disease. For example, only obstructive sleep apnea syndrome according to the data of British epidemiologists is met among the adults at the frequency rate, which can be compared with the prevalence of the bronchial asthma. Since metabolic acidosis caused by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor of acetazolamide stimulates the ventilation of lungs, the researchers have set forth a supposition that the application of this medicine can be efficient to treat the respiratory disturbances in sleep. There is wide application of acetazolamide <b>for</b> the <b>medicated</b> correction of sleep apnea and hypopnea syndrome of the central genesis among both adults and children. When using acetazolamide for the long term therapy of respiratory disturbances among adult patients, the main issue is the probable growth of tolerance towards the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor along with the continuous longbterm application of the medicine.

In this paper I will challenge this view on a particular area of psychopathology, mild and moderate depression and anxiety, showing that in these particular situations, 15 - 20 sessions of psychotherapy are sufficient and efficient for recovery and there is no further need <b>for</b> <b>medicating</b> the client, unless the client himself desires this particular type of psychiatric approach.

Heart period variability (standard deviation [SD] of 120 consecutive RR or PP intervals) was measured at supine rest in 34 patients with congestive heart failure (23 patients receiving diuretics, digoxin or vasodilators and 11 patients weaned from all medications), 30 cardiac transplant patients (both innervated recipient and denervated donor atrial rates) and 16 age-matched healthy control subjects. Arterial baroreflex gain was evaluated with intravenous bolus injections of phenylephrine in 22 transplant patients. Mean heart period variability (±SEM) was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in the heart failure groups (22 ± 3 ms <b>for</b> <b>medicated</b> and 17 ± 3 ms for nonmedicated) than in the transplant patients (41 ± 5 ms) or control subjects (58 ± 5 ms). Heart period variability of the transplant patients was {{less than that of}} the control patients (p < 0. 05). A stepwise regression model revealed that heart period variability was inversely related to systolic arterial pressure and directly related to time after transplantation R 2 = 0. 39; p = 0. 03) in the transplant patients. Baroreflex gain of normotensive transplant patients was normal (11. 7 ± 1. 0 ms/mm Hg) and correlated directly with heart period variability (r = 0. 62; p < 0. 001). These data suggest that subnormal levels of cardiac parasympathetic activity at rest associated with congestive heart failure can be restored progressively toward normal by correction of congestive heart failure after cardiac transplantation.

Method: Children ages 8 to 12 years (n = 102 : 18 medicated, 84 unmedicated) were re-cruited in a specialized outpatient clinic over a 3 -year period. All had a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Comparisons were done using t-tests for continuous measures and chi-square tests for discrete measures. Treatment-related changes were assessed using re-peated measures analyses of variance. Results: Medicated and unmedicated groups did not differ by age, sex, socioeconomic sta-tus, or diagnostic profile. Initial ratings of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and global functioning were comparable. Greater family dysfunction and family frustration were reported in medicated children. With treatment, both groups improved symptomati-cally and showed improved family functioning. Families of medicated children showed a greater reduction in frustration than families of unmedicated children, whereas unmedi-cated children showed greater gains in global functioning.

40|$|The human {{immune system}} is highly {{efficient}} and remarkably protective when functioning properly. Similar to other physiological systems, it functions best when the body is maintained with a balanced diet, sufficient rest and a moderately stress-free lifestyle. It can be disrupted by inappropriate drug use and extreme emotion or exertion. The functioning of normal or compromised immune systems can be enhanced by properly prescribed moderate exercise conditioning regimens in healthy people, and in some human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1) -infected patients but not in others who unable to complete an interval training program. Regular exercise conditioning in healthy people reduces cardiovascular risk factors, increases stamina, facilitates bodyweight control, and reduces stress by engendering positive feelings of well-being. Certain types of cancer may also be suppressed by appropriate exercise conditioning. Various exercise regimens are being evaluated as adjunct treatments <b>for</b> <b>medicated</b> patients with the HIV- 1 syndrome. Limited anecdotal evidence from patients suggests that moderate exercise conditioning is per se responsible for their survival well beyond expectancy.
