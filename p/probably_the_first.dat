5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Sir William Davenant of the Duke's Company {{staged a}} 1662 {{adaptation}} in which Henry Harris played Romeo, Thomas Betterton Mercutio, and Betterton's wife Mary Saunderson Juliet: she was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> woman {{to play the}} role professionally. Another version closely followed Davenant's adaptation and was also regularly performed by the Duke's Company. This was a tragicomedy by James Howard, in which the two lovers survive.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs were <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{organized}} {{force to}} conduct successful {{battles in the}} desert. By knowing back routes and the locations of oases and by utilizing camels, Muslim Arab forces were able to successfully overcome both Roman and Persian forces in the period 600 to 700 AD during {{the expansion of the}} Islamic caliphate.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} death in the 2006 murder of Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian KGB agent who had {{defected}} to the British MI6 intelligence agency, was determined to be 210Po poisoning. According to Prof. Nick Priest of Middlesex University, an environmental toxicologist and radiation expert, speaking on Sky News on December 3, 2006, Litvinenko was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> person to die of the acute α-radiation effects of 210Po.|$|E

Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.|$|E
5|$|Abul Ala {{was born}} in Maʿarra, modern Maarrat al-Nuʿman, Syria, {{near the city of}} Aleppo, in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the Abbasid Caliphate, the third Islamic caliphate, and was during the Golden Age of Islam. He {{was a member of the}} Banu Sulayman, a notable family of Maʿarra, {{belonging}} to the larger Tanukh tribe. One of his ancestors was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> qadi of Maʿarra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the Banu Sulayman had also been noted as good poets.|$|E
5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper {{layers of the}} atmosphere is quite rare. <b>Probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball was more than a thousand times as massive and it got 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{the first}} New Zealander to be awarded the Victoria Cross, Heaphy was an {{accomplished}} artist. His watercolours, mostly produced between 1841 and 1855, are an important record of many scenes {{in the early days}} of European settlement in New Zealand. Many of his works have been published in histories of New Zealand but his name is best known now through the Heaphy Track in the north-west corner of the South Island. He and Brunner were <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Europeans to walk through this area of the South Island and the Heaphy Track, though he never followed its route, is named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{university}} opened, the State Legislature amended Cornell's charter on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees. However that provision {{did not become}} operative until {{there were at least}} 100 alumni in 1872. Cornell {{was one of the first}} Universities to elect trustees by direct election. (Harvard was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to shift to direct election of its Board of Overseers by alumni in 1865.) Cornell's first female trustee was Martha Carey Thomas (class of 1877), who the alumni elected while she was serving as President of Bryn Mawr College.|$|E
5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} {{was not a}} single line, but an entire texture, often of a popular song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus. Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E

5|$|Marshall's {{last years}} were productive. By May 1937, he was {{appointed}} {{as director of the}} Forest Service's Division of Recreation and Lands. Over the next two years, Marshall worked on two major initiatives: an effort to extend national forest recreational opportunities to people with lower incomes (as well as dismantling discriminatory barriers against ethnic minorities), and a program to preserve more wilderness within the national forests. His biographer James Glover asserts that Marshall was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> high-level official to seriously fight ethnic discrimination in Forest Service recreational policies, at a time when racial segregation of public facilities was law throughout the Southern states and in some other states. During this time, Marshall continued to financially support The Wilderness Society, as well as various civil rights, labor, and socialist organizations.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and it was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time anyone had been tested {{for the presence of}} 210Po in their body. The poison was in Litvinenko's cup of tea. Those who had contact with Litvinenko may also have been exposed to radiation.|$|E
5|$|The British {{squadron}} {{spotted the}} Germans at 05:37 (ship's clocks were set four hours ahead of local time – the engagement commenced shortly after dawn), but the Germans were already {{aware of their}} presence, Prinz Eugens hydrophones having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened fire at 05:52 with Hood engaging Prinz Eugen, the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned fire at 05:55, both ships concentrating on Hood. Prinz Eugen was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> ship to score when a shell hit Hoods boat deck, between her funnels, and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Burnham-on-Sea {{is the history}} of the {{reclamation}} of the Somerset Levels from the River Severn and the Bristol Channel. The Romans were the first peoples to try to reclaim the Somerset levels, and it was their people who were <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> settlers in the high sand dunes behind the River Parrett. This could have been in part to maintain navigational systems, to aid ships entering the River Parrett and what is now Highbridge. When the Romans left, the system of drainage they installed was not maintained, and the areas reverted to become a tidal salt flat during the Anglo Saxon period.|$|E
5|$|The {{technical}} investigations Butler {{conducted during}} her tenure resulted in worldwide collaborations and three publications. The {{culmination of the}} research came in 1998 with an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The exhibition was small, {{with a handful of}} paintings and a few manuscript leaves. Only two are definitively attributed to the master, the Annunciation, which came from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and Saint Barbara, loaned from Antwerp. Two Saint Christophers, one in Philadelphia and the other from the Louvre, are considered to be by workshop members. From Cleveland came a John the Baptist in the Landscape, thought to be by van Eyck followers. The Philadelphia and Turin Saint Francis paintings were both on display, reunited for <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time since the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Winsor McCay's The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) was {{a silent}} First World War film. At 12 minutes long, {{it was the}} longest {{animated}} film made at that time. It was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> animated propaganda film to be made; it remains the earliest serious animated drama that has survived. Through World War II, animated propaganda shorts remained influential in American cinema. The Walt Disney Company, working with the American armed forces, produced 400,000 feet of war propaganda films between 1942 and 1945, including Der Fuehrer's Face (1943) and Education for Death (1943).|$|E
