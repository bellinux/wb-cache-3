Later, the Mint sold them through telemarketing. Mintage ceased after the ten different medallions approved by Congress were produced. All were struck at the West Point Bullion Depository. The series sold poorly, prompting critics to blame the involved process by which they were first marketed, {{and the fact that}} they were medallions rather than coins.|$|E
5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost {{per unit of}} energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal <b>price,</b> <b>by</b> minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of {{commercial}} success {{when it was first}} released, the C5 gained an unexpected degree of cult status in the later years. Collectors began purchasing them as investment items, reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price. One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation. He also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax. According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as £2,500 – more than six times the original retail <b>price.</b> <b>By</b> 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to be worth more than £5,000 to collectors.|$|E

5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their <b>price</b> <b>by</b> ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{pervasive}} discrepancy among the pricing schemes of data services, this paper investigates {{the selection of}} pricing metrics (variables) and the corresponding pricing plans. We construct a stylized model in which a monopoly data services seller faces heterogeneous consumers whose utilities depend on the usage and the connection speed. We examine three options for the seller to conduct the second-degree (indirect) <b>price</b> discrimination: <b>by</b> minutes, by giga bytes (Gigs), and by mega bytes per second (Mbps). We show that the after-sales self-selection behaviors {{have a significant impact}} on the seller's profitability, and it leads to a first-order influence on the pricing metric selection. We prove that either <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> Gigs or <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> Mbps can be optimal. <b>Pricing</b> <b>by</b> Gigs can dominate the <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> Mbps even if the consumer's utility is more sensitive in changes in the connection speed. We also find that when incorporating the bandwidth costs or congestion costs, <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> Mbps becomes more attractive as it allows the seller to directly control the congestion effect. These findings may help practitioners to develop their own pricing plans and pricing metrics selection...|$|R

5|$|While {{traditionally}} the Sirens had been depicted as human–animal chimeras, Etty portrayed them as naked young women, {{on an island}} strewn with decaying corpses. The painting divided opinion {{at the time of}} its first exhibition, with some critics greatly admiring it while others derided it as tasteless and unpleasant. Possibly owing to its unusually large size, 442.5cm by 297cm (14ft 6in by 9ft 9in), the work initially failed to sell, and was bought later that year at a bargain <b>price</b> <b>by</b> the Manchester merchant Daniel Grant. Grant died shortly afterwards, and his brother donated The Sirens and Ulysses to the Royal Manchester Institution.|$|E
5|$|Plataea and Mycale {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles that decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. They kept Persia from conquering all of Greece, although they paid a high <b>price</b> <b>by</b> losing many of their men. The Battle of Marathon showed that the Persians could be defeated, and the Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Plataea and Mycale that effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles is nearly as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might, however, be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers; and Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; the Greeks, in fact, sought out battle on both occasions.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In a matched-lot {{controlled}} experiment, eggs <b>priced</b> <b>by</b> {{the pound}} outsold those <b>priced</b> <b>by</b> the dozen. Consumers {{were given the}} choice of buying eggs <b>priced</b> <b>by</b> the dozen or by the pound; the egg lots were displayed {{side by side on}} a shelf. Each dozen carton sold by the pound had a label showing net weight in pounds (to two decimal places), selling price per pound, and total price per dozen. An electronic scale was used for weighing, pricing, and labeling. Eggs were priced at 46 cents a pound, comparable to 25. 5 ounce-per-dozen large eggs selling for 73 cents a dozen. Medium eggs were 68 cents, and small eggs 55 cents a dozen. Results were based on a one-month test (October, 1974) in which 19, 562 dozen cartons of eggs were purchased. The test market was the Main Commissary, a large supermarket, at Fort Riley, Kansas. Sixty-three percent of the consumers buying eggs during the test purchased eggs <b>priced</b> <b>by</b> the pound...|$|R

Research findings indicate that stock return in Tehran Stock Exchange can be clarified by four factors including market excess return, firm size, BE/ME ratio and stock transaction turnover in a relative plausible level (% 40 in average). In the meantime, a significant relationship is observed between market excess share, firm share and stock return. No significant relationship is seen between BE/ME ratio and stock transaction turnover and stock return.
