5|$|Goronwy married Gwerful fil Madog, {{daughter}} of Madog ap Iorwerth, Baron Hendwr. Goronwy and Gwerful had three sons, Hywel ap Goronwy, Tudur ap Goronwy and Gruffydd ap Goronwy. Goronwy was interned {{after his death}} in the west wall of the Franciscan Llanfaes Friary near Bangor, Gwynedd on 11 December 1331. His father had overseen the reconstruction efforts of the friary, and in 1311 {{was the first of the}} family to be <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> following his death. Other members of the family were <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> following death, until some were moved following the Dissolution of the Monasteries under the Church of England imposed by King Henry VIII of England, with Goronwy's being moved to St Gredifael's Church, Penmynydd.|$|E
5|$|Pickett's grave {{is marked}} by a {{memorial}} in Hollywood Cemetery, which was <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> in 1888. A monument to Pickett also stands in the American Camp on San Juan Island, Washington, erected by the Washington University Historical Society on October 21, 1904.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1909 Bogue plan, this part of Lower Queen Anne had been {{considered}} for a civic center. The Civic Auditorium (later the Opera House, now McCaw Hall), the ice arena (later Mercer Arena), and the Civic Field (rebuilt in 1946 as the High School Memorial Stadium), all built in 1927 had been <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> based on that plan, as was an armory (the Food Circus during the fair, later Center House).|$|E

5|$|Clennell {{moved to}} East Anglia {{ten years before}} her death, {{following}} the breakup of her parents' marriage. Clennell had three children with her partner; all had been taken into care and adopted due to her drug addiction. Clennell herself had spent some of her childhood in a referral unit, and it was shortly after being <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> that she started taking drugs.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} combat these {{threats to the}} world order, the United Nations has {{expanded}} its influence around the globe to form the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO). It is headquartered near New York City in a bunker beneath Liberty Island, <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> after a terrorist strike on the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|On {{the outer}} {{wall of the}} transept, {{opposite}} Vicars' Hall, is a second clock face of the same clock, <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> just over seventy years after the interior clock and driven by the same mechanism. The second clock face has two quarter jacks (which strike on the quarter-hour) {{in the form of}} knights in armour.|$|E

5|$|Soldiers of the 5th Massachusetts {{who died}} during their second term of service with the Department of North Carolina are {{buried in the}} New Bern National Cemetery. The 5th Massachusetts is one of 17 Massachusetts regiments listed on the {{monument}} <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1908.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the dimes were released, {{relations}} with the USSR were deteriorating, and Sinnock's initials, JS, were deemed by some to refer to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> by a communist sympathizer. Once these rumors reached Congress, the Mint sent out press releases debunking this myth. Despite the Mint's denial, there were rumors into the 1950s {{that there had been}} a secret deal at the Yalta Conference to honor Stalin on a U.S. coin. The controversy was given fresh life in 1948 with the posthumous release of Sinnock's Franklin half dollar, which bears his initials JRS.|$|E
5|$|Behind the Horseshoe Cloister is the Curfew Tower, one of {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} parts of the Lower Ward and dating from the 13th century. The interior of the tower contains a former dungeon, and the remnants of a sally port, a secret exit for the occupants in a time of siege. The upper storey contains the castle bells <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> in 1478, and the castle clock of 1689. The French-style conical roof is a 19th-century attempt by Anthony Salvin to remodel the tower in the fashion of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc's recreation of Carcassonne.|$|E

5|$|Crimea's coastal highway {{runs through}} the park, {{dividing}} it into {{the upper and lower}} portions. The upper park is dominated by the mountain springs, {{as well as by the}} native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth. A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features three pairs of Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace's southern façade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E
5|$|He {{acted as}} an {{official}} representative for the English Royal Family in the Perfeddwlad territories. Tudur used the English property laws, which he found more advantageous in his position than those used by the Welsh, as they allowed for inheritance of lands by a single party. He continued to hold the lands in North Wales and Cardiganshire which he had inherited. Upon his death in 1311, his holdings passed to his son Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. He had two further sons, Madog and Hywel. Tudur Hen was interned in Bangor Priory on 11 October 1311; his son, Goronwy, was also <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> on 11 December 1331 following his death.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases found in shell middens are broken {{and many of the}} bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains in shell middens in Penobscot Bay reported that sea mink craniums were intact, more so than that of other animals found, implying that they were specifically <b>placed</b> <b>there.</b> Males were more often collected than females.|$|E

5|$|The Chagos Islands are {{a cluster}} of 60 islands and seven atolls in the Indian Ocean. First {{occupied}} by lepers from Mauritius, France acquired the islands in the late 18th century, and slaves were brought in from Africa and India to maintain coconut plantations <b>placed</b> <b>there.</b> Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, the islands were ceded to the British in the Treaty of Paris, who administered them as a dependency of the Colony of Mauritius. Although the slaves were given their freedom in 1835, many remained on the Chagos Islands as contract workers, and their descendants and later immigrants are considered the indigenous people - the Chagossians.|$|E
5|$|The Shrine {{is set in}} a large {{expanse of}} parkland officially called Kings Domain. Over the years many other war {{memorials}} have been built in this area, including the Australian-Hellenic Memorial to Australian and Greek dead in the Battles of Greece and Crete in 1941, and statues of Monash and Blamey. Most of the trees which line the approaches to the Shrine bear plaques commemorating individual Army units, naval vessels or Air Force squadrons, <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> by veterans' groups. An older memorial to Victorians killed in the Second Boer War of 1899–1902 is also located nearby on the corner of St Kilda and Domain Roads.|$|E
5|$|The first {{cross on}} the {{mountain}} was <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> in 1643 by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, {{the founder of the}} city, in fulfilment of a vow he made to the Virgin Mary when praying to her to stop a disastrous flood. Today, the mountain is crowned by a 31.4 m-high (103ft) illuminated cross, installed in 1924 by the John the Baptist Society and now owned by the city. It was converted to fibre optic light in 1992. The new system can turn the lights red, blue, or purple, the last of which is used as a sign of mourning between the death of the Pope and the election of the next.|$|E

5|$|The unrooted {{cladogram}} to {{the right}} shows the relationship between various subgenera and classes {{as defined by the}} analysis of Rivadavia et al. in 2002. The monotypic section Meristocaulis {{was not included in the}} study, so its place in this system is unclear. More recent studies have placed this group near section Bryastrum, so it is <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> below. Also of note, the placement of the section Regiae in relation to Aldrovanda and Dionaea is uncertain. Since the section Drosera is polyphyletic, it shows up multiple times in the cladogram (*).|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{domestic}} decoration, Han artwork {{also served}} an important funerary function. Han artists and craftsmen decorated the wall bricks lining underground tombs {{of the deceased}} with mural paintings and carved reliefs; {{the purpose of this}} artwork was to aid the deceased in traveling through their afterlife journey. Stamping artistic designs into tile and brick was also common. Human figurine sculptures found in Han tombs were <b>placed</b> <b>there</b> to perform various functions for the deceased in the afterlife, such as dancing and playing music for entertainment, as well as serving food. A common type of ceramic figurine found in Han tombs is a female entertainer sporting long, flowing silk sleeves that are flung about while dancing. Some ceramic human figures—both male and female—have been found naked, all with clearly distinguished genitalia and missing arms. This is because they once had wooden or cloth arms which were attached to holes in the shoulders by pegs, as well as miniature clothes made of perishable materials such as silk.|$|E
