25|$|On 4 October Nelson wrote Shaw {{a second}} letter. Nelson had {{received}} a letter from Mr. Langdon alleging that Shaw had issued him certificates for pilot services (payment instructions), and demanded back half the <b>pilotage</b> <b>charge.</b> Nelson asked for an accounting of all such certificates in order to decide whether to open a public inquiry into Shaw's conduct. He also instructed Shaw not to pay for any more pilotage services except in extraordinary circumstances as in Nelson's opinion, Shaw was familiar with all the ports he might visit.|$|E
50|$|The port is a {{compulsory}} pilotage area. Pilotage {{is provided by}} the Great Lakes Pilotage Authority, a Crown corporation of the Government of Canada which includes responsibility for pilotage on the Hudson Bay coast of the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. <b>Pilotage</b> <b>charges</b> between July 20 and October 31 follow a published schedule; outside these dates charges are based on cost recovery.|$|R
50|$|In November 2011, the Tall Ships Youth Trust {{announced}} plans to sell Stavros S Niarchos, its last remaining tall ship, to focus on smaller vessels. Much of {{this is due to}} the high cost of running a vessel of such size due to <b>pilotage</b> <b>charges</b> and mooring fees for a vessel over 400 tonnes. This has become a contentious issue with the trust and its supporters where some see this as the abandonment of the tall ships for yachts within the trust. For others this is a return to the days of Sir Winston Churchill and Malcolm Miller which as smaller vessels didn't incur these charges and had better sailing and penetration and operation within UK sailing ports and waters. Although the schooners were smaller, they ran a much better programme and fulfilled the mandate of the former Sail Training Association, before it became TSYT.|$|R

This paper {{is an extension of}} the research initiated by Grushevska and Notteboom (2015, 2016) where the concepts of intermediacy and centrality are introduced in order to assess the role of Ukraine in the global and regional transport networks. The list of key obstacles for Ukraine’s intermediacy function includes such IWT related barriers as: (i) deficient inland waterway infrastructure, (ii) high IWT costs (fees for bridges, locks etc.) and (iii) <b>pilotage</b> <b>charges.</b> To date the transportation to/from ports is mainly fulfilled by road or by rail-based multimodal transport solutions. We have analysed the unutilized potential of Ukrainian IWT that needs to be efficiently exploited {{for the benefit of the}} national economy and national transport system. This study intends to enrich the limited academic research on IWT systems in a transition stage, as exemplified by the case of Ukraine...|$|R
40|$|This project aims {{to resume}} the {{pilotage}} service, which in principle was the responsibility of Port Authority of Guayaquil (PAG), which was responsible for its administration. Currently the <b>pilotage</b> service is <b>charge</b> of private companies, which provide for the Port Authority of Guayaquil who decided it was more efficient if the service was provided by these companies. Among them include: Ecuadorian PILOT, SERNAPRA, PACIFIC PILOT, CISENI. Our project is focused on known as the Port Authority of Guayaquil can resume pilotage service, {{and what would be}} the socio-economic impact that this project would be carried out. The pilotage service is being offered to all ships entering the Simon Bolivar Port of Guayaquil and other private terminals. This service is the main tool for people called “PRACTICAL”, which are solely responsible for the vessels to enter the various docks. The main role of PAG as a state is “to serve”, for this reason Port Authority of Guayaquil should return to this pilotage service, once the grant or when you consider that you can provide this service efficiently...|$|R
