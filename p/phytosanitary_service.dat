40|$|Notwithstanding nematology is {{a rather}} new science, in Italy the first {{observations}} and publications on nematodes date back to several centuries ago and are from physicians and botanists. Among them are U. Aldrovandi (1522 - 1605), {{who was the first}} in the word to observe nematodes in insects, and F.

However, the first observations on plant parasitic nematodes were made from the second half of 1800 to early 1900. They refer to Anguina tritici in wheat kernels (1867), Meloidogyne spp. (1875 - 1904) on several host plants, Ditylenchus dipsaci (1897) in oats. The sugar beet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, was reported in 1931 and the citrus nematode, Tylenchulus semipenetrans, in 1940.

40|$|Zambia is a {{landlocked}} {{developing country}} in southern Africa. It is an importer and exporter {{of plants and}} plant products. These are potential pathways for introducing exotic plant pests that may affect agricultural production and/or limit access to international export markets. In this regard, the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) of Zambia is responsible for formulating phytosanitary regulations to ensure risks of introducing exotic plant pests are minimized. For this, the application of Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) is a vital component of any <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>service.</b> PRAs can be data demanding, time consuming and complex. As a consequence, a simplified procedure that aligns Zambia’s national phytosanitary capacity and resources has been developed.

However, {{there has not been}} a formal scientific report confirming its presence by two independent methods, nor has there been an update on the spread of the disease to other parts of the country. Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) trees in Los Chiles showing zinc deficiency, vein yellowing, blotchy mottle, and corky veins resembling HLB disease were sampled. Genomic DNA was extracted from leaf midrib and petiole, and Asian citrus psyllid (Diphorina citri) samples using DNeasy Plant, and Blood and Tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR; TaqMan probes) assays (Li et al. 2006) detected the presence of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ in 30 symptomatic tree samples. The intergenic region between rplA and rplJ of the β-operon (Hocquellet et al. 1999) was amplified from eight plant and two psyllid samples containing five insects each, and was directly sequenced (Macrogen, Korea) to corroborate the presence of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’. All sequences obtained from plants and D. citri shared 100 % identity with each other, and a BLAST search showed a 99 % identity to different sequences of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ available in GenBank, e. g., some from India (KC 477384). Although D. citri is present in the country (Villalobos et al. 2005), the disease has not been detected in other growing areas. Three hundred seventeen trees and 32 psyllid samples were tested as described above for the presence of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ by qPCR in July through September 2013, and April through May 2014. Sampled trees were grown in the San Jose, Alajuela, and Puntarenas provinces, and showed chlorosis-like zinc deficiency. None of the samples tested positive for ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’. Ct values were above 36 or undetected, while internal control (COX) values ranged from 17 to 23. Considering that Costa Rica is a small country, the containment or the failure to detect ‘Ca.

This phenomenon can be due to the SFE’s and the private sector’s quarantine and containment plans (Arredondo-Bernal et al. 2013); however, there may be other factors that are containing the disease that have not been studied. © 2015 The American Phytopathological Society...|$|E
40|$|International {{trade of}} plants and plant {{products}} {{is one of the}} major vectors for the introduction and spread of exotic pests of plants. Some of these pests may affect agricultural production and/or limit access to international export markets. Phytosanitary inspections {{of plants and}} plant products at border ports are an important phytosanitary measure to ensure compliance with importing countries’ requirements. Measures are formulated by undertaking Pest Risk Analysis (PRA). In many developing countries however, the undertaking of PRAs is affected by limited national phytosanitary capacity and resources. This thesis provides insights that may facilitate more effective phytosanitary regulation, particularly the undertaking of PRAs where limited data and expertise are available for this purpose. The Plant Quarantine and <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>Service</b> (PQPS), the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) of Zambia is a case in point. In light of the above, a simplified PRA procedure was developed, one that is internationally acceptable and easily applied day-to-day with the resources available in a developing country like Zambia. The developed procedure focused on Pest Risk Assessment, the second stage of a PRA as guided by international standards. This stage is key to formulating phytosanitary measures. The procedure is entirely qualitative and relates to particular risk elements. The risk elements used in the simplified procedure were identified for inclusion after a detailed review of PRAs conducted by NPPOs of various developed countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the USA as well as one of the Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RPPO), the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO). The review evaluated the different steps of stage two of these PRAs, specifically, entry, establishment, spread and consequences of the pest(s). Selection of risk elements for inclusion in the procedure was based on their consistent usage in the PRAs reviewed. The procedure was developed to be easy to apply and being user-friendly, with straightforward questions requiring a yes or no response. The procedure developed in this study avoids the burden of misinterpretation of levels of risk through ratings or scoring. As such, the procedure has the potential to be applied by the NPPOs of other developing countries, including Zambia’s PQPS. The procedure can provide PQPS with science-based PRAs to support the application of phytosanitary measures on imported plants and plant products. Use of the procedure was then tested, using Zambia’s import of South African maize (Zea mays) seed for sowing in a comparative study. However, having a suitable PRA procedure is one thing but ensuring there is the capacity to apply it routinely is another. Additional effort was therefore made to identify the essential PRA process components necessary for a NPPO to have an internationally acceptable PRA system. Essential components of a PRA system were determined through the aforementioned comprehensive review of publicly available PRAs as well as NPPOs and RPPOs documented procedures. The essential components included: •	Presence of a PRA unit; •	Collaboration with specialists from all relevant plant health fields, whether in the NPPO or outside; •	Access to published sources of PRA relevant information and the availability of up-to-date data sets; •	Objective, if not independent technical peer review of each PRA; and •	Risk communication and consultation with stakeholders, including potential trading partners(s). As the case in point, the phytosanitary capacity of Zambia’s NPPO, the PQPS was examined in relation to its PRA system. Two questionnaires were designed specifically for this purpose. The questionnaires provided the means to survey PQPS staff to obtain information on: •	Phytosanitary activities at border ports; •	International trade patterns; •	The current PRA process; •	The availability of PRA experts; •	PQPS staffing; •	Availability of and access to sources of information relevant to PRAs; and •	Laboratory and inspection facilities. The questionnaires were applied between November 2011 and June 2012 at the PQPS head office in Lusaka and Zambia’s border ports. Border ports were Katima Mulilo, Chirundu, Copperbelt, Mwami, Nakonde, Victoria Falls and the main airport, the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA). Survey results showed that Zambia’s phytosanitary capacity is challenged in relation to PRA processes. The Zambian NPPO does not have staff specifically tasked with conducting PRAs and a PRA unit is not established in its structure. At the time of the survey, PQPS had a staff comprising 26 Plant Health Inspectors (PHIs). Presently, PHIs located at the border ports conduct ad hoc analyses of the risks associated with imported plants and plant products at the same time they complete phytosanitary inspections. In summary, there was little doubt that Zambia’s PRA process needs to be improved. The phytosanitary capacity of its NPPO is lacking and ideally will require significant injection of funds in the long term. In the absence of additional funding, however, improvements could still be made to its PRA process. The effectiveness of Zambia’s phytosanitary regulatory system will depend on its capacity to undertake PRAs. It is recommended that the effectiveness of Zambia’s system could be improved by: (i) restructuring PQPS so as to utilise some of its in-house tertiary qualified personnel located centrally in Head Office to focus on PRAs; (ii) applying routinely the newly developed PRA procedure at Head Office to develop scientifically justified measures to imports of plants and plant products; (iii) utilising the expertise of other centrally located plant health specialists in the PRA process; (iv) clarifying the inspection roles of PQPS border staff; and (v) establishing clearer communication channels with PHIs located at the border ports thereby enabling them to respond consistently to Head Office directives relating to phytosanitary measures required for imported plants and plant products...|$|E

Volta 2 project has used innovation platforms as its principal development tool to achieve integrated management of rainwater for crop-livestock agroecosystems in 2 West African countries (Burkina Faso and Ghana). The aim of our study is {{to assess the impact}} of structure of innovation platform members, their conduct, and the consequence on the improvement of performance of crop and livestock production in four focal villages of Yatenga province, northern Burkina Faso (Ziga, Koura Bagre, Pogoro Silmimosse and Bogoya). The study was conducted from April to September 2013 with 2 months of field surveys between mid-May and mid-July 2013 in the four villages. This study was conducted through one approach borrowed from socio-economic theory: the model of “Structure – Conduct – Performance (SCP) ”. The improvement in crop and livestock production was measured by asking farmers for their perception of this improvement. For data collection, focus group discussions and individual surveys with different stakeholders were used. Data analysis was carried through SPSS software, firstly for factor analysis to identify the dominant constructs of what makes innovation platform successful. And then, for regression analysis to determine the relationships between structure of innovation platform, the conduct of its members and whether they are achieving the objectives they set themselves in terms of improvement of crop and livestock production. Qualitative data was also interpreted to complete and interpret the results obtained through the analysis of quantitative data. Our study shows a positive impact of innovation platform, set up by Volta 2 project, on IP member’s practices in Yatenga province. Innovation platform have contributed to the change of mentalities and conduct of its members in their activities. Indeed, through IP, its members have benefited from different support in their activities that have contributed to their capacity development, mainly by the reinforcement of their human and social capacity. The human capacity was improved through different trainings and advice received by IP members from different facilitators of innovation platform, such as training in animal and crop production, training in access to market, training in management of rainwater for crop and livestock production, etc. The social capacity of IP members was improved through new contacts and new partners that IP members have got in their activities. Indeed, through innovation platform, IP members of one village have entered in contact with IP members of other villages. Innovation platform have contributed to closer working relationships among IP members within the same village and to villagers gaining easier access to some organisations such as micro-credit organisations, animal husbandry and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>services</b> of agricultural ministry, etc., which can help them to improve their activities. This improvement of human and social capacity of IP members has resulted in the improvement of crop and livestock production through a better exchange of information and knowledge between different stakeholders and a better access to different support services. Thus, our study shows a positive impact of innovation platform set up by Volta 2 project for improvement of crop and livestock production in Yatenga province. These findings justify the necessity to support this kind of project in the perspective of reinforcing food security and reducing poverty in rural areas around the world...|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} problem Cue: Mr. Martin Shu is {{a commercial}} farmer in Cameroon. He grows {{a variety of}} crops, including maize and yams. He is also keen on organic agriculture, and gets organic manure from his poultry flock. But obtaining enough manure for a large maize crop is a major problem, as Martha Chindong found out when she visited his farm, close {{to the town of}} Bamenda. Martha also spoke to Mr. Michael Mboh, an expert in biological crop protection, to find out how organic crops were competing in the local marketplace. But her report begins with Mr. Shu, who explains the system of organic farming he has adopted. IN:		?I have been cultivating this ? OUT:		?grown from organic matters. ? DUR?N	 5 ? 01 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Martha Chindong finding out the difficulties and the potential of commercial organic production in Cameroon. Transcript Shu	I have been cultivating this piece of land for more than six years, and in this farm I do crop rotation. And to succeed in this crop rotation I do sole cropping, I don?t inter-crop, I don?t mix. So when I want to shift this one to this place, another one comes there. That is the method that I am using in my farm. Chindong	Is that the reason why the crops are looking green and fresh? Shu	That is one of the reasons, and another one is, I have been using poultry manure in the farm, which you know is very rich, even richer than fertilizer. And also the green grass which grows in the farm after harvest, I actually bury in furrows where it decays, and the next season it is already manure, in addition to the poultry manure. That?s why you find these crops growing very fresh and green like that. Chindong	What are some of the difficulties you encounter with this organic method of farming? Shu	Well the problem is, you know, when you want to farm in a very large quantity, I also find it difficult to have enough manure since my poultry is not too large. So those are my problems. Should I have a large poultry I can also farm a large farm. And that is why I have decided to use fertilizer in some of the areas, just because I want to farm more but I am having less manure. Chindong	If I get you well, it means a farmer cannot really go commercial using an organic method of farming? Shu	Actually, if you want to farm five hectares of maize, and you want to use only organic manure, I don?t think you will succeed to have enough manure so that the crops will do well. That is what makes a commercial farmer like me still to involve myself with fertilizer. Whereas if I was not a big commercial farmer, I would not be using fertilizer. Chindong	Do you think there is a way that this organic method of farming can be encouraged? Shu	Yes there should be a way, because in fact those who are there to support farmers, when they get from us that there is a problem, that we cannot get a lot of this organic manure, they can start thinking of a way to support us get it. Like the national extension saw our farm, so green, that we farm with manure and so on, and our problem was the building of a storage house. They decided to build one for us, which we have for storing our yams, and to sell when the market is there. And surely when we sell when the market is there, and we have more money, we can also be able to buy more feed for the animals {{and so on and so}} forth. Chindong	Yes, we are meeting the staff of the <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>Services</b> in the North West province, in the name of Mr. Mboh Michael. Mr. Mboh, do you encourage farmers to go organic? Mboh	Yes we do. We have been working day and night, to see that the farmers abandon the use of these synthetic pesticides. So we are now talking about natural plant protection, by use of local herbs to treat plant diseases. I think that is one way of encouraging them to go organic? Chindong	Crop rotation: can it also help as a way to control pests and diseases? Mboh	I think yes, like let?s say, yam beetle; he said that he is growing yams. If the yams were affected by yam beetle, when they rotate, the maize that is coming to take over from the yams cannot be attacked by the beetles. So the next rotation, the beetles are not going to be found where maize was grown. Chindong	Let me ask you this practical question. Do you think crops grown biologically, or using this organic method, can really compete in this liberalised market? Mboh	To me, it can compete, it?s just that we lack the will. If we could distinguish what is produced by use of chemicals, and what is produced by just organic matter, you see that there is a difference. Like talking in the case of where crops have been treated with toxic chemicals, if you could identify such crops on the market, and if you were already affected by crops that had been grown with toxic chemicals, and when you go to the hospital and you want to know how much it will take to cure yourself, that way you can evaluate the cost. Chindong	Do they do this thing of certification of organic products here in Cameroon? If not, how do farmers know that these crops are grown with chemical fertilizers, and these ones grown naturally? Mboh	Well for now I think there is nothing, to my knowledge, we are not yet doing it. But I think there is something in place; we are already talking about seed certification, that is seed material to be planted. They are setting up units that are doing certification at provincial level. so I think very soon it will be possible to talk about certification of crops that have been grown from organic matters. End of track. A commercial farmer from Cameroon discusses the difficulty of large-scale organic production, and a plant health specialist comments on crop rotation and organic market development...|$|R
40|$|Existing plant {{protection}} regulations in the Caribbean {{are not only}} outdated but suffer {{from a lack of}} technical backup. That explains why over the last 25 years these islands have been menaced by many pests that have been introduced from other countries. Pillaging pirates and other outlaws have come back to threaten many countries in the Caribbean. They sneak in by boat or plane, evade customs officials, break into warehouses and rampage through their new found bounty before wreaking havoc with the lives of ordinary people throughout the islands. These modern day plunderers brandish no swords but, seen from close up, are no less menacing with their armour and built-in weapons. They are, in fact, insects, bacteria and diseases that despoil crops and harvests by attacking them on all fronts. To combat such pests, most countries have developed laws and implemented them with more or less effective regulations. It is in this area, however, that many Caribbean countries have fallen behind to the advantage of all sorts of persistent pests. It is not uncommon to see {{plant protection}} laws passed over a century ago still on the books. While they may include relatively complete regulations enabling the control of imported vegetation by various sanitation measures, including the destruction of infected shipments, for many islands this is no longer sufficient. Unfortunately, there acoears to be little initiative to update such laws. This leaves those responsible for their implementation a difficult task for which they are, at best, ill-prepared. In some cases, the lack of personnel and technical support means that only a token effort can be made to deal with the problem. The result in many countries is that plant protection measures boil down to a simple bureaucratic procedure: issuing certificates that simply delay exports. Grenada {{is a good example of}} the state of plant protection controls in the Caribbean. A law passed in 1891 gives authority to local officials to prohibit or restrict the import of plant material and to order any treatment judged necessary, but it has never been updated. If the situation is not this bad on all the islands, there are various loopholes through which many pests have passed on their way to establishing themselves as local problems. In recent years, some organizations (notably the Caribbean Plant Protection Commission - CPPC - of the FAO and the Regional Programme for Vegetation Protection of the Inter- American Institute for Agricultural Cooperation - IIAC) have made considerable efforts in this direction. Meetings and seminars at both the national and regional level have been organized in close cooperation with agricultural departments of different countries in order to promote better plant protection controls. Direct technical support has also been given to help update and enforce regulations. As a result of an IIAC study on phytosanitation measures in various Caribbean countries, a certain number of common problems have been identified: insufficent records, inexperienced personnel, outdated legislation, and a general lack of both material and staff. Some of these obstacles are now being overcome thanks to the various programmes noted above, but much remains to be done To deal effectively with this problem, one must first of all know how the pests in question arrive. Most of them are brought in on vegetable matter, notably live plants, fruit and grains. Studies in the Caribbean have identified three major vectors. The first is the use of exotic HYV seeds, seedlings, cuttings or tubers. The second is the importation of staple foods needed to complement the country's food supply deficit. Finally, there is the exchange of agricultural products within the region. Whether in the form of vegetable matter or another agricultural product, processed or not, all of these vectors run the risk of introducing serious plant diseases or infestations. Experience in some ACP countries has shown that, if properly applied, plant protection measures that are constantly revised to keep up with modern transmission patterns can reduce such risks. National measures, however, will never be enough to deal with these 'pests without borders'. We now know that effective international control measures must do more than try to keep pests out of uninfected countries. Attention must also be given to reducing the export of such problems. As with human health, sanitary measures must be taken on both sides: by protecting others, one protects oneself and by exporting only uninfected products, one reduces the likelihood of importing infected products in the future. This principle is particularly valid in the Caribbean where there is a constant flow of products between the islands. The lesson has been well learned in the Barbados, St. Vincent and Antigua. Unlike their neighbours, these countries have not suffered from an infestation of Anastrepha on fruit. In order for them to keep this pest out, they must ensure that control measures be taken beyond their borders. Their best allies are thus the inspection services of exporting countries which must be able to ensure that only uninfected products are shipped. Even in regions where such controls are adequate and applied effectively by all countries concerned, new pests have still been introduced. As recent studies have confirmed, the loopholes and poor enforcement of regulations are not the only cause for the failure of plant protection measures. Of the world's 350 or so major agricultural pests listed by the Commonwealth Institute of Entomology, more than 60 % have been introduced. This has led to the 'inevitability theory' which holds that 'all pests will eventually get to all parts of the world because phytosanitary controls can only retard their spread'. Unfortunately, some specialists are beginning to agree. For evidence, they cite the recent introduction of a citrus scab in Florida, a mango seed beetle in Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Lucia, and the slow but steady spread northward of the African killer bee despite draconian protection measures. A recently discovered element also supports this thesis: it seems that natural vectors, such as winds, storms and ocean currents, also spread diseases and insects. Hurrican Allen, for example, is blamed for having introduced thrips (Fulmekiola serrate) into the Caribbean. Previously unknown in the region, it had disastrous effects on sugarcane plantations in Guadeloupe and the Barbados before moving on to Guyana and Trinidad. Another problem in Guyana's plantations is a smut disease whose spores appear to be carried by the wind over the Atlantic from West Africa. In this case, no number of laws or inspections would be effective. Even if after all precautionary measures have been taken some pests still manage to reach another country, the battle is far from over. One can still fight a rearguard action to stop them from spreading. It is at this point that good technical support can play a pivotal role. Unfortunately, few <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>services</b> in the Caribbean have access to such facilities. This shortcoming was primarily responsible for the spread of moko disease among bananas. Introduced to Grenada earlier this decade, it has resulted in over 2 million dollars worth of losses and poses enormous risks to the banana industry in the region. As the closest country, St. Vincent is at the greatest risk due to the fact that the Grenadine archipelago acts as a land bridge between the two larger islands. The lack of a good plant protection service was also responsible for the 1965 invasion of a sugarcane beetle (Diatraea centella) on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas. It was introduced by sugarcane seeds brought in from Guyana. An effective protection service could at least have avoided its spread once it was introduced. If it is easy to evaluate the losses caused by such pests, it is much harder to predict the economic impact of identified threats and thus to gauge the investment warranted to prevent their spread. The cruciferae moth (Plutella xylostella). for example, was discovered for the first time in Trinidad in 1945 but it caused little damage until 25 years later. The cherry beetle was first observed in coffee plantations in 1978 in Jamaica, but has not been noticed anywhere else. On the other hand, sugarcane smut and rust, identified in 1974 and 1978 respectively, spread like wildfire through all Caribbean sugarcane plantations as well as those in Central and South America. The best protection against such pests remains prevention. First of r all, every effort must be made to : stop them from leaving or entering countries. Once introduced, eradication and treatment measures are both complicated and very costly. It took no less than 27 months and 176 million dollars to control the 1980 Mediterranean fruitfly epidemic in California. It is thus easy to understand why the Barbados banned the import of mangoes from St. Lucia when mango seed beetles were discovered there in 1984. Many measures are now needed to improve plant protection in the Caribbean. The first seems to be better information. Whether designed to evaluate the risks of spreading pests through internal circulation or international commerce, studies of transmission methods will be very useful. Unfortunately, even basic data such as lists of existing pests in these countries is not always available. In addition to studies on the risks and modes of infestations, analyses of the economic impact of introduced pests are needed. Finally, it must be remembered that phytosanitary control personnel can only help to ensure the food security of their countries if they are given the necessary training and technical support.
