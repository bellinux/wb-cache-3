The Thracian <b>Plain</b> is roughly triangular, beginning southeast of Sofia and broadening as it reaches the Black Sea coast.|$|E
25|$|Intermediate <b>plains</b> {{material}} is less abundant than the intercrater <b>plains</b> unit {{and has a}} density of superposed small craters that is intermediate between those of the intercrater <b>plains</b> and smooth <b>plains</b> units. The intermediate <b>plains</b> {{material is}} most readily mapped on the floors of those c1, c2, and c3 craters and basins that are surrounded by intercrater <b>plains</b> material with a distinctly higher crater density (FDS 27428). Contacts between intercrater <b>plains</b> and intermediate <b>plains</b> units that occur outside mapped craters and basins are gradational and uncertain. In parts of the quadrangle, photographic resolution and lighting do not permit the intermediate <b>plains</b> unit {{to be separated from}} the intercrater <b>plains</b> or smooth <b>plains</b> units {{with a high level of}} confidence.|$|R

The Molonglo then flows into the Murrumbidgee north-west of Canberra, which in turn flows north-west toward the New South Wales town of Yass. The Queanbeyan River joins the Molonglo River at Oaks Estate just within the ACT.|$|E

5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points.

Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal <b>plain.</b> This <b>plain,</b> south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal <b>Plain.</b> Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E

2500|$|The {{intermediate}} <b>plains</b> {{material and}} smooth <b>plains</b> material probably also consist of mixtures of relatively fine crater ejecta and volcanic materials {{that appear to}} form a continuous sequence. Both units are thicker than the intercrater <b>plains</b> unit. The intermediate <b>plains</b> material is widespread in intercrater areas in the west half of the quadrangle and fills floors of older craters and basins in the southern part. Smooth <b>plains</b> material, the youngest <b>plains</b> unit, occurs as scattered patches in low areas and covers the floors of many craters of c4 age and older. In some crater floors, especially smaller ones, differentiation between smooth <b>plains</b> and intermediate <b>plains</b> materials is difficult and the choice becomes arbitrary.|$|R
25|$|Patches of less cratered, smoother, less rolling <b>plains</b> occur {{throughout}} the quadrangle, but their recognition is {{highly dependent on}} the resolution and lighting of individual Mariner 10 frames. Therefore, because their distribution cannot now be mapped accurately, many of these patches are included with the smooth <b>plains</b> material. Certain patches of these intermediate <b>plains,</b> where clearly rougher and possibly older, are mapped as the intermediate <b>plains</b> material. These patches occur mostly within the floors of ancient craters and are distinguished by a slightly greater density of small craters and a lower incidence of small bright-halo craters than are found on the smooth <b>plains</b> material. The presence of <b>plains</b> intermediate in roughness and crater density between the oldest <b>plains</b> and the post-Caloris <b>plains</b> suggests that <b>plains</b> formation was {{a more or less}} continuous process that spanned much of the early geologic history of Mercury.|$|R

2500|$|The smooth <b>plains</b> {{material}} forms essentially level tracts, flooring depressions in the mercurian surface.
