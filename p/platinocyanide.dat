50|$|A <b>platinocyanide</b> is a salt {{containing}} the anion Pt(CN)42−. Barium <b>platinocyanide,</b> BaPt(CN)4, {{was important in}} the discovery of X-rays, and {{in the development of}} the fluoroscope. One <b>platinocyanide</b> salt with interesting conductive properties is Krogmann's salt, used in cathode ray tube televisions as the fluorescent material.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 8 November 1895, Röntgen was determined to test his idea. He carefully constructed a black cardboard covering {{similar to the one}} he had used on the Lenard tube. He covered the Crookes-Hittorf tube with the cardboard and attached electrodes to a Ruhmkorff coil to generate an electrostatic charge. Before setting up the barium <b>platinocyanide</b> screen to test his idea, Röntgen darkened the room to test the opacity of his cardboard cover. As he passed the Ruhmkorff coil charge through the tube, he determined that the cover was light-tight and turned to prepare the next step of the experiment. It was at this point that Röntgen noticed a faint shimmering from a bench {{a few feet away from}} the tube. To be sure, he tried several more discharges and saw the same shimmering each time. Striking a match, he discovered the shimmering had come from the location of the barium <b>platinocyanide</b> screen he had been intending to use next.|$|E
5000|$|Following Röntgen's work on X-rays in 1895, Clarence and {{his brother}} Charles worked on the {{development}} of the Edison X-ray focus tube, developing the fluoroscope using calcium tungstate. The Edison fluoroscope produced sharper images than the Röntgen fluoroscope, which used barium <b>platinocyanide.</b> At the time, the levels of X-rays produced were not believed to be dangerous. However, Edison noted how [...] "the x-ray had affected poisonously my assistant, Mr. Dally." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{one point}} {{while he was}} {{investigating}} the ability of various materials to stop the rays, Röntgen brought {{a small piece of}} lead into position while a discharge was occurring. Röntgen thus saw the first radiographic image, his own flickering ghostly skeleton on the barium <b>platinocyanide</b> screen. He later reported that it was at this point that he determined to continue his experiments in secrecy, because he feared for his professional reputation if his observations were in error.|$|E
50|$|The use of Sidot's blende (zinc sulfide) {{instead of}} barium <b>platinocyanide</b> as a {{luminescence}} material {{to make the}} radioactive rays visible was a commonly accepted improvement. He did several self-experiments with radioactive substances {{and was able to}} affirm the damaging effects of radioactive radiation on skin. Because of prolonged contact with radioactive material, fingers of his right hand had to be amputated and he suffered from lung cancer. He died of lung cancer in 1927. His name was included on the Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations erected in Hamburg, Germany in 1936.|$|E
50|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, {{but this is}} a likely reconstruction by his biographers: Röntgen was investigating cathode rays using a fluorescent screen painted with barium <b>platinocyanide</b> and a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard to shield its fluorescent glow. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 metre away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow: they were passing through an opaque object to affect the film behind it.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 July 1896, Reynolds and Branson {{attended}} the Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom at Leeds. The firm was represented in various sessions. During the session on Orthochromatic Photography, Branson gave a presentation on X-ray apparatus {{that included a}} well received demonstration and repeated as follows:"... Mr. Branson, of Messrs. Reynolds and Branson, who had made a special study of X ray work, gave a demonstration which for lucidity and completeness has rarely been equalled. In {{the course of his}} remarks he fully explained the construction and exhaustion of the tubes, and showed various forms and explained his method of making calcium tungstate, which was to mix solutions of sodium tungstate and calcium chloride, collect, wash, and dry the precipitate of calcium tungstate which was formed, and then to fuse this in a small muffle furnace at the temperature of the melting point of cast-iron, and reduce to small crystals in a mortar, mix with varnish, and coat a screen. With such a screen in contact with the plate {{he had been able to}} show osseous structure of the hand, measuring only one-hundredth of an inch, with an exposure of one minute. A comparison of the fluorescent appearance of the three salts, calcium tungstate, <b>platinocyanide</b> of barium, and <b>platinocyanide</b> of potassium, was shown, the first and last being the best for photographic work, as the fluorescence was blue, and the barium salt was most satisfactory for visual work, as the fluorescence was yellow." ...|$|E

50|$|During 1895 Röntgen was {{investigating}} the external {{effects from the}} various types of vacuum tube equipment — apparatuses from Heinrich Hertz, Johann Hittorf, William Crookes, Nikola Tesla and Philipp von Lenard — when an electrical discharge is passed through them. In early November, he was repeating an experiment with one of Lenard's tubes in which a thin aluminium window had been added to permit the cathode rays to exit the tube but a cardboard covering was added to protect the aluminium from damage by the strong electrostatic field that produces the cathode rays. He knew the cardboard covering prevented light from escaping, yet Röntgen observed that the invisible cathode rays caused a fluorescent effect on a small cardboard screen painted with barium <b>platinocyanide</b> when it was placed close to the aluminium window. It occurred to Röntgen that the Crookes-Hittorf tube, which had a much thicker glass wall than the Lenard tube, might also cause this fluorescent effect.|$|E

40|$|In early November 1895 Willem Röntgen {{performed}} {{an experiment in}} which invisible cathode rays, generated by electrostatic discharges from within an evacuated glass tube, caused a cardboard screen painted with barium <b>platinocyanide</b> to fluoresce.

His groundbreaking article 2 was published less than 2 months later on 28 December 1895...|$|E
