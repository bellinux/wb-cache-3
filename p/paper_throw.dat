40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} innovation, the innovation process and its associated coordination problems in the subjectivist perspective. It argues that innovation, when viewed {{in the first person}} perspective, is not a homogeneous concept. Instead, the degree of newness of an innovation is determined subjectively by adopters. The stages of the innovation process described in the management literature are re-interpreted in light of Schutz' phenomenology. Innovation creates coordination problems. Schumpeterian innovation disrupts plans of market participants and threatens people's sense of reality. The stocks of knowledge of market participants are no longer able to solve new problems brought about by pioneering entrepreneurs. Knowledge taken for granted becomes problematic. As a result, coordination fails. In attempting to remove uncertainty arising from radical innovation, human agents create knowledge surrogates and project acts in the future perfect tense. Through a process of typification, successful actions are crystallised into firm routines and institutions that once again help to serve for coordination. The arguments developed in this <b>paper</b> <b>throw</b> new light on three aspects of business strategies, namely, management of innovation, vertical integration and advertising. Innovation, Coordination, Phenomenology, Entrepreneurship, Subjectivist Interpretation,...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Technology) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1988 Brown Davis and McCorquodale {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{suppliers}} of cheques to the banking industry. To produce these cheques they use a number of different print systems, one of which comprises of a minicomputer, an industry standard tape deck and two printers, a Diablo daisywheel and a Control Data Corporation (CDC) printer which was extensively modified to cater for the requirements of the cheque printing industry. The CDC printer is used to print the code line on the cheques using magnetic ink. After each line is printed the computer sends a form feed command which causes the printer to throw paper. This throw is controlled by a paper tape, known as a Vertical Format Unit tape, or rather a VFU tape. This tape has holes punched into it at specific places which determine the amount of <b>paper</b> <b>throw</b> also known as vertical feed. The holes are sensed by brushes which are pulled up to 5 volt when they pass over a hole and touch a roller connected to the 5 volt line. This system, being of an electro-mechanical nature, is prone to faults and causes much down time due to mechanical wear on the brushes and dirt on the roller. This means that the brushes have to be adjusted and therefore also means that the timing has to be readjusted each time. The timing relationships are discussed in Section 2. ...|$|E

Several things {{can be learned from}} the sedimentation diagrams of dilute protein solutions photographed in this way [...] (l) the rate of sedimentation of any heavy molecules that may be present, (2) the homogeneity, or uniformity with respect to size and shape, of these molecules or particles, and (3) the purity of the solution. The results of the present <b>paper</b> <b>throw</b> light upon each of these points {{but it is clear that}} many of these bacteriophage solutions have a complexity that can only be resolved by much more detailed investigation. The instrument used in these experiments was a development of the air-driven machine already described (3). The ultraviolet light, of wave lengths between 2700 A and 2300 A, was that of a high pressure mercury arc passed through the usual chlorine and bromine filters. In all experiments the photography, which was carried out automatically (4), was such that the interval between pictures was exactly 5 minutes and the exposure 1 ~ seconds. Preparations of concentrated staphylococcus bacteriophage have unusually strong absorption in the ultraviolet region [...] for a 2 ram. thick cell the optimum concentration has been ca. 0. 3 mg. per cc.

40|$|Collaboration {{is often}} put forward as a {{programmatic}} ideal, or invoked {{as an antidote}} to conventional research methods in the humanities and social sciences. Collaboration also increasingly features in the lexicon of ‘innovation’, ‘interdisciplinarity’, ‘partnership’, ‘engagement’ and ‘impact’ that accompanies the restructuring of Higher Education as well as the production, circulation and consumption of knowledge. But despite this turn to ‘collaboration’ and the set of tensions it generates, there has been comparatively little sustained attention to the actual practices of doing collaborative research. In this Working Paper, researchers from the CRESC Encounters Collaborative reflect on their experiences of collaborative research, offering a series of case studies that describe research with actors ranging from City Councils to a feminist community allotment, from Eurostat to intra-academic projects. Through these case studies we unpack the research process in ways that serve to disrupt conventional representations of research as a linear, sequential activity resulting in a set of knowable outputs. Rather we find that collaborative research often requires that the definition of research problems, methods or outputs be left open or remain undetermined, whilst at the same time posing questions about the authorship and ownership of knowledge production that are often otherwise foreclosed in conventional research. Furthermore, via an analysis of our research encounters, we find that the relationships that underpin collaborative research are often sustained through the production and exchange of particular kinds of ‘gifts’, which may be missed in contemporary regimes of ‘impact’. In these ways, the accounts presented in this <b>Paper</b> <b>throw</b> into relief the artefactual character of representations of research that as academics we are often incited to construct. Yet, by paying attention to the mundane and opportunistic ways in which collaborative research often proceeds (or fails to proceed), the case studies also serve to complicate a reified opposition between conventional and collaborative research. Rather, we find that the distinctiveness of collaboration lies less in a deviation from some kind of imagined, non-collaborative research process, than in the way it forces a reflexive acknowledgment of the emergent quality of knowledge in research relationships across time and space...|$|E
