500|$|In 1932 Texaco {{introduced}} its [...] "Fire Chief" [...] gasoline to the public, {{so named because}} its octane rating was 66, higher than the United States government's requirements for fire engines. To advertise its new <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>fuel,</b> Texaco approached vaudeville comic Ed Wynn to star in a radio show titled Fire Chief. Wynn played the fire chief {{in front of an}} audience of 700 and the show was aired live over the NBC Red Network, beginning April 24, 1932.

50|$|Rather {{than being}} {{directly}} {{based on the}} now larger Accord, the new Ascot was given its own platform, with the codenames CE4/5, which was a platform improvement of the previous generation. Like the Inspire, Vigor and the even larger Honda Legend, the CE Ascot had its engines mounted longitudinally, contrary to the Accord and most other FWD cars, employing the transverse setup, thereby placing {{the weight of the}} engine aligned and behind the front axle and improving vehicle weight distribution between the front and rear axles. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On October 12, 1989, the Honda Accord Inspire was introduced. The {{platform}} {{was shared}} with the Honda Vigor, a JDM Honda Accord derived five-cylinder luxury sedan available only at Honda Verno dealerships. The Inspire was introduced before the recession developed in Japan in the early 1990s (known in Japan as the [...] "bubble economy"), and Honda wanted a car that would compete with the Toyota Cresta and Nissan Laurel, with the unique inline 5-cylinder Honda G engine, in a front-wheel-drive configuration. This 5-cylinder engine was also used in the JDM Honda Rafaga, which was a shorter sedan {{shared with the}} second generation Honda Ascot.

5000|$|The Honda Rafaga series CE4 and CE5 was {{a compact}} 4-door sedan sold only in Japan by Honda, {{introduced}} in January 1993, {{and used the}} same 5-cylinder engine {{that was used in}} the Honda Inspire and the Honda Vigor and shared a platform with the second generation CE series Honda Ascot. [...] "Rafaga" [...] is Spanish for [...] "gust" [...] or [...] "blustery". The engine is installed longitudinally, the same configuration used in the Vigor and Inspire. The Rafaga was third in Hondas hierarchy of sedans, and a sister car to the Ascot, which was sold at the Honda Primo dealership network. The Rafaga was sold in Japan at Honda Verno dealerships, and was one level up from the Honda Integra. As with other Honda products, the Rafaga used double wishbone suspension at the front and rear wheels. The [...] "2.5 S" [...] trim level came with a front suspension upper strut brace in the engine compartment. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{the launch}} of the fourth {{generation}} Accord, the Vigor was no longer based on the Accord chassis, but a stretched derivative. The third generation Vigor, fulfilling as the top level sedan at Honda Verno dealerships in Japan, was shared with the all new Honda Inspire and the new second generation Honda Legend, sold at Honda Clio dealerships. The Vigor was sold in the United States and was badged as the first generation Acura Vigor in 1992. In Japan, the Vigor competed against the Toyota Chaser and the Nissan Laurel. The Vigor in Japan was available in four trim packages, starting with the Type N, Type E, Type W, and Type X. In May 1991, the Type N package was no longer offered, and the top trim package was the Type S-Limited. Starting January 1992, the trim packages were 2.5XS, 2.5S, 2.5X, 2.5W, 2.0G, and the Type W. In North America, the Vigor came in two trim packages; the LS and the higher content GS, and the 2.5 L engine was the only engine available. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>fuel.</b> One of the optionally available items was Digital signal processing integrated into the stereo system that allowed sound modification for various types of music.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Mark VII, the Mark VIII {{featured}} a unibody construction with a high-strength roof capable of withstanding 5000 lbs of force, heavy-gauge steel door beams {{to protect against}} side impacts, front and rear crumple zones, dual front-side airbags and four-wheel antilock disc brakes. Like the similar Thunderbird and Cougar, the Mark VIII {{featured a}} short-long arm (SLA) four-wheel independent suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars and a standard computer-controlled air suspension with sensors to automatically lower the ride height at high speed, enhancing the car's aerodynamic efficiency. Powering the Mark VIII was an all-new, all-aluminum 4.6 L DOHC 32-valve V8. The engine {{was the first of}} its kind in Ford's Modular engine family. The 4.6 L V8 produced [...] @ 5500 rpm and [...] of torque @ 4500 rpm and required <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> 91-octane <b>fuel</b> for optimum performance. Handling the V8's power was the 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive. The Mark VIII's rear axle ratio was 3.08:1. The Mark VIII also featured standard chrome dual exhaust tips and 16-inch cast aluminum wheels.|$|R
40|$|Recently, as {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of the dwindling world oil reserves and the growing awareness of the environmental problems {{associated with the use of}} coal as energy source, there is growing interest in cheaper, abundant and cleaner burning methane. The Gas-to-Liquid technology offers perhaps the most attractive routes for the exploitation of the world huge and growing natural gas resources. Using this process the erstwhile stranded gas is converted to <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> liquid <b>fuels</b> and chemicals that are easily transported. However, a widespread application of the GTL process is being hampered by economical and technical challenges. The high cost of synthesis gas, for instance, weighs heavily on the economics and competitiveness of the process limiting its wider application. This work presented a modified Gas-to-Liquid process that eliminates the costly synthesis gas production step. The proposed process utilized an alterna-tive pathway for methane activation via the production of chloromethane derivatives which are then converted to hy-drocarbons. It established that hydrocarbons mainly olefins can be economically produced from di- and tri-chloro-methanes over a typical iron-based Fischer Tropsch catalysts in a moving bed reactor at industrially relevant conditions. Some of the attractions of the proposed process include a) the elimination of the costly air separation plant requirement b) high process selectivity and c) significant reduction of carbon dioxide emissions thereby saving on feedstock loss and the costly CO 2 removal and isolation processes...|$|R
5000|$|In 1987, {{after all}} other Standard Oil {{descendants}} had minimized {{use of the}} name Standard, Standard of Ohio, proud to be the original corporate component of Standard oil, sought to corporately rebrand itself under the Standard name, while continuing to use the Sohio brand in Ohio. However, later that year BP bought the 45% of Sohio it did not already own and assumed control. Among the first changes was the rebranding of all Sohio and Boron stations to 'BP' in 1991.The Boron name was used outside of Ohio in neighboring states, like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia.

5000|$|Still {{ultimately}} {{concerned with}} {{issues such as}} fuel consumption and emissions, SVO engineers opted to pass over the venerable production 5.0 liter V-8 in lieu of an updated, turbocharged, and stronger version of Ford's 2.3 liter inline four, originally used in the Pinto and Ford Mustang II. The installation of the four-cylinder engine helped with weight distribution, due to the engine being installed perpendicular to, and behind, the front axle, thereby improving handling. Endowing the engine with an advanced, computer-controlled fuel injection system and an intercooled turbocharger system helped push power output to 175 horsepower, fairly high for the time. In addition, a [...] "fuel grade" [...] switch {{was added to the}} dash, allowing the driver to adjust the vehicle's performance level depending on whether <b>premium</b> or standard <b>grade</b> <b>fuel</b> were being used, as the engine was not installed with a knock sensor.
