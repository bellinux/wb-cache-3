500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1983, {{students}} {{reported for the}} first SAMS class. Although the curriculum was ready, the school faced a number of challenges at the outset. For example, there was no separate academic building for the school. Classrooms in Fort Leavenworth's Bell Hall (image right) were reserved [...] "on a daily basis." [...] During the first year, Winton observed that, [...] "It {{was a little bit}} on the fly and everybody <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> and understood it." [...] Difficulties aside, the 13 students of the first class completed their studies and graduated in May 1984. By then, SAMS had become [...] "the symbol for intellectual renaissance in the officer corps".|$|E
2500|$|Natalie’s {{relationship}} with Barry Evans- frequently {{described as a}} “bumbling buffoon” – was central to the character upon her return to the serial. Speed has explained her character’s initial attraction to Barry: [...] "I think {{it has a lot}} to do with her childhood. Natalie really adored her dad but he couldn't <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> horrible wife of his, Andrea… and so he walked out on the family. Andrea is a total nightmare control freak, and it says a lot about who Natalie is, why she had no confidence in herself. Her mother probably emotionally abused her. So Barry represented safety and a secure family environment…She feels safe with him and she felt she made the right choice at the time, although of course she was apprehensive about it.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Ullman {{became an}} American citizen in December 2006 and holds dual {{citizenship}} in the United States and the United Kingdom. The {{results of the}} 2004 United States presidential election, and a comment made by actor Tom Hanks, prompted her desire to naturalise. “Tom Hanks was standing in a corridor at a party and I said something, {{and he was just}} very nice and he went, ‘Oh, yeah. I know that but you’re British. You know, you don’t have to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> stuff ... I went, ‘No. Actually I’ve been here a long time.‘ I thought, that’s it. I’m going to join in. So I took the [...] test.” In 2006, she topped the list for the [...] "Wealthiest British Comedians," [...] with an estimated wealth of £75 million. In 2015, Ullman's wealth was estimated to be £77 million, making her the wealthiest British actress and female comedian. In 2017, The Sunday Times increased it to £80 million.|$|E
2500|$|With Brian Luckhurst injured Colin Cowdrey {{volunteered to}} open the innings with David Lloyd and {{withstood}} the wild first overs of Dennis Lillee (2/59) and Jeff Thomson (5/93). So many of the balls were short that {{only two or three}} had to be played each over and runmaking came slowly as the batsmen concentrated on survival. Lloyd was caught in the box by a bouncer from Thomson that failed to rise, doubled up in pain for five minutes and was helped off by the England physiotherapist Bernie Thomas. Cowdrey was dropped by Ian Redpath off Lillee, hit on the arm, survived a confident appeal by Rod Marsh before he was finally caught lbw by Thomson for 41, the bowler's 50th first class wicket, with the score 62/1. Mike Denness had replaced Lloyd and despite Doug Walters' low expectations, [...] "Oh Christ, don't tell me we have to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> Mike Denness for a couple of balls again", he and Tony Greig lasted the day with his team on 102/1. After a rest day the innings resumed in 37°C heat on the fourth day, but the game was effectively over when four wickets fell in the first hour. Greig repeated his slashing policy of the First Test until he was caught by Greg Chappell off Thomson. He was replaced by Lloyd who saw Denness edge the same bowler to Redpath, then Fletcher to Marsh to give him 3/8 in three overs. Greg Chappell caught Knott and Lloyd, Luckhurst came out to bat with his broken hand, but was caught by Mallett off Lillee after a stand of 63 with the gallant Fred Titmus (61). With nothing to lose Chris Old thrashed 2 sixes and 5 fours, taking 20 runs off one over from Max Walker and making 43 of the 64 runs added with Titmus for the eight wicket, which ensured that Australia would have to bat again. Geoff Arnold was Thomson's fifth victim and Greg Chappell took Titmus off Mallett (2/32) to give him a seven catches in a Test, breaking the record for a fielder held by his grandfather Vic Richardson amongst others. England made 293, forcing Australia to make 21 runs for victory.|$|E

25|$|There is {{only one}} verb to {{tolerate}} and one adjective tolerant, but the two nouns tolerance and toleration have evolved slightly different meanings.
