40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to investigate genetic diversity and population structure of pike perch in the Northern part of Iran. For this purpose, 207 adult <b>pike-perches</b> from four regions of the Caspian Sea watershed (Talesh Coasts, Anzali Wetland, Chaboksar Coasts and Aras Dam) were collected. DNA was extracted and by using 15 pairs of microsatellite primers, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was conducted. DNA bands were analyzed using Biocapt and GenAlex 6 software package. Out of 15 microsatellite primers, 11 loci were produced, of those, 6 loci were polymorphic and 5 were monomorphic. Analysis revealed that the average number of alleles per locus and observed heterozygosities were not statistically significant (P> 0. 05) for all four populations. Data indicated an appreciable genetic differentiation, in spite of a low genetic variation, and agreed with the low level of genetic polymorphism already observed for this species in Iran. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was obvious in most cases, mostly due to the deficiency of heterozygosities. The highest genetic distance was between Anzali Wetland and Aras Dam populations. This investigation represents the first approach to the knowledge of the genetic variability of Iranian populations using microsatellite markers, and reported results could be of interest for future management and conservation programs of this species in Iran...|$|R

Whereas the average depth of the lake is 31 meters, the depth is about 2-3 meters in the Kizhi and only in some places reaches 16-20 meters. Because of the weak flows and shallow depth, water is relatively warm and quiet that promotes growth of aquatic vegetation. Fish types include roach, some gobies, crucian carp, sabre carp, perch, ruffe, pike, common dace, silver bream, ide, gudgeon, carp bream, spined loach, European smelt, char, <b>pike-perch,</b> rudd and burbot.|$|E

50|$|The zander {{is closely}} related to perch. Zander are often called <b>pike-perch</b> as they {{resemble}} the pike with their elongated body and head, and the perch with their spiny dorsal fin. Zander are not, as is commonly believed, a pike and perch hybrid. In Europe, a second species (Sander volgensis) is limited to rivers in southern Russia and the basin of the Danube. These two species are suspected to hybridize occasionally where they are sympatric, as they produce fertile hybrids in captivity; no natural hybrids are known yet however, and while they are apparently hard to detect, it is suspected that the species are separated by strong prezygotic isolation. It strongly resembles, both in looks and in taste, the closely related American walleye (Sander vitreus).|$|E
50|$|Historically, the sea has had rich marine life, both in variety, {{with over}} 80 fish and 300 {{invertebrate}} species identified, and in numbers. Consequently, fishing {{has long been}} a major activity in the area. The annual catch of recent years was 300,000 tonnes, about half of which are valuable species (sturgeon, <b>pike-perch,</b> bream, sea-roach, etc.). This was partly due to extremely high biological productivity of the sea, which was stimulated by the strong supply of nutrients from numerous rivers feeding the sea, low water salinity, ample heating due to shallow waters and long vegetation period. However, diversity and numbers have been reduced by artificial reduction of river flow (construction of dams), over-fishing and water-intense large-scale cultivation of cotton, causing increasing levels of pollution. Fish hauls have rapidly decreased and in particular anchovy fisheries have collapsed.|$|E
50|$|The lake hosts 54 {{species of}} coastal aquatic flora, {{including}} cane, calamus (Acorus calamus), bulrush, grass rush, lesser bulrush (Typha angustifolia) and water parsnip (Sium latifolium). Floating plants are rare and are {{of only three}} types: arrowhead, yellow water-lily and water knotweed. The lake is home to perch, <b>pike-perch,</b> bream, roaches, whitefishes, smelt and other species of fish. The wetlands of the coastal strip of the lake are important resting and feeding grounds for swans, geese and ducks migrating between the White Sea and Baltic Sea and western Europe. Lake Peipsi {{is one of the}} main stopovers for Bewick's swan (Cygnus columbianus). The swans leave their breeding grounds in the Russian Arctic 1,600 km away and the lake is the first stop for many. Bewick's rarely fly more than 1,900 km without fueling so they are near to the limits of their endurance when they reach the lake.|$|E
40|$|The <b>pike-perch</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{commercial}} fish species in Uzbekistan. Historically, it inhabited the Aral Sea and deltas of inflowing rivers (Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya).

40|$|The {{host range}} of ranaviruses was {{investigated}} by challenging <b>pike-perch</b> (Sander lucioperca) {{with the following}} ranavirus isolates: epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV), European sheatfish virus (ESV), European catfish virus (ECV), <b>pike-perch</b> iridovirus (PPIV), short-finned eel virus (SERV) and frog virus 3 (FV 3). <b>Pike-perch</b> fry were bath-challenged at 12 °C and 22 °C at 5 weeks post hatching, and the challenge was repeated with EHNV and PPIV in older fish (15 weeks post hatching) at higher densities. A third batch of fish was subjected to intraperitoneal (i. p.) and cohabitation challenge with EHNV, ESV, ECV and PPIV at 16 °C. Statistically significant mortality was observed in EHNV-challenged fish at both temperatures in the five week old fish. No mortalities were seen in older fish challenged with EHNV and PPIV. High mortalities were registered in i. p. -challenged fish, but not in cohabitated fish. Virus re-isolation was possible from the youngest bath-challenged fish in all challenge trials and the i. p. -challenged fish, but not from older fish or cohabitated fish. Susceptibility of <b>pike-perch</b> to ranaviruses appears {{to be dependent on}} age of fish and challenge route. The study shows that <b>pike-perch</b> are susceptible to infection with ranavirus under certain conditions, and it is suggested that this be considered when reviewing the legislation on notifiable diseases...|$|E

40|$|Fish parasites may {{potentially}} harm {{fisheries and}} aquaculture. Infected fish are unusable, {{even though they}} would not pose a direct risk to human health. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} ecology and epidemiology of three previously unknown or poorly known spore-forming parasites infecting muscles of economically important fish species. The first novel microsporidian species, here described as Microsporidium luciopercae, was found from <b>pike-perch</b> (Sander lucioperca) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and formed opaque-looking patches in the muscles. The second novel microsporidian species, Myosporidium spraguei, was found from <b>pike-perch</b> and burbot (Lota lota) and occurred within xenomas in the musculature. The third muscle-dwelling parasite, Henneguya zschokkei (Cnidaria), formed white plasmodia in the muscle of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). Among the six study lakes, the prevalence of M. luciopercae in wild <b>pike-perch</b> and perch varied from 0 to 1 %, while M. spraguei was more common (prevalence of 5 – 26 % in <b>pike-perch</b> and 65 % in burbot). M. spraguei was strongly aggregated and most abundant in the middle-sized (37 – 45 cm) <b>pike-perch</b> and in larger burbot (> 35 cm), but the infection was not related to host sex, sampling season or host condition. In the case of H. zschokkei, in two inland fish farms, one year-old whitefish were virtually uninfected, but the prevalence of infection was higher in 2 and 3 year old fish (up to 36 % of 3 year old fish were infected). New infections appeared seasonally in July-August. Neither the size of plasmodia nor the proportion of different plasmodium types changed from 2 to 3 year old fish, suggesting slow development of H. zschokkei in whitefish. However, the proportion of infected fish with melanised plasmodia increased with fish age, suggesting an age-dependent host response against this strongly aggregated parasite...|$|E

40|$|Animals {{should be}} {{rendered}} unconscious before slaughter {{in order to}} avoid suffering or pain. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate an electrical stunning after dewatering to induce instantaneous unconsciousness and insensibility in yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), common sole (Solea solea) and <b>pike-perch</b> (Stizostedion lucioperca). To kill without recovery, the current was applied for 5 s, followed by chilling in ice water for 10 min. Loss of consciousness and sensibility were assessed by neural (EEG), physiological (ECG) and behavioural parameters. An epileptiform insult was observed in all yellowtail kingfish (n = 27), common sole (n = 25) and <b>pike-perch</b> (n = 25) after administering a current of 0. 54 +/- 0. 12 A(rms) (124 V dc and 11 V-rms ac; 100 Hz), 0. 65 +/- 0. 23 A(rms) (98 V dc and 8. 4 V-rms ac; 100 Hz) and 0. 75 +/- 0. 24 A(rms) (144 V dc and 13 V-rms ac; 100 Hz) during 1 s through the head of individual fish, respectively. When yellowtail kingfish (n = 11) was submitted to a 5 s electrical stun followed by chilling in ice water, this resulted in passing 0. 72 +/- 0. 13 A(rms) for 5 s and no recovery during chilling. In the case of common sole (n = 10) and <b>pike-perch</b> (n = 12), passing 1. 4 +/- 0. 64 and 0. 75 +/- 0. 24 A(rms) during 5 s followed by chilling in ice water for 10 min resulted in an irrecoverable stun in 9 out 10 fish and 11 out 12 fish, respectively. We conclude that for yellowtail kingfish the investigated combination of electrical stunning and chilling is suitable for humane slaughter, whereas for common sole and <b>pike-perch</b> this procedure needs to be optimised.
