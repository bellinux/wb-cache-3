50|$|Pursuant to {{resolution}} 1976 {{and resolution}} 2015, both adopted in 2011, the United Nations Security Council {{has called for}} more structured international support for Somalia's Transitional Federal Government as well as Puntland and other regional authorities in Somalia in creating counter-piracy special courts, laws, prisons and <b>policing</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Resolution 1976 also encourages regional and federal actors to engage in more effective marine resource defence against illegal fishing and toxic waste dumping in areas under their jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|The ADFIS is the {{unification}} of the separate <b>policing</b> <b>capabilities</b> {{of each of the}} three services, but each service still maintains its own capabilities. The Royal Australian Navy maintains the Naval Police Coxswain branch with NPC postings on HMA ships and shore establishments. The Army maintains the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police which include general duties police members. The Royal Australian Air Force maintains the Air Force Police (formerly Security Police) which also includes general duties police members.|$|E
50|$|The Operational Response Group {{was defined}} as a police {{tactical}} group within the National Counter-Terrorism Committee arrangements providing the Commonwealth of Australia an offshore specialist and tactical policing response capability. The unit provided similar capabilities to the AFP's Specialist Response and Security Team but focused on national and international deployments outside of the Australian Capital Territory, where the SRS had responsibility. The ORG was created to enhance the operational <b>policing</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the AFP's International Deployment Group (IDG) operating predominantly in the Pacific region.|$|E

50|$|In {{cases where}} {{military}} organisations do {{operate in the}} domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required, to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations. such as the Iranian Embassy Siege, the British police formally turned responsibility over to the Special Air Service when the situation went beyond <b>police</b> <b>capabilities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The National Intervention Unit {{can trace}} its origins to the [...] Reaction Units which were {{established}} in the Riot Units in 1979.

5000|$|Yet, parterre {{behaviour}} continued largely unchanged. In Rome and Parma, {{efforts to}} regulate start times were ineffective and ignored, especially by “the notorious minor abbots who littered the parterre. Even {{a request from}} a bishop in England to lower the curtain {{before the start of}} the Sabbath at midnight could not prevent the pit from rioting and trashing the theater when the stage manager attempted to comply. [...] Whether the inability of all efforts to impose order in the parterre reflects poor <b>policing</b> <b>capabilities,</b> the declining authority of the monarchy, or the deliberate resistance of the parterre is undecided.|$|E
50|$|The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 {{demonstrated}} the inadequacies of the then existing border management system {{and led to}} the formation of the Border Security Force as a unified central armed police force with the specific mandate of guarding India's international boundary with Pakistan. The BSF's <b>policing</b> <b>capabilities</b> were used in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 against the Pakistani Armed Forces in areas which were least threatened. During wartime or upon orders from the central government BSF operates under the command of the Indian Army. BSF troops took part in the Battle of Longewala in 1971 in this capacity. After the 1971 war which led to the creation of Bangladesh, the responsibility for policing the border with Bangladesh was also assigned to Border Security Force.|$|E
40|$|Throughout the War on Drugs, South American {{governments have}} fought a {{difficult}} and many times losing battle against drug trafficking. Lack of resources and <b>policing</b> <b>capabilities</b> have lead {{a growing number of}} States to adopt so called “Shoot-Down Laws”, legislation designed to authorize use of lethal force against “hostile” aircraft suspected of being involved in narco-trafficking. This article examines said laws from the viewpoint of international law, humanitarian law and human rights law. The article makes the point that mere transportation of narcotics cannot be reason enough to authorize use of lethal force and that “Shoot-Down Laws” constitute both a violation of the right to life and a misuse of the law of armed conflict to justify military action against civilian aircraft. The article claims that other alternatives, such as closer bilateral cooperation and enforcement, must be explored if these governments want to avoid being sued for human rights violations at the Inter-American level...|$|E
50|$|Domestically, police crisis {{response}} teams (CRTs) {{are the primary}} groups to engage in CQC. Situations involving the potential for CQC generally involve extraordinary threats outside of conventional <b>police</b> <b>capabilities,</b> and thus CRTs are specifically organized, equipped, and trained to respond to these situations. These situations often require the special tactics and techniques involving building entry and room clearing procedures that are the hallmarks of CQC.|$|R
50|$|According to that report, the Secretary-General expresses {{confidence}} that a partial drawdown of the Mission’s post-earthquake “surge” military and <b>police</b> <b>capabilities</b> {{would be unlikely}} to undermine progress made so far on the security front. He, therefore, recommends reducing the Mission’s authorized military strength by 1,600 personnel and reducing the authorized police strength by 1,150 formed police unit officers, to be completed by June 2012.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is analyze the spatial relationship between aspects of place (socioeconomic, demographic, land use) and the clustering of crime activity in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. The framework proposed in this analysis combines a macrolevel, mesolevel and microlevel approaches at the census block level to identify problem neighborhoods and associated characteristics to determine the relationship between crime incidents and site-specific physical features, socioeconomic, demographic and land use characteristics. The data that were collected by Population and Housing Census (Inegi, 2010) for the socioeconomic variables and the violence and property crimes statistics geocoded by the Municipal Observatory of Security and Citizenship at census tract and block level. The results show the pattern of violent crime at the macrolevel has remained concentrated in low socioeconomic status. Microlevel research emphasizes the analysis of crime at individual locations (hot spots). Findings are expected to enhance crime monitoring and <b>policing</b> <b>capabilities</b> across the urban size spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Corruption {{is usually}} {{depicted}} {{in one of}} two ways: as stemming from a lack of government accountability, or from a lack of capacity. Neither depiction predicts that the structure of institutions meant to control corruption should vary across autocratic regimes. If corruption results from moral hazard between politicians and citizens, then all unaccountable governments should eschew anticorruption bodies. If rent-seeking stems from moral hazard between politicians and bureaucrats, all governments should create anticorruption bodies. We offer an explanation for why unaccountable governments vary in their willingness to create anticorruption institutions. Autocrats create such bodies to deter ideo-logically disaffected members of the populace from entering the bureaucracy. Anticorruption institutions act as a commitment by the elite to restrict the monetary benefits from bureaucratic office, thus ensuring that only zealous sup-porters of the elite will pursue bureaucratic posts. We illustrate these arguments with case studies of South Korea and Rwanda. (JEL D 73, P 48) The literature on corruption, broadly speaking, points to two agency problems as the source of corrupt behavior. One such problem exists between the populace and its political leaders. A lack of government accountability gives rise to politicians ’ predatory behavior (e. g., Adersà et al. 2003). Political institutions, such as democracy, may serve as a check on these predatory tendencies. Alternative arguments point to an agency problem between governments and their bureaucrats as a source of cor-ruption. The state’s lack of <b>policing</b> <b>capabilities</b> may allow bureaucrats to predate on the population, regardless of the intentions of political leader...|$|E
50|$|In April 2008 he was {{appointed}} as the Head of UK Border Control and in 2009, following the 'Security in a Global Hub' Review {{he was charged with}} the responsibility of integrating the front line border customs operation (HMRC) with the border Immigration operation, thus delivering a more effective <b>policing</b> <b>capability</b> against illegal activity spanning people and goods. By 2010 the 9000 strong multiskilled Border Force was in place.|$|R
50|$|At its peak, SO was a {{group of}} twenty {{specialist}} units, which were formed to give the Metropolitan Police a specialist <b>policing</b> <b>capability.</b> The SO designation was implemented in 1986 as part of Sir Kenneth Newman's restructuring of the Metropolitan Police Service. Most of the units designated SO units were already in existence, many of them as departments of C Division and its branches, and all were presided over by an Assistant Commissioner of Special Operations (ACSO).|$|R
50|$|The GMP {{maintains}} a mounted <b>policing</b> <b>capability.</b> The mounted officers are employed to target crime hotspots {{and are also}} seen at many events including demonstrations and the region's football matches. Horses are also used to search inaccessible areas for missing or wanted people. The unit {{is made up of}} a team of specialist police officers, skilled grooms and trainers, and 35 horses. The mounted unit is based at Hough End, in Chorlton, and uses horseboxes to transport the horses for duties around Greater Manchester.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} an {{evaluation}} of a trial of predictive policing by the MPS in the Greater London Area. Since 2013, MPS Territorial <b>Policing,</b> <b>Capability</b> and Support (TP C & S) has been trialling a number of predictive policing initiatives in the capital. By late 2014, three commercial predictive policing products and one ‘in house’ (MPS analyst) crime forecasting model (‘MBR’) were being used to support operational decision-making in most London boroughs. The commercial products were each allocated two Borough Operational Command Units (BOCU) in which to operate. The MBR (in principle at least) operated in the remaining 26 of the 32 MPS BOCUs. As part of the evaluation we assessed the hit rates and predictive accuracy indices of the crime forecasting products in two towns outside London: Reading and Slough...|$|R
40|$|The Pacific Islands {{are seriously}} {{challenged}} by the growth in wealth {{and the expansion of}} international material possessions. On the roads traffic has grown dramatically and the types of vehicles now using Island roads has greatly changed. With the importation of cheap second hand vehicles designed for freeway speeds serious safety issues have grown proportionally with the increasing numbers. In this research we consider the prohibitive costs of traditional traffic controls to economy and propose a light weight highly mobile aerial surveillance system that integrates with ground <b>policing</b> <b>capability.</b> Our research question was: How can road safety and security be enhanced with economical technologies? In addition to collecting and processing live data we have also designed a forensically ready system, and an information system to process the large amounts of data generated by the addition of these technologies into the traffic surveillance processes...|$|R
5000|$|Specialist Response Group (SRG) is {{a highly}} trained police unit of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) {{consisting}} {{of a range of}} teams capable of deploying at short notice in order to undertake a variety of specialist policing tasks. SRG predominantly consist of sworn police officers, based in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT), who are capable of resolving higher risk planned and emergency policing operations; both domestically and internationally. [...] SRG are a police tactical group as defined under the Australian and New Zealand Counter-Terrorism Committee (ANZCTC) arrangements. SRG commenced operations in July 2012 {{as a result of the}} merging of the Specialist Response and Security Team (SRS) (from ACT Policing) and the Operational Response Group (ORG) from AFP’s International Deployment Group. SRG are now the largest centralised specialist <b>policing</b> <b>capability</b> in Australia, with almost 200 personnel.|$|R
50|$|In May 2011, the Secretary of State for Transport Philip Hammond {{announced}} that British Transport Police would create an armed capability {{of its own}} with {{the added benefit of}} additional resilience and capacity of the overall UK <b>police</b> armed <b>capability.</b> The BTP are deployed on armed patrols using Glock 17 pistols, LMT AR-15 CQB carbines as well as tasers.|$|R
50|$|The {{armed forces}} largely escaped the {{immediate}} wrath {{of a population}} clearly bent on {{putting an end to}} Duvalier rule. Popular violence had erupted in 1984, and it continued into early 1986 in an expanding sequence of local revolts. In its waning days, the regime relied heavily on the VSN and on limited local <b>police</b> <b>capabilities</b> to curb violence. Many Haitians detected the fissures growing in the nation's security apparatus, and some rumors held that the army would move against Duvalier. These rumors, however, proved incorrect; still, Duvalier's inability to contain the widespread rioting through political measures and the VSN's failure to control the unrest placed the military in a pivotal position. Conscious of his precarious hold on power, Duvalier reshuffled the cabinet and the military leadership in the last days of 1985, but to no avail. Reports of brutal excesses by the increasingly desperate VSN further weakened Duvalier's position.|$|R
40|$|By {{creating}} the European Gendarmerie Force (EGF), some European Union (EU) member states have devised a ‘structured solution’ to provide international civilian <b>police</b> <b>capabilities.</b> In this article, we undertake a critical {{examination of the}} EGF by first arguing that the EGF has been widely misrepresented, notably with regard to its general purpose and specific relationship to the EU. Next, we examine a range of security problems used to justify the EGF, arguing that its potential role in handling certain tasks has not been very carefully considered. Finally, we suggest that a major rationale behind the EGF was the shared desire among its members {{to draw attention to}} a policing model that is not universally appreciated, and to promote this model by offering its ‘third-type’ capabilities while keeping the EGF outside of EU institutional constraints. In the conclusion, we identify some crucial questions related to the EGF–EU relations, notably in terms of non-optimisation of EU resources and possible incoherence in EU/Common Security and Defence Policy efforts...|$|R
5000|$|Symbolism: Gold (Yellow) {{recalls the}} Cavalry lineage of the unit. Gold is also emblematic of {{excellence}} and high achievement. The two horizontal black bars allude to wrought iron, inherent with Armor and the unit's numerical designation [...] "2nd." [...] The Spartan sword or Xiphos represents the unit's courage, vigilance and preparedness {{to stand and}} fight at a moment's notice. The blue of the hilt is for loyalty. The Spartan shield or Hoplon signifies the unit's ability to receive and organize multiple attachments for combat and remain constantly ready to support global military operations. Red symbolizes valor, sacrifice and {{is the color of}} the Spartan warrior's cape. The Spartan army was one of the toughest on record and served as the standard for valor. The lightning flashes highlight the organization's inherent ability to support tactical missions with Intelligence, Signal and Military <b>Police</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The contrast of black and gold underscores the night and day, around the clock mission of the Special Troops Battalion.|$|R
