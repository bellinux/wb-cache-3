5|$|When the British {{gained control}} of Indiana, the entire region {{was in the middle}} of Pontiac's Rebellion. During the next year, British {{officials}} negotiated with the various tribes, splitting them from their alliance with <b>Pontiac.</b> Eventually, <b>Pontiac</b> lost most of his allies, forcing him to make peace with the British on July 25, 1766. As a concession to <b>Pontiac,</b> Great Britain issued a proclamation that the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains was to be reserved for Native Americans. Despite the treaty, <b>Pontiac</b> was still considered a threat to British interests, but after he was murdered on April 20, 1769, the region saw several years of peace.|$|E

5|$|The full Holden VE {{range was}} {{exported}} {{and sold to}} New Zealand, whereas in the Middle East and South Africa it was re-branded as the Chevrolet Lumina. Sales of the Berlina began in 2007 for Brazilian market as the Chevrolet Omega. <b>Pontiac</b> in North America also imported Commodore sedans from 2008 through to 2009 as the G8. The G8's cessation was a consequence of GM's Chapter 11 bankruptcy resulting in {{the demise of the}} <b>Pontiac</b> brand. Unlike the Chevrolet Lumina and Omega, the <b>Pontiac</b> received several unique features including a revised L76 engine with Active Fuel Management as opposed to the Commodore's L98, and appearance changes.|$|E
5|$|When M-218 {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the State Trunkline System by 1936, it served as a connector between M-58 in <b>Pontiac</b> and US 16 in West Novi.

5|$|A {{number of}} highway {{designation}} and routing {{changes in the}} <b>Pontiac</b> were made when US10 was shifted out of downtown to replace M-58 along Telegraph Road west of downtown {{by the middle of}} 1961. Before the change, US10 followed Dixie Highway and Oakland Avenue southeast into <b>Pontiac</b> to Perry Street and then Perry to Woodward while M-58 was routed along Telegraph and Square Lake roads. After the change, US10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto Telegraph and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward. The old route through downtown was assigned the Bus. US10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Two years later, I-75 was completed to the east of <b>Pontiac,</b> and the M-24 bypass of the city was turned over to local control. The former Bus. M-24 through downtown was renumbered BL I-75 along with a connection along Square Lake Road out to the freeway. The next year, the streets downtown <b>Pontiac</b> were reconfigured and a loop called Wide Track Drive was created to route traffic around the downtown area. The former routing of BL I-75 on Perry Street in the downtown core was replaced by routing the business loops on Wide Track Drive. Then in 1966, an interchange was built to replace the intersection at Opdyke Road and Square Lake Road.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, the British {{attempted to}} make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But <b>Pontiac</b> was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, <b>Pontiac</b> lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.|$|E

5|$|Hoping to {{take the}} stronghold by surprise, on May 7 <b>Pontiac</b> entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men {{carrying}} concealed weapons. The British had learned of Pontiac's plan, however, and were armed and ready. His tactic foiled, <b>Pontiac</b> withdrew after a brief council and, two days later, laid siege to the fort. <b>Pontiac</b> and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers they could find outside of the fort, including women and children. One of the soldiers was ritually cannibalized, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Native cultures. The violence was directed at the British; French colonists were generally left alone. Eventually more than 900 soldiers from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege. Meanwhile, on May 28 a British supply column from Fort Niagara led by Lieutenant Abraham Cuyler was ambushed and defeated at Point Pelee.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, the main north–south highway through <b>Pontiac</b> was numbered M-10, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created.

US10 was extended westward along Square Lake Road from the intersection of Woodward Avenue to the junction with Telegraph Road so that it would continue to connect with its parent highway on the southern end. In 1985, the Michigan Department of Transportation received permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to truncate US10 to Bay City, and when the change was made the following year, US24 replaced US10 on Telegraph Road north of Square Lake Road, and Bus.

5|$|During the French and Indian War, the North American {{front of}} the Seven Years' War in Europe, the British {{directly}} challenged France {{for control of the}} region. Although no pitched battles occurred in Indiana, the native tribes of the region supported the French. At the beginning of the war, the tribes sent large groups of warriors to support the French in resisting the British advance and to raid British colonies. Using Fort Pitt as a forward base, British commander Robert Rogers overcame the native resistance and drove deep into the frontier to capture Fort Detroit. The rangers moved south from Detroit and captured many of the key French outposts in Indiana, including Fort Miamis and Fort Vincennes. As the war progressed, the French lost control of Canada after the fall of Montreal. No longer able to effectively fight the British in interior North America, they lost Indiana to British forces. By 1761 the French were entirely forced out of Indiana. Following the French expulsion, the native tribes, led by Chief <b>Pontiac,</b> confederated in an attempt to rebel against the British without French assistance. While <b>Pontiac</b> was besieging British-held Fort Detroit, other tribes in Indiana rose up against the British. They were forced to surrender Fort Miamis and Fort Ouiatenon. In 1763, while <b>Pontiac</b> was fighting the British, the French signed the Treaty of Paris and ceded control of Indiana to the British.|$|E
