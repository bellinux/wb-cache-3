5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Breckinridge quickly became an ardent supporter of the Union, not for its position against slavery, but for the sake of preserving the Union. He used his position as editor of the Danville Quarterly Review to advocate his position. He called for harsh measures against secession, and in time, accepted President Lincoln's immediate emancipation of slaves. He was chosen as the temporary chair of the 1864 Republican National Convention that re-nominated Lincoln for <b>president,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> pro-Union speech was hailed by freshman Representative James G. Blaine {{as one of the most}} inspiring given at the event.|$|E

The northern passage (this time extending across the length of the room) was restored by 1865. An open doorframe in the south wall provided access to the bedroom to the south. The 1865 configuration was occupied by Senator David T. Patterson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife, Martha (daughter of President Andrew Johnson); President Ulysses S.

After Johnson's retirement, Marcus's invitations were among the few the former <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife continued to accept.

5|$|Unlike the White House Hanukkah Party, Obama's White House Passover Seder {{was not a}} {{political}} event. The guest list did not include rabbinical figures, Jewish lobbyists, members of Congress, or Israeli representatives. The guest list of approximately 20 remained basically the same each year. Attendees included the <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family, members of the president's and first lady's staff and their families, {{and friends of the}} Obamas, with a mix of Jews and non-Jews.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for <b>president,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|During the Diệm era, the VNQDD were {{implicated in}} two failed coup attempts. In November 1960, a paratrooper revolt failed after the mutineers agreed to negotiate, {{allowing}} time for loyalists {{to relieve the}} president. Many of the officers involved had links to or {{were members of the}} VNQDD, and fled the country after the coup collapsed. In 1963, VNQDD leaders Tam and Vũ Hồng Khanh were among those arrested for their involvement in the plot; Tam committed suicide before the case started, and Khanh was jailed. In February 1962, two Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots, Nguyễn Văn Cừson of a prominent VNQDD leaderand Phạm Phú Quốc, bombarded the Independence Palace in a bid to kill the <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family, but their targets escaped unharmed. Diem was eventually deposed in a military coup and killed in November 1963. While the generals that led the coup were not members of the VNQDD, they sought to cultivate ARVN officers who were part of the VNQDD because of their antipathy towards Diem.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Rio Branco {{became the}} President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) {{for the first}} time. He would become the Council's longest-serving <b>president,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> cabinet the second longest, in Brazilian history. His {{government}} was marked by a time of economic prosperity and the enactment of several necessary reforms—though they proved to be seriously flawed. The {{most important of these}} initiatives was the Law of Free Birth, which granted freeborn status to children born to slave women. Rio Branco led the government that enacted this law, and its passage increased his popularity. However, his government was plagued by a long crisis with the Catholic Church that had resulted from the expulsion of Freemasons from its lay brotherhoods. After more than four years heading the Cabinet, Rio Branco resigned in 1875. Following a long vacation in Europe, his health swiftly declined and he was diagnosed with oral cancer. Rio Branco died in 1880 and was widely mourned throughout the country. He is regarded by most historians as one of Brazil's greatest statesmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, with Obama elected <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> junior staffers {{working in}} the White House, Obama encouraged the group to hold the Seder again. The 2009 event {{was the first time}} that a sitting U.S. president conducted a Passover Seder in the White House. The White House switchboard was reportedly swamped with callers seeking a dinner invitation. The White House Seder was scheduled for the second night of Passover to allow Jewish staffers to spend the first Seder on the first night of Passover with their families. About 20 guests sat around a table in the Old Family Dining Room reading the Haggadah and sampling the traditional Seder foods. Malia and Sasha Obama, being the youngest in attendance, recited the Four Questions and engaged in the search for the afikoman.|$|E
5|$|Apparently {{poised for}} a {{military}} victory, the rebels hesitated. Đông wanted to storm the palace and capture the <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family. Thi felt that despite Diệm's shortcomings, he was South Vietnam's best available leader and thus was worried Diệm could be killed in an attack. Thi thought that enforced reform was the best outcome. The rebels wanted Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief advisor, and his wife, Madame Nhu, who were {{widely regarded as the}} powers behind Diệm's rule, out of the government, although they disagreed over whether to assassinate or deport the couple. Thi demanded that Diệm appoint an officer as Prime Minister and remove Madame Nhu from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorized by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diệm was being removed for corruption and suppression of liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent representatives to negotiate. After lengthy talks, the parties agreed to a ceasefire. In the meantime, loyalist forces headed towards the capital. Diệm promised to end press censorship, liberalize the economy, and hold free and fair elections. Diệm refused to sack Nhu, but agreed to dissolve the cabinet and form a new government which would accommodate members of the Revolutionary Council. In the early hours of 12 November, Diệm taped a speech detailing the concessions, and Thi broadcast the message on Saigon Radio.|$|E
