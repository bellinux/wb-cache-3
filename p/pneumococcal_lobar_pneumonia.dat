40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the case fatality rate in <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> can be appreciably decreased by {{the proper use of}} the sulfonamide drugs (1 - 3) and of penicillin (4). In spite of the effectiveness of these compounds in the treatment of pneumonia, the exact manner in which they bring about recovery is not understood. The effect of such chemotherapeutic agents, particularly the sulfonamides, is known to be chiefly bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal in the concentrations usually attained in the treatment of human patients (5, 6). According to the prevailing concepts of immunology, the fully encapsulated pneumococcus cannot be attacked and destroyed by phagocytic cells unless previously opsonized by type-specific antibodies (7 - 9). Since sulfonamide chemotherapy frequently brings about a crisis in pneumonia long before type-specific antibodies appear in the patient's serum (10, 11), the question arises as to how the pneumococci are finally destroyed in the lung. In the preceding paper of the present series (12) these and other specific questions were raised regarding the mechanism of recovery in pneumococca...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} data from three {{analyses}} of occupational mortality for England and Wales {{to investigate a}} suspected hazard of pneumonia in welders. Mortality from the disease was consistently raised in welders aged 15 - 64, with standardised mortality ratios of 184 (95 % Cl 150 - 224) in 1959 - 63 and 157 (121 - 200) in 1970 - 72. Analysis of data for 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 90 showed that the increased risk is attributable mainly to an excess of <b>pneumococcal</b> and unspecified <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> (proportional mortality ratio 255, 95 % Cl 192 - 332). No excess occurred in men above retirement age (65). A possible explanation of these findings is that welding fume reversibly increases the susceptibility of the lung to pneumonic infection. The observation of a similar mortality pattern in moulders and coremakers points to the metallic component of the fume as a possible culprit, but ozone or oxides of nitrogen could also be implicated. There are grounds for <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> to be considered an occupational disease in welder...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{national}} {{analyses of}} mortality in England and Wales have repeatedly shown excess deaths from pneumonia in welders. During 1979 - 1990 the excess was attributable largely to deaths from <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> and pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia, limited to working-aged men, and apparent in other metal fume-exposed occupations. We assessed findings for 1991 - 2000 and compared the mortality pattern with that from asthma in occupations exposed to known respiratory sensitizers. Methods: the Office of National Statistics supplied data on deaths by underlying cause among men aged 16 - 74 years in England and Wales during 1991 - 2000, including age and last held occupation. We abstracted data on pneumonia for occupations with exposure to metal fume and on asthma for occupations commonly reported to surveillance schemes as {{at risk of}} occupational asthma. We estimated expected numbers of deaths by applying age-specific proportions of deaths by cause in the population to the total deaths by age in each occupational group. Observed and expected numbers were compared for each cause of death. Results: among working-aged men in metal fume-exposed occupations we found excesses of mortality from <b>pneumococcal</b> and <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> (54 deaths vs. 27. 3 expected) and from pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia (71 vs. 52. 4), but no excess from these causes at older ages, or from bronchopneumonia at any age.

40|$|Tillet and Francis (1) in 1930 {{found that}} sera {{obtained}} from patients {{early in the}} course of <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> contained a substance which precipitated with the somatic C poly~ccharide of pneumococci. Abemathy, MacLeod, and Avery (2 - 4) subsequently found this substance to be a protein, and defined many of its properties. Because it was found in the sera of patients acutely ill with other diseases and since its reaction with C polysaccharide required ionized calcium (2), it seemed unlikely that this "C-reactive protein" was an antibody. Aberuathy (5) found that the sera of monkeys infected with pneumococci also contained a material which gave a precipitin reaction with C polysaccharide. LSfstrtim (6, 7) and Anderson and McCarty (8) described the presence in acute phase rabbit sera of an analogous material, "Cx-reactive protein. " The work of Anderson and McCarty (8) and Wood el al.

40|$|Studies on {{bacteremia}} in <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> {{have brought}} forward accumulating evidence {{to indicate that}} this form of pneumococcus infection in the human being is characteristically a localized disease. The older view that lobar pneumonia in its beginning stages {{is accompanied by a}} transient invasion of the blood stream is not supported by the results of blood cultures in early cases. While bacteremia may occur within the first 24 hours of the disease, the great majority of cases exhibit a sterile blood at this time (1, 2). x The marked alteration in prognosis occasioned by finding pneumococci in the blood stream at any period in the disease is so generally recognized that it is mentioned here only to emphasize the importance of this phenomenon about which so little is known. The conception that bacteremia indicates a breaking down of the body's defence mechanism is probably correct, since it has been observed that the more extensive the pulmonary involvement and the lower the white blood count the greater the likelihood of bacteremia (3), and that following the onset of baeteremia an increasing number of pneumococci in the blood is associated with a rapidly rising mortality. However, we have little information as to how or why pneumococci escape from the pulmonary lesion. Of the various factors in bodily resistance, which might operate to control the liberation of pneumococci from the lung into the blood stream, that o...|$|E
40|$|With {{the purpose}} of ascertaining the {{influence}} exerted by the pneumococcidal activity of {{the blood on the}} course of bacteremia occurring in experimental canine pneumococcal pneumonia, a study was made of the rates at which intravenously injected pneumococci disappeared from the circulation and the shed blood of diseased dogs. Preliminary studies on normal animals showed that blood containing hundreds of thousands of pneumococci per cc. immediately after injection usually became sterile or nearly so within an hour's time. Simultaneous observations carried out on the blood in vitro showed an analogous rapid disappearance of the microorganisms, although the effect was not quite as marked. Similar tests on non-bacteremic dogs with pneumonia revealed essentially the same ability of the body to dispose of large numbers of circulating pneumococci. The shed blood likewise exhibited marked bactericidal power. The occurrence of bacteremia during pneumonia did not retard greatly the rate at which injected pneumococci disappeared from the circulation, as compared with the non-bacteremic state. After several hours the numbers of circulating microorganisms were approximately the same as prior to the intravenous injection. Blood in vitro often cleared as fully as it did in vivo over the same length of time. Studies on the role played by humoral immune substances in the bactericidal action of the blood showed that while their presence was necessary for maximum killing power, and that bacteremic blood lacking humoral immune properties was rarely capable of self-sterilization in vitro, nevertheless such blood often retained considerable bactericidal potency as shown by its ability to reduce materially the numbers of pneumococci added to it. This phenomenon is discussed. The marked pneumococcidal capacity of the blood exhibited by dogs with experimental pneumococcal pneumonia and its persistence during bacteremia suggest that this constitutes the principal mechanism for limiting the degree of blood invasion. The similarity of the findings in canine and human <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is pointed out...|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous {{pneumonia}} {{occurred to}} a considerable extent among stock monkeys at the Army Medical School. This pneumonia occurred chiefly {{in the form of}} an epidemic outbreak shortly after the arrival of a large shipment of monkeys, and was shown to be due in large part to transmission of infection from monkey to monkey, either directly or indirectly. That spread of the epidemic was facilitated by overcrowding was indicated by the fact that in a subsequent shipment of monkeys, which were kept in pairs in separate cages and were not allowed to come into contact with the monkeys among which the epidemic occurred, no cases of spontaneous pneumonia developed. The close analogy between the epidemic of <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> that occurred among the monkeys and similar epidemics of <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> that occurred during the war among certain groups of newly drafted troops shortly after their arrival at camp is very striking, and would seem to indicate that pneumococcus pneumonia may become an epidemic disease among groups of susceptible individuals when they are assembled under conditions that facilitate the ready transfer of infection from individual to individual. Bacteriological examination showed the spontaneous pneumonia to be due in the great majority of cases to infection with Pneumococcus Type IV. Immunological classification of the strains of pneurnococci by cross-agglutination tests showed that the majority fell into two biological groups. Two cases were apparently caused by Streptococcus hæmolyticus, two by Streptococcus viridans. The clinical course of spontaneous pneumococcus pneumonia in monkeys was characterized by sudden onset, high sustained temperature, leucocytosis, rapid respiration with expiratory grunt, cough, physical signs of consolidation, invasion of the blood by pneurnococci, and termination in death or recovery by crisis about the 7 th to 9 th day. In a few instances the disease was complicated by acute fibrinopurulent pericarditis, by empyema, and by purulent meningitis. It was, therefore, clinically identical with <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> experimentally produced in monkeys and with <b>lobar</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in man.
