5|$|The Calcutta High Court is {{the oldest}} High Court in the country, {{established}} on 2 July 1862. High Courts that handle {{a large number of}} cases of a particular region have permanent benches established there. Benches are also present in states which come under the jurisdiction of a court outside its territorial limits. Smaller states with few cases may have circuit benches established. Circuit benches (known as circuit courts {{in some parts of the}} world) are temporary courts which hold proceedings for a few selected months in a year. Thus cases built up during this interim period are judged when the circuit court is in session. According to a study conducted by Bengaluru-based NGO Daksh on 21 high courts in collaboration with Ministry of Law and Justice (India) in March 2016, it was found that average <b>pendency</b> of a case in High courts in India is 3 years.|$|E
5|$|The players {{ultimately}} prevailed after a {{jury trial}} on their claims. That verdict, the <b>pendency</b> of other antitrust cases {{and the threat of}} a class action lawsuit filed by Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, on behalf of all NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a salary cap, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floorminimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 302 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of causal graphs from non-experimental data {{rests on a}} set of constraints that the graph structure imposes on all probability distributions compatible with the graph. These constraints are of two types: conditional inde <b>pendencies</b> and algebraic constraints, first noted by Verma. While conditional independencies are well studied and frequently used in causal induction algorithms, Verma constraints are still poorly understood, and rarely applied. In this paper we examine a special subset of Verma constraints which are easy to understand, easy to identify and easy to apply; they arise from “dormant independencies,” namely, conditional independencies that hold in interventional distributions. We give a complete algorithm for determining if a dormant independence between two sets of variables is entailed by the causal graph, such that this independence is identifiable, in other words if it resides in an interventional distribution that can be predicted without resorting to interventions. We further show the usefulness of dormant independencies in model testing and induction by giving an algorithm that uses constraints entailed by dormant independencies to prune extraneous edges from a given causal graph...|$|R

40|$|Many methodologies {{proposed}} in the literature for modelling and simulating the behavior of critical infrastructures (CIs) in response to disruptive events are based on exhaustive analytic models, require extensive amounts of data and suffer from high computational burden. These factors restrain their applicability in practical policy making pro- cesses, which often require higher flexibility and efficiency {{in the delivery of}} analysis and prediction results. Taking these constraints under consid- eration, in this paper we propose a novel architecture for modeling inter- connected CIs. Our analysis framework is based on a holistic approach which enables to include both intra-sectoral and cross-sectoral interde- <b>pendencies</b> in a consistent and unified manner, based on the concept of functional representation of interdependencies. Based on this modeling approach, we are able to assess the performance of networks of CIs from a resilience point of view.

To that end, we applied the factorial definition of island effects made available by experimental syntax (e. g., Sprouse et al. 2012) to four island types (wh/whether, complex NP, subject, and adjunct), two dependency types (wh-interrogative clause dependencies and relative clause de- <b>pendencies)</b> and two languages (English and Italian). The results of 8 primary experiments suggest that there is indeed variation across dependency types, suggesting that wh-interrogative clause dependencies and relative clause dependencies cannot be identical at every level of analysis; however, the pattern of variation observed in these experiments is not exactly the pattern of variation previously reported in the literature (e. g., Rizzi 1982). We review six major syntactic approaches to the analy- sis of island effects (Subjacency, CED, Barriers, Relativized Minimality, Structure- building, and Phases) and discuss the implications of these results for these analyses. We also present 4 supplemental experiments testing complex wh-phrases (also called D-linked or lexically restricted wh-phrases) for all four island types using the factorial design in order to tease apart the contribution of dependency type from featural specification.

The de- <b>pendencies</b> of the fuselage component drag, such as the bow, fairings exhaust pipes of helicopter, sponsons, and tail sectionof the fuselage, on their form are described in this article. At the second stage the fuselage geometry was created in program SolidWorks.

Developed as a generic planning and scheduling tool, HURON has been used to optimize space mission surface operations. The tool has also been used to analyze lunar architectures for a variety of surface operational scenarios in order to maximize return on investment and productivity. These scenarios include numerous science activities performed by a diverse set of agents: humans, teleoperated rovers, and autonomous rovers. Once given a set of agents, activities, resources, resource constraints, temporal constraints, and de <b>pendencies,</b> HURON computes an optimal schedule that meets a specified goal (e. g., maximum productivity or minimum time), subject to the constraints. HURON performs planning and scheduling optimization as a graph search in state-space with forward progression. Each node in the graph contains a state instance. Starting with the initial node, a graph is automatically constructed with new successive nodes of each new state to explore. The optimization uses a set of pre-conditions and post-conditions to create the children states. The Python language was adopted to not only enable more agile development, but to also allow the domain experts to easily define their optimization models. A graphical user interface was also developed to facilitate real-time search information feedback and interaction by the operator in the search optimization process. The HURON package has many potential uses in the fields of Operations Research and Management Science where this technology applies to many commercial domains requiring optimization to reduce costs. For example, optimizing a fleet of transportation truck routes, aircraft flight scheduling, and other route-planning scenarios involving multiple agent task optimization would all benefit by using HURON...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. New methodologies intended to facilitate system level design and optimization are developed. Specifically, these methodologies allow: (1) development of system level models for the purpose of gathering statistical data on the performance of large systems and performance dependencies on sub-block parameters and (2) the development of system level top-down optimization strategies for hierarchical propagation of optimal sub-block performance specifications. Together, these new methodologies expand the current scope of Design for Quality, allowing statistical design and optimization techniques to be applied early in the product design cycle. In both of these areas, new methodologies, techniques and concepts are presented. In the area of system level modeling, criteria for judging model appropriateness are developed and explained. A new method of system level modeling intended for use in top-down investigations is introduced, exploiting the flexibility and efficiency of behavioral modeling techniques. A complicated IC system (a PLL filter tuning circuit) is thoroughly analyzed and models suited to a variety of analysis methods are developed and tested. Model examples using two behavioral modeling languages, Spectre and MAST, are developed to further demonstrate the validity of the methods introduced. In the area of top-down design, a new methodology suited to system level optimization tasks is introduced. The methodology relies on cost definitions and tolerance assignment originally proposed by M. A. Styblinski and the relevant algorithms developed for the optimal assignment of sub-block performance by A. Achab as a specifications. In addition, the nominal values of sub-block performances are optimized in order to improve the performance of the overall system while reducing sensitivity to sub-block performance variations. Two examples are investigated using the new methodology. The first example is a MOSFET-C bandpass filter, which utilizes macromodels and SPICE analysis to gain insights into the performance de <b>pendencies</b> of the system. The second example uses the models created for the PLL to complete a system level optimization and optimal specification assignment process using models developed and analyzed in the Saber environment. Following the development and verification of the new methodologies, conclusions are drawn, and possibilities for future work in the area are suggested...|$|R
