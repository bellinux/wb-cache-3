5000|$|The <b>push</b> <b>switch</b> marked [...] "Train Stop Override" [...] {{is used to}} pass {{a signal}} at danger with {{authority}} - It ignores the TPWS TSS loops for around 20 seconds or until the loops have been passed, whichever is soonest.|$|E
50|$|There is a TPWS panel {{located in}} each driving cab {{of a train}} or locomotive. The TPWS panel {{comprises}} two indicator lamps and a <b>push</b> <b>switch.</b> There is also a separate TPWS Temporary Isolation Switch which is not shown in the example photograph.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>Push</b> <b>switches</b> are {{designed}} to function as both push to make and <b>push</b> to break <b>switches.</b> For these switches, the wiring of the switch determines whether the switch functions as a push to make or as a <b>push</b> to break <b>switch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Typically {{starters}} are {{operated by}} two <b>push</b> <b>switches,</b> a [...] "start" [...] switch which is normally-off (i.e. push-to-make) and a [...] "stop" [...] switch which is normally-on (i.e. push-to-break).|$|R

50|$|With the {{announcement}} of the Speaker for recording the votes, the Secretary- General presses the button of a key board. Then a gong sounds serving as a signal to members for casting their votes. For casting a vote each member present in the Chamber has to press a switch and then operate one of the three push buttons fixed in his seat. The <b>push</b> <b>switch</b> must be kept pressed simultaneously until the gong sounds for the second time after 10 seconds. There are two Indicator Boards installed in the wall {{on either side of the}} Speaker's Chair in the Chamber. Each vote cast by a member is flashed here. Immediately after the votes are cast, they are totalled mechanically and the details of the results are flashed on the Result Indicator Boards installed in the railings of the Speaker's and Diplomatic Galleries.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1896 and 1909 he {{was granted}} 45 patents {{on a wide}} variety of {{electrical}} productsCompany's product lines had been continuously expanded. Catalogue #17 was published in March 1917 [...] The catalogue had more than 100 pages and listed more than a thousand products. In bulb sockets alone, the Company manufactured 277 different types and sizes. Hubbell's toggle action light switch which incorporated a [...] "quick make or break" [...] feature to meet the rigid requirements of Underwriters' Laboratories (UL) was replacing the former two button type <b>push</b> <b>switch</b> [...] Hubbell designed a [...] "Loxin" [...] mechanism which fit into any standard socket and locked the bulb in place. Falling lightbulbs no longer endangered streetcar passengers, and overly thrifty commuters had to find a new source of replacement bulbs for home use.For the home, the Company developed a system for lighting fixture connections called [...] "Elexit" [...] which allowed the homeowner to install most fixtures without hiring an electrician.|$|E
5000|$|Tabor {{endorsed}} Zion Guitars, {{around the}} time of the recording of Dogman. Phil Keaggy played Zion Guitars earlier. The Zion Ty Tabor Model was a Strat style guitar, with a basswood body and a maple cap. It featured Joe Barden Pickups, a 3 button pickup selector with no tone control. It came only in candy apple red. The neck was maple with a rosewood fingerboard. It featured a relatively new machine head at the time, a gold accented locking model made by Sperzel. Tabor personally signed each guitar. In recent years, Tabor has endorsed Mesa Boogie, Line 6, and Randall amplifiers, as well as Yamaha guitars, including the AES series and his now discontinued signature RGX-TT model. The RGX-TT was an unusual guitar in that it featured a basswood body with a maple center section. On this guitar Tabor use pickups by Seymour Duncan, in the H-S-S fashion. The bridge humbucker could be switched to single coil mode with a <b>push</b> <b>switch.</b> On the [...] "Go Tell Somebody" [...] tour with King's X, Tabor is using the M4 preamp from Egnater and Dean Soltero guitars. In 2008 and through mid-2009 Ty toured with two black Frank Lamara designed/Gene Baker built signature model guitars, with pickup (Motor City Pickups) covers showing an X on one and a V on the other. These symbolized the name of the album King's X were supporting at the time. In 2009, Ty began working with luthier John Guilford to create the Ty Tabor model of Guilford guitars. The Ty Tabor model features a mahogany body, maple neck (inlaid with the stylized X at the 12th fret) and maple fretboard, and two Seymour Duncan P-Rails pickups. The combination allows for tones ranging from traditional single-coil to dual humbucker to P90. Ty has used these guitars extensively on tour in support of XV.|$|E

50|$|In the {{minority}} case of mongo-footed skateboarders, {{the opposite is}} true. Some skateboarders who don't push mongo in their regular stance may still push mongo when riding in switch stance, rather than push with their weaker back foot.

5000|$|Post-flight {{investigation}} {{revealed the}} cable connecting the Left Thrust Lever {{to the engine}} assembly had severed shortly after application of Takeoff power. A procedure in the aircraft's Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) titled [...] "Thrust Lever Jammed" [...] would have directed the pilots {{to shut down the}} left engine by utilizing the Left Engine Fire <b>push</b> <b>switch,</b> which would have closed (among other things) the Fuel SOV (shutoff valve), thus allowing the speed of the aircraft to be better controlled while landing the aircraft. This QRH procedure would have been accomplished [...] "at a safe altitude" [...] per the procedure, while giving consideration to terrain or other obstacles. The pilots did not perform the above procedure, and instead, chose to immediately return to the airport, landing at a higher than normal airspeed due to the left engine still producing takeoff thrust, making it difficult to stop the aircraft and using much greater runway distance than normal. The aircraft was taxied back to the terminal with the left engine still producing takeoff power and the right engine at idle.When the aircraft was brought to a stop at the terminal building, the right engine was shut down by the pilots, the left engine was still operating at takeoff thrust, and the hydraulics were all turned [...] "off", which was common procedure at the time. The aircraft disc brakes on the Canadair CRJ-100 are operated by two of the three hydraulic systems on the aircraft, with System 2 supplied by pumps on the right engine (both mechanical and electric) and System 3 being supplied by two electric pumps. By shutting off the right engine and all of the electric hydraulic systems, the brakes as well as the parking brake were no longer being powered. As the hydraulic pressure bled down and with the left engine still producing takeoff thrust, the aircraft jumped over the chocks, lurched to the right (caused by the left engine thrust), and hit the terminal building. The left engine was eventually shut down by the airport crash tender spraying foam into the engine.|$|E

50|$|Just {{like the}} {{previous}} game, BoxBoxBoy! once again has players controlling Qbby, a box-shaped character who can create boxes {{from out of}} his body. Like before, players use boxes to solve various puzzles, such as climbing on ledges, <b>pushing</b> <b>switches,</b> and avoiding obstacles, {{in order to reach}} the end of each level. This time around, Qbby is able to create two sets of boxes at a time, allowing for more complex puzzle solving. Players can use medals earned from completing levels to unlock costumes, music tracks, and 4-panel comic strips, and unlock additional levels by collecting crowns.|$|R

40|$|Absfrucf: The {{invention}} of the transistor over fifty years ago, and the many advances in power semiconductor devices that followed have rapidly <b>pushed</b> <b>switching</b> power supplies to a ubiquitous presence in today’s electronic world. Improvements in circuits, packaging and other components have also kept pace, helping make power supplies much smaller, cheaper and reliable. These advances are examined in three broad areas, powering architectures, addc rectifiers and dddc converters, {{to set the stage}} for an examination of what the future might bring. By studying some of the fundamental aspects of power-supply technology, and understanding where the applications being powered are headed, we speculate on what advances are needed and delve into how component technologies must develop in the future. Then, based on the demanding needs of powering lowervoltage, higher-current and faster electronics in the future, we offer a power-supply technology roadmap. Our vision is for a future where the necessary advances come by means of much stronger partnerships between power-supply manufacturers, their customers and component suppliers. I...|$|R
40|$|New {{types of}} textile {{products}} – smart textile - {{compliance with the}} requirements of wearability and durability need to be confirmed by tests. To determine the suitability of smart clothes with an integrated textile-based switch with contact - electrodes sewn of conductive threads for wearing the following tests are carried out: 15 washing cycles and 8000 pressure cycles for switches. The purpose of the experiments - to find out how changes electrical and physical properties during the use of the textile-based conductive elements. Results of the tests with textile-based <b>push</b> <b>switches</b> showed that the effect of repeated pressure deformation on the electrical conductivity of switches is insignificant, while washing effect on switches depends on the used material type: for example, electrical resistance of switches with fusible interlinings has increased by 1 - 2. 5 Ω, but for samples without the fusible interlinings - about 9 - 9. 5 Ω. The thickness of switches is affected both by repeated pressure deformation and washing cycles...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{new product}} {{introduction}} requires that product characteristics relate to the customer on functional, emotional, aesthetic and cultural levels. As a part of research into automotive human machine interfaces (HMI), this paper describes holistic customer research carried out to investigate how the haptics of switches in luxury sports utility vehicles (SUVs) are perceived by customers. The application of these techniques, including an initial proposal for objective specifications, is addressed within the broader {{new product introduction}} context, and benefits described. One-hundred and one customers of SUVs assessed the feel of automotive <b>push</b> <b>switches,</b> completing the tasks both in, and out of vehicles to investigate the effect of context. Using the semantic differential technique, hedonic testing, and content analysis of customers’ verbatim comments, a holistic picture has been built up of what influences the haptic experience.
