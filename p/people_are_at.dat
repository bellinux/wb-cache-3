25|$|Thrombosis prevention, {{also known}} as {{thrombosis}} prophylaxis, are treatments to prevent the formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel. Some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a higher risk {{for the formation of}} blood clots than others. Prevention measures or interventions are usually begun after surgery as <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> higher risk due to immobility. There are medication-based interventions and non-medication-based interventions. The risk of developing blood clots can be modified by life style modifications, the discontinuation of oral contraceptives, and weight loss. In those at high risk both interventions are often used. The treatments to prevent the formation of blood clots is balanced against the risk of bleeding.|$|E

Because of this, they should not change or handle cat litter boxes.

According to WHO report, 90% of total global infection is in Africa, 7% in the South-East Asia, and 2% in Eastern Mediterranean. Europe is regarded as malaria-free region. Historically, the parasite and its disease had been most well-known in Europe. But medical programmes, such as insecticide spraying, drug therapy and environmental engineering, since the early 20th century resulted in complete eradication in the 1970s.

25|$|Manet's {{paintings}} of café scenes are observations {{of social life}} in 19th-century Paris. People are depicted drinking beer, listening to music, flirting, reading, or waiting. Many of these paintings were based on sketches executed on the spot. He often visited the Brasserie Reichshoffen on boulevard de Rochechourt, upon which he based At the Cafe in 1878. Several <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> the bar, and one woman confronts the viewer while others wait to be served. Such depictions represent the painted journal of a flâneur. These are painted in a style which is loose, referencing Hals and Velázquez, yet they capture the mood and feeling of Parisian night life.

500|$|The opening Volume {{introduces}} the series' leads, Alana and Marko, two lovers from different worlds whose <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> war with one another. Alana {{comes from the}} technologically advanced Landfall Coalition, so named after Landfall, the largest planet in the galaxy, and Marko is from Wreath, Landfall's only satellite, whose people wield magic. Because the destruction {{of one of the}} worlds would send the other spinning out of orbit, the war was [...] "outsourced" [...] to other worlds. Although peace was restored on the two home worlds, the conflict spread across all the other known planets, whose native species were forced to choose a side. As Landfall and Wreath were on opposite sides, Alana and Marko met when she was assigned to guard him in a prison on the planet Cleave after he became a prisoner of war. They escaped together twelve hours after meeting. In the beginning of the series' first issue, Alana gives birth to their daughter, Hazel, who occasionally narrates the series. Their respective people are incredulous when it is suggested that they have voluntarily mated and they are pursued by both the Wreathers and the Landfallians, both because of the perceived betrayal of the two fugitives and to prevent knowledge of their pairing from spreading and damaging morale among their troops. On Landfall, Prince Robot IV is assigned by his father to capture him and comes into conflict with his counterpart from Wreath, a mercenary named The Will. The ghost of a dead girl named Izabel is bonded to Hazel and the four of them escape Cleave before being joined by Marko's parents.|$|E

In 1996, a controlled study of 64 heterosexual men (half said they were homophobic by experience, with self-reported orientation) at the University of Georgia found that men who were found to be homophobic (as measured by the Index of Homophobia) were considerably more likely to experience more erectile responses when exposed to homoerotic images than non-homophobic men. Another study in 2012 arrived at similar results when researchers found that students who came from [...] "the most rigid anti-gay homes" [...] were most likely to reveal repressed homosexual attraction.
