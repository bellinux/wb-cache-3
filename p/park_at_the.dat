5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car <b>park</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site.

Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the routing through Muskegon was altered. Instead of {{terminating}} in the <b>park</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> outlet of Muskegon Lake into Lake Michigan, M-46 was routed {{to follow}} US16 to the car ferry docks. The last section of gravel highway was also paved in Newaygo County near the Montcalm County line. The routing of M-46 between Casnovia and Howard City was altered in 1973 when the US131 freeway was opened north of Cedar Springs by then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. M-46 was restored to the Kent City–Cedar Springs roadway it used in the 1930s and routed concurrently along US131 again.|$|E
5|$|Collyer Monument is an {{historic}} monument to firefighters in Mineral Spring <b>Park,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corner of Mineral Spring Avenue and Main Street, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, United States.

The life-size bronze sculpture stands atop a pedestal of Westerly granite which contains a bronze plaque showing the fatal accident and the reverse bears the inscription. The Collyer Monument represents a significant example of monumental work of the period and an early example of local civic pride. The monument {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} for demolition, in late 1995, the councillors {{of the newly}} formed City of Perth had a feasibility study carried out into whether Council House could be refurbished. This feasibility study {{was carried out by}} Architects Cox Howlett and Bailey, of which one of the partners was the son of original designer Jeffrey Howlett, and cost $100,000. The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an underground car <b>park</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the site. The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact that interest rates at the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent. At the time, the refurbishment was expected to cost around $26 million.|$|E

5|$|Dueling Dragons {{was one of}} Islands of Adventure {{original}} attractions, {{opening with}} the theme park on May 28, 1999, in The Lost Continent area of the <b>park.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, {{it was the only}} fully inverted dueling roller coaster in the world. The ride was themed to two dueling dragons. The queue was decorated to be a ruined castle that the two dragons destroyed, once the riders got to the station. They got to chose between which of the two coasters they would like to experience. The blue coaster was named Ice and the other Red coaster was named Fire.|$|E
5|$|During data {{collection}} for The Banksia Atlas project, a single presumed natural hybrid between B.prionotes and B.lindleyana (porcupine banksia), with fruit like B.lindleyana but leaves intermediate {{between the two}} parents, was found north of Kalbarri National <b>Park.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time this was considered an important discovery, as the parent species were thought not to be closely related. Mast's analyses, however, place them both in a clade of eight species, though B.lindleyana remains less closely related to B.prionotes than B.hookeriana. Hybrids of B.prionotes with B.menziesii (firewood banksia) have also been produced by artificial means, and presumed natural hybrids have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Expedition Everest — Legend of the Forbidden Mountain is a steel {{roller coaster}} built by Vekoma at Disney's Animal Kingdom theme <b>park</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.
