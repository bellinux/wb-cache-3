5|$|His {{political}} {{projects were}} put on hold, and Caragiale instead concentrated his energy on obtaining the French Légion d'honneur order, eventually becoming one of its Chevaliers in December 1929. The Romanian author himself noted that this had been made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> intercession of François Lebrun, the Bucharest correspondent of Le Matin newspaper, whom he considered a personal friend.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> motion of dislocations.|$|E
5|$|Perl {{poetry is}} the {{practice}} of writing poems that can be compiled as legal Perl code, for example the piece known as Black Perl.

5|$|Preservation of most {{specimens}} {{was made}} <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fast sedimentation that quickly cut the organism off from seawater; {{it may also}} have been enhanced by the decay products of the rotting organism, which could have helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by the organism may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily {{to play a role in}} binding sediment together.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has {{reached the end of}} one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E
5|$|Some of Van Rensselaer's {{success as}} a jewel {{merchant}} came about due to trade made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dutch East India Company.

During the Twelve Years' Truce, Dutch merchants had sailed unmolested to the West Indies but also received no letters of marque to take prizes from the enemy.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Switzerland under Roman rule was, from the Augustan period up until 260AD, {{a time of}} {{exceptional}} peace and prosperity. The Pax Romana was made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> protection of well-defended and distant Imperial borders and a peaceful and smooth Romanization of the local population. The Romans urbanized the territory with numerous settlements and built a network of high-quality Roman roads connecting them, allowing for the integration of Helvetia into the imperial economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the U.S. state of Minnesota is shaped by its {{original}} Native American residents, European exploration and settlement, {{and the emergence of}} industries made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state's natural resources. Minnesota achieved prominence through fur trading, logging, and farming, and later through railroads, and iron mining. While those industries remain important, the state's economy is now driven by banking, computers, and health care.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{success of}} flex {{vehicles}} was made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> existence of 33,000 filling stations {{with at least}} one ethanol pump available by 2006, a heritage of the early Pró-Álcool ethanol program. These facts, together with the mandatory use of E25 blend of gasoline throughout the country, allowed Brazil in 2008 to achieve more than 50% of fuel consumption in the gasoline market from sugar cane-based ethanol.|$|E

30|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) studies are largely limited by statistical noise caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{relatively small number}} of recorded events, and the uncertainty in the location of these events due to limited timing resolution.

Further significant increases in effective sensitivity also are <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> increasing <b>the</b> time-of-flight resolution.|$|R

5|$|Yarrell {{was aware}} of earlier bird handbooks, {{especially}} Bewick's. A History of British Birds used the same title as Bewick's popular book (1797–1804). Its approach, however, was significantly different in the extensiveness of Yarrell's correspondence and in the increased emphasis on scientific accuracy made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rapid advance in ornithological knowledge in the nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E

5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which was made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, {{reducing the number of}} boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E
5|$|After Manzikert, {{a partial}} {{recovery}} (referred {{to as the}} Komnenian restoration) was made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Komnenian dynasty. The first Komnenian emperor was Isaac I (1057–1059), after which the Doukas dynasty held power (1059–81). The Komnenoi attained power again under Alexios I in 1081. From the outset of his reign, Alexios faced a formidable attack by the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemund of Taranto, who captured Dyrrhachium and Corfu, and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly. Robert Guiscard's death in 1085 temporarily eased the Norman problem. The following year, the Seljuq sultan died, and the sultanate was split by internal rivalries. By his own efforts, Alexios defeated the Pechenegs; they were caught by surprise and annihilated at the Battle of Levounion on 28 April 1091.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1852, land speculators {{laid out}} streets and {{commercial}} plots surrounding the new station. Industry, made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> railroad connections to major cities, soon arrived: a plow company in 1850, a tannery in 1854, and an iron foundry soon after. The city of Ayer, named after Groton-born James Cook Ayer, was incorporated from parts of Groton and Shirley in 1871; the railroad station was then renamed Ayer Junction. The station received a small expansion that year, and a covered island platform was built between the W tracks. The roof was rebuilt with new trusses; the former iron supporting pillars {{were used to}} construct the upper story of the nearby Spaulding Block.|$|E
