50|$|Ports are {{passages}} that allow fluid {{to pass through}} the valve. Ports are obstructed by the valve member or disc to control flow. Valves most commonly have 2 ports, but may have as many as 20.

When a message crosses the address space boundary and is sent through an external device (a <b>pipe</b> <b>or</b> a network <b>connection),</b> it is marshalled and written by its sender and unmarshalled by its receiver using a system-wide network format: the message size (in bytes) is written first, the encoded message type follows, and actual message bytes are written last.|$|R

In solving the piping problem in a region, a pipe network system model for the distribution of raw water which includes hydraulic equations for closed channels is required.
