The British Petroleum chemical works at Saltend uses condensates from the gas refining process and is a major employer in the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of a suitable catalyst {{is also an important}} factor in deciding whether to build an alkylation plant. If sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is used, significant volumes are needed. Access to a suitable plant is required for the supply of fresh acid and the disposition of spent acid. If a sulfuric acid plant must be constructed specifically to support an alkylation unit, such construction will {{have a significant impact on}} both the initial requirements for capital and ongoing costs of operation. Alternatively it is possible to install a WSA Process unit to regenerate the spent acid. No drying of the gas takes place. This means that there will be no loss of acid, no acidic waste material and no heat is lost in <b>process</b> <b>gas</b> reheating. The selective condensation in the WSA condenser ensures that the regenerated fresh acid will be 98% weight, even with the humid <b>process</b> <b>gas.</b> It is possible to combine spent acid regeneration with disposal of hydrogen sulfide by using the hydrogen sulfide as a fuel.|$|E
