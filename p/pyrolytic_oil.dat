50|$|Pyrolysis oil, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as biocrude or biooil, is a synthetic fuel under investigation as substitute for petroleum. It is obtained by heating dried biomass without oxygen in a reactor at a temperature of about 500 °C with subsequent cooling. <b>Pyrolytic</b> <b>oil</b> (or bio-oil) {{is a kind of}} tar and normally contains levels of oxygen too high to be considered a hydrocarbon. This high oxygen content results in non-volatility, corrosiveness, immiscibity with fossil fuels, thermal instability, and a tendency to polymerize when exposed to air. As such, it is distinctly different from petroleum products. Removing oxygen from biooil or nitrogen from algal biooil is called upgrading.|$|E

Two hierarchical mesoporous zeolites were synthesized by desilication of microporous zeolite using 0. 2 and 0. 3 M solution of sodium hydroxide. Upgrading over microporous zeolite produced 16. 0 wt% solid, 27. 2 wt% organic phase and 23. 9 wt% aqueous phase liquid while modified zeolites produced 21 – 42 % less solid and 15 – 16 % higher organic phase liquid. Higher degree of deoxygenation of <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>oil</b> was achieved with the modified zeolites. Analysis of organic phase collected after catalytic upgrading revealed high transformation of oxygenates into valuable products. Bulk zeolite produced cyclic olefins and polyaromatic hydrocarbons while mesoporous zeolites were selective toward cycloalkanes and alkylated monoaromatic production, with significant reduction in the production of polyaromatic hydrocarbon. Result of gas analysis showed that hierarchical mesoporous zeolite favored decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions compared to the parent zeolite, which promoted dehydration reaction.

Power generation using this technology is essentially the use of <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>oils</b> for the gas turbine integrated into a combined cycle. Using this process has an inherent advantage of potentially decoupling of the fuel-generation from the power- generation site. A comparative study of this technology for power generation, with other technologies is made to determine its economic viability.

It is found that the biomass prices have a strong influence in the economics, and using pyrolysis for power generation would be a more favored route than others at higher biomass prices.

30|$|Density is {{the weight}} {{occupied}} by a substance per unit volume; it is a property which determines the injection and ignition quality of a fuel [24]. The density of the thermal cracking liquid product obtained {{in this study is}} 1.060  g/ml, while that of kaolin catalytic cracking process is 0.800  g/ml. Thus, the density of the liquid product from thermal cracking process is higher than that of the catalytic process. This is expected as the liquid product obtained from kaolin catalytic cracking is light and wax free. On comparing with gasoline with a reported density range of 0.72 – 0.78  g/ml and diesel oil with density range of 0.82 – 0.90  g/ml, the kaolin catalytic liquid product density is between the reported density ranges of gasoline and diesel. The thermal cracking oil product density is absolutely out of gasoline and diesel oil density ranges as it is heavier than both of them. The two liquid product densities from these studies indicate that there are more breaking of the polypropylene C–C covalent bonds to a remarkable extent during the catalytic cracking than during thermal cracking as secondary cracking is facilitated by the use of kaolin as a catalyst. The density of the catalytic pyrolytic liquid obtained is comparable to that of other pyrolytic oils reported: HDPE <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>oil</b> has 0.801  g/ml as density [25], LDPE <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>oil</b> was reported to have 0.815  g/ml as density [9], and PP <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>oil</b> has density of 0.778  g/ml as reported by Panda and Singh [16]. The very little variation can be due to differences in pyrolysis condition, catalyst used, differences in polymeric material, and differences in the method of evaluation. The density of the liquid product obtained from kaolin catalyzed pyrolysis in this study suggests that it can be suitable for use as fuel, while that of thermal cracking might not be suitable.|$|E

Pyrolysis of HDPE waste products was investigated using both thermal and catalytic cracking techniques using packed bed reactor with bed materials, including sand, cement and white clay in the presence of catalysts sodium hydroxide, HUSY and HBeta zeolite, under an inert atmosphere at 450  °C. The reactor beds significantly altered the yield as well as the product composition with yield of 82 % liquid over a cement powder bed with narrowing of product distribution using the zeolitic catalysts [5]. Catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using metal oxides (Fe 2 O 3, CoO, ZnO, MnO 2 and NiO) impregnated waste brick kiln dust to obtain petro-fuels like oil. ZnO-impregnated catalyst was found to be highly active in terms of oil quality and yield [6]. Synergistic interactions of calcium oxide (CaO) or calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) and a steam atmosphere were studied in the thermal decomposition of individual and mixed plastics (PE, PP, PS and PET) at 600  °C. The presence of steam with CaO facilitated the PE, PP and mixed plastic cracking while decreasing the PS cracking process [7]. Miandad et al. studied the two-step pyrolysis (thermal followed by catalytic) of high-density polyethylene using mixture of MCM 41 and ZSM- 5 as catalyst for producing oil. Mixture of equal amount of both the catalysts with plastic and catalyst ratio of 1 : 2 yielded highest 83 % oil containing aromatic hydrocarbons with a few aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds [8]. The presence of Fe-PILC among a series of modified pillared clays as catalyst in the pyrolysis of mixed plastics enhanced the oil yields with about 80 % selectivity for diesel fraction and high yield of H 2 gas owing to moderate acidity, high surface area and uniform distribution of iron oxide over montmorillonite support [9].

Both acid- and alkaline-treated ZSM- 5 zeolite were used as a catalyst for the pyrolysis of PP:PE mixture at 450  °C for 30  min. Alkaline-treated catalyst yielded higher lighter fractions composed of olefins, alkylbenzenes and naphthalenes with the predominance of olefins [12].

Chemical analysis by GC-MS showed a significant pollution by PAHs in Urdaibai sediment samples, mainly from pyrolytic sources, with minor contributions from oil spills. Measurement of the dioxin-like activity using a yeast-based bioassay showed an excess of biological activity in sediment samples from the inner part of the estuary. Analysis of PAH metabolites in bile of thicklip grey mullet () showed a large excess of 2 -naphthol over 1 -naphthol or 1 -pyrenol, suggesting a specific contamination in the inner Urdaibai estuary by some industrial process. Therefore, the combination of these three techniques defined different PAH pollution sources in Urdaibai: A major <b>pyrolytic</b> origin, occasional <b>oil</b> spills, and specific industrial activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaporation}} of {{pyrolysis oil}} was studied at varying heating rates (∼ 1 – 106 °C/min) with surrounding temperatures up to 850 °C. A total product distribution (gas, vapor, and char) {{was measured using}} two atomizers with different droplet sizes. It was shown that with very high heating rates (∼ 106 °C/min) the amount of char was significantly lowered (∼ 8 %, carbon basis) compared to the maximum amount, which was produced at low heating rates using a TGA (∼ 30 %, carbon basis; heating rate 1 °C/min). The char formation {{takes place in the}} 100 – 350 °C liquid temperature range due to polymerization reactions of compounds in the pyrolysis oil. All pyrolysis oil fractions (whole <b>oil,</b> <b>pyrolytic</b> lignin, glucose and aqueous rich/lean phase) showed charring behavior. The pyrolysis oil chars age when subjected to elevated temperatures (≥ 700 °C), show similar reactivity toward combustion and steam gasification compared with chars produced during fast pyrolysis of solid biomass. However, the structure is totally different where the pyrolysis oil char is very light and fluffy. To use the produced char in conversion processes (energy or syngas production), {{it will have to be}} anchored to a carrie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are formed during the pyrolysis of scrap tyres to produce tyre <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>oil</b> (TPO). Due to carcinogenic, mutagenic, and toxic properties PAHs are priority pollutants. Hence {{it is essential}} to remove PAHs from TPO before utilising TPO as a petroleum fuel alternative (to run the engine). Agricultural wastes have promising future to be utilized as biosorbent due to their cost effectiveness, abundant availability, high biosorption capacity and renewability. Various low cost adsorbents were prepared from natural sources. Uptake of PAHs present in tyre <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>oil</b> was investigated using various low-cost adsorbents of natural origin including sawdust (shisham), coconut fiber, neem bark, chitin, activated charcoal. Adsorption experiments of different PAHs viz. naphthalene, acenaphthalene, biphenyl and anthracene have been carried out at ambient temperature (25 °C) and at pH 7. It was observed that for any given PAH, the adsorption capacity increases with the lignin content. Freundlich constant Kf and 1 /n have been evaluated and {{it was found that the}} adsorption isotherms of PAHs were in agreement with a Freundlich model, while the uptake capacity of PAHs followed the order: activated charcoal> saw dust (shisham) > coconut fiber> chitin. The partition coefficients in acetone-water, and the adsorption constants at equilibrium, could be linearly correlated with octanol–water partition coefficients. It is observed that natural adsorbents are good alternative for PAHs removal. Sawdust of Dalbergia sissoo, a by-product of sawmills was found to be a promising adsorbent for the removal of PAHs present in TPO. It is observed that adsorbents studied were comparable to those of some conventional adsorbents. Keywords—Acenaphthene, anthracene, biphenyl, Coconut fiber...|$|E
40|$|A 250 dm 3 {{pyrolysis}} reactor was designed, fabricated {{and tested}} for performance. The feedstock for the reactor was 12 kg dried household refuse (a mixture of food waste, fruits/vegetable, paper, plastic and textile materials). The experiment was replicated four times each {{with the same}} percentages of waste components in the household refuse. The experiments were performed between 5000 C and 6500 C. A waste volume reduction of about 65 % on the average was achieved after the experiments and <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>oil</b> of between 5. 27 kg and 6. 85 kg was obtained. The residues obtained were mainly char (25 %) which showed that the process has a potential {{for the treatment of}} municipal solid waste and is a good technology for resource recovery...|$|E
40|$|A {{sample of}} <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>oil</b> (condenser oil – project B- 469) was vacuum {{distilled}} at 30 °C/ 14. 5 mm - 188 °C/ 19. 0 mm. The distillate (25 - 1) was studied by gas chromatography to establish optimum conditions and apparatus {{performance for the}} separation of the components of the distillate. This was achieved by using a 62 ̆ 7 x 1 / 42 ̆ 2 SE- 30 column. The peaks were identified by using a combined gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric technique. The identification of peaks was also aided by noting enhancement of peak size when known materials were chromatographed with the mixture. After the components of the mixture were known, a quantitative gas chromatographic analysis procedure was developed...|$|E
40|$|A highly stable {{biological}} {{film was}} prepared by casting an aqueous dispersion of protein and composite hydrogel {{obtained from the}} polysaccharide Scleroglucan (Sclg) and borax as a cross-linking agent. Heme proteins, such as hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin (Mb), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP),were chosen as model proteins to investigate the immobilized system. A pair of well-defined quasi-reversible redox peaks, characteristics Of the protein heme Fe(II) /Fe(III) redox couples, were obtained at the Sclg-borax/proteins films <b>oil</b> <b>pyrolytic</b> graphite (PG) electrodes, {{as a consequence of}} the direct electron transfer between the protein and the PG electrode. A full characterization of the electron transfer kinetic was performed by opportunely modeling data obtained from cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry experiments. The efficiency or our cross-linking approach was investigated by studying the influence of different borax groups percentage in the Sclg matrix, revealing the versatility of this hydrogel in the immobilization of redox proteins. The native conformation of the three heme proteins entrapped in the hydrogel films were proved to be unchanged, reflected by the unaltered Soret adsorption band and by the catalytic activity toward hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)). The main kinetic parameters, such its the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant, for the electrocatalytic reaction were also evaluated. The peculiar characteristics of Sclg-borax matrix make it possible to find wide opportunities as proteins immobilizing agent for studies of direct electrochemistry and biosensors development...|$|R
40|$|Background: The LTC {{process is}} a {{technique}} that consists of heating solid residues at a temperature of 380 oC - 420 oC in an inert atmosphere and their products are evaluated individually: these products include pyrolysis <b>oil,</b> <b>pyrolytic</b> char, gas and water. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the effects of the use of oils obtained by pyrolysis of Jatropha curcas as an additive for diesel in different proportions. Results: A Low Temperature Conversion (LTC) process carried out on samples of Jatropha curcas fruit and generated pyrolysis oil, pyrolyic char, gas and aqueous fractions in relative amounts of 23, 37, 16 and 14 % [w/w] respectively for Jatropha curcas fruit and 19, 47, 12 and 22 % [w/w] respectively for Jatropha curcas cake. The oil fractions were analyzed by FTIR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, GCMS and physicochemical analysis. The pyrolysis oil was added to final concentrations of 2, 5, 10 and 20 % [w/w] to commercial diesel fuel. The density, viscosity, sulfur content and flash point of the mixtures were determined. Conclusions: The results indicated that the addition of the pyrolysis oil maintained the mixtures within the standards of the diesel directive, National Petroleum Agency (ANP no 15, of 19. 7. 2006), with the exception of the viscosity of the mixtures containing 20 % pyrolysis oil...|$|R
