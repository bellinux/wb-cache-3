25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets {{has given me}} the most pleasure...I no longer stop to think. My answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a <b>point.</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> was not over the hill as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a good delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E
500|$|In {{the midst}} of the lengthy world tour {{supporting}} 1995's multi-platinum Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Chamberlin's father died, and his substance abuse hit a fever pitch. Of this period, Chamberlin later said, [...] "I learned that escapism was better than emotion, and that's where I hid... It got to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really didn't care. Life was scary for me." [...] Prior to shows scheduled July '96 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Chamberlin and touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin overdosed on heroin; Melvoin subsequently died, and Chamberlin was kicked out of the band, ostensibly to protect his health.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{appreciate}} {{other kinds}} of drummers who play differently, but it's not my style or what works for this band. I get [...] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I {{realize that this is}} what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [...] plays so well at this <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E
50|$|Judge Mijović filed a concurring opinion, <b>pointing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{consider}} self-identification {{primarily as}} a matter of personal perception rather than a matter based on objective grounds, and <b>that</b> is why <b>I</b> do not share the Chamber's reasoning in the judgment.|$|R
40|$|Dr Nair’s {{letter to}} the editor {{regarding}} the failed nerve blocks mentioned in our paper, “Comparison of the supraclavicular, infraclavicular and axillary approaches for ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block for surgical anesthesia”, raised several <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe are worth looking at in more detail...|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was {{directed}} by Ray Kay and filmed inside a basement in Los Angeles, California. On March 17, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account, [...] "Day 1 of the #TTWE Videoshoot. Just wrapped my first big dance number. Taking a well deserved break people!" [...] She also tweeted {{a picture of her}} on set, wearing ripped tights, a Burberry Prorsum studded leather jacket and matching fingerless leather gloves. The making-of was chronicled on the special Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale, which aired on MTV on April 3, 2011, at 21:00 EST (02:00 UTC). In the special, Spears is seen watching the playback, as she later explained, [...] " [...] just to make sure it's right and that the costume looks right and the dancers are together and we all look in unison. It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing." [...] Spears said that she did not feel the need to top herself, saying that [...] "I've made so many videos that I'm at the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> genuinely want to enjoy myself, and I have such a good team of people with me. [...] I had never worked with Ray Kay before. I was really happy with the work we did." [...] The video was choreographed by Brian Friedman. On April 4, 2011, it was announced that two different versions of the music video would be released, a director's cut and a choreography cut. The same day, Spears tweeted a 30-second preview of the video, announcing, [...] "#TillTheWorldEnds video premieres THIS Wednesday on VEVO. Cant wait to share it with you guys!" [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] became at the Spears second VEVOcertified music video on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|Although Brach {{began writing}} the {{screenplay}} in late 1981, Annaud took on another project, that of directing a film adaptation of Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose. Between preparing for and filming his next film, Annaud traveled and visited zoos {{in order to}} research animal behavior. In an interview he later gave with the American Humane Association, Annaud stated: [...] "Each time I was fascinated with the tigers, to a <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought to do a movie called The Tiger instead of The Bear. In those days I felt that the bear, because they're so often vertical, {{would give me a}} better identification, or would provide more instant identification from the viewers." [...] The finished script was presented to Berri in early 1983.|$|E
2500|$|On January 2, 2007, Beck said on {{his radio}} program that Ellison did not take offense at the {{comments}} and the two had a friendly chat off the air. On January 9, 2007, at the Television Critics Association's semiannual press tour, Beck said it was [...] "Quite possibly the poorest-worded question of all time." [...] He clarified by saying, [...] "My point to Keith Ellison... is the same <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> make to my own faith, and that is — you must stand up before things {{get out of control}} ... And it's important for people of all faiths, when someone is hijacking their religion, to stand and say, 'That is not what we do. That is not who we are."' ...|$|E
40|$|The {{consideration}} of multiple forest values and products {{is critical to}} the future of production forestry, both in planted and less intensively managed systems. I will make only five <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe are important to consider during a debate about productivity and biodiversity trade-offs in such managed forest systems...|$|R
5000|$|It {{depends on}} what one means by the Washington Consensus. If one means the ten <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> tried to outline, then clearly it's not right. If one uses the {{interpretation}} {{that a number of}} people—including Joe Stiglitz, most prominently—have foisted on it, that it is a neoliberal tract, then I think it is right.|$|R

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Burroughs High School in 1990, he began {{playing in a}} band called of All Things he formed with two friends, {{covering}} songs by Descendents, Social Distortion and Bad Religion, as well as writing original punk numbers. The group primarily performed at friend's parties and bonfires, and once played Oasis, the local music venue. Hoppus left Ridgecrest in summer 1992 to attend college {{and get a job}} at a local music store in San Diego. Hoppus continued playing gigs with of All Things, returning on weekends. Eventually, Hoppus' manager became suspicious of his weekend activities (Hoppus having told him he worked with mentally disabled children in Ridgecrest) and refused any time off on weekends. His [...] "short lived attempt" [...] at college, studying at California State University, San Marcos, revolved around plans to become an English teacher. He recalls he [...] "hated" [...] college and his reasoning behind becoming a teacher involved sights set for educational reform. He dropped out in the early 1990s after [...] "things began to take off with Blink-182" [...] and lived with his mother for many of {{the early years of the}} band. Hoppus describes his mother as always supportive in his decisions to drop out of college and tour with Blink-182; however, he describes his father as [...] "more realistic, [...] he said, 'Have something to fall back on.'" [...] "I'm really fortunate that my mom always completely supported me, even to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> dropped out of college and lived at her house for five years before our band started to catch on," [...] said Hoppus.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I say it--but hasn't {{my whole}} <b>point</b> been <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't ask you to. Therefore," [...] she demanded--but {{smiling at him}} now-- [...] "where's the logic?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Trafford {{was quite}} right. The <b>point</b> is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> took {{a part in}} {{locating}} two of the claims. Before <b>that</b> <b>I</b> followed a good many rough occupations, mostly in the bush. My prosperity's recent." ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} relationship between Christianity and other religions, the main concern being the search for truth and mutual understanding between religions. This is a very large area of study, and I do not presume to provide a complete picture of all aspects of the problem, but will restrict it to the specific <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know, i. e. revelation and salvation in other religions. The relationship between Christianity and other world religions has become a topic of discussion among theologians and those Protestants of other denominations. For comparative religious studies, this thesis should be the subject of lively debate in the sphere of theological research. (Translation) ...|$|R

5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} song's history, Wilkinson said the following:"I wrote three {{different}} versions of the song,” he says. “I took everything out rebuilt it. Like fitting a house, I guess. Stripped it all out, started again and wrote a whole new tune. Three times. It started to make me realise the elements I actually liked. When you’re too deep into a track you don’t realise which components are really working. So stripping it back and adding them back in gradually made me realise the key <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> like. I played with the structure and went in deeper for the more chilled, liquid roller vibe that it is today." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{found all}} this very uncomfortable, {{and tried to}} turn the talk back to a <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt curious about: [...] "But in Altruria, if the {{literary}} class is not exempt from the rule of manual labor, where do they find time and strength to write?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite the album's huge success, Gotye {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone Australia that he initially battled with indecision and depression while making the album, which in turn became the subject matter of songs like [...] "Smoke and Mirrors" [...] (with a central theme of impostor syndrome) and [...] "Save Me". He stated: [...] "There were <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought I wouldn't be able to finish a record I was really into or that I'd give up at some stage." ...|$|R
