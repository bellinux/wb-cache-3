40|$|Chitosans are {{a diverse}} group of biopolymers, which are widely used in {{different}} fields of application for years. They are appreciated and used especially because of their antimicrobial effects combined with their biocompatible properties. However, details of the correlation between their physical-chemical characteristics and biological effects (e. g. antimicrobial effect) have not been fully understood yet. In the following thesis the antimicrobial properties were examined with mold fungi as well as with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the biocompatibility was proven with a plant assay and the physical-chemical properties of chitosan were systematically investigated. The results of the investigations on mold fungi and bacteria allow the conclusion that chitosan has no antifungal capacities. Furthermore the mold fungi are able to use the chitosan as carbon resource. Certainly, chitosans operated as an inhibitor to the group of bacteria. They acted biostatical and bactericide, which led to a structural membrane damage of E. coli. However, there was no indication of a different effect on gram-positive bacteria compared to gram-negative bacteria. The effect of chitosans is presumably more affected by bacteria and their adaptation to the environment rather than by the composition of the membrane structure. It was shown that the marine gram-negative bacteria V. fischeri was less affected in the occurrence of luminescent than the bacteria E. coli (gram-negative) and B. subtilis (gram-positive) in their dehydrogenase activity. The biocompatibility is guaranteed unrestricted as long as the pH is neutral to alkaline. Chitosans will form micelles or aggregates under these pH conditions, which significantly reduces their bioavailability. Effects in eukaryotic test systems under acetic pH conditions demonstrated, that the chitosan significantly disturbed the growth of the plant L. minor. Additionally, no growth recovery was observed even several weeks after the treatment. No influence of the molecular weight of the Chitosans on inhibition effects could be found for the correlation of the physical-chemical properties with all EC values over all experiments. On the other hand it could be shown that the degree of acetylation (and additionally combined with the amount of acetylated units) and the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> might influence the impact of chitosan on biological effects. A low degree of acetylation or a low-numbered <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> inhibited the growth of bacteria most clearly, whereas a high degree of acetylation or a high-numbered <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> inhibited the growth of L. minor most effectively. Complete biocompatibility can probably be achieved by adaption of these characteristics of chitosan...|$|E
40|$|The {{biopolymer}} chitosan {{has shown}} {{great potential for}} {{a tremendous number of}} applications despite the fact that typical chitosan preparations are always mixtures of different chemical entities, natural impurities and process-induced impurities. However, chitosan preparations described in the literature or offered on the market are analytically highly undefined. Here we propose a T-SAR (thinking in terms of structure-activity-relationships) guided multi-dimensional analysis of distinct chitosan preparations with the aim a) to obtain the information needed for the production of reproducible chitosan preparations and b) to predict biological effects and technological properties of certain chitosan preparations. First, a physico-chemical description (molecular weight (M-W), polydispersity (M-W/M-N), fraction of acetylation (F-A), <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> (P-A), hydrodynamic radius (R-h), intrinsic viscosity ([eta])) of six selected samples was done. Furthermore chitosan properties like solubility, crystallinity, conformation (Mark-Houwink-plot) and impurities of all the chitosan preparations from different origins were determined and biological effects were also analyzed using test systems with two different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Vibrio fischeri). It was found that the presence of HCl enabled the water solubility of chitosan, while chloride-free chitosan was only soluble in acetic acid. The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> P-A showed no impact on this behavior. The analyzed biological effects revealed growth inhibition within 30 minutes for E. coli and a decreased bioluminescence for V. fisheri (IC 50 = 0. 035 w%). Thus, the strategy to check biological effects within a multi-dimensional analysis kit proved to be effective for detecting general structure-property-relationships of chitosan in relation to its biological effects...|$|E

The activation of the ERK/MAPK cascade was seen in mice after the introduction of a new taste, the cascade was shown to be necessary for the memory of the taste to be formed. The proposed mechanism for how this cascade works is that MAPK regulates histone acetylation and subsequent chromatin remodeling by means of downstream effectors, such as the CREB binding protein (which has HAT activity).

40|$|The {{biopolymer}} chitosan {{has shown}} a great potential for {{a tremendous number of}} applications despite the fact that typical chitosan preparations are always mixtures of different chemical entities, natural impurities and process-induced impurities. Chitosan preparations described in the literature or offered on the market are analytically highly undefined which prevents a detailed structure-activity-relationship (SAR) analysis. The aim of this thesis is to accomplish the prerequisites necessary for a sophisticated study of the polymers chitin/chitosan. Within this thesis a SAR guided multi-dimensional analysis is proposed including a physicochemical description (molecular weight (MW), polydispersity (MW/MN), fraction of acetylation (FA), and determination of the purity content combined to biological effects on two different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Vibrio fischeri). Results are obtained by methods such as triple detection size-exclusion chromatography (refractive index, light scattering (90 ° and 7 °), viscometry), inhibition assays and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, an improved method to determine the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> PA from heterogeneously as well as homogeneously prepared chitosan is shown. No link between the different production processes and the formation of a specific <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> was found. For all investigated sample a random-dominated pattern was found. The obtained PA values include also calculated inter-day and inter-analyst variations of the carbon nuclear magnetic resonance technique (13 C-NMR). The conformational analysis of chitosan, again achieved with the triple detection SEC, revealed an interesting behavior. Using different theoretical models (Benoit-Doty, Odijk-Houwart, Bohdanecky) different Kuhn segment lengths (lK) were found for the two different samples. While the first approached linear chain behavior, the second showed similarity to dextran, a branched polysaccharide. Dissolution studies on chitin and chitosan showed positive results in 18 cases (chitosan) and 6 cases (chitin), respectively, by testing 58 different ionic liquid samples in total. In case of chitin, ionic liquids may be promising candidates for future dissolution studies of this biopolymer. However, chitin behaves completely different in dissolution assays than its relative cellulose which may based on three different dissolution mechanism each for chitosan, chitin and cellulose, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{nature of}} chitin and chitosan, which influences the biomedical activity of these compounds, is {{strongly related to}} the source of chitin and the conditions of the chitin/chitosan production process. Apart from widely described key factors such as weight-averaged molecular weight (MW) and degree of N-acetylation (DA), other physicochemical parameters like polydispersity (MW/MN), crystallinity or the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> (PA) have to be taken into consideration. From the biological point of view, these parameters affect a very important factor—the solubility of chitin and chitosan in water and organic solvents. The physicochemical properties of chitosan solutions can be controlled by manipulating solution conditions (temperature, pH, ionic strength, concentration, solvent). The degree of substitution of the hydroxyl and the amino groups or the degree of quaternization of the amino groups also influence the mechanical and biological properties of chitosan samples. Finally, a considerable research effort has been directed towards developing safe and efficient chitin/chitosan-based products because many factors, like the size of nanoparticles, can determine the biomedical characteristics of medicinal products. The influence of these factors on the biomedical activity of chitin/chitosan-based products is presented in this report in more detail...|$|E
40|$|Chitin and {{chitosan}} oligomers have diverse biological {{activities with}} potentially valuable applications in fields like medicine, cosmetics, or agriculture. These properties may depend {{not only on}} the degrees of polymerization and acetylation, but also on a specific <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> (PA) that cannot be controlled when the oligomers are produced by chemical hydrolysis. To determine the influence of the PA on the biological activities, defined chitosan oligomers in sufficient amounts are needed. Chitosan oligomers with specific PA can be produced by enzymatic deacetylation of chitin oligomers, but the diversity is limited by the low number of chitin deacetylases available. We have produced specific chitosan oligomers which are deacetylated at the first two units starting from the non-reducing end by the combined use of two different chitin deacetylases, namely NodB from Rhizobium sp. GRH 2 that deacetylates the first unit and COD from Vibrio cholerae that deacetylates the second unit starting from the non-reducing end. Both chitin deacetylases accept the product of each other resulting in production of chitosan oligomers with a novel and defined PA. When extended to further chitin deacetylases, this approach has the potential to yield a large range of novel chitosan oligomers with a fully defined architecture...|$|E

40|$|Human STAGA is a multisubunit {{transcriptional}} coactivator {{containing the}} histone acetyltransferase GCN 5 L. Previous {{studies of the}} related yeast SAGA complex {{have shown that the}} yeast Gcn 5, Ada 2, and Ada 3 components form a heterotrimer that is important for the enzymatic function of SAGA. Here, we report that ADA 2 a and ADA 2 b, two human homologues of yeast Ada 2, each have the ability to form a heterotrimer with ADA 3 and GCN 5 L but that only the ADA 2 b homologue is found in STAGA. By comparing the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> <b>of</b> several substrates, we found context-dependent requirements for ADA 2 b and ADA 3 for the efficient <b>acetylation</b> <b>of</b> histone tails by GCN 5. With human proteins, unlike yeast proteins, the <b>acetylation</b> <b>of</b> free core histones by GCN 5 is unaffected by ADA 2 b or ADA 3. In contrast, the <b>acetylation</b> <b>of</b> mononucleosomal substrates by GCN 5 is enhanced by ADA 2 b, with no significant additional effect of ADA 3, and the efficient <b>acetylation</b> <b>of</b> nucleosomal arrays (chromatin) by GCN 5 requires both ADA 2 b and ADA 3. Thus, ADA 2 b and ADA 3 appear to act at two different levels of histone organization within chromatin to facilitate GCN 5 function. Interestingly, although ADA 2 a forms a complex(es) with GCN 5 and ADA 3 both in vitro and in vivo, ADA 2 a-containing complexes are unable to acetylate nucleosomal H 3. We have also shown the preferential recruitment of ADA 2 b, relative to ADA 2 a, to p 53 -dependent genes. This finding indicates that the previously demonstrated presence and function of GCN 5 on these promoters reflect the action of STAGA and that the ADA 2 a and ADA 2 b paralogues have nonredundant functional roles...|$|R
40|$|By immunoprecipitation of {{chromatin}} fragments from cultured human HL- 60 {{cells with}} antibodies specific for H 4 acetylated at specific lysine residues we have defined {{the level of}} H 4 acetylation within transcriptionally active and inactive regions of the genome. H 4 within or adjacent to coding regions had a similar level of overall acetylation to input (bulk) chromatin and a similar <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> of individual lysines (i. e. 16 > 8, 12 > 5). The acetylation of H 4 in coding (and adjacent) regions was not correlated with transcriptional activity and did not vary with position along the constitutively active c-myc gene. Turnover of H 4 acetates was not selectively increased in transcriptionally active chromatin. H 4 associated with centric heterochromatin or with the CCCTAA repeat of telomeric heterochromatin was infrequently acetylated (< 1 %) at all lysines. We conclude that nucleosomes containing acetylated H 4 are scattered infrequently and possibly randomly through coding and adjacent regions and are essentially absent from heterochromatin. Induction of differentiation of HL- 60 cells by exposure to dimethylsulfoxide or 12 -o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA) did not alter the level of H 4 acetylation within either the c-myc or c-fos genes or other coding regions, but did induce a transient increase in H 4 acetylation within centric heterochromatin...|$|E

Histone- 4 Lys- 16 acetylation follows a similar pattern in normal males and females, being higher on the X and lower on the autosomes in males than in females. However, the staining <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> and the mof gene product, a putative histone acetylase, in msl mutant males returns to a uniform genome-wide distribution as found in females. Gene expression on the autosomes correlates {{with the level of}} histone- 4 acetylation. With minor exceptions, the expression levels of X-linked genes are maintained with either an increase or decrease of acetylation, suggesting that the MSL complex renders gene activity unresponsive to H 4 Lys 16 acetylation. Evidence was also found for the presence of nucleation sites for association of the MSL proteins with the X chromosome rather than individual gene binding sequences. We suggest that sequestration of the MSL proteins occurs in males to nullify on the autosomes and maintain on the X, an inverse effect produced by negatively acting dosage-dependent regulatory genes {{as a consequence of the}} evolution of the X/Y sex chromosomal system...|$|E

We showed {{previously}} that acetylation of H 2 A. Z was essential (Q. Ren and M. [*]A. Gorovsky, Mol. Cell 7 : 1329 - 1335, 2001). Here we used in vitro mutagenesis of lysine residues, coupled with gene replacement, to identify the sites of acetylation of the N-terminal tail of the major H 2 A and to analyze its function in vivo. Tetrahymena cells survived with all five acetylatable lysines replaced by arginines plus a mutation that abolished acetylation of the N-terminal serine normally found in the wild-type protein. Thus, neither posttranslational nor cotranslational acetylation of major H 2 A is essential. Surprisingly, the nonacetylatable N-terminal tail of the major H 2 A was able to replace the essential function of the acetylation of the H 2 A. Z N-terminal tail. Tail-swapping experiments between H 2 A. 1 and H 2 A. Z revealed that the nonessential acetylation of the major H 2 A N-terminal tail {{can be made to}} function as an essential charge patch in place of the H 2 A.

40|$|A {{recent report}} sought to {{demonstrate}} that acetylation of specific lysines within integrase (IN) by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p 300 regulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) integration and is essential for viral replication (A.

We can corroborate the efficient and specific acetylation of the IN carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) (amino acids 212 to 288) by p 300 using purified recombinant components. Although arginine substitution mutagenesis of the isolated CTD confirms {{that the majority of}} p 300 acetylation occurs at lysine residues 264, 266, and 273, the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> is not uniform and a hierarchy of reactivity can be established. Several combinatorial mutations of the CTD lysines modified by p 300 in vitro were reconstructed into an otherwise infectious proviral plasmid clone and examined for viral growth and frequency of productive chromosomal integration. In contrast to the findings of Cereseto and coworkers, who used epitope-tagged viruses for their experiments, we find that an untagged mutant virus, IN K(264 / 266 / 273) R, is fully replication competent. This discrepancy may be explained by the use of an acidic epitope tag placed at the extreme carboxyl terminus of integrase, near the target site for acetylation. Although the tagged, wild-type virus is viable, the combination of this epitope tag with the RRR substitution mutation results in a replication-defective phenotype. Although IN belongs to the very small set of nonhistone proteins modified by HAT-mediated activity, an obligate role for acetylation at the reactive CTD lysines in HIV- 1 IN cannot be confirmed...|$|E

To elucidate {{the role of}} Hint 2 in liver physiology, the Hint 2 gene was deleted. Hint 2 (-/-) and Hint 2 (+/+) mice were generated in a mixed C 57 Bl 6 /J x 129 Sv background. At 20 weeks, the phenotypic changes in Hint 2 (-/-) relative to Hint 2 (+/+) mice were an accumulation of hepatic triglycerides, decreased tolerance to glucose, a defective counter-regulatory response to insulin-provoked hypoglycaemia, an increase in plasma interprandial insulin but a decrease in glucose stimulated insulin secretion and defective thermoregulation upon fasting. Leptin mRNA in adipose tissue and plasma leptin were elevated. In mitochondria from Hint 2 (-/-) hepatocytes, state 3 respiration was decreased, a finding confirmed in HepG 2 cells where HINT 2 mRNA was silenced. The linked complex II to III electron transfer was decreased in Hint 2 (-/-) mitochondria, which {{was accompanied by a}} lower content of coenzyme Q. HIF- 2 α expression and the generation of reactive oxygen species were increased. Electron microscopy of mitochondria in Hint 2 (-/-) mice aged 12 months revealed clustered, fused organelles.

40|$|Extracellular signals {{generated}} {{during both}} feeding and fasting coordinately regulate transcription of metabolic enzyme genes that control glucose metabolism in theƒnƒÒ cell. A post-prandial rise in extracellular glucose levels promotes expression of various genes including the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK). Conversely, {{under conditions of}} fasting, a rise in hormones that stimulate increased intracellular levels of cAMP results in suppression of glucose-activated genes such as L-PK. The L-PK gene is coordinately regulated by these two opposing stimuli. Therefore, we explored the mechanism of induction and repression of the L-PK gene by glucose and cAMP, respectively, using the 832 / 13 rat insulinoma cell line. Glucose mediates induction of the L-PK gene by stimulating the recruitment of two primary DNA binding transcription factors, the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (ChREBP) and the orphan nuclear receptor, Hepatic Nuclear Factor 4 ƒÑ (HNF 4 ƒÑ) to their respective response elements in the proximal L-PK promoter. In addition, glucose stimulates the recruitment of the coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) to the L-PK gene promoter. Assembly of these three factors on the L-PK gene promoter facilitates alterations in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> and methylation of histones associated with the promoter and coding region, respectively. These changes in histone modifications correlate with increased occupancy of the RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) holoenzyme on the L-PK promoter. Finally, glucose promotes changes in the phosphorylation state of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II at serines 5 and 2, which are necessary for the promoter clearance and elongation phases of transcription. cAMP represses the glucose-mediated induction of the L-PK gene by inhibiting the assembly of the ChREBP, HNF 4 ƒÑ and CBP-containing complex on the L-PK promoter. The cAMP-dependent decrease in complex assembly on the promoter is associated with alterations in the acetylation and methylation status of histones on both the promoter and coding region. Furthermore, cAMP inhibits the glucose-mediated recruitment and phosphorylation of Pol II CTD, ultimately blocking initiation and elongation of the L-PK gene by Pol II. In summary, these studies provide a detailed insight into the mechanism of regulation of the L-PK gene by glucose and cAMP in islet ƒÒ cells...|$|E

For Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of a single H 4 -specific histone acetyltransferase (HAT), Esa 1 p, results in cell cycle defects and death. In contrast, although several yeast HAT complexes preferentially acetylate histone H 3, the catalytic subunits of these complexes are not essential for viability. To resolve the apparent paradox between the significance of H 3 versus H 4 acetylation, we tested the hypothesis that H 3 modification is essential, but is accomplished through combined activities of two enzymes. We observed that Sas 3 p and Gcn 5 p HAT complexes have overlapping <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation.</b> Simultaneous disruption <b>of</b> SAS 3, the homolog of the MOZ leukemia gene, and GCN 5, the hGCN 5 /PCAF homolog, is synthetically lethal due to loss of acetyltransferase activity.

Further, the combined loss of GCN 5 and SAS 3 functions results in an extensive, global loss <b>of</b> H 3 <b>acetylation</b> and arrest in the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle.

Many xylans are acetylated in nature, and the degree and <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> influences the material properties of the plant cell wall. Controlled chemical esterification is a powerful tool for tailoring the structure and material properties of hemicelluloses as a renewable raw material for bio-based plastic production. First, chemical acetylation was carried out on corncob arabinoxylan (CCAX), and the films were then compared with the unmodified pure CCAX films. There was clear improvement of the thermal and water resistant properties of the xylan films after acetylation. In following work, the structure-property analysis showed a positive effect of arabinose side chains on the elongation at break, the thermal stability and glass transition temperature of the acetylated xylan. 	 To make hemicellulose acetylation more sustainable, green chemistry was applied. The first approach included the utilization of ionic liquids (IL) as reaction media. Rye AX and spruce AGX were both fully acetylated while maintaining a high degree of polymerization (DP) in a very fast reaction. Another green chemistry alternative is to use enzymes. In this thesis the surfaces of rye AX films were acylated with acetate and stearate using lipases and cutinases in a water-free environment. The advancing contact angle of the surfaces was increased, the stearated surface being most hydrophobic. Finally, AcAX was combined with spruce nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) to form films. The thermal properties, stiffness and stress at break of the composite were superior to the neat AcAX films. The uniqueness of this composite is the water resistance and high elongation at break, even at a 10 % NFC content. This work is a contribution to the designing of novel xylan based materials and their feasible and environmentally friendly production. Acetylated arabinoxylans have a potential to replace many of the oil based plastics and become a future bioplastics...|$|E
40|$|The SAGA {{family of}} co-activators {{play a major}} role in {{regulating}} eukaryotic gene expression. These multiprotein complexes are highly conserved across all eukaryotic species, from budding yeast to humans. Transcription of inducible genes is facilitated by SAGA, by mediating acetylation of amino tails of the histone H 3. The acetyltransferase activity of SAGA is harbored in the Gcn 5 subunit of the complex. Previous studies characterized the enzymatic properties of the recombinantly expressed HAT domain of Gcn 5 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, on synthetic H 3 peptides. We were interested in studying the properties of endogenous Gcn 5, in the context of full SAGA complex. We also utilized nucleosomes as substrates, since the basic structural unit of chromatin is a nucleosome. Towards this end, we first turned our efforts into developing a reliable, reproducible and sensitive assay for detecting acetylation on nucleosomes. Previous studies utilized filter binding assays, which work great for short peptides. Since these peptides are positively charged, they bind to the filter in an efficient and reproducible manner. Nucleosomes, being net negatively charged and structurally fragile, required an alternative approach. We developed bead based strategies which immobilize the nucleosome substrates, and thus circumvented the above-mentioned issues. We utilized a trinucleosome system to study the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> established across the nucleosomal array under saturating and sub-saturating conditions. We observed a 2 fold preference for nucleosomes harboring longer linker lengths on one side. By further optimizing the bead based assay for performing initial rate, steady state kinetics, we designed several nucleosomes harboring different lengths of linkers on both sides. Our data suggest that linker DNA longer than 80 bp on one end stimulate the HAT activity of SAGA. We also show that a long linker in combination with linker on the other side of the nucleosome stimulates SAGA to the maximum potential. Steady state data on different nucleosomes revealed that SAGA binds to all nucleosomes pretty tightly, but the turnover rates were lower than expected. Our bead based assay also allows us to perform single turnover experiments, which would give important information on the nature of chemical step. Preliminary data suggests that indeed, the first turnover is pretty fast, but subsequent cycles are much slower, indicating a step post catalysis, such as product release, to be limiting. We are currently working towards understanding this burst phase in more detail. In vivo, different factors work in concert to regulate gene transcription. For example, DNA bound activators recruit SAGA to target genes, to initiate transcription. Previous studies have followed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to qualitatively assess this interaction. In order to investigate the effect of this interaction from a quantitative perspective, we incorporated activator binding site in the linker DNA of one of the nucleosomes. Our preliminary data suggests that activator modulates SAGA complex in potentially 2 different ways, even beyond the stimulation mediated by linker DNA. This might explain how the cell is able to quickly respond to stress environments and turn on genes to achieve homeostasis. Overall, our results help us in gaining better insights into the mechanisms employed by the SAGA complex in maintaining basal levels of acetylation under normal conditions, and establishing hyperacetylated domains under inducing conditions...|$|E
40|$|Diverse {{cellular}} functions {{including the}} regulation of inflammatory gene expression, DNA repair and cell proliferation are regulated by changes in the <b>acetylation</b> status <b>of</b> histones and non-histone proteins. Many human diseases, particularly cancer, {{have been associated with}} altered <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylation.</b> Furthermore, abnormal expression and activation of histone acetyltransferases, which act as transcriptional co-activators, has been reported in inflammatory diseases. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been developed clinically for malignancies due to their effects on apoptosis. More recently, in vitro and in vivo data indicates that HDAC inhibitors may be anti-inflammatory due to their effects on cell death acting through <b>acetylation</b> <b>of</b> non-histone proteins. Although there are concerns over the long-term safety of these agents, they may prove useful particularly in situations where current anti-inflammatory therapies are suboptimal...|$|R

Through systematic epigenomic profiling of 35 epigenetic modifications and transcriptomic analysis, we define chromatin state changes associated with melanomagenesis by using a cell phenotypic model of non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic states. Computation of specific chromatin state transitions showed loss <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylations</b> and H 3 K 4 me 2 / 3 on regulatory regions proximal to specific cancer-regulatory genes in important melanoma-driving cell signaling pathways.

The Raman data further confirm successful acetylation as shown by FTIR that was demonstrated previously to be highly sensitive for determining the level <b>of</b> <b>acetylation.</b> However, the Raman peaks are much weaker than the FTIR bands. Nevertheless, the variations of the extent <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> estimated from both Raman and FTIR spectra with weight percent gain due to acetylation (WPG) were observed to follow the same <b>pattern.</b> The degrees <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> calculated from Raman data were also found to increase linearly with that calculated from the more sensitive FTIR technique.

It would be of great biological interest and practical importance if we could uncover the molecular mechanism of aging, {{and find a way}} to delay the aging process while maintaining physical and mental strengths of youth. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) such as SIR 2 and RPD 3 are known to be involved in the extension of lifespan in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. An inhibitor of HDACs, phenylbutyrate, also can significantly increase the lifespan of Drosophila, without diminution of locomotor vigor, resistance to stress, or reproductive ability. Treatment for a limited period, either early or late in adult life, is also effective.

40|$|To {{delineate}} {{the relationship between}} epigenetic modifications and hemoglobin switching, we compared the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylation</b> and pol II binding across the β-globin locus at fetal and adult stages of human development. To make this comparison possible, we introduced an external control into experimental samples in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Using this common standard, {{we found that the}} locus control region (LCR) was acetylated to the same level at all stages, whereas acetylation levels at the individual gene regions correlated with the state of transcription. In the active genes, the promoters were less acetylated compared with the coding regions. Furthermore, all globin promoters were acetylated to a similar level irrespective of the state of transcription. However, after correction for the loss of nucleosomes, the level <b>of</b> <b>acetylation</b> per histone at the active γ and β promoters was 5 - to 7 -fold greater than that at the inactive ε promoter. Although the histone acetylation level within the LCR was developmentally stable, pol II binding in fetal erythroblasts was 2 - to 3 -fold greater than that in adult erythroblasts. These results demonstrate that dynamic changes in histone acetylation and pol II take place as the human β-globin gene region undergoes its developmental switches...|$|R
40|$|Histones of {{the green}} alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were {{prepared}} by a new method and fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Acid-urea-Triton gel analysis and tritiated acetate labeling demonstrated high levels <b>of</b> steady-state <b>acetylation</b> for the single histone H 3 protein, in contrast to low levels on histones H 4 and H 2 B. Twenty percent of histone H 3 is subject to dynamic acetylation with, on average, three acetylated lysine residues per protein molecule. Histone synthesis in light-dark-synchronized cultures was biphasic with pattern differences between two histone H 1 variants, between two H 2 A variants, and between H 2 B and ubiquitinated H 2 B. Automated protein sequence analysis of histone H 3 demonstrated a site-specific <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> steady-state <b>acetylation</b> between 7 and 17 % at {{five of the six}} amino-terminal lysines and of monomethylation between 5 and 81 % at five of the eight amino-terminal lysines in a pattern that may limit dynamic acetylation.

40|$|Increasing {{survival}} {{motor neuron}} 2 (SMN 2) gene expression {{may be an}} effective strategy {{for the treatment of}} spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown to increase SMN transcript and protein levels, but the specific role <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylation</b> in regulating SMN gene expression has not been explored. Using chromatin immunopreciptation, we investigated the levels of acetylated H 3 and H 4 histones and HDACs associated with different regions of the human and mouse SMN genes in both cultured cells and tissues. We show that the SMN gene has a reproducible <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylation</b> that is largely conserved among different tissues and species. A limited region of the promoter surrounding the transcriptional start site has relatively high levels <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylation,</b> whereas regions further upstream or downstream have lower levels. After HDAC inhibitor treatment, acetylated histone levels increased, particularly at upstream regions, correlating with a 2 -fold increase in promoter activity. During development in mouse tissues, histone acetylation levels decreased and associated HDAC 2 levels increased at the region closest to the transcriptional start site, correlating with a 40 – 60 % decrease in SMN transcript and protein levels. These data indicate that histone acetylation modulates SMN gene expression and that pharmacological manipulation of this epigenetic determinant is feasible. HDAC 2, in particular, may be a future therapeutic target for SMA...|$|R
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae has {{a global}} <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> histone <b>{{acetylation}}</b> in which histone H 3 and H 4 acetylation levels are lower at protein-coding sequences than at promoter regions. The loss of Eaf 3, a subunit of the NuA 4 histone acetylase and Rpd 3 histone deacetylase complexes, greatly alters the genomic profile <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylation,</b> {{with the effects}} on H 4 appearing to be more pronounced than those on H 3. Specifically, the loss of Eaf 3 causes increases in H 3 and H 4 acetylation at coding sequences and decreases at promoters, such that histone acetylation levels become evenly distributed across the genome. Eaf 3 {{does not affect the}} overall level <b>of</b> H 4 <b>acetylation,</b> the recruitment <b>of</b> the NuA 4 catalytic subunit Esa 1 to target promoters, or the level of transcription of the genes analyzed for histone acetylation. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling indicates that Eaf 3 plays a positive, but quantitatively modest, role in the transcription of a small subset of genes, whereas it has a negative effect on very few genes. We suggest that Eaf 3 regulates the genomic profile of histone H 3 and H 4 acetylation in a manner that does not involve targeted recruitment and is independent of transcriptional activity. Histone acetylases and deacetylases modify lysine residues on the N-terminal tails of histones, and these modifications correlate with the activation and repression of transcription...|$|R
40|$|Stably {{integrated}} transgenes {{flanked by}} the chicken β-globin HS 4 insulator are protected against chromosomal position effects and gradual extinction of expression during long-term propagation in culture. To investigate {{the mechanism of}} action of this insulator, we used bisulfite genomic sequencing to examine the methylation of individual CpG sites within insulated transgenes, and compared this with <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylation.</b> Surprisingly, although the histones of the entire insulated transgene are highly acetylated, only a specific region in the promoter, containing binding sites for erythroid-specific transcription factors, is highly protected from DNA methylation. This critical region is methylated in noninsulated and inactive lines. MBD 3 and Mi- 2, subunits of the Mi- 2 /NuRD repressor complex, are bound in vivo to these silenced noninsulated transgenes. In contrast, insulated cell lines do not show any enrichment of Mi- 2 /NuRD proteins very late in culture. In addition to the high levels <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylation</b> observed across the entire insulated transgene, significant peaks <b>of</b> H 3 <b>acetylation</b> are present over the HS 4 insulator elements. Targeted histone acetylation by the chicken β-globin insulator occurs independently of gene transcription and {{does not require the}} presence of a functional enhancer. We suggest that this acetylation is in turn responsible for the maintenance of a region of unmethylated DNA over the promoter. Whereas DNA methylation often leads to histone deacetylation, here acetylation appears to prevent methylation...|$|R
40|$|Although V(D) J {{recombination}} {{is thought}} to be regulated by changes in the accessibility of chromatin to the recombinase machinery, the mechanisms responsible for establishing “open” chromatin are poorly understood. We performed a detailed study <b>of</b> the <b>acetylation</b> status <b>of</b> histones associated with 11 VH gene segments, their flanking regions, and various intergenic elements during B-cell development and ontogeny, when V(D) J recombination is highly regulated. Histone H 4 shows higher and more-regulated acetylation than does histone H 3 in the VH locus. In adult pro-B cells, VH gene segments are acetylated prior to V(D) J rearrangement, with higher acetylation associated with JH-distal VH gene segments. While large regions of the VH locus have similar <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> histone <b>acetylation,</b> acetylation is narrowly confined to the gene segments, their flanking promoters, and recombinase signal sequence elements. Thus, histone acetylation in the VH locus is both locally and globally regulated. Increased histone acetylation accompanies preferential recombination of JH-proximal VH gene segments in early B-cell ontogeny, and decreased histone <b>acetylation</b> accompanies inhibition <b>of</b> V-DJ recombination in a transgenic model of immunoglobulin heavy-chain allelic exclusion. Thus, changes in histone acetylation appear to be important for both promotion and inhibition of V-DJ rearrangement during B-cell ontogeny and development...|$|R
