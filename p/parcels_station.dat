50|$|The name Frankfurt-Louisa {{refers to}} the Louisa <b>parcel</b> <b>station</b> (Flurstück Louisa), which was {{immediate}} west of the current station. At {{the beginning of the}} 19th century the Frankfurt banker and diplomat Simon Moritz von Bethmann (1768-1828) acquired the land the <b>parcel</b> <b>station</b> was built on to create an English garden. After his marriage to Louise Friederike Boode in 1810, Bethmann named the park after his wife. The Bethmann family retained ownership of most of the Park Louisa until 1941. In the north-eastern corner of the site, about 200 metres {{to the north of the}} station, the existing Waldspielpark Louisa (Louisa forest playground) was established in 1954.|$|R

Ultimately, outlets can act as pickup locations as an alternative to a <b>parcel</b> <b>station.</b> Especially OC retailers originating from bricks-and-mortar business consider store pickup to be an essential format for OC distribution. It allows them to generate higher frequency at their stores. Furthermore, the additional assortment available for pickup enhances the variety of products in the outlets. Almost 70  % of the OC retailers interviewed have already implemented store pickup solutions.|$|R

5000|$|United States <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>Station,</b> {{also known}} as the Railway Express Building, is a {{historic}} post office structure located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is two stories high with the first floor at the St. Paul Street level and is supported by concrete piers that extend 35 feet down {{to the level of the}} Jones Falls Expressway (I-83). It was constructed in 1929 in a Classical Revival style and built of reinforced concrete with brick walls and limestone and terra cotta trim, the building is a parallelogram in plan, measuring 142 feet on the east and west and 269 feet deep. The principal facade features a 4 foot high limestone base and terra cotta capitals molded in the form of an American bald eagle within a wreath. The St. Paul Street facility and its location next to the Pennsylvania Railroad according to the U.S. Post Office Department in 1928 [...] "would affect handling of parcel-post matter in Washington and delivery points as far as New York and Canada."

50|$|Although {{passenger}} services on the Northampton line ceased on 2 May 1964, {{the following year}} around 40 trains per day were still calling at Peterborough East. However, on 6 June 1966, with {{the closure of the}} Rugby line from Yarwell Junction to Seaton, Peterborough East finally closed to passenger traffic. This, however, did not mark the end of the station as it was converted into a <b>parcels</b> centre. The <b>station</b> became the base for the East Anglia British Rail Universal Trolley Equipment (BRUTE) service and handled some 15,000 parcels a day. On 29 June 1970, the station finally became redundant when operations were transferred to the new British Rail Express Parcel Terminal built {{on the site of the}} New England locomotive sheds. In July 1981, the Post Office took over the terminal when BR withdrew its unprofitable Collected/Delivered parcels business.|$|R
50|$|The Gare de la Bastille was, except {{possibly}} in its earliest days, an almost purely passenger <b>station.</b> <b>Parcels</b> and post were handled but almost the only freight was coal for the 3-road engine shed. General freight was handled at a goods station {{located at the}} other end of the viaduct at Reuilly but the Gare de la Bastille did handle one rather unusual traffic. Following devastation by phylloxera and increased competition from wine shipped in by rail, vineyards that had traditionally supplied Paris in the area served by the outer rural section of the Ligne de Vincennes switched to growing roses. A Train des Roses was introduced as early as 1897, arriving at the Gare de la Bastille in the early hours. The roses were sold in the markets at Les Halles. Traffic peaked at over 1,000,000 roses per night.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 2 June 1852 by the Leeds Northern Railway. The station was {{situated}} {{on the east side}} of the A1. Like Newby Wiske and Pickhill, the station opened with one platform although it was rebuilt and lengthened while another was built when the line was doubled in 1901. The goods yard was located behind the station buildings with a single set of coal drops. A loading dock was provided on the up side where there was also a cattle dock. The main freight that was handled at the station was barley, with 797 tons being handled in 1911. In 1913, 218 tons of livestock were handled at the station. By 1956 there was only one southbound train at 7:24am, although passengers couldn't use it if they wanted to. The train was possibly used for mail and <b>parcel</b> offloading. The <b>station</b> was closed to passengers on 1 January 1962 and to goods traffic on 11 November 1963. The station was demolished in 2009 to make room for the widening of the A1 road.|$|R

This Preliminary General Plan/Draft EIR is focused on the former Naval Facility and the Light Station complex. Point Sur’s distinctive rock, referred to as Moro Rock, has been a navigational landmark on California’s central coast for many years. Several renowned shipwrecks have occurred off of the coast nearby. To help mariners navigate this treacherous section of coastline, a lighthouse was established on Moro Rock in 1889.

60|$|Nothing speaks more eloquently of the pitiless {{insistence of}} {{progress}} and expansion in our time than that it should get into the Smallways blood.

He was lost for a whole day before he was five, and nearly drowned in the reservoir of the new water-works before he was seven. He had a real pistol taken away from him by a real policeman when he was ten. And he learnt to smoke, not with pipes and brown paper and cane as Tom had done, but with a penny packet of Boys of England American cigarettes. His language shocked his father before he was twelve, and by that age, what with touting for <b>parcels</b> at the <b>station</b> and selling the Bun Hill Weekly Express, he was making three shillings a week, or more, and spending it on Chips, Comic Cuts, Ally Sloper's Half-holiday, cigarettes, and all the concomitants of a life of pleasure and enlightenment. All of this without hindrance to his literary studies, which carried him up to the seventh standard at an exceptionally early age. I mention these things so that you may have no doubt at all concerning the sort of stuff Bert had in him.|$|R

40|$|The {{suburban}} terminus station dedicates {{large amounts}} of land for parking in order to cater to its driving riders, and causes a trade-off tension between attracting ridership through providing park-and-rides and building transit-oriented development (TOD) within station areas. I focus my research on the Millbrae Intermodal Station, a suburban terminus station in the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, which is still waiting for {{a large amount of}} TOD to occur in its station area. The predominant research question for this thesis is: What are the challenges of creating TOD at suburban terminus stations and how can mixed use, highdensity, and human-scaled environments be better facilitated to become a reality? To answer this question, I took a mixed methods approach that included (1) evaluating ridership and parking supply data of all BART stations, (2) analyzing the primary and contextual case studies by comparing TOD plan documents to the current build-out reality of each station's station area, (3) conducting focused interviews with experts to gain insight on the barriers to implementing TOD at the Millbrae Station, and (4) developing a design proposition of how the Millbrae Station Area could engage alternative uses on its station parking lots. For all of the evaluated <b>stations,</b> <b>parcels</b> immediately approximate to the station had more difficulty realizing TOD than parcels further away from the station. Issues that surfaced as barriers to TOD included weak market conditions, land assemblage, construction costs, parking replacement standards, existing parcel ownership, and existing land use. In addition, TOD plans at more mature stations took an extensive period of time to become realized. To demonstrate how this inevitable waiting period could be more productive, I conclude by proposing design interventions and a strategy for how Millbrae, in the meantime, could apply and experiment with temporary flexible uses on its station parking lots. by Janet Wei Shih.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} real estate and {{happiness}} consequences of public investment in local public goods improvements by using unique micro-geographical data from Beijing; it focuses on the spatial variations in park amenity values, and {{on the impact of}} transport improvements on land prices and homeowners’ happiness. Despite intense public interest, little is known about these effects. This thesis aims to fill these gaps. First, I explore the impact and sources of variations of park proximities as capitalized into the residential land prices. This analysis, using geographically-coded data from Beijing, provides new insights on the ways in which land markets capitalize the values of proximity to parks and suggests that this is highly dependent on the parcel’s location and local contextual characteristics. Next, I examine {{the real estate}} consequence of public investment in transport improvements using a rich data set of vacant land parcels in Beijing. I use a multiple intervention difference-in-difference method to document opening and planning effects of new rail stations on prices for different land uses in affected areas versus unaffected areas. Residential and commercial land <b>parcels</b> receiving increased <b>station</b> proximity experience appreciable price premiums, but the relative importance of such benefits varies greatly over space and local demographics. Finally, I investigate the impact of transport improvements on happiness that altered the residence-station distance for some homeowners, but left others unaffected. My estimation strategy takes advantage of micro happiness surveys conducted before-and-after the building of new rail stations in 2008 Beijing. I deal with the potential concern about the endogeneity in sorting effects by focusing on “stayers”and using non-market housings with pre-determined locations. I find the significantly heterogeneity in the effects from better rail access on homeowners’ happiness with respect to different dimensions of residential environment. The welfare analysis results suggest strong social-spatial differentiations. In combination, the three papers of this thesis make important contributions to a growing literature on public infrastructure, land market and happiness...|$|R
