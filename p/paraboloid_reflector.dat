40|$|Reflector antennas {{are widely}} used in {{communication}} satellite systems because they provide high gain at low cost. Offset-fed single <b>paraboloids</b> and dual <b>reflector</b> offset Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas with multiple focal region feeds provide a simple, blockage-free means of forming multiple, shaped, and isolated beams with low sidelobes. Such antennas are applicable to communications satellite frequency reuse systems and earth stations requiring access to several satellites. While the single offset paraboloid {{has been the most}} extensively used configuration for the satellite multiple-beam antenna, the trend toward large apertures requiring minimum scanned beam degradation over the field of view 18 degrees for full earth coverage from geostationary orbit may lead to impractically long focal length and large feed arrays. Dual reflector antennas offer packaging advantages and more degrees of design freedom to improve beam scanning and cross-polarization properties. The Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas are the most commonly used dual reflector antennas. A computer program for calculating the secondary pattern and directivity of a generalized dual reflector antenna system was developed and implemented at LeRC. The theoretical foundation for this program is based on the use of physical optics methodology for describing the induced currents on the sub-reflector and main reflector.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{dual-band}} dual-polarized (DBDP) {{array antenna}} with low frequency ratio and integrated filtering characteristics is proposed. By employing a dual-mode stub-loaded resonator (SLR) {{to feed and}} tune with two patches, the two feed networks for each polarization can be combined, resulting in {{the reduction of the}} feed networks and the input ports. In addition, owing to the native dual resonant features of the SLR, the proposed antenna exhibits 2 nd-order filtering characteristics with improved bandwidth and out-of-band rejections.

40|$|Abstract — A {{hybrid system}} is {{described}} that combines {{the features of}} two solar technologies – photo-voltaic conversion to electricity (PV) and thermal conversion to heat and finally to electric energy for battery usage. Under {{the condition of the}} same output power of photovoltaic system, using low cost superiority of the high concentrator material in place of the expensive solar cell to reduce the comprehensive cost of the photovoltaic system and realize the high effective and the efficient unification of the focussing photovoltaic system. In this paper, problems of solar energy tracking by solar cells is analysed and an alternate method is analysed of focussing the light rays through a concentrator for tracking maximum power. The technical approach uses a convex lens mounted on a cyclic parabolloid to reflect and concentrate sun’s radiations at the focus and this acts as the point of maximum power tracking. A thermo electric generator (TEF) is also used to convert the heat generated at the focus into usable electric energy. Keywords—photovoltaic solar tracking, sensor based automatic tracking, photovoltaic/thermal hybrid system, lens focussing action, parabolloid dish reflector, thermal collector. High installation cost Capital costs associated with solar energy installation are very high. Particularly unhelpful is the high upfront costs of buying solar panels.

40|$|This thesis {{researches}} several novel {{high power}} wideband antennas with omnidirectional, horizon- and broadside-directional, and bi-directional coverage for various electronic warfare (EW) systems. The developed antennas are designed and analyzed with the considerations in frequency domain (FD), time domain (TD), and power domain (PD) using full-wave electromagnetic simulations, transient analysis, multiphysics simulations, field analysis, equivalent circuit modeling, spherical mode decomposition, etc., as needed. The theoretical models of all antenna configuration are carefully validated with measurements. Equivalent circuit models of monopole-like antennas are derived {{based on the}} physical structure and field distribution around a monopole. These models are used to ease physical understanding, analyze antenna impedance, and design derivatives with improved performance. A novel wideband omnidirectional antenna with consistent monopole-like patterns is proposed for millimeter-wave integrated towed decoy receiving subsystems by combining annular slot mode with a monopole into a single structure. The bandwidth of the combined antenna is improved to cover {{the wide range of}} radar signals from 18 GHz to 45 GHz, and its operating principle is analyzed using the proposed equivalent circuit model. In addition, compact <b>paraboloid</b> <b>reflector</b> fed by the combined antenna is designed for the same platform but with enabled horizon-directional coverage. The path toward using the proposed combined antenna for transient high power electromagnetics (HPEM) applications with good TD and PD performances is described. Reconfigurability between steerable horizon-directional and omnidirectional modes for transient HPEM pulses is demonstrated by a monocone fed reflector antenna system. To do so, a conventional monocone is modified to a conical monopole first. The spherical mode expansion (SME) analysis shows that this structure has consistent monopole-like patterns and {{can be used as a}} feeder of a wideband reflector antenna system. Owing to the small diameter and consistent patterns of the modified monocone feeder, a <b>paraboloid</b> <b>reflector</b> is engineered and stable impedance and far-field performances from 1. 66 GHz to 20 GHz are demonstrated. Analysis in TD and PD proves the suitability of the proposed antenna concept for transient HPEM applications. The electrical size of the monocone is also reduced by loading shorted semi-helical wires. The circuit model analysis demonstrates that typical miniaturization techniques require large monocone diameter though height can be greatly reduced. The proposed loading does not contribute to additional antenna volume, while lowering its electrical size by 34 %, and the prototype monocone achieves good impedance match and gain from 1. 23 GHz to 11 GHz. Planar bi-directional and flush-mountable broadside unidirectional log-periodic (LP) antennas for long range communication, radar, or jammer systems with over a decade wideband performance are also introduced. To maintain inherent bi-directionality of a planar LP antenna, microstrip feed is preferred over a typical coax-based exciter. However, this leads to deteriorated impedance match and pattern distortion when the boom angle is not wide enough. To resolve this issue, a novel wide-boom geometry of the LP antenna is proposed. Since the wide-boom provides wide ground plane for the feeding microstrip line, good impedance match and gain performances can be achieved without sacrificing the antenna size. Moreover, electro-thermal multiphysics analysis of the antenna shows that the wide-boom also improves the temperature response, and thus, the average power handling capability is increased. The multiphysics simulation results are validated using a non-contact infrared (IR) camera. To achieve broadside unidirectional coverage, a slot-loaded cavity backing design is engineered. Instead of filling the cavity with carbon loaded absorber, the proposed slot-cavity backed LP antenna is loaded with the slot terminated by a coax cable that can be easily used for energy recycling. Fabricated prototype maintains high gain and efficiency with good impedance match over a wide bandwidth from 0. 59 GHz to 5 GHz. All ideas and concepts proposed in this thesis are thoroughly validated with circuit and full-wave simulations as well as experiments on representative prototypes...|$|E
40|$|A {{symmetric}} reflectarray, {{consisting of}} variable-size square patch elements with a commonly used mathematical {{model for the}} horn {{in the form of}} a cosine function, has been designed using the transmit mode technique for different f/D ratios with 10 dB edge taper. Subsequently, the antennas were analyzed for the radiation pattern and gain. The infinite array model was used to determine the reflection phase of each patch element in the design and analysis codes. By displacing the feed laterally, the scan characteristics were obtained, such as the beam deviation factor, gain loss, and pattern degradation. The properties of reflect arrays were compared to those of the conventional paraboloidal reflectors. The same procedure was used to study the scan properties of offset reflectarrays. There is no cross-polarized radiation in the principal planes for a symmetric system. Cross-polarized radiation exists in non-principal planes off broadside in symmetric systems, with greater levels for larger values of subtended angles. Such cross-polarized radiation level increases with subtended angle just as cross-polarization level increases with decreasing values of f/D ratios for symmetric paraboloids in non-principal planes. Pattern distortions and gain loss were found to be more severe in the case of a microstrip reflectarray compared to the conventional parabolic reflector. The scan performance of the reflect arrays was found to improve with f/D ratios as is true for paraboloids. In general, scanning by means of displaced feed is limited to a few beam - widths in reflectarrays. Feed displacement in the axial direction of a symmetric reflectarray was investigated and compared to that of paraboloids. The gain loss due to the defocused feed of a reflectarray was found to be nearly the same as that of a paraboloid of the same subtended angle for larger values of f/D, and for displacements away from the antenna. The gain loss of an axially defocused reflectarray was found to be greater than that of a paraboloid for displacements closer to the antenna, especially for smaller values of f/D. In general, the performance of a defocused reflectarray was found to be poorer than that of a comparable <b>paraboloid</b> <b>reflector...</b>|$|E
