5|$|Footage of the Fairchild {{crash was}} used in the making of the 2015 film Project Almanac, {{depicting}} an airline accident, which sparked public anger among relatives of Wolff and McGeehan. After an initial claim by Paramount <b>Pictures</b> <b>that</b> the video in question was of a 2009 Tokyo crash, producer Michael Bay issued an apology to the families, and the footage was removed from the film's theatrical release and associated trailers at Bay's request.|$|E
5|$|Selznick formed Selznick International Pictures in 1935, and Pioneer Pictures {{merged with}} it in June 1936. Cooper became the vice {{president}} of Selznick International <b>Pictures</b> <b>that</b> same year. Cooper did not stay long; he resigned in 1937 due to disagreements over the film Stagecoach.|$|E

5|$|A 56-page, {{hardcover}} book contains {{quotes from}} Shankar and Harrison, commenting on their long friendship and the projects {{represented on the}} discs. Both artists' families supplied photographs for the book, while other pictures are credited to professional photographers Clive Arrowsmith, Dezo Hoffmann, Jan Steward and Carolyn Jones. The photo used {{on the front of}} the box was one of a series of <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> Arrowsmith took at Friar Park in 1974, over the period when the Music Festival orchestra were recording and rehearsing there.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> the fans haven't seen before, all {{together}} of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|The iPad {{allows users}} to {{purchase}} and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera. The user zooms {{in and out of}} photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the spacecraft's orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter's frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{main hub}} is the Comet Observatory, a {{spaceship}} which contains six themed domes that {{provide access to}} the 42 galaxies available in the game. Five of the domes end with a boss level in which {{the objective is to}} defeat Bowser or Bowser Jr., which then gives the player access to the next dome via acquiring a collectable called a Grand Star. The player only has access to a few galaxies when they begin the game; as more Power Stars are collected, more galaxies become available. The player is awarded the ability to play as Luigi after collecting 120 Power Stars as Mario. Once 120 Power Stars are collected with both characters, the player is rewarded one further challenge for Mario and Luigi to complete, which upon completion, awards the player with two commemorative <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> can be sent to the Wii Message Board.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Fung sends more killers to Kwai's {{refuge in}} order to {{eliminate}} Kwai's syndicate. A gunfight ensues, with the four men emerging victorious. As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello {{has a problem with}} his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman (Michelle Ye) with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and the pregnant woman learn of the shootout during a news report.|$|E

25|$|Still another {{technique}} {{relies on}} a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and {{is very difficult for}} a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.|$|E

25|$|Fluoroscopy {{is similar}} to {{radiography}} and X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) in that it generates images using X-rays. The original difference was that radiography fixed still images on film whereas fluoroscopy provided live moving <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> were not stored. However, today radiography, CT, and fluoroscopy are all digital imaging modes with image analysis software and data storage and retrieval.|$|E
25|$|His art {{often had}} a strong moralizing element to it, such as in his {{masterpiece}} of 1732–33, A Rake's Progress, engraved in 1734. It consisted of eight <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, {{the son of a}} rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from sex workers, and gambling—the character's life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital.|$|E
