5|$|The {{tradition}} of Voviyo (wedding songs), sung by women during a Ros, {{is important to}} this community.

Only women whose husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the feelings of the <b>people</b> <b>about</b> the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} more people with Scottish ancestry living abroad than the total {{population}} of Scotland. In the 2000 Census, 9.2million Americans self-reported some degree of Scottish descent.

5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing <b>people</b> <b>about</b> asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} respond to the social {{security}} needs of an increasingly aged population, many governments with limited budgets are required to focus available resources on the direct causes of <b>people's</b> anxieties <b>about</b> aging. This study investigated the causes of <b>people's</b> anxieties <b>about</b> life after the age of 65 using household data from countries with different social contexts: Japan, the United States, and China. This research uncovered three major findings. First, the speed of population aging does not always make <b>people</b> anxious <b>about</b> life at an older age. Second, high financial status effectively lessens people's levels of anxiety about their older years in Japan and the United States. Third, living with a child does not necessarily lessen <b>people's</b> concern <b>about</b> life after 65...|$|R

Upon {{arriving at the}} Atlantic City morgue, Scully and Mulder discover that the body was eaten by a human. However, the local detective, Thompson, denies the agents access to the investigation. Scully returns to Washington to attend her godson's birthday party, while Mulder stays in New Jersey. At the party, Scully meets Rob, the divorced father {{of one of the}} guests. Meanwhile, Mulder questions homeless <b>people</b> <b>about</b> the case. A man shows him a drawing of a humanoid and tells him that he saw it and that the other homeless people and cops know about it. Mulder gives his hotel room key to the man and sleeps in the alley, where he sees a shadowy, human-like creature. He chases the creature, but is arrested before he can catch it.|$|E
5|$|Bede's primary {{intention}} {{in writing}} the Historia Ecclesiastica was to show {{the growth of the}} united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; {{by the end of the}} Historia the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons. This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the Historia is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the Synod of Whitby in 664. Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and <b>people</b> <b>about</b> which he wrote.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a fungal infection, Penicillium marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most <b>people</b> <b>about</b> his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E

5|$|Comic strips {{have also}} dealt in subtext and innuendo, their wide {{distribution}} in newspapers limiting their inclusion of controversial material. The first openly gay characters appeared in prominent strips {{in the late}} 1970s; representation of LGBT issues in these titles causes vociferous reaction, both praise and condemnation, to the present day. Comic strips aimed at LGBT audiences are also syndicated in gay- and lesbian-targeted magazines and comics have been created to educate <b>people</b> <b>about</b> LGBT-related issues and to influence real-world politics, with their format and distribution allowing them to transmit messages more subtle, complex, and positive than typical education material. Portrayal of LGBT themes in comics is recognized by several notable awards, including the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards and GLAAD Media Awards for outstanding comic book and comic strip.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of six chapters, Madonnaland finds Simone visiting Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan, {{where she}} spoke with the local <b>people</b> <b>about</b> the singer.

Simone had been initially commissioned to write a new biography about the singer. However, due to already available excess content on her, the author felt {{she would not be}} able to find anything new. Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City did not have any commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E

The Sejm on 30 September 1773 accepted the partition treaty. By the first partition the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 211,000km² (30% of its territory, amounting {{at that time to}} about 733,000km²), with a population of over four to five million <b>people</b> (<b>about</b> a third of its population of 14 million before the partitions). The treaty was a major success for Frederick II of Prussia: Prussia's share might have been the smallest, but it was also significantly developed and strategically important. Russia received the largest, but economically least-important area, in the northeast.|$|E

5|$|Foraging {{takes place}} {{mostly on the}} ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer <b>people</b> <b>about.</b> Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by {{dropping}} vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.|$|E
