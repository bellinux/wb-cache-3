An extended literature was undertaken to address the stated problems. The study found that organisations utilising the professional {{project management}} are benefiting more than those who do not used professional <b>project</b> <b>managers.</b> It was also found that there is an exponential increase in membership of the Project Management Institute (PMI) and those with Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. <b>Projects</b> and <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> plays an important role in the success of business. This study shows that projects are initiated as a result of the development of new products or services. Despite all the necessary selection criteria for appointing <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> being satisfied, <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> are still faced with challenges. This study shows that the temporary nature as well the limited authority given to the <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> constitute the core challenges for a <b>project</b> <b>manager.</b> The study shows that most of the organisations do not have system approach when selecting the <b>project</b> <b>managers.</b> Appointment of an “accidental project manager” is a sure path to project failure.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} {{was to create a}} social <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> {{competence}} framework, because it hasn't been defined up till now and it is extremely necessary as {{there are more and more}} social <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> who need a list of soft competences which are required from them to work effectively. Interpersonal competences should be much more developed in the case of social <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> because managers make relationships with different people. What is more, social <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> need higher competences than other <b>project</b> <b>managers,</b> especially interpersonal competences which are the most important factor to make a project successful. They should be aware of it before they start the work. The research revealed the most important interpersonal competences which have the greatest influence on the effectiveness of social <b>project</b> <b>managers.</b> Social <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> should know what interpersonal competences are needed to work effectively on a social project. So therefore, the <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> competence framework is especially dedicated to social <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> so they can check if they have most of the required competences to work effectively...|$|R

40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>manager</b> {{selection}} is generally {{based on a}} resume review, an interview and verbal or written references. This three step selection process has not changed for many years, yet a global online survey conducted {{as part of this}} research shows a low level of stakeholder satisfaction with <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> selected using this process. Considering recent advances in our understanding of <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> effectiveness, improvements in staff selection processes and the impact of the <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> on stakeholder satisfaction, this is unsatisfactory. The objective of this research is to demonstrate that focusing on candidate skills, experience and qualities while conducting a more comprehensive and structured <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> selection process than the conventional three step process of a resume review, candidate interview and reference check results in higher stakeholder satisfaction with the <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> selected. Using a design science approach the author shows that the commonly used three step selection process is unsound due to the incidence of bias in each step and how the low level of satisfaction with current <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> selection processes can be improved. The analysis conducted in this study shows that skills, experience and qualities are the key dimensions that should be examined in order to select a <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> who will meet or exceed stakeholder expectations. This research also shows that a more comprehensive selection process consisting of a role analysis, resume review, personality assessment, structured interview and reference check results in higher stakeholder satisfaction with the selected <b>project</b> <b>manager.</b> These activities were combined into a <b>Project</b> <b>Manager</b> 5 Step Selection Process which was validated using contemporary theory, quantitative techniques and case studies.
