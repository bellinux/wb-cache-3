40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{assessment of}} income {{on the basis}} of approximate indicators as opposed to conventional records. Such a method of assessment, known as presumptive income taxation, is widely used in many developing and industrial countries; however, it has been neglected in public finance literature. In most cases the presumptive approach has been followed for administrative reasons, but this paper argues that more attention should be paid to the efficiency implications of <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxes.</b> Income taxes;Tax administration;Taxation;presumptive taxation, tax system, public finance, <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxes,</b> tax evasion, tax liability, tax reform, tax administrations, tax authorities, taxable income, tax systems, progressive taxation, tax payments, tax collections, fiscal reform, tax officials, tax administrators, tax base, tax rates, tax legislation, fiscal documentation, tax department, optimal taxation, tax policy, tax structure, marginal <b>tax</b> rate, <b>tax</b> <b>assessment,</b> corporate income <b>taxes,</b> marginal tax rates, tax departments, tax return, direct taxation, taxpayer compliance, income tax payments, high tax rates, national tax journal, optimal ? tax, taxpaying population, company income tax, taxation of income, tax incomes, tax on wages, theory of taxation, tax revenue, fiscal affairs, sales taxes, federal tax, income <b>tax</b> system, <b>presumptive</b> income <b>tax,</b> amount of tax, interest payments, tax inspectors, sales tax, tax journal, fiscal affairs department, corporate tax rate...|$|R
40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the efficiency of}} <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> collection system {{and the impact of}} <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> on the viability of Small and Medium Enterprises, using Bindura commuter transport operators as a case study. The major objectives of the study were to establish the reason(s) why Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are subject to <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax,</b> whether there was any relationship between viability of SMEs and the payment of <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> and the effectiveness of Zimbabwe Revenue Authority‟s (ZIMRA) tax awareness campaigns. The study adopted a descriptive research design and questionnaires, interviews and observations were used to collect qualitative data. SSPS version 16 was used to analyse the data. The population consisted of 67 respondents and simple random sampling was used to draw up the sample of 44 respondents for questionnaires and judgemental sampling 5 respondents for interviews. The major results of the study revealed that ZIMRA needs to do more educational campaigns to inform tax payers and that <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> negatively affects the viability of SMEs. Major recommendations included intensification of <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> awareness campaigns by ZIMRA at grassroots level, involvement of transport operators in setting up tax amounts and use of technology to identify <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> defaulters...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a recent need to boost {{internally}} generated revenue in Nigeria due to the fall {{in the price of}} oil, upon which Nigeria has been dependent for revenue. The Nigerian government's attention has been drawn to the massive size of the informal sector from which little or no taxes are being collected. To resolve this discrepancy, it plans to introduce a <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> regime aimed at taxing the firms in the informal sector. In this paper, I analyze the effect of different presumptive taxation policies {{on the size of the}} informal sector, tax revenue, output and welfare. Results show that an assessment in the form of proportional <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> seems to be more efficient than a uniform lump-sum <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax.</b> However, I also show that in certain cases, the optimal policy for a government that cares about inequality would be a proportional <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> with size-based "tax holiday" for informal firms who operate with less than a prescribed capital threshold...|$|R
40|$|The research’s main thrust was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> system in Zimbabwe, case study –Zimra Region One. The research looked at the implementation of the tax head, setting of tax rates, collection of revenue and the views of various stakeholders. In this study 100 ZIMRA staff members, 180 informal traders and 20 local authority staff members formed the main research participants. It was established that the <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> head has not been fully implemented and administered. This has seen it contributing 60 % to the gross domestic product against a 3 % contribution to revenue compared with other tax heads. The principal findings were that many players in the informal sector are oblivious of the existence and objective of the <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> head. In addition, the absence of involvement of the concerned stakeholders in determining tax rates has resulted in spirited resistance. ZIMRA has its own shortcomings which include lack of follow ups and inadequate awareness campaigns. The study revealed that effective implementation and administration of the tax head has the potential of increasing the revenue base. This means there is room for improvement on implementation and administering of the <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax...</b>|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{literature}} on presumptive taxation limits its application to the less-developed economies. In this paper I argue that <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxes</b> are well entrenched in the modern world, although usually not classified as such. <b>Presumptive</b> <b>taxes</b> can take many forms, and can be incorporated in sections of a tax law that is not generally presumptive. The difficulties that developed economies face collecting tax revenues, the rising fear of an intrusive government, and efficiency considerations may all portend a larger role for presumptive taxation - whether or not so designated - in the developing and developed economies. <b>presumptive</b> taxation, tagging, <b>tax</b> administration...|$|R

50|$|The lack of {{provision}} of public goods is attributed {{in turn to}} the lack of revenues and the inefficient and racially biased fiscal system. Sancianco called for the abolition of the tobacco monopoly, the racially discriminatory tribute system, and all customs duties. Instead he proposed a reform of the system of internal taxes that involved the introduction of a small poll tax (cedula) applicable to all regardless of race, and a <b>presumptive</b> <b>tax</b> on urban and rural property, {{as well as on the}} practice of the professions. Sancianco was aware that a tax based on “net income” was a first-best solution, but his proposals were made taking full account of the pragmatic difficulty of accurately determining and assessing net incomes when taxpayers were prone to evasion and tax officials corruptible. Hence he proposed taxes based on observable characteristics, i.e., <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Time Limit for <b>Tax</b> <b>Assessment</b> The thesis {{deals with}} the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> as it is {{regulated}} especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This time limit thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of time limits. It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of time limits. Part Two explains general aspects of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of time limits. Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Chapter Two is divided in ten parts.

40|$|Emission {{reductions}} {{could be}} provided by cleaner technologies as well as substitution towards less polluting inputs and goods. We develop a model to assess the scope for emission reductions by input substitution. We then apply the model to manufacturing in Chile and Indonesia-two developing countries considering air pollution control strategies. We estimate substitutability in input demand in manufacturing [...] using standard techniques-and combine these with emission factors to assess the potential for emission reductions via demand' changes. For sulphur oxides (SO) and suspended particulates (TSP), emission elasticities with respect to the price of heavy fuels range from - 0. 4 to - 1. 2. A price increase of 20 percent would reduce emissions of SOx, and TSP by 8 to 24 percent. While these results indicate how emissions can be reduced by <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxes</b> on fuels-clearing the air as well as the markets for energy-such a strategy preferably should be accompanied by other instruments that stimulate cleaner technologies. Similarly, emission standards should be accompanied by <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxes</b> on goods and inputs. Emission taxes, if feasible, optimally combine inducements along both avenues. ...|$|R
