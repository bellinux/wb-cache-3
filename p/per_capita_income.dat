40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to examine whether trade and/or financial liberalization {{have resulted in the}} acceleration or deceleration of convergence of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> real <b>incomes</b> in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Data for 14 Asian countries, 30 African countries and 20 Latin American countries are available, some of which never liberalized during the period 1970 - 1999. The panel data methodology and the concepts of beta-convergence and sigma-convergence are used for each of the regions. The study concludes that liberalization has accelerated convergence in real <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>incomes</b> to their regional income levels for Asian and Latin American economies while for African countries, liberalization seems to have diverged real <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>incomes</b> from its mean level. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.
