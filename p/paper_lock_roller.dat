50|$|In {{firearms}} operating systems, {{the term}} <b>roller</b> <b>locked</b> refers to locking the bolt with rollers. Notable examples of firearms using this method are the MG42 and Rheinmetall MG3 machineguns, and the CZ 52 pistol.|$|R
50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is an automatic, {{air-cooled}} belt-fed weapon {{operated by}} roller-delayed blowback and fires {{from an open}} bolt. The machine gun's bolt differs from other contemporary designs employing the short recoil method of operation (such as CETME and Heckler & Koch designed weapons), being a 3-piece design that consists of a bolt head with two <b>locking</b> <b>rollers,</b> a striker sleeve and the bolt carrier which is connected telescopically with the bolt head. When a round is chambered pressure from the return spring drives the bolt and carrier assembly forward; simultaneously both rollers engage camming surfaces which drive the rollers outward from their compressed travel position into recesses in the barrel extension. Upon firing, the bolt carrier and striker assembly recoil to the rear and the geometry of the fixed camming surfaces drives the rollers inward unlocking the bolt breech and increasing {{the speed at which}} the striker sleeve withdraws relative to the bolt. As the slower bolt continues rearward it impacts the returning striker sleeve (this impact decelerates the bolt).|$|R
50|$|The delay {{results from}} {{the amount of time}} it takes for enough recoil energy to be {{transferred}} through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber {{for a short period of}} time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4 mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the <b>locking</b> <b>rollers</b> are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.|$|R

30|$|We {{have shown}} in this paper that Reed-Solomon codes are good {{candidates}} for designing efficient steganographic schemes. They enable to mix wet <b>papers</b> (<b>locked</b> positions) and simple syndrome coding (small number of changes) in order to face not only passive but also active wardens. If we compare them to the previous studied codes, as binary BCH codes, Reed-Solomon codes improve the management of locked positions during embedding, hence ensuring a better management of the distortion; {{they are able to}} lock twice the number of positions. Moreover, they are optimal {{in the sense that they}} enable to lock the maximal number of positions. We first provide an efficient way to do it through Lagrange interpolation. We then propose a new algorithm based on Guruswami-Sudan list decoding, which is slower but provides an adaptive tradeoff between the number of locked positions and the average number of changes.|$|R

30|$|The use of {{syndrome}} coding in steganographic schemes {{tends to}} reduce distortion during embedding. The more complete model {{comes from the}} wet papers (J.

First, a simple and efficient scheme based on Lagrange interpolation is provided to achieve the optimal number of locked positions. We also consider a new and more general problem, mixing wet <b>papers</b> (<b>locked</b> positions) and simple syndrome coding (low number of changes) in order to face not only passive but also active wardens.
