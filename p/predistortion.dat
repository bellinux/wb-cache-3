The deployment of higher modulation formats (> 4QAM) or higher Baud rates (> 32 GBaud) diminishes the system performance due to linear and non-linear transmitter effects. These effects can be categorised in linear distortions due to DAC bandwidth limitation and transmitter I/Q skew as well as non-linear effects caused by gain saturation in the driver amplifier and the Mach-Zehnder modulator. Digital <b>predistortion</b> counteracts the degrading effects and enables Baud rates up to 56 GBaud and modulation formats like 64QAM and 128QAM with the commercially available components.

50|$|As a form {{of phase}} shift keying is used to {{transmit}} data during each burst, it would seem reasonable to expect the transmit power to be constant. However it is not. This is because the sidebands, which are essentially a repetition of the data in the main carrier's modulation, are filtered off with a sharp filter so that unnecessary spectrum is not used up. This results in an amplitude modulation and is why TETRA requires linear amplifiers. The resulting ratio of peak to mean (RMS) power is 3.65 dB. If non-linear (or not-linear enough) amplifiers are used, the sidebands re-appear and cause interference on adjacent channels. Commonly used techniques for achieving the necessary linearity include Cartesian loops, and adaptive <b>predistortion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Multidimensional Digital Pre-distortion (MDDPD), often {{referred}} to as multiband digital pre-distortion (MBDPD), is a subset of digital <b>predistortion</b> (DPD) that enables DPD to be applied to signals (channels) that cannot or do not pass through the same digital pre-distorter but do concurrently pass through the same nonlinear system. Its ability to do so comes from the portion of multidimensional signal theory that deals with one dimensional discrete time vector input - 1-D discrete time vector output systems as defined in Multidimensional Digital Signal Processing. [...] The first paper in which it found application was in 1991 as seen here.

50|$|Although class-A power {{amplifiers}} (PA) are best {{in terms of}} linearity, their efficiency is rather poor as compared with other amplification classes such as “AB”, “C” and Doherty amplifiers. However, higher efficiency leads to higher nonlinearity and PA output will be distorted, often to extent that fails the system performance requirements. Therefore, class-AB {{power amplifiers}} or other variations are used with some suitable form of linearization schemes such as feedback, feedforward or analog or digital <b>predistortion</b> (DPD). In DPD power amplifier systems, the transfer characteristics of the amplifier are modeled by sampling {{the output of the}} PA and the inverse characteristics are calculated in a DSP processor. The digital baseband signal is multiplied by the inverse of PA nonlinear transfer characteristics, up-converted to RF frequencies and is applied to the PA input. With careful design of PA response, the DPD engines can correct the PA output distortion and achieve higher efficiencies.|$|E
50|$|In {{low level}} {{modulation}} a small audio stage {{is used to}} modulate a low power stage. The output of this stage is then amplified using a linear RF amplifier. The great disadvantage of this system is that the amplifier chain is less efficient, because {{it has to be}} linear to preserve the modulation. Hence high efficiency class C amplifiers cannot be employed, unless a Doherty amplifier, EER (Envelope Elimination and Restoration) or other methods of <b>predistortion</b> or negative feedback are used. High level modulation uses class C amplifiers in a broadcast AM transmitter and only the final stage or final two stages are modulated, and all the earlier stages can be driven at a constant level. When modulation is applied to the plate of the final tube, a large audio amplifier is needed for the modulation stage, equal to 1/2 of the DC input power of the modulated stage. Traditionally the modulation is applied using a large audio transformer. However many different circuits have been used for high level AM modulation. See Amplitude Modulation.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid Digital/RF Envelope <b>Predistortion</b> Linearization for High Power Amplifiers in Wireless Communication Systems Wangmyong Woo 151 Pages Directed by Dr. J. Stevenson Kenney The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to implement a hybrid digital/RF envelope <b>predistortion</b> linearization system for high-power amplifiers used in wireless communication systems. It is well known that RF PAs have AM/AM (amplitude modulation) and AM/PM (phase modulation) nonlinear characteristics. Moreover, the distortion components generated by a PA are not constant, but vary as a function of many input conditions such as amplitude, signal bandwidth, self-heating, aging, etc. Memory effects in response to past inputs cause a hysteresis in the nonlinear transfer characteristics of a PA. This hysteresis, in turn, creates uncertainty in predictive linearization techniques. To cope with these nonlinear characteristics, distortion variability, and uncertainty in linearization, an adaptive digital <b>predistortion</b> technique, a hybrid digital/RF envelope <b>predistortion</b> technique, an analog-based RF envelope <b>predistortion</b> technique, and a combinational digital/analog <b>predistortion</b> technique have been developed. A digital adaptation technique based on the error vector minimization of received PA output waveforms was developed. Also, an adaptive baseband-to-baseband test system for the characterization of RF PAs and for the validation of linearization algorithms was implemented in conjunction with the adaptation technique. To overcome disadvantages such as limited correction bandwidth and the need for a baseband input signal in digital <b>predistortion,</b> an adaptive, wideband RF envelope <b>predistortion</b> system was developed that incorporates a memoryless <b>predistortion</b> algorithm. This system is digitally controlled by a look-up table (LUT). Compared with conventional baseband digital approaches, this <b>predistortion</b> architecture has a correction bandwidth that is from 20 percent to 33 percent wider at the same clock speeds for third to fifth order IMDs and does not need a digital baseband input signal. For more accurate <b>predistortion</b> linearization for PAs with memory effects, an RF envelope <b>predistortion</b> system has been developed that uses a combination of analog-based envelope <b>predistortion</b> (APD) working in conjunction with digital LUT-based adaptive envelope <b>predistortion</b> (DPD).

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method of digital <b>predistortion</b> {{suitable}} for wideband high crest factor applications such as those encountered in DAB, DVB-T and WCDMA transmitters. The proposed method is advantageous for four main reasons. Firstly, it utilizes a reliable frequency domain measure of transmitter output nonlinearity, specifically the Weighted Adjacent Channel Power (WACP), as the objective for <b>predistortion</b> filter parameter estimation. This is in direct contrast to traditional approaches which utilize a time domain measure obtained via a full feedback path and potentially corrupted by gain and phase compensation error as well as ADC distortion. Secondly, the method models <b>predistortion</b> filter parameter estimation as a generic nonlinear mathematical optimization problem. This model assumes a non-convex objective function and therefore utilizes both global and local optimization algorithms to achieve true global convergence. This is once again in direct contrast to traditional approaches which model <b>predistortion</b> filter parameter estimation as a linear regression problem. Such a model incorrectly assumes a convex error surface and therefore restricts itself to inadequate local optimization algorithms which unfortunately cannot guarantee true global convergence. Thirdly, the method's <b>predistortion</b> filter is a pruned Volterra Series with memory which utilizes a hybrid pruning strategy {{in order to keep}} high order kernels to a practically manageable size, suitable for optimization parameter estimation. <b>Predistortion</b> filter memory ultimately makes the method highly suited to wideband applications.
