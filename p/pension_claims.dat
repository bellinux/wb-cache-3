25|$|However, Chancellor Wythe's {{decisions}} were modified or overruled many times, particularly by {{the appeals court}} that his former student Spencer Roane joined in 1794. In 1795, Wythe published analyses {{of some of his}} cases and subsequent appellate decisions, and added a few more pamphlets later. Although this publication offended Pendleton, he decided against replying in kind. One of Wythe's most famous decisions (unpopular at the time), Page v. Pendleton, upheld the authority of the 1783 federal peace treaty with Great Britain which required debts to British merchants be paid under the contract terms, although Virginia had passed a law (used by Edmund Pendleton and other executors of the will of Speaker John Robinson discussed above) that allowed payment in depreciated paper currency. In Roane v. Innes, Wythe upheld revolutionary war soldiers's <b>pension</b> <b>claims,</b> but was reversed. Pendleton died in 1803, just before he could deliver an opinion attempting to reverse Wythe in Turpin v. Lockett, which dealt with the sale of the disestablished church's glebe lands, nominally at least to support the poor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{priority}} list in insolvency sees creditors with fixed security (typically banks) get paid first. Second are preferential creditors. Third are unsecured creditors up to {{a limit of}} £600,000. Fourth are floating charge holders (usually banks again). Fifth are remaining debts to unsecured creditors (in the unlikely event that anything remains). Sixth are [...] "deferred debts" [...] (typically to company insiders). Last are shareholders. Among the preferential creditors, the insolvency practitioners' fees together with adopted contracts attain super-priority. Otherwise, employees wages and pensions still have preferential status, but only up to an £800 limit, a figure which has remained unchanged since 1986. Employees having priority among creditors, albeit not above fixed security holders, dates back to 1897, and is justified {{on the ground that}} employees are particularly incapable, unlike banks, of diversifying their risk, and forms one of the requirements in the ILO Protection of Workers' Claims (Employer's Insolvency) Convention. Often this limited preference is not enough, and can {{take a long time to}} realise. Reflecting the Insolvency Protection Directive under ERA 1996 section 166 any employee may lodge a claim with the National Insurance Fund for outstanding wages. Under ERA 1996 section 182 the amount claimable is the same as that for unfair dismissal (£350 in 2010) for a limit of 8 weeks. If an employee has been unpaid for a longer period, she may choose the most beneficial 8 weeks. The Pensions Act 2004 governs a separate system for protecting <b>pension</b> <b>claims,</b> through the Pension Protection Fund. This aims to fully insure all <b>pension</b> <b>claims.</b> Together with minimum redundancy payments, the guarantees of wages form a meagre cushion which requires more of a systematic supplementation when people remain unemployed.|$|E
2500|$|UK law grants the {{greatest}} protection to banks or other parties that contract for a security interest. If a security is [...] "fixed" [...] over a particular asset, this gives priority in being paid over other creditors, including employees and most {{small businesses that}} have traded with the insolvent company. A [...] "floating charge", which is not permitted in many countries and remains controversial in the UK, can sweep up all future assets, but the holder is subordinated in statute to a limited sum of employees' wage and <b>pension</b> <b>claims,</b> and around 20 per cent for other unsecured creditors. Security interests have to be publicly registered, {{on the theory that}} transparency will assist commercial creditors in understanding a company's financial position before they contract. However the law still allows [...] "title retention clauses" [...] and [...] "Quistclose trusts" [...] which function just like security but {{do not have to be}} registered. Secured creditors generally dominate insolvency procedures, because a floating charge holder can select the administrator of its choice. In law, administrators are meant to prioritise rescuing a company, and owe a duty to all creditors. In practice, these duties are seldom found to be broken, and the most typical outcome is that an insolvent company's assets are sold as a going concern to a new buyer, which can often include the former management: but free from creditors' claims and potentially with many job losses. Other possible procedures include a [...] "voluntary arrangement", if three quarters of creditors can voluntarily agree to give the company a debt haircut, receivership in a limited number of enterprise types, and liquidation where a company's assets are finally sold off. Enforcement rates by insolvency practitioners remain low, but in theory an administrator or liquidator can apply for transactions at an undervalue to be cancelled, or unfair preferences to some creditors be revoked. Directors can be sued for breach of duty, or disqualified, including negligently trading a company when it could not have avoided insolvency. Insolvency law's basic principles still remain significantly contested, and its rules show a compromise of conflicting views.|$|E

We find that increasing the full retirement age (FRA) by one year delays labor market exit by 4 to 6 months, affecting women who leave the labor force at the FRA. Increasing the FRA by one year delays claiming of retirement benefits by 6 to 8 months. Doubling the early retirement penalty, from 3. 4 % to 6. 8 %, delays <b>pension</b> <b>claiming</b> by almost 4 months but {{has no effect on}} labor market exit.

30|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{quantify}} the role that Social Security provisions for old-age pensions play in the retirement decision of Spanish workers and to evaluate the effects of the 2002 reform.

40|$|Empirical {{analyses}} {{of the effects of}} public and private pensions on household saving impose strong assumptions in order to obtain a tractable empirical model: fixed retirement and <b>pension</b> <b>claiming</b> ages, no borrowing constraint, little or no uncertainty, and no institutional restrictions on <b>pension</b> <b>claiming.</b> I specify a richer version of the life cycle model that relaxes these assumptions. I calibrate, solve, and simulate the model and use the results to study three issues: (1) How much household wealth is crowded out by pensions? (2) Can linear regression analysis accurately estimate the magnitude of crowdout when the assumptions used in the empirical analysis are invalid? (3) How valuable are pensions to households? Simulation results indicate that private pensions in the US crowd out less than $ 0. 15 of household saving per dollar of pension wealth. Crowdout by Social Security is larger at $ 0. 33, but far smaller than the one-for-one offset predicted by a stylized version of the life cycle model. Regression estimates of crowdout using the simulated data are systematically larger than simulated crowdout, indicating that empirical estimates of crowdout are quite sensitive to the assumptions required in order to use the regression approach. The welfare analysis implies that, conditional on Social Security, DB pensions are worth less than their expected present discounted value to households, while DC pensions are worth more than their dollar value. In the absence of a private pension, Social Security is worth 50 % more to households than its expected dollar value. pensions, saving, retirement...|$|R

40|$|A {{specific}} {{attention is}} devoted to the 55 + age group when building global labour force projections regularly updated by Insee. This requires taking into account individual heterogeneity, because the impact of pension reforms on behavior is potentially very different across individuals. For instance, increasing to 62 the minimum age of eligibility, as decided in 2010, will be neutral for people who already planned to retire after this age. It will be constraining for other people, but the impact on global labour force will depend upon employment status before retirement: postponing <b>pension</b> <b>claiming</b> for individuals who have already left the labour market does not affect this labour force, at least {{as long as it does}} not change labour market behavior before retirement age. Simulating individual transitions to retirement raises however considerable problems, to which models only bring imperfect and uncertain answers. This argues in favor of scenarized projections based on alternative assumptions. We present here results based on three options offered by the Destinie 2 microsimulation model. Depending upon these assumptions, cumulated impacts of past reforms on labour force participation rates for the 60 - 64 age group range, in the long run, between 10 and 40 %, but starting from no-reform trends that are themselves very different from one scenario to the next. On the whole, after reforms, the long run labour force participation rate for the 60 - 64 group would lie within the 40 %- 50 % bracket. This corresponds to mean ages at <b>pension</b> <b>claiming</b> lying between 64 and 65 years, and to mean ages at exit from the labour force fluctuating between 61 and 63 years, depending upon possible retroactions on career paths before full retirement. pension reform, age at retirement, microsimulation, labour force projection...|$|R
