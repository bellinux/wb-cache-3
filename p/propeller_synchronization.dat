50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{provide a}} visual indicator of <b>propeller</b> <b>synchronization</b> in the cockpit. Pilots {{can use this}} indicator {{to decide whether or}} not to engage <b>propeller</b> <b>synchronization,</b> or to help them synchronize propeller speeds manually.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, <b>propeller</b> <b>synchronization</b> is a {{mechanism}} that automatically synchronizes all propellers of a multi-engine, propeller-driven aircraft {{so that they}} rotate at the same speed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propeller</b> <b>synchronization</b> serves {{mainly to}} {{increase}} the comfort of crew and passengers, since its primary purpose {{is to reduce the}} “beats” generated by propellers that are turning at slightly different speeds. These beats can become very irritating to persons inside the aircraft after a time. Synchronization is not normally necessary for proper operation of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|His {{hydraulic}} machine gun synchronization gear allowed airplane-mounted guns to shoot between the spinning blades of the <b>propeller.</b> The Constantinesco <b>synchronization</b> gear (or [...] "CC" [...] gear) {{was first used}} operationally on the D.H.4s of No. 55 squadron R.F.C. from March 1917, during World War I, and rapidly became standard equipment, replacing a variety of mechanical gears. It continued {{to be used by}} the Royal Air Force until World War II - the Gloster Gladiator being the last British fighter to be equipped with [...] "CC" [...] gear.|$|R
50|$|It is {{assembled}} {{from six}} modules : accessory gearbox, compressor, combustor, gas-generator turbine, power turbine and propeller gearbox.The FADEC provides torque-limiting protection, <b>propeller</b> <b>synchronization,</b> auto-propeller feathering and auto-relight.It could have powered growth {{versions of the}} Beech Starship or Piaggio Avanti.A large-diameter bore hole running through the compressor and turbines allow a concentric shaft to connect the power turbine to a front-mounted gearbox to convert it to a tractor configuration.|$|E
5000|$|Operation of <b>propeller</b> <b>synchronization</b> {{can occur}} with a master/slave {{approach}} {{or with a}} push/pull technique associated with Type II systems. In Type II systems speed is increased for the side lower in RPM {{while at the same}} time speed is decreased on the faster RPM side. The net result is similar, but there is no master or slave, and no minute hunting typical of a Type I (master/slave) system. With a Type II system RPM cannot be reduced below manual speed settings so prop sync does not need to be [...] "Off" [...] during takeoff and landing. Type I systems MUST be off for takeoff and landings.|$|E
40|$|The {{in-flight}} {{evaluation of}} noise control treatments for a light, twin-engined turboprop aircraft presents several {{problems associated with}} data analysis and interpretation. These problems include data repeatability, <b>propeller</b> <b>synchronization,</b> spatial distributions of the exterior pressure field and acoustic treatment, {{and the presence of}} flanking paths. They are discussed here with regard to a specific aeroplane configuration. Measurements were made in an untreated cabin and in a cabin fitted with an experimental sidewall treatment. Results are presented in terms of the insertion loss provided by the treatment and comparison made with predictions based on laboratory measurements...|$|E
40|$|In many applications, {{such as in}} {{propeller}} aircraft, the dominating {{noise is}} periodic. Successful reduction of the periodic noise components {{can be achieved by}} using an Active Noise Control (ANC) system based on feedforward techniques. In this paper, a comparison between the performance of single [...] reference (single-tacho) and multiple [...] reference (twin-tacho) feedforward control systems is presented. The comparison is made for two different flight conditions, both with and without synchronized propellers. The evaluation results show that a multiple [...] reference controller provides better performance than a single [...] reference controller when a slight deviation exists in the <b>propeller</b> <b>synchronization...</b>|$|E
