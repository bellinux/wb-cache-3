5|$|On May 28 and 29 of 1959 (exactly {{one year}} after the Zürich ALGOL 58 meeting), a meeting was held at the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>to</b> discuss the {{creation}} of a common programming language for business. It was attended by 41 people and was chaired by Phillips. The Department of Defense was concerned about whether it could run the same data processing programs on different computers. FORTRAN, the only mainstream language at the time, lacked the features needed to write such programs.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{diagnosed}} with cancer, Scully is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition {{is a result of}} her earlier abduction ("Ascension"), and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. He is dissuaded by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who secretly makes such a deal instead. While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body. He uses the distraction this offers to infiltrate The <b>Pentagon</b> <b>to</b> find a cure for Scully's cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI.|$|E
5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into Saudi Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia, such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from The <b>Pentagon</b> <b>to</b> be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E

Goldwater was instrumental in pushing the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>to</b> support desegregation of the armed services.|$|E
25|$|In January 2016, President Obama sent a {{directive}} to the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>to</b> {{make it easier}} for the military to get approval for strikes in Afghanistan, targeting militias that have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State. For 3 weeks in that month, the United States military carried out at least a dozen operations, including commando raids and airstrikes, many of these raids and strikes taking place in the Tora Bora region of Nangarhar Province. American commanders in Afghanistan said they believed that between 90 and 100 Islamic State militants had been killed in these recent operations.|$|E

His former platoon members Ray Compton, Neil Haffey and Larry Gibson, whose lives he saved, sought to correct the oversight and renewed their efforts {{in favor of a}} Medal of Honor for Rascon. The Pentagon would not reconsider Rascon's case because so much time had elapsed. Therefore, Rascon's comrades sought the help of Congressman Lane Evans from Illinois. In 1997, Evans gave President Bill Clinton a packet containing the information about Rascon. The President then convinced the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>to</b> reopen the case.|$|E

On 27 September 2007, the GAO announced that it had denied Raytheon's protest, thereby allowing the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>to</b> proceed with procurement; at this time, the U.S. Army had requirement for up to 75 aircraft in the Army National Guard; the Air Force had a requirement for up to 70 aircraft in the Air Force Special Operations Command and the Air National Guard. The first C-27J was to be scheduled to be delivered to the joint U.S. Army–Air Force test and training program in June 2008; the first flight of a U.S. C-27J occurred on 17 June 2008.|$|E

The LAS contract {{was developed by the}} <b>Pentagon</b> <b>to</b> supply Afghanistan’s military with 20 planes, which should ensure air superiority in the country after the majority of US forces leave. Because the contract is a foreign military sale, Nevada-based SNC and Brazil-based Embraer deliver the planes to the Air Force, which then passes them on to the Afghan military. The first of 20 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft arrived at Moody Air Force Base on September 26, 2014 in preparation for the Afghanistan pilot and maintenance training mission.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, {{he became}} Chief of the Army Ordnance Technical Intelligence teams {{assigned}} to Europe {{to seek out}} and evaluate captured enemy ordnance weapons and equipment. During this time, Toftoy received a request from Colonel Gervais Trichel, chief of the rocket branch in the Ordnance Department at the <b>Pentagon,</b> <b>to</b> acquire and ship 100 operational V-2 rockets to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico for testing. Soon after the capture of the area around Nordhausen and the Mittelwerk, Toftoy set up Special Mission V-2 to do the job. He assigned Major William Bromley {{in command of the}} special mission, and he reported back to Toftoy through Major James P. Hammill, who was responsible for shipping the weapons from Nordhausen to Antwerp, and from there to New Orleans. Bromley and Hamill went to central Germany to salvage as many missiles as they could, under pressure because of the unwelcome news that U.S. forces would be withdrawing soon. Although there were by no means a hundred complete V-2s available, Toftoy organized U.S soldiers and camp workers to put partially completed rockets and major components into hastily requisitioned rail cars. From 22 to 31 May, several freight trains left Nordhausen for Antwerp loaded with missile and missile parts; thus successfully completing the mission.|$|E
