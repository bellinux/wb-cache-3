5|$|The Comet's second fatal {{accident}} occurred on 2 May 1953, when BOAC Flight 783, a Comet 1, registered G-ALYV, crashed in a severe thundersquall six minutes after {{taking off from}} Calcutta-Dum Dum (now Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport), India, killing all 43 on board. Witnesses observed the wingless Comet on fire <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the village of Jagalgori, leading investigators to suspect structural failure.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} prime ministerial {{debate was}} organised by the state-owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in Tampere and included the chairpersons {{of the four}} parties leading in the opinion polls. The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate; {{the leaders of the}} governing coalition, Katainen and Kiviniemi, defended Finland's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis-ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries. As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties, Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt-ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their own debt restructuring. Urpilainen was not entirely against emergency measures aimed at saving these countries, but insisted that the major European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees. Soini continued his criticism of the euro, reiterating that no referendum was ever called on the currency union — he remained steadfast on his party's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on the issue. On other economic issues, Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders. Urpilainen and, initially, also Katainen were willing to make cuts on military spending; Soini, however, contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration-related expenses.|$|E

50|$|On {{a manual}} milling machine, the {{micrometer}} adjustment nut limits the depth {{to which the}} cutting tool may <b>plunge</b> <b>into</b> the workpiece. It is located on a threaded rod on the mill head. The machine operator moves it up or down by rotating it clockwise (to move it down) or counter-clockwise (to move it up). Moving the nut down increases the depth to which the cutting tool may <b>plunge</b> <b>into</b> the workpiece. Moving the nut up reduces the depth to which the cutting tool may <b>plunge</b> <b>into</b> the workpiece.|$|R

25|$|The Shropshire Union Canal {{is just to}} {{the east}} of the site and it is {{believed}} that the canal fooled some of the new pilots during night-time training. At least one aircraft, an American P-47 Thunderbolt ended up in the canal, though this was down to an engine failure with the aircraft undershooting the airfield and <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the canal. Whilst the pilot avoided serious injury, the aircraft was dragged out of the canal and scrapped.|$|E
25|$|The First Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 5, is a four-movement {{work from}} 1901–3 {{suggesting}} {{the style of}} Scriabin or Rachmaninoff, but nonetheless original. Medtner's craft gained subtlety and complexity in later years, but this work is already evidence of his mastery of musical structure. An opening Allegro, dramatic and imbued like much Russian music with a bell-like sonority, is separated by a Intermezzo from a Largo divoto that reaches a Maestoso climax before <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the headlong Allegro risoluto finale.|$|E

25|$|While {{flying over}} the fields of {{northern}} Belgium, onlookers saw the plane catch fire before losing altitude and <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the ground. As the aircraft began its descent, a passenger was seen to exit the aeroplane and fall to earth without a parachute. He was later identified as Dr Albert Voss, a German who had emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he practised as a dentist in Manchester. Just before crashing, at approximately , the aircraft split into two sections which hit the ground separately, instantly killing all those still on board.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday 5 January 1975, a {{disaster}} occurred in Hobart when the handyweight {{bulk ore carrier}} MV Lake Illawarra collided with the Tasman Bridge in what would later {{be referred to as}} the Tasman Bridge disaster. The ship crashed into pylon 19, and then bounced across to strike pylon 18, knocking both pylons down, and also causing a 127-metre section of steel and concrete roadway to collapse onto the deck of the ship. The Illawarra sank, killing seven crew, and five motorists were killed when they drove off the gap, <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the river below.|$|E
25|$|During the 1991 close season, Ferguson's {{assistant}} Archie Knox departed to Rangers {{to become}} assistant to Walter Smith, and Ferguson promoted youth team coach Brian Kidd {{to the role}} of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also made two major signings – goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and defender Paul Parker – to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990–91 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of Lee Sharpe, who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added the Ukrainian Andrei Kanchelskis to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders Mike Phelan and Bryan Robson.|$|E

25|$|The full Grand Prix Circuit {{begins on}} the Brabham Straight, an off-camber, {{slightly}} curved stretch, before <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the right-hander at Paddock Hill Bend. Despite {{the difficulty of}} the curve, due to the straight that precedes it, {{it is one of the}} track's few overtaking spots. The next corner, Druids, is a hairpin bend, negotiated after an uphill braking zone at Hailwood Hill. The track then curves around the south bank spectator area into the downhill, off-camber Graham Hill Bend, and another, slightly bent stretch at the Cooper Straight, which runs parallel to the pit lane. After the straight, the circuit climbs uphill though the decreasing-radius Surtees turn, before moving onto the back straight where the track's top speeds can be reached. The most significant elevation changes on the circuit occur here at Pilgrim's Drop and Hawthorn Hill, which leads into Hawthorn Bend. The track then loops around the woodland with a series of mid-speed corners, most notably the dip at Westfield and Dingle Dell and the blind Sheene curve. From there the track then emerges from the left hand and cambered Stirlings Bend onto the short straight to Clearways and rejoins the Indy Circuit for Clark Curve with its uphill off-camber approach to the pit straight and the start/finish line.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} B-movie companies of the 1980s was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era, Troma Pictures, founded in 1974. Troma's most characteristic productions, including Class of Nuke 'Em High (1986), Redneck Zombies (1986), and Surf Nazis Must Die (1987), take exploitation for an absurdist spin. Troma also built on another B-studio tradition: re-releasing the often embarrassing early films of actors turning into major stars. In 1986, the company acquired and distributed two unreleased films, Sizzle Beach U.S.A. (shot in 1974) and Shadows Run Black (shot in 1981), capitalizing on performances by Kevin Costner, who had recently appeared in the popular Silverado (1985) and was set to headline The Untouchables (1987). Troma's best-known production is The Toxic Avenger (1985), whose hero, after <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> a vat of toxic waste while attempting to escape a loathsome gang of tormentors, mutates into a hideous creature with enhanced physical strength and revenge on what's left of his mind. After the film's successful release, the character, affectionately known as Toxie, became the symbol of Troma and an icon of the 1980s B movie. One of the few successful B-studio startups of the decade was Rome-based Empire Pictures, whose first production, Ghoulies, reached theaters in 1985. Despite other profitable ventures such as Re-Animator (1985), financial difficulties forced the company's American founder to sell it off in 1988.|$|E

500|$|Zennor Head {{is located}} on the north coast of Cornwall, England, facing the Atlantic Ocean. A {{headland}} extending some , it is surrounded by steep cliffs <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the sea below. It is west of the town of St Ives, and north-east of the town of Penzance. The nearest human settlement is the village of Zennor, and the headland is flanked by two coves, Pendour and Porthzennor. The nearest headland is Gurnard's Head, 1.6 kilometres to the west. Access is from the South West Coast Path, or the B3306 road (West Cornwall coast road). There is a deep inlet known as Horseback [...] on the western side, where seabirds nest. The headland is topped by an Ordnance Survey [...] "Trig Point".|$|E
500|$|The Sunol Water Temple {{is located}} at 505 Paloma Way in Sunol, California.

Inside the temple, water originally from the Pleasanton well fields and Arroyo de la Laguna flowed into a white tiled cistern before <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> a deeper water channel carrying water from the filter galleries to the Niles Aqueduct in Niles Canyon and across San Francisco Bay near the Dumbarton Bridge.

500|$|The {{lighthouse}} at {{the foot}} of the cliff came into operation in October 1902. Although originally manned by two keepers, it has been remotely monitored by Trinity House via a landline since June 1983. Prior to its construction, shipping had been warned by the Belle Tout lighthouse on the cliff top some 1,640 yards (1,500 m) to the west. Belle Tout lighthouse was operational from 1834 to 1902, and closed because its light was not visible in mist and low cloud. It became a private residence, but was severely damaged in the Second World War by Canadian artillery. In 1956, it was rebuilt as a house and remains a dwelling to this day. In March 1999, the structure was moved [...] back from the cliff edge to save it from <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the sea.The structure may need to be moved again to safeguard it from cliff erosion.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{pressures}} on his time, Heber set out again on 30 January 1826, this time heading south for Madras (now Chennai), Pondicherry, Tanjore (Thanjavur) and ultimately Travancore. One reason for the tour {{was to examine the}} issue of caste, which persisted in the church in South India. In Tanjore on Easter Day, 26 March 1826, Heber preached to more than 1300, and on the following day conducted a confirmation service for a large Tamil congregation. On 1 April he moved on to Trichinopoly (Tiruchirappalli) where, next day, he confirmed 42 people. On 3 April, after attending an early-morning service at which he gave a blessing in the Tamil language, Heber returned to his bungalow for a cold bath. Immediately after <b>plunging</b> <b>into</b> the water he died, possibly from the shock of the cold water in the intense heat. Watson records that a contemporary engraving shows his body [...] "being carried from the bath by his servant and chaplain, the latter immaculately attired in a frock coat and top hat". His funeral was held the next day at St John's church, where he had preached his final sermon; he was buried within the church, {{on the north side of}} the altar.|$|E

The German artillery fired {{all the way to}} the rear of the New Zealand divisional area and machine-gun barrages from the German pillboxes raked the advance. The division captured the cemetery at Wallemolen and reached Wolf Copse, the right of the advance stopping on the rise astride the Ravebeek creek. North of the Gravenstafel–Metcheele road, the division gained some ground but was stopped by belts of barbed wire [...] deep and were swept by machine-gun fire. The infantry tried to cut their way through the wire of the German [...] on the Wallemolen spur and small numbers of troops got through both belts but were killed after being stopped by more wire around the German pillboxes.
