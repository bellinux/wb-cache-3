5000|$|Sir Henry’s final posting was as Governor and Commander-in-Chief Malta. He {{arrived in}} Malta on 28 September 1888 and within one month he had founded Royal Malta; with a clubhouse in St Anne’s Ditch and a 9-hole course laid {{out around the}} bastions (better known as the Hornworks) of Valletta. Not much of a golf course - with {{practically}} no turf and with 'greens' of <b>puzzolana</b> concrete, covered with sand to give the ball some stop. The so-called fairways {{were no more than}} 20 yards wide stone walls, in some cases 150 feet high, on both sides. The ball could either ricochet from one side to another or become lodged in the battlements. At least this form of golf satisfied the voracious appetite for golf of the servicemen stationed on the island. Fortunately some photographs of this unique course still survive and are {{on the wall of the}} club house. Golf was also apparently played at the Mosta garrisons but no record of this 'course' exist.|$|E
40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{survey of}} over 1000 of samples {{of concrete and}} masonry mortars from structures in the Netherlands shows that, in practice, self healing occurs in historic lime and lime – <b>puzzolana</b> mortars, in contrast to modern cement bound concretes and mortars. Self healing may be effected by the formation of either new Ca-carbonate, CaCO 3, or portlandite, Ca(OH) 2. The latter may represent a precursor stage to final self healing producing CaCO 3, which has a larger molar volume than portlandite; transition from the possibly initially formed CaCO 3 -polymorph vaterite will, however, involve a slight decrease in volume. In the paper, compositions and external conditions of samples clearly showing self healing will be evaluated. In addition, it is discussed whether the observed self healing phenomena should be desired, i. e. whether internal mass transfer in the material resulting in the healing does not imply weakening of deeper zones of the material...|$|E

New {{generation}} fly ashes are a {{produced during}} coal combustion in fluidized bed furnaces with simultaneous sulphur removal from the gas. This process is held at temperature of about 850 degrees of Celsius. The generated ashes basically {{differ in their}} physicochemical properties from traditional silica ashes. Fluidal ashes produced during lignite combustion consist of active <b>puzzolana</b> {{in the form of}} dehydrated clayey minerals and active components activating the process of hydration of, e. g. CaO, anhydrite II and CaCO 3 ashes. The paper presents the results of laboratory analyses of the influence of ashes coming from the combustion of lignite on technological properties of fresh and set sealing slurries based on drilling cement.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 146 - 162) The st {{subject of}} t:his paper is the historical account of t"he development {{of concrete and}} its use in architecture from early Roman times to its "re-discovery" by John Smeaton in t. he eighteenth century. Vitruvius had written down the precepts for concrete {{by the beginning of}} t. he first century B. C. Due to the special qualities of <b>puzzolana.</b> Roman mortar contained a tenacity which made it last for the basic structural principle derived by deductions based on experience and observation, was that the stability of a vaulted structure did not depend upon friction or pressure as in vaults constructed of cut stone, but upon the cohesion and homogeneity of the Roman concrete mass. In the centuries following the fall of Rome's Western Empire, brick and stone supplanted concrete. The waning of concrete architecture in Medieval Europe was due in part to a general lack of knowledge regarding the calcination and slacking of limestone. It was also {{due to a lack of}} understanding statical theory. With the Renaissance, dome construction required a new application of the knowledge of statics and its relevance to the strength of arches. The scientific revolution of the seventeenth century inspired the investigation of ancient Roman cement. John Smeaton' s Edystone Lighthouse in the eighteenth century provided a basis upon which all future concrete construction could proceed. Not until the twentieth century, however, were engineers and architects capable of creating an architecture applicable to concrete which expressed statically tested data of the material in aesthetically new ways...|$|E
