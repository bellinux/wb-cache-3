25|$|Intermediate {{product from}} the first section is baled bottle waste with a PET content greater than 90%. Most common trading form is the bale but also bricked or even loose, pre-cut bottles are common in the market. In the second section, the {{collected}} bottles are converted to clean <b>PET</b> <b>bottle</b> flakes. This step can {{be more or less}} complex and complicated depending on required final flake quality. During the third step, <b>PET</b> <b>bottle</b> flakes are processed to any kind of products like film, bottles, fiber, filament, strapping or intermediates like pellets for further processing and engineering plastics.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} the {{consumption}} of <b>PET</b> <b>bottle</b> flakes, the main portion of about 70% is converted to fibers and filaments. When using directly secondary materials such as bottle flakes in spinning processes, {{there are a few}} processing principles to obtain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} containers (<b>PET</b> <b>bottles)</b> are recycled into {{fibers and}} sheets, but the complicated process requires {{a high level}} of technology and large cost resulting in a low recycling rate of PET. Weight reduction of concrete has been demanded for certain uses. In view of this, lightweight concrete embedding raw <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> is conceivable. It may be used for void slabs and lightweight wall panels for dwelling units. Also such bottles filled with functional materials can add a new function to concrete. In this study, the basic physical properties of lightweight multifunctional concrete embedding used <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> were investigated. A method of placing concrete with embedded <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> was examined. <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> fixed to the mold at their caps withstood the impact and the pressure during concrete placing with no deformation, and the filling capability of concrete was confirmed. The weight reduction of the reinforcing concrete panel embedding <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> was approximately 16 %. The strength properties of concrete specimen embedding <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> were examined and the compressive strength of the specimen embedding bottles with the smallest intervals between bottles was 55 % of that of the solid concrete specimen...|$|R

25|$|In 2016, it was {{estimated}} that 56 million tons of PET are produced each year. While most thermoplastics can, in principle, be recycled, <b>PET</b> <b>bottle</b> recycling is more practical than many other plastic applications because of the high value of the resin and the almost exclusive use of PET for widely used water and carbonated soft drink bottling. PET has a resin identification code of 1. The prime uses for recycled PET are polyester fiber, strapping, and non-food containers.|$|E
25|$|In general, one can {{say that}} the {{processes}} to make <b>PET</b> <b>bottle</b> flakes from collected bottles are as versatile as the different waste streams are different in their composition and quality. In view of technology there isn't just one way to do it. Meanwhile, there are many engineering companies that are offering flake production plants and components, {{and it is difficult to}} decide for one or other plant design. Nevertheless, there are processes that are sharing most of these principles. Depending on composition and impurity level of input material, the general following process steps are applied.|$|E
25|$|The task {{consists}} in feeding 10–25% bottle flakes {{while maintaining the}} quality of the bottle pellets that are manufactured on the line. This aim is solved by degrading the <b>PET</b> <b>bottle</b> flakes—already during their first plasticization, which can be carried out in a single- or multi-screw extruder—to an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.30 dℓ/g by adding small quantities of ethylene glycol and by subjecting the low-viscosity melt stream to an efficient filtration directly after plasticization. Furthermore, temperature is brought to the lowest possible limit. In addition, with this way of processing, the possibility of a chemical decomposition of the hydro peroxides is possible by adding a corresponding P-stabilizer directly when plasticizing.|$|E

40|$|The tuning of Injection Stretch Blow Molding (ISBM) {{process for}} <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> {{is crucial to}} lower the {{production}} costs, reduce the environmental impact and assure a sufficient quality of the final product. Among the parameters defining <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> quality, the thickness is of primary importance for the appearance and mechanical resistance of the final product. Up to date, tuning of the process is demanded to the operator skills through a trial and error process, iterated until the wanted configuration is achieved. Moreover, the process is not controllable because the <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> characteristics are not currently measured. This work describes a method for <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> thickness measurement; the method could be implemented {{as part of an}} active control of the ISBM process. A noncontact method based on infrared transmittance measurement has been developed to evaluate the wall thickness of <b>PET</b> <b>bottles.</b> The method uncertainty is 6 % when the nominal thickness ranges between 0. 2 and 0. 5 mm.

40|$|Blending of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) {{with oxygen}} {{scavenger}} additives {{is a way}} to reduce ingress of oxygen into <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> made of these blends. The objective is to reduce oxidation of packaged beverages and oils. However, few studies were performed about the long-time influence of temperature on <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> with oxygen scavenger additives. Such knowledge is relevant for the development of accelerated tests. In this study, the influence of temperature on oxygen permeation of <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> with the oxygen scavenger additives MXD 6 or Oxyclear® was examined. <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> made of blends of PET with 2, 5 and 8 wt. −% MXD 6, respectively, or with 2 wt. −% Oxyclear® were filled with deoxygenated water. The bottles were stored at 5, 23, 38 and 55 °C up to 5 years. Oxygen partial pressure of the water in the bottles was measured regularly. As expected, oxygen partial pressure increased earlier at higher temperature because of faster exhaustion of the oxygen scavenger. Oxygen partial pressure of water in <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> with 8 wt. −% MXD 6 was below 10 mbar even after 5 years storage time at 5 and 23 °C. Oxygen absorption capacity of activated MXD 6 was at least 76 mg/g.
