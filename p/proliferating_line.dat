40|$|B cell lymphomas are {{generally}} believed {{to result from}} the monoclonal proliferation of neoplastic B cells derived from a single transformed lymphocyte (1, 2). In {{a significant proportion of}} cases, two different histologic types of lymphoma are noted in the same patient, when separate biopsy specimens are obtained, either simultaneously or at different times (3, 4). Conversion between histologic categories of lymphoma usually involves changes, over time, from small cell size, often follicular morphology, to a large cell with a diffuse appearance. Such changes often coincide with the development of more aggressive disease, and with shortened survival. Conversion between these histologic types of B cell lymphoma are commonly interpreted as representing "dedifferentiation " of cells within the original malignant clone, and emergence of more rapidly <b>proliferating</b> <b>lines</b> of tumor cells (3 - 9).

40|$|Increased {{reproduction}} is frequently {{associated with a}} reduction in longevity {{in a variety of}} organisms. Traditional explanations of this ‘cost of reproduction’ suggest that trade-offs between reproduction and longevity should be obligate. However, it is possible to uncouple the two traits in model organisms. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} reproduction and longevity are linked by molecular signals produced by specific reproductive tissues. For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans, lifespan is extended in worms that lack a <b>proliferating</b> germ <b>line,</b> but which possess somatic gonad tissue, suggesting that these tissues are the sources of signals that mediate lifespan. In this study, we tested for evidence of such gonadal signals in Drosophila melanogaster. We ablated the germ line using two maternal effect mutations: germ cell-less and tudor. Both mutations result in flies that lack a <b>proliferating</b> germ <b>line</b> but that possess a somatic gonad. In contrast to the findings from C. elegans, we found that germ line ablated females had reduced longevity relative to controls and that the removal of the germ line led to an over-proliferation of the somatic stem cells in the germarium. Our results contrast with the widely held view that it is downstream reproductive processes such as the production and/or laying of eggs that are costly to females. In males, germ line ablation caused either no difference, or a slight extension, in longevity relative to controls. Our results indicate that early acting, upstream reproductive enabling processes are likely to be important in determining reproductive costs. In addition, we suggest that the specific roles and putative patterns of molecular signalling in the germ line and somatic tissues are not conserved between flies and worms...|$|R

A 3 D culture system was used to investigate the behaviour of mesothelial cells present in the wall of human vaginalis peritonei duct (VPD). To this end we used the VPD removed/extracted in the operating theatre from 20 children undergoing surgery for inguinal hernia or hydrocele. Small tissue fragments placed on collagen sponges were cultured for 7, 14 and 21 days in medium supplemented with 10 % FBS, and analysed for the expression and distribution of cytokeratins, p 63, Ki- 67, vimentin, CD 34, and HBME- 1. Mesenchymal cells within the stroma were vimentin positive and endothelial cells of small vessels displayed positive staining for CD 34. Cytokeratins, p 63 and HBME- 1 were negative in all stromal cells. In cultured fragments, flat mesothelial cells positive for vimentin, cytokeratins and HBME- 1 <b>proliferated,</b> <b>lining</b> the fragment surface and migrating into the sponge. Capillaries showed morphological alterations; however, their immunoreactivity was comparable with the stroma prior to culture. Cells that had migrated into the sponge and displayed characteristics of mesothelial progenitors, predominantly spindle-shaped and stellate, showed heterogeneous expression of markers especially in late phases of cultivation. These cells were constantly positive for vimentin, a small fraction was cytokeratin-positive and a few displayed HBME- 1 immunoreactivity. CD 34 was found in cells forming small cavities into the matrix, resembling newly formed blood vessels. Further evidence for a mesothelial progenitor comimg from tissue engineering applications suggest that mesothelial cell progenitors are able to switch between different cell phenotypes depending on the local environment. However, only by performing detailed investigations involving selective cell isolation, clonal analysis together with cell labelling and tracking studies, we will begin to determine the true existence of a mesothelial stem cell.

40|$|Summary Recent immunocytochemical and {{biochemical}} {{studies have}} shown the intracellular uptake of alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) by most neural crest and neural tube derivatives of developing mammals and birds. The neural crest origin of neuroblastomas {{has been known for}} a long time. While many mouse neuroblastoma cell lines can express several neuronal properties, other lines lack specialized neural functions and may re-express embryonal or foetal antigens, suggesting some reversion towards an earlier stage of differentiation. We have therefore tested the C- 1300 Jackson mouse neuroblastoma cell line for its ability to incorporate AFP. The results obtained confirm the significant internalization of protein by these cells, both in vitro and in vivo. External photoscans of mice bearing tumours after injection with [131 I]-AFP have proven the usefulness of the protein as a radiotracer for neuroblastoma localization. <b>Proliferating</b> cell <b>lines</b> of neuroblastoma express several neuronal characteristics such as process formation (Schubert et al., 1969), neurotransmitter synthesis (Biedler et al., 1978; Pons et al., 1982), high acetylcholinesterase and electrical activities.

Another approach which is now the focus of extensive research is the use of stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells for long term cell microencapsulation and cell therapy applications in hopes of reducing the immune response in the patient after implantation. Another issue which compromises long term viability of the microencapsulated cells is the use of fast <b>proliferating</b> cell <b>lines</b> which eventually fill up the entire system and lead to decrease in the diffusion efficiency across the semi-permeable membrane of the capsule.

Explicitly considering potential interdependencies between cost-reduction effort and quality decisions, we characterize environments where the optimal product line involving component commonality features products of higher quality and yields higher revenues. Counter to earlier research we show that it can be preferable to make those components common that, relative to their production cost, are attributed a higher importance by customers.

HepaRG is the only <b>proliferating</b> cell <b>line</b> supporting HBV infection in vitro, following specific differentiation, allowing for investigation of new host host-cell factors involved in viral entry, within a more robust and reproducible environment.

In contrast to the constitutive expression of Raf- 1 in continuously <b>proliferating</b> cell <b>lines,</b> c-raf- 1 mRNA and Raf- 1 protein levels were barely detectable in freshly isolated G 0 T lymphocytes. Previous work with fibroblasts has suggested that Raf- 1 plays a signaling role in the G 0 -G 1 phase transition.

In addition, the promotion of G 1 progression by interleukin 2 (IL- 2) was associated with a 5 - to 10 -fold immediate/early induction of c-raf- 1 mRNA, resulting in up to a 12 -fold increase in Raf- 1 protein expression. TCR/CD 3 activation did not alter the phosphorylation state of Raf- 1, whereas interleukin 2 receptor stimulation resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation state of a subpopulation of Raf- 1 molecules progressively increasing throughout G 1.
