5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the <b>periphery</b> towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females.

The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Jeanne moved inland, its inner eyewall dissipated, and {{its outer}} eyewall quickly became less distinct. It turned west-northwestward over the state, curving around the western <b>periphery</b> {{of the ridge}} to its northeast. By 14hours after landfall, Jeanne {{weakened}} to tropical storm status near the Tampa Bay area. In western Florida, offshore winds produced a tide of 4.5feet (1.4m) below normal in Cedar Key; however, after the storm passed the area, the onshore winds produced above normal tides. Despite initial forecasts that it would emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, the storm remained over land and continued to slowly weaken. Early on September 27, dry air became entrained into the southern <b>periphery</b> of the circulation, which diminished the thunderstorms to the south. After turning northward, Jeanne entered southern Georgia and weakened into a tropical depression.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} <b>peripheries</b> {{of the city}} of Napoli {{starting}} from a different definition and description of its huge public housing stock. The main research hypothesis is that public housing transformations, their historical evolution and differences, are very important elements for the city regeneration politics design, that should {{be able to deal with}} the complexity and variety of the present problems (first of all social exclusion). The limited effectiveness of <b>peripheries</b> politics is often tied to an erroneously homogenous reading of the <b>peripheries</b> as if they were an homogeneous thing. For this reason the paper proposes a description of the Napoli’s <b>peripheries</b> based on their public housing dimension, that it is important to redefine the different characteristics, invariants and problems of this parts of the city. Through this process of re-descriptions of the different <b>peripheries,</b> with theirs ‘evils’ (or values), we recognize background’s emergencies and problems that supply indications for the treatment of important problematic dimensions as policy design proposals for the <b>peripheries</b> public politics...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral {{regions are}} most often {{described}} in terms of economic geography. However, this study stresses more the sociological aspects of <b>peripheries,</b> studying not only the causes, but also the social effects of life in peripheral regions. The authors use the term ‘inner peripheries’ because most of the peripheral regions detected in their analyses are located in the inner parts of the country, mainly along the borders of the administrative regions (kraje). Their approach combines the concept of the life world (espace vécu) as defined by A. Frémont and A. Giddens when describing the social and cultural consequences of living in <b>peripheries,</b> and a modified version of G. Myrdal´s theory of cumulative circular causation when trying to explain the origin and growth of <b>peripheries.</b> In the Czech Republic inner <b>peripheries</b> are usually the peripheral zones of metropolitan areas and regional centre areas. In the mid- 1990 s population numbers stopped declining in some <b>peripheries</b> as a result of suburbanisation processes, but in other <b>peripheries</b> depopulation processes continued. This last category of inner <b>peripheries</b> can be described as the hard core of Czech peripheral regions and in the authors’ opinion they warrant the development of specifi c regional policy measures, stressing the creation of new jobs, the improvement of public transport, greater accessibility of service centres, and co-operation among communities...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{explore what}} we might mean by the phrase "crossing work {{practice}} boundaries by means of electronic communication". The {{focus is on the}} work practice boundaries, and the transformational effects of electronic communication on such boundaries. I begin by defining work practices with respect to the social world or activity system communities for whom such practices make sense. Taking up Strauss' suggestion that <b>peripheries</b> arouse more appropriate imagery for the variation and fluidity of social world boundaries, I propose a metaphor of boundary in terms of centres and <b>peripheries,</b> where <b>peripheries</b> can be characterized {{in a number of ways}} including: the degrees of commitment, the limits of communication and the levels of participation. Vignettes from three case studies illustrate some of the transformational effects of electronic communication on the relationships between a centre and its <b>peripheries,</b> on the external relationships among centres and their <b>peripheries,</b> and on the relationship of work practice boundaries to other boundary forms. In designing support for social worlds, a centre-periphery perspective could allow for more explicit account of the fluidity of work practice boundaries and the ways in which these might be affected by electronic communication...|$|R

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained multiple cloud swirls within a common center. Banding features increased, though southwesterly wind shear {{and the lack}} of a well-defined circulation prevented initial strengthening. Dry air encountered the depression, and as such it developed very slowly; forecasters maintained considerable difficulty in determining a center of circulation. It continued its motion to the west-northwest while tracking around the southern <b>periphery</b> of a deep-layer subtropical ridge to its north. Though convection remained focused near the outer <b>periphery</b> of the system, the overall organized continued to steadily increase, and it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Florence on September 5 while located about 1,120miles (1,800km) east-northeast of Anguilla.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between changes in the conception of urban <b>peripheries</b> and changes in urban renewal policies, mainly focusing on policy debates and theoretical discourses developed within Italy. The aim is to test the usefulness of a non-conventional approach to urban <b>peripheries,</b> both from a theoretical and practical point of view. According to this approach, urban <b>peripheries</b> {{can be thought of}} as plural and complex places which are considered to be a fundamental part of the city and as he builders of urban identity. The article initially explores the changes in describing and interpreting urban <b>peripheries,</b> showing how they must be related to actual changes in urban settlement dynamics, as well as to changes in the theoretical frameworks used to understand the phenomenon of the Italian ‘urban periphery'. The article then shows how changes in interpretation have redefined the objectives and methods of policy nterventions in the Italian context. Finally, certain critical issues will be discussed, in particular the origins of urban renewal policies and their recent evolution; the redefinition of the local authority role, and {{the relationships between}} institutional and social projects and activities. In this view, institutional projects are considered to be the formal projects carried out by public actors, for example municipalities, in order to manage the change in urban <b>peripheries</b> while social projects are understood as the informal practices of inhabitants of <b>peripheries</b> that change their living neighbourhood...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} I investigate, what I have called ‘the paradox of {{urbanization}}’, through {{the case of}} Rio de Janeiro. The paradox of urbanization is {{a process in which}} the qualitative impulses - improvements of urbanization, such as public infrastructure and facilities - are planned and implemented in central neighborhoods, while the quantitative rate of urbanization - the strongest growth of the city in terms of residents - takes place in the <b>peripheries</b> of the city. In Rio de Janeiro the paradox of urbanization has resulted in a divided city, in which rich and poor neighborhoods are separated, and exist as closed and partially autonomous communities. The prosperous central neighborhoods were facilitated with parks, pavements, and public buildings, while the <b>peripheries</b> were developed with private means: residents paved their own sidewalks, and companies provided collective buildings and facilities. Based on the work of Ananya Roy, I propose a role for architects and planners that I shall indicate as ‘the aesthetization of urbanity’. I propose that architects and planners should create spaces for public functions, with a substantial urban qualitity that transcends the interest of a particular community, and adopt the common norms of society as a standard for their representation. The aesthetization of urbanity is a response to community based, self-help projects: using similar architectural means in the peripheral zones as one would use in the centre, to give the <b>peripheries</b> a qualitative impulse that trancends local interests, and make the <b>peripheries</b> an integral and established part of the city. The qualitative improvements in the <b>peripheries</b> should be of substantial architectural quality as a mean of representation of state interest in the poor <b>peripheries,</b> should be in the interest of society as a whole and not only a local community, and should create opportunities for residents in the <b>peripheries</b> of the city through public means.
