40|$|Abstract: Linear and squared {{residual}} <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> {{proposed to}} assess nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity in regression diagnostics. It is shown that linear residual <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> useful for diagnosing nonlinearity and squared residual <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> powerful for detecting nonconstant variance. A paradigm for the graphical interpretation of residual <b>plots</b> <b>is</b> presented. Key words and phrases: Heteroscedasticity, leverages, nonlinearity, outliers. 1...|$|R

A massacre of three thousand people from the eastern region living in the north occurred soon afterwards, and stories of other attacks on Igbo Nigerians began to filter into Lagos.|$|E
5|$|The Expendables 2: Deploy & Destroy is a single-player tower defense, {{real-time}} strategy online game.

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by Paul Feig. The writing staff sought to address more topical issues during the second season, and the same-sex marriage <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> inspired by the real-life pairing of Harry and Pepper, a pair of romantically involved male penguins at the San Francisco Zoo. However, Hiscock said he was focused more strongly on comedy than making a political or social statement.|$|E

5|$|After the {{financial}} backing from Tsui Hark became problematic following {{the release of}} Woo's film A Better Tomorrow 2, Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun Fat's and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming The Killer with a rough draft whose <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the films Le Samouraï, Mean Streets, and Narazumono. Woo desired {{to make a film}} about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to The Killer as a tribute to directors Jean-Pierre Melville and Martin Scorsese.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{also began}} work on the fragmentary writing Soborul țațelor ("The Council of Busibodies", 1929) and the detective story Sub pecetea tainei ("Under the Seal of Secrecy", 1930), but they would remain unfinished. In its first draft, Sub pecetea tainei was {{published}} by Gândirea in April 1930-April 1933, while Soborul țațelor was kept in three different variants. In a 1985 essay later published as a preface for Sub pecetea tainei, literary critic Nicolae Manolescu proposed that, while the story was not given a finishing touch, its <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> meant to seem ambiguous, and thus had led other commentators to wrongly assume that the text ended abruptly.|$|E

40|$|More {{information}} is {{needed on the}} grazing responses of wetland graminoids to improve management ofriparian shrub community types. To study the effect ofcattle grazing on the number ofnew shoots produced by beaked sedge (Carex rostrata) within the 1989 and 1990 growing seasons, 40 <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> protected and 40 <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> grazed by cattle in June and September each year. Altlwugh number ofshoots produced on grazed and ungrazed <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> similar in 1989, grazed plots produced 27. 4 percent more shoots per plot than ungrazed plots (P < 0. 05) in 1990. Preliminary analysis ofmonthly shoot production data indicates that the greatest difference between grazed and ungrazed <b>plots</b> <b>was</b> in July. Seasonal mortality on grazed and ungrazed <b>plots</b> <b>was</b> similar, altlwugh high rodent-caused mortality in the ungrazed plots may have masked the effects ofcattle grazing...|$|R

5|$|Dunstan {{soon became}} a {{favourite}} of the king and was the envy of {{other members of the}} court.

When the <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> uncovered, the eunuchs arrested Empress Dowager Dou (d.172AD) and Chen Fan. General Zhang Huan (張奐) favored the eunuchs. He and his troops confronted Dou Wu and his retainers {{at the palace}} gate where each side shouted accusations of treason against the other. When the retainers gradually deserted Dou Wu, {{he was forced to}} commit suicide.|$|E
40|$|Mallows' Cp <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> {{a useful}} tool for {{variable}} selection in linear regression. Though not as popular as the Cp plot, Spjotvoll's Fp and Pp <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> also used in the variable selection procedure. The Cp, Fp and Pp <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> useful in their own right. If the interest is the direct measure of the amount of bias of the submodels and a distributional assumption is not made about the error term, a Cp or Fp <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> used. If a formal testing procedure is to be performed, then a Pp <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> employed. A geometrical approach is used in order to propose an alternative plot that unifies all the information in these three plots, and that has some advantages over them. A Mathematica package has been written to implement the approach. ...|$|R
