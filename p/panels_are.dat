30|$|Ten laboratory-scale 10 -ply LVL <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> manufactured. Six <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> made of {{eucalypt}} veneer only, choosing {{veneer sheets}} of defined MoE grades {{based on their}} dynamic MoE values.

40|$|Abstract: The {{concrete-filled}} {{glass fiber}} reinforced gypsum wall <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> {{a kind of}} panel that the inside cavums of the glass fiber hollow gypsum <b>panel</b> <b>are</b> filled with concrete, {{which can be used}} as the bearing wall of a building. The influences of eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio on the bearing capacity of the compression wall <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> studied, and the failure mechanism and bearing capacity of compression wall <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> gained through the experiments of twenty-seven(nine groups) axial compression wall panel specimens and twenty-seven(nine groups) eccentric compression wall panel specimens. The analysis results indicate that the bearing capacity of compression wall <b>panels</b> <b>is</b> obviously affected by the eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio, and there is a linear relation between bearing capacity and eccentricity distance. The bearing capacity calculation formula of the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> obtained by regression analysis, which provides reliable gist for structural design of concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall panel buildings...|$|R

5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously tested in a laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were ever needed. As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{structural}} behaviour of two connected Sandwiched Precast Lightweight Foamed Concrete Panel (PLFP) {{in term of}} their load bearing capacities and failure modes. Three (3) connected PLFP <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> cast using foamed concrete as the wythe and polystyrene as the core layer. Each connected <b>panel</b> <b>were</b> cast from two single panels connected using L-bar connection. The <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> strengthened with steel bar reinforcement embedded in both wythes which were connected to each other by the steel shear truss connectors. The connected PLFP <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> tested under flexural load. A single PLFP <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> cast as a control panel and tested under axial load. The results were analysed in term of the panel’s ultimate load, crack pattern and mode of failure. Results showed that the two connected PLFP <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> able to sustain slightly lower ultimate load compared to single PLFP panel. Crack at 45 degree angle at top half of panel and small crack at surface between joint of the connection were observed...|$|R

5|$|Each canvas {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Floatovoltaics are an {{emerging}} form of PV systems that float {{on the surface}} of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce the need of valuable land area, save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion, as the <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land. Although not floating, other dual-use facilities with solar power include fisheries.|$|E

One of the mosaic panels at the end of the station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|E

5|$|Motifs and {{arrangements}} of figures extend along the lower panels {{from one to}} the next, {{to the extent that the}} separations between <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> ignored with the intersections cutting figures in two. This is particularly evident on the lower register where each panel division intersects figures, so that parts of figures are painted on two adjoining panels; whereas Christ and St Michael are enclosed within the single central panel, giving emphasis to the iconography.|$|E
5|$|Shimura mainly {{found her}} characters' names by looking through name dictionaries, {{although}} she also took {{the names of}} acquaintances and slightly changed them, and even used train station names for side characters appearing only once. Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their early teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters do not look very different from each other, her <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> too white, and there is much pathos.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} of varying coloration either rapidly {{or with the}} changing seasons has military applications. Active camouflage could in theory make use of both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simple techniques such as changing uniforms and repainting vehicles for winter have been in use since the Second World War. In 2011, BAE Systems announced their Adaptiv infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The Peltier plate <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> heated and cooled to match either the vehicle's surroundings (crypsis), or an object such as a car (mimesis), when viewed in infrared.|$|E
