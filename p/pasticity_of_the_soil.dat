In this research, a set of soil samples with different CECs were stabilized with different proportions of cement and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2, CH). <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> CEC on <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stabilized <b>soil</b> was investigated by analyzing the CH saturation in the pore solution and measuring <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stabilized <b>soil</b> specimens. It is revealed that cation exchange in <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> can reduce <b>the</b> CH saturation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stabilized <b>soil.</b> If <b>the</b> CEC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> is too high, the CH in <b>the</b> pore solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stabilized <b>soil</b> cannot reach <b>the</b> saturation level, and further cation exchange would then consume the Ca 2 + ions which should be originally used to generate calcium silicate hydrate, thus result in <b>the</b> poor strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stabilized <b>soil...</b>|$|R

Capacitance probes use capacitance to measure <b>the</b> dielectric permittivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> <b>The</b> volume <b>of</b> water in <b>the</b> total volume <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> most heavily influences <b>the</b> dielectric permittivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> because <b>the</b> dielectric <b>of</b> water (80) {{is much greater}} than <b>the</b> other constituents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> (mineral soil: 4, organic matter: 4, air: 1). Thus, when <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> water changes in <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> <b>the</b> probe will measure a change in capacitance (from the change in dielectric permittivity) that can be directly correlated with a change in water content.
