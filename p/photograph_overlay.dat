50|$|It is also {{possible}} to make composite <b>photographs</b> by <b>overlaying</b> the print with a hand-cut mask, performing an exposure, and then using the inverse of that mask to perform another exposure with a different negative.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{identify}} insertion {{procedure and}} force application related complications in Jet Screw (JS) type mini-implants when {{inserted in the}} palatal slope. Methods Setting and Sample Population: The Department of Orthodontics, the University Hospital Münster. Forty-one consecutively started patients treated using mini-implants in the palatal slope. In this retrospective study, 66 JS were evaluated. Patient records were used to obtain data on the mode of utilization and complications. Standardized <b>photographs</b> <b>overlayed</b> with a virtual grid served {{to test the hypothesis}} that deviations from the recommended insertion site or the type of mechanics applied might be related to complications regarding bleeding, gingival overgrowth or implant failure. Results Two implants (3 %) were lost, and two implants (3 %), both loaded with a laterally directed force, exhibited loosening while still serving for anchorage. Complications that required treatment did not occur, the most severe problem observed being gingival proliferation which was attributable neither to patients’ age nor to applied mechanics or deviations from the ideal implant position. Conclusions The JS mini-implant is reliable for sagittal and vertical movements or anchorage purposes. Laterally directed forces might be unfavorable. The selection of implant length as well as the insertion procedure should account for the possibility of gingival overgrowth. </p...|$|R

40|$|The University of Florida (UF) has {{partnered with}} the City of St. Augustine to 2 ̆ 2 unearth 2 ̆ 2 archival {{repositories}} {{which have been}} previously inaccessible to researchers worldwide. The digital archive supports research in {{a broad range of}} subjects: Florida and U.

Currently, over 25, 000 <b>photographs,</b> maps, <b>overlays</b> of the city, architectural drawings, government records, transcriptions of key Spanish documents, and archaeology site summaries have been digitized, with a majority of them geo-located. The collection not only satisfies the needs {{of a wide variety of}} researchers including historians, archaeologists, architects, historic preservationists, and those in the digital humanities, but the project also helps in telling St. Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s unique 2 ̆ 2 story 2 ̆ 2 of colonial heritage on a global scale...|$|R

Organized into modules corresponding to the book chapters, the series of digital presentations relates the conceptual to the perceptual aspects of architecture by <b>overlaying</b> <b>photographs</b> and drawings with diagrams. The selected examples are, of course, limited in number and scope, but {{it is hoped that}} the vignettes will help the viewer identify elements and abstract principles from what is seen in a book or on a monitor, and be able to see similarities in the environments experienced in real life or imagined while designing.

5000|$|Another Mind is {{primarily}} shown {{through a series}} of still <b>photographs</b> with text <b>overlays</b> advancing the story. The characters are represented by photographs of real actors, which are displayed whenever that character is speaking. Rarely a cutscene is used, featuring a movie of the actors interacting; the game uses the actors' real voices during these scenes, a rarity for the time. The player represents [...] "another mind" [...] residing in the head of the main protagonist, and can only control the game through speaking to the girl. The player does this by constructing their own sentences out of context-sensitive parts of speech provided by the game, rather than selecting from pre-made options.|$|R
40|$|Repentir is {{a mobile}} {{application}} that employs marker-less tracking and augmented reality to enable gallery visitors {{to explore the}} under drawing and successive stages of pigment beneath an oil painting's surface. Repentir recognises the position and orientation of a specific painting within a <b>photograph</b> and precisely <b>overlays</b> images that were captured during that painting's creation. The viewer may then browse through the work's multiple states and closely examine its painted surface {{in one of two}} ways: sliding or rubbing. Our current prototype recognises realist painter Nathan Walsh's most recent work, "Transamerica". Repentir enables the viewer to explore intermediary stages in the painting's development and see what is usually lost within the materially additive painting process. The prototype offers an innovative approach to digital reproduction and provides users with unique insights into the painter's working method...|$|R
50|$|The freedom webcomics provide allows {{artists to}} work in non{{traditional}} styles. Clip art or photo comics (also known as fumetti) {{are two types of}} webcomics that do not use traditional artwork. A Softer World, for example, is made by <b>overlaying</b> <b>photographs</b> with strips of typewriter-style text. As in the constrained comics tradition, a few webcomics, such as Dinosaur Comics by Ryan North, are created with most strips having art copied exactly from one (or a handful of) template comics and only the text changing. Pixel art, such as that created by Richard Stevens of Diesel Sweeties, {{is similar to that of}} sprite comics but instead uses low-resolution images created by the artist himself. However, it is also common for artists to use traditional styles and layouts, similar to those published in newspapers or comic books.|$|R

500|$|The SPLC {{stated that}} The Daily Stormer owed its success to the online imageboard 4chan {{becoming}} popular among racists, as both websites use similar memes and rhetorical styles. One meme the website has used is to <b>overlay</b> <b>photographs</b> of Taylor Swift with anti-Semitic quotations, including those by Hitler. The website puts triple parentheses around {{the names of}} Jews, a far-right meme created by fellow website The Right Stuff. Jacob Siegel of The Daily Beast wrote that the website was growing in popularity amongst a younger audience due to its use of humor, and was attracting activists of other anti-political correctness ideologies—such as Gamergaters, men's rights activists and opponents of Social Justice Warriors—who would not usually identify with fascism. The SPLC has also documented Anglin's involvement in and encouragement of culture jamming by making hyperbolic statements in fake online accounts as women and minorities. He has also said that [...] "ridiculous" [...] statements such as [...] "gas the kikes", if repeated in media coverage, can work to desensitize the public to the Holocaust. He also believes that his extreme right-wing rhetoric can normalize less extreme right-wingers such as Trump.|$|R
