Apprentices whom Bewick trained include John Anderson, Luke Clennell, and William Harvey, who in their turn became well known as <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> engravers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{narcissi}} are depicted {{in three different}} contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association. The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his Narcissus, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's Undergrowth.|$|E

5|$|Lemmons {{was full}} of impossibly glamorous older people and a core commune of writers, <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> inventors; even the dogs and cats shared a {{communal}} basket, and there were always stray writers and publishers whose marriages were unravelling. The drink flowed as freely as an open artery at family dinners.|$|E
5|$|Notable <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> {{engravers}} Władysław {{supported and}} who attended his royal court included Peter Paul Rubens, Tommaso Dolabella Peter Danckerts de Rij, Wilhelm Hondius, Bartłomiej Strobel, and Christian Melich. His royal orchestra was headed by kapellmeister Marco Scacchi, seconded by Bartłomiej Pękiel.|$|E
5|$|Bogdan-Pitești {{consolidated}} his own estate when {{he inherited}} a manor in Vlaici village (part of Colonești). It was, beginning in 1908, {{the center of}} his activities and home to his sizable art collection, as well {{as one of the first}} locations in Romania acting as a summer camp for <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> sculptors. The events he planned were attended by the Ileana regulars, and, in time, attracted virtually all other major en plein air painters of the day: Nicolae Dărăscu, Ștefan Dimitrescu, Iosif Iser, M. H. Maxy, Theodor Pallady, Camil Ressu.|$|E

5|$|Gottlieb, {{aided by}} Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which {{was signed by}} 12 <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> three sculptors, and {{addressed}} {{to the editor of}} the Tribune. It was never published. Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of The Nation, calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Francis Henry Taylor a philistine. Two days later Time magazine noted the protest in an article entitled The Revolt of the Pelicans, an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 comments in the Atlantic Monthly.|$|E
5|$|Music was {{the least}} {{restricted}} of cultural activities, probably because Hans Frank regarded himself as a fan of serious music. In time, he ordered {{the creation of the}} Orchestra and Symphony of the General Government in its capital, Kraków. Numerous musical performances were permitted in cafes and churches, and the Polish underground chose to boycott only the propagandist operas. Visual artists, including <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> sculptors, were compelled to register with the German government; but their work was generally tolerated by the underground, unless it conveyed propagandist themes. Shuttered museums were replaced by occasional art exhibitions that frequently conveyed propagandist themes.|$|E
5|$|Of John and Susannah Sartain's children, Samuel (1830–1906), Henry (1833–1895), William Sartain (1843–1925) and Emily were <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> engravers, {{beginning}} {{a legacy of}} Sartain family artists and printmakers. Sartain sought her father's input on her work throughout her career and benefited from his support and connections. She carried on the mezzatint engraving technique that he taught her. Sartain lived with her parents into adulthood, supporting and caring for them in their later years. In 1886, her parents moved into her living quarters at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.|$|E

In addition, they provide spaces for music and theatre events, including an underground iteration of the Pepsi Music Festival on Line H.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} William Shakespeare enjoyed a renewed {{popularity}} in 18th-century Britain. Several new editions {{of his works}} were published, his plays were revived in the theatre and numerous works of art were created illustrating the plays and specific productions of them. Capitalising on this interest, Boydell decided to publish a grand illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays that would showcase the talents of British <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> engravers. He chose the noted scholar and Shakespeare editor George Steevens to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.|$|E

5|$|According to David A. Norris, {{a scholar}} specializing in Serbian {{cultural}} history, conditions in 19th-century Serbia were unsuitable {{for the development}} of visual art. Materials were difficult to come by, studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non-existent, and there were no art patrons willing to financially support <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> purchase their finished works. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to decorating the walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects. There were some painters of Serb heritage living outside Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E
5|$|As Osijek grew as a city, the fort's {{presence}} hindered {{the potential}} for urban development. The demolition {{of most of the}} fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926, with the construction of an electric tramway. The last gunpowder magazine, located behind the church of St. Michael, was demolished in 1958. While most of the fortifications have been demolished (only the first and eighth bastions and the northern wall with its so-called 'water gate' were kept), the center of Tvrđa remains intact. The Yugoslav People's Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa, but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned, and adapted into ateliers for local <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> sculptors.|$|E
5|$|By the 1770s {{the castle}} was roofless, and was {{regarded}} as a romantic ruin by 19th-century <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> visitors to the Highlands. In 1884 the castle came under the control of Caroline, Dowager Countess of Seafield, widow of the 7th Earl of Seafield, on the death of her son the 8th Earl. On Lady Seafield's death in 1911 her will instructed that Urquhart Castle be entrusted into state care, and in October 1913 responsibility for the castle's upkeep was transferred to the Commissioners of His Majesty's Works and Public Buildings. Historic Environment Scotland (formerly Historic Scotland), the successor to the Office of Works, continues to maintain the castle, which is scheduled monument in recognition of its national significance.|$|E

5|$|During {{her time}} in Europe, Fuller had great success. After a pastel {{portrait}} of hers was accepted for the Paris Salon in 1895, two of her paintings were shown there in 1896. That was followed by another, La Glaneuse, in 1897, in which year {{she also had a}} work accepted by the Royal Academy in London. She exhibited in many other locations: the Royal Institute of Oil <b>Painters</b> <b>and</b> Manchester Art Gallery in England, as well as the Victorian Artists Society and the New South Wales Society of Artists, and at the Melbourne studio of Jane Sutherland. There was even a painting, Landscape, hung in the exhibition for the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Bendigo. Not all her time was spent in Europe, however; in 1899 she returned to South Africa to paint Cecil Rhodes. One source suggests that she ultimately prepared five portraits of the founder of Rhodesia. A later newspaper report stated that Fuller also travelled and made sketches in Wales, Ireland, and Italy.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{regarded}} {{during her}} active {{career as a}} portrait and landscape painter, by 1914 Fuller was represented in four public galleries—three in Australia and one in South Africa—a record {{for a woman who}} was an Australian painter at that time. In 1927 she began almost twenty years of institutionalization in a mental asylum, however, and her death went without notice. After her death, information about her was frequently omitted from reference books about Australian <b>painters</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of her work became obscure despite her paintings being held in public art collections including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Australia's National Portrait Gallery.|$|E
