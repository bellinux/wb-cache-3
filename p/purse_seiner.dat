40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the fishing effort exerted by <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> on tropical tuna requires a constant monitoring {{of the changes in}} individual fishing power of <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> due to changes in vessel characteristics, fishing gears or fishing strategies. Also, since the 1990 s, increasing numbers of drifting Fish Aggregating Devices have been used by this fleet. As dFADs contribute to a reduction of search times, traditional measures of fishing effort such as search time or fishing time are inappropriate. Here, using logbook data from the French and the Spanish purse seine fleets over 2003 - 2014, the effects of purse seiners' characteristics (length, the size of the wells, period of construction) and their use of support vessels on the efficiency of <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> are analyzed with GLM models. 3 dimensions of the efficiency of <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> are analyzed: monthly catch rates, monthly frequency of fishing sets and monthly distance of fishing sets. Among others, we find that support vessels contribute to an increase in catch rates (+ 10 tons per day) and in distance between fishing set. In a second steps, the results of the GLM models are used to build 3 indexes of fishing effort that are compared to a simple monitoring of the number of EU <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> over 2003 - 2014. Ours result show that this simple index provide a biased image of the evolution of fishing effort for the purse seine fishery.

40|$|Seabirds {{are known}} to make {{extensive}} use of fishery waste, a phenomenon that has been particularly well studied in relation to demersal fisheries, especially when operating during daylight hours. Contrarily, very {{little is known about}} the importance of predominantly nocturnal fisheries in providing feeding opportunities to seabirds. We considered the particular case of purse seining for small pelagic fish, which takes place basically at night, and assessed the significance of this fishing practice for seabirds off the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean). Fieldwork was conducted on board commercial <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> (nocturnal activity) in 1997 - 1998, and was complemented with observations performed on board both commercial bottom trawlers (diurnal activity; 1997 - 1998) and a research vessel (1999 - 2000). The purse seine fleet targets small clupeoids, which are attracted and concentrated by the light of a powerful lamp, and then captured using an encircling net. <b>Purse</b> <b>seiners</b> frequently changed fishing area, took very variable catches, and were strongly influenced by the weather. This made the fishery unattractive to most seabird species, which primarily attended <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> during the discarding process. This process took place on the way back to port after dawn (i. e. with daylight) during daylight and was quite irregular, thus attracting lower numbers of seabirds than did trawlers. The threatened Audouin's gull Larus audouinii was the only species attending <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> regularly at night, capturing live fish concentrated at the sea surface during the hauling process. This is in accordance with the specialisation of this gull in the capture of epipelagic fish at night, which seems facilitated by <b>purse</b> <b>seiners.</b> Indeed, the vessels would favour the direct capture of fish (illumination of the sea surface, concentration of the fish), as well as the location of the shoals (light signalling). The purse seining fishery was especially important for Audouin's gull during trawling moratoria (when trawling discards were not available) and in the non-breeding season. A simple bioenergetic model estimated that individual Audouin's gulls could obtain a mean of 669 kJ haul- 1, which would represent far more than hall of the daily energy requirements of breeding birds. Provided that Audouin's gulls feeding in a given area could attend more than one haul in a short time, birds attending <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> at night could easily meet their energy requirements. However, there was strong variability in our estimate (from 0 to 1659 kJ bird- 1 haul- 1, 95 % CI), and feeding at <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> would only sometimes be profitable for Audouin's gulls. Purse seine fisheries could be of importance for other nocturnal seabirds in other regions such as the SE Pacific, and this deserves further research. It is important to note that <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> could also be detrimental for many seabirds, through direct competition and eventual depletion of fish stocks.

40|$|Agreement {{was reached}} at an {{extraordinary}} NEAFC meeting in Moscow in December 1971 by Island, Norway and USSR {{of a total}} ban for 1972 on fishing for adult Norwegian spring sprawning herring, except for a restricted fishery in connection with scientific investigations. In order to trace the distribution and migration of winter herring R. V. "Johan Hjort" (6 January— 2 February and 2 — 13 March) and M. S. «Havdrøn» (10 — 20 January) were used. In addition five comercial <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> were chartered from 17 January to 11 March by the Norwegian government. Obervers from the Institute of marine research were on board two of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> and joint surveys were carried out throughout the season.

The <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> were allowed to fish for biological sampling according to instruction given by the Director of fisheries. However, no herring were recorded with sonar and echo sounder, and the <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> did not catch any herring. It was concluded that only insignificant number of adult herring approached the Norwegian coast for spawning in 1972. Occassionally spawning herring were caught by set nets at different places along the coast from Stad to Lofoten. They were mainly herring of the Norwegian spring spawning type.

40|$|Competition {{between the}} yellow-legged gull Larus cachinnans and Audouin's gull Larus audouinii while {{foraging}} at commercial fishing vessels off the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean) was assessed in 1997 and 1998. Observations {{were performed on}} board two kinds of fishing vessels with different timetables: bottom trawlers (diurnal activity) and <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> (nocturnal activity). Three situations were distinguished {{with respect to the}} season and the fishing regime: (1) breeding season, both fleets operating; (2) breeding season, only <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> operating due to a trawling moratorium; (3) non-breeding season, both fleets operating. Overall, the yellow-legged gull behaved as an opportunist species and exerted pressure over Audouin's gull through kleptoparasitism and agonistic interactions (i. e. contest competition). Despite this, Audouin's gull was more efficient at capturing discards through scramble competition and was able to take profit from fishing vessels when the capture of fish required high skill, in accordance with its higher specialisation. Competition varied in intensity according to the fishing fleet and the season. Indeed, Audouin's and the yellow-legged gulls only interfered at trawlers, since only Audouin's gull attended <b>purse</b> <b>seiners.</b> During the breeding season competition at trawlers was not severe and Audouin's gull preferentially attended these vessels. <b>Purse</b> <b>seiners</b> acted as a secondary food resource and only attracted important numbers of Audouin's gulls during trawling moratoriums. Out of the breeding season the number of Audouin's gulls strongly declined in the area. Furthermore, the intensity of kleptoparasitism increased at trawlers, and the average size of the fish discarded was larger and less suitable. In parallel with these changes, Audouin's gull shifted to attend <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> preferentially, thus avoiding the high levels of competition at the trawlers. The lower representation of Audouin's gull in other breeding areas in the Mediterranean, as well as the less important fishing fleets in these areas, would probably reduce the attractiveness of trawlers for this species, even during the breeding season. Moreover, changes in fishing policies aimed to reduce discarding practices would lead to a globally less favourable situation for Audouin's gull. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Seabirds feeding ecology was {{studied at}} sea {{to assess the}} {{significance}} of two commercial fisheries, trawlers (demersal fishery with diurnal activity) and <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> (pelagic fishery with nocturnal activity), in the NW Mediterranean. Trawlers offered high amounts of discards (mostly fish of small size) on a predictable basis, and consequently attracted large numbers of seabirds. At the Ebro Delta, discards provided in average 65 % of the energy requirements of the seabird breeding community, being most important for large gulls and of little significance for terns. <b>Purse</b> <b>seiners</b> produced few discards, on an irregular basis, and attracted lower numbers of seabirds during discarding (after dawn). During the fishing operation, at night, only Audouin's Gulls Larus audouinii attended these vessels, capturing live fish concentrated near the sea surface, attracted by powerful lamps. During the breeding season, Audouin's Gulls preferentially attended trawlers in spite of potential competition with the more aggressive and opportunistic Yellow-legged Gulls Larus cachinnans, since the former showed to be more efficient at capturing discards and reduced competition by showing {{a wider range of}} feeding techniques. Only during trawler closures, Audouin's Gulls occurred in important numbers at <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> (thus acting as a secondary food resource for most individuals). During the non-breeding season Audouin's Gulls shifted to preferentially attend <b>purse</b> <b>seiners,</b> presumably because competition at trawlers strengthened at this period. The rare and threatened Balearic Shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus also made significant use of discards, which represented more than 40 % of the energy requirements of the whole population during the breeding season. Seabirds feeding upon discards showed higher levels of mercury, as discards make accessible to them demersal fish that is more polluted than epipelagic fish (natural prey for most seabirds). Thus, the risks of toxicity by this metal are higher for those species capturing discards. Given the significance of commercial fisheries for seabirds in the NW Mediterranean, and considering the increasing ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, fisheries managers should regard these birds when designing fishing policies...|$|R
