50|$|The {{electron}} beam <b>prober</b> (e-beam <b>prober)</b> is a specialized adaption {{of a standard}} scanning electron microscope (SEM) that is used for semiconductor failure analysis. While a conventional SEM may be operated in a voltage range of 10-30 keV, the e-beam <b>Prober</b> typically operates at 1 keV. The e-beam <b>prober</b> is capable of measuring voltage and timing waveforms on internal semiconductor signal structures. Waveforms may be measured on metal line, polysilicon and diffusion structures that have an electrically active, changing signal. The operation of the <b>prober</b> {{is similar to that}} of a sampling oscilloscope. A continuously looping, repeating test pattern must be applied to the device-under-test (DUT). E-beam probers are used primarily for front side semiconductor analysis. With the advent of flip-chip technology, many e-beam probers have been replaced with back side analysis instruments.|$|E

50|$|A wafer <b>prober</b> is {{a machine}} {{used to test}} {{integrated}} circuits. For electrical testing a set of microscopic contacts or probes called a probe card are held in place whilst the wafer, vacuum-mounted on a wafer chuck, is moved into electrical contact. When a die (or array of dice) have been electrically tested the <b>prober</b> moves the wafer to the next die (or array) and the next test can start. The wafer <b>prober</b> is usually responsible for loading and unloading the wafers from their carrier (or cassette) and is equipped with automatic pattern recognition optics capable of aligning the wafer with sufficient accuracy to ensure accurate registration between the contact pads on the wafer and {{the tips of the}} probes.|$|E

50|$|Normally a {{probe card}} is {{inserted}} into an equipment called a wafer <b>prober,</b> inside which {{position of the}} wafer to be tested will be manipulated so {{that there should be}} a precise contact between the probe card and wafer. Once the probe card and the wafer is loaded, a camera in the <b>prober</b> will optically locate several tips on the probe card and several marks or pads on the wafer, and using this information it can align the pads on the device under test (DUT) to the probe card contacts.|$|E
50|$|CAD {{navigation}} {{refers to}} software tools {{which are used}} for the correlation of electronic semiconductor design data with a physical semiconductor device. CAD navigation tools consist of software {{that is capable of}} reading and displaying the physical layout and logical schematic for the device. The logical design consists of a netlist and/or a schematic. The physical design consists of a set of polygons which precisely represent the location of all electrical conductors, diffusions and interconnections in the physical semiconductor device. CAD navigation tools are often used to provide a cross-correlation between the logical design and the physical design. CAD navigation tools are used extensively with E-beam <b>probers,</b> focused-ion beam systems and photon <b>probers</b> for the purpose of semiconductor failure analysis.|$|R

While insects {{make up the}} {{majority}} of the diet they will also feed on spiders, worms, centipedes, snails, and small crabs; larger species will also tackle small vertebrates such as frogs, geckos and baby birds.

50|$|A {{cum laude}} {{graduate}} of Princeton University, Schoelkopf earned his Ph.D in {{physics at the}} California Institute of Technology.

50|$|Adeos {{provides}} for a way for kernel debuggers and <b>probers</b> {{to take control of}} Linux without modifying Linux. As with other Adeos domains, these facilities would load as normal kernel modules and would thereafter request a ring-zero domain from Adeos. Once that is done, they may request priority interrupt dispatching in the interrupt pipeline. Hence, before Linux gets to handle any interrupts, {{they will be able to}} intercept those interrupts and carry out the requested debugging tasks. This can also be extended to performance profilers and other such development tools.|$|R
40|$|Azhdarchid pterosaurs {{were among}} the most {{widespread}} and successful of pterosaur clades, but their paleoecology remains controversial. Morphological features common to all azhdarchids include a long, shallow rostrum; elongate, cylindrical cervical vertebrae that formed a long and unusually inflexible neck; and proportionally short wings with an abbreviated fourth phalanx. While azhdarchids have been imagined as vulture-like scavengers, sediment <b>probers,</b> swimmers, waders, aerial predators, or stork-like generalists, most recent authors have regarded them as skim-feeders, trawling their lower jaws through water during flight and seizing aquatic prey from the water’s surface. Although apparently widely accepted, the skim-feeding model lacks critical support from anatomy and functional morphology. Azhdarchids lack the many cranial specialisations exhibited by extant skim-feeding birds, most notably the laterally compressed lower jaw and shock absorbing apparatus required for this feeding style. Well-preserved azhdarchid skulls are rare, but their rostra and lower jaws appear to have been sub-triangular in cross-section, and thus dissimilar to those of skim-feeders and sediment <b>probers.</b> Taphonomic data indicates that azhdarchids predominately inhabited inland settings, and azhdarchid morphology indicates that they were poorly suited for all proposed lifestyles bar wading and terrestrial foraging. However, azhdarchid footprints show that their feet were relatively small, padded and slender, and thus not well suited for wading. We argue that azhdarchids were stork- or ground hornbill-like generalists, foraging in diverse environments for small animals and carrion...|$|R
