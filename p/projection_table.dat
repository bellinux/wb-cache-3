S. naval amphibious competency. Current responsibilities in Iraq and Afghanistan have significantly reduced available training time causing overall amphibious readiness to suffer. In response, this thesis evaluates 3 D visualization techniques and other virtual environment technologies available to support these mission-critical training goals. The focus {{of this research is}} to modernize the Expeditionary Warfare Demonstrator (EWD) located aboard Naval Amphibious Base (NAB) Little Creek, Virginia. The EWD has been used to demonstrate doctrine, tactics, and procedures for all phases of amphibious operations to large groups of Navy, Marine Corps, Joint, Coalition and civilian personnel for the last 55 years. However, it no longer reflects current doctrine and is therefore losing credibility and effectiveness. In its current configuration, the EWD is limited to a single training scenario since the display’s ship models rely on a static pulley system to show movement and the terrain display ashore is fixed. To address these shortfalls, this thesis first recommends the usage of the wireless communication capability within Sun’s Small Programmable Object Technology (SunSPOT) to create robotic vehicles to replace the current ship models. This enables large-group visualization and situational awareness of the numerous coordinated surface maneuvers needed to support Marines as they move from ship to shore. The second recommendation is to improve visualization ashore through the creation of Extensible 3 D Graphics (X 3 D) scenes depicting high-fidelity 3 D models and enhanced 3 D terrain displays for any location. This thesis shows how to create these scenes and project them from overhead in order to modernize the gymnasium-sized EWD into an amphibious wargaming table suitable for both amphibious staff training and operational planning. Complimentary use of BASE-IT <b>projection</b> <b>tables</b> and digital 3 D holography can further provide smallgroup, close-up views of key battlespace locations.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Typically, when {{different}} forms of growth and yield models are considered, they are grouped into convenient discrete classes. As a heuristic device, I chose to use a contrasting perspective, that all growth and yield models are diameter distribution models that merely differ in regard to which diameter distribution is employed and how the distribution is projected to future conditions. I describe different diameter distributions, whether they are the classical contmuous diameter distributions, the implied distributions of whole-stand models, or the discrete diameter distributions of size-class or individual tree models. There are also intermediates between these types of diameter distributions. Aggregation vs. disaggregation describes the alternate poles for how diameter distributions can be projected to future conditions. There are intermediates between these extremes, as well. There are several alternatives that vary from the classical paradigms. One alternative is a continuous analog to stand <b>table</b> <b>projection</b> that employs a “distribution modifying function ” to project diameter distributions in time. One discrete variant of stand <b>table</b> <b>projection</b> is termed “non-naWe ” size class models, as they relax {{one or more of}} the assumptions of size class models. An “individual tree kernel ” model is one that uses a simple kernel function to distribute probability around an individual tree, rather than concentrate the probability at the measured diameter, as in typical individual tree models. Other variants are mentioned. These variants suggest that there is an infiite universe of alternative growth and yield models, and the classic labels for types of growth and yield models do not embrace these alternatives...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} planned to compute growth by the lateral surface method (Russian method) {{and by the}} most {{commonly}} used conventional method, the stand <b>table</b> <b>projection</b> method, in an evenage stand of lodgepole pine (Pines contorta Dougl), near the school forest. One-quarter acre plots (40 plots) were taken at random to measure D. B. H., bark thickness, and heights of the trees. Increment cores for the last 10 years were taken from the trees from sub-plots of 1 / 50 acres in every alternate one-quarter acre plot. The data were summarized into the stand table, placing the trees in one-inch classes, from 4. 5 inch to 21. 5 inch classes. The growth was computed by both methods and the results tested statistically. The study shows that there is no significant difference in quantity of growth in cubic feet by these two methods. The computa­tional procedure of the lateral surface method is less complicated, faster, and more economical in comparison with the stand <b>table</b> <b>projection</b> method, but it has only been employed in evenage stands. Its application too all age stands requires investigation. The growth was also computed for the past 13 years from a single permanent sample plot located in the Utah State University forest.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The Timber Resource Inventory Model (TRIM) is a {{computer}} model used by the U. S. D. A. Forest Service in assessing {{the state of the}} Nation's forest resources and the forests' probable future conditions. TRIM is a yield <b>table</b> <b>projection</b> system designed and developed to model forest inventory changes over time in response to different levels of management and to removals from either large or small forested areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the sensitivity of regional timber availability <b>projections</b> to yield <b>table</b> assumptions and various silvicultural impacts. Yields were projected under various management assumptions. In addition, the yield projections themselves were tested by projecting yields with and without approach to normality. A literature survey was conducted to assess work previously done with changes in management assumptions, model sensitivity, and approach to normality (i. e., stocking adjustment). In the short run, the projections were constrained by current inventory, growth functions, and harvest levels. In the long run, projections were constrained by growth functions and harvest levels. Inventory projections for all species and combined ownership varied both in trend and in degree between runs in both the long and the short run. Growth trends for all species and combined ownership showed normal yields with stocking adjustment and managed yields without stocking adjustment paralleling each other in both the long and the short run. Growth for managed yields with stocking adjustment exceed the two previous management intensities in both the long and the short run. Empirical yields without stocking adjustment are far below normal yields with stocking adjustment and managed yields without stocking adjustment in the short run, but the three projections converge in the long run. It was shown that the difference between runs with and without stocking adjustment is appreciable in both the short and the long run. Limitations of TRIM include the fact that it is difficult to use for the uninitiated, harvest levels are set, and the stocking adjustment function is relatively inflexible...|$|R

Recently, hashing-based approaches, e. g., Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), are proved to be effective for scalable high dimensional nearest neighbors search. Many hashing algorithms found their theoretic root in random projection. Since these algorithms generate the hash <b>tables</b> (<b>projections)</b> randomly, {{a large number of}} hash tables (i. e., long codewords) are required in order to achieve both high precision and recall. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hashing algorithm called Density Sensitive Hashing (DSH) in this paper. DSH can be regarded as an extension of LSH. By exploring the geometric structure of the data, DSH avoids the purely random projections selection and uses those projective functions which best agree with the distribution of the data. Extensive experimental results on real-world data sets have shown that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to the state-of-the-art hashing approaches. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The current {{southern}} species {{growth and}} yield prediction capability, new techniques utilized, and modeling trends {{over the last}} 17 years, were examined. Changing forest management objectives that emphasize more non-timber resources {{may have contributed to}} the continuing genetii lack of emphasis in modeling the timber productivity of the South’s largest forest types-mixed pines and mixed pine-hardwood stands. Less than 10 percent of the literature during the period of this review pertained to growth and yield predictions of that resource. On the other hand, 45 percent of the literature centered on predicting the productivity of loblolly pine, almost all in plantations. Clearly the modeling emphasis has been, and continues to be, on the results of intensive management of the South’s commercially valuable species, although some notable work has been done for other species and other forest types. Several new procedures have been developed for projecting tree and stand growth using whole stand, diameter distribution, and individual tree modeling approaches.

40|$|Given {{an audio}} query, such as {{polyphonic}} musical piece, this thesis {{address the problem}} of retrieving a matching (similar) musical score data from a collection of musical scores. There are different techniques for measuring similarity between any musical piece such as metadata based similarity measure, collaborative filtering and content-based similarity measure. In this thesis, we use the information in the digital music itself for similarity measures and this technique is known as content-based similarity measure. First we extract chroma features to represents musical segments. Chroma feature captures both melodic information and harmonic information and is robust to timbre variation. Tempo variation in the performance of a same song may cause dissimilarity between them. In order to address this issue we extract beat sequences and combine them with chroma features to obtain beat synchronous chroma features. Next, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. This algorithm first computes the DTW matrix between two feature sequences and calculates the cost of traversing from starting point to end point of the matrix. Minimum the cost value, more similar the musical segments are. The performance of DTW is improved by choosing suitable path constraints and path weight. Then, we implement LSH algorithm, which first indexes the data and then searches for a similar item. Processing time of LSH is shorter than that of DTW. For a smaller fragment of query audio, say 30 seconds, LSH outperformed DTW. Performance of LSH depends on the number of hash <b>tables,</b> number of <b>projections</b> per <b>table</b> and width of the projection. Both algorithms were applied in two types of data sets, RWC (where audio and midi are from the same source) and TUT (where audio and midi are from different sources).

The back of the skull is wide, with large projections on the exoccipital bones that would have anchored large epaxial muscles in the top part of the neck.|$|R
40|$|Growth and yield {{modeling}} has a {{long history}} in forestry. Methods of measuring the growth of uneven-aged forest stands have evolved from those developed in France and Switzerland during the last century. Furthermore, uneven-aged growth and yield modeling has progressed rapidly since the first models were pioneered by Moser and Hall (1969) (Moser Jr., J. W., Hall, O. F., 1969. For. Sci. 15, 183 – 188). Over the years, a variety of models have been developed for predicting the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands using both individual and stand-level approaches. Modeling methodology not only has moved from an empirical approach to a more ecological process-based mechanistic approach, but also has incorporated a variety of techniques, such as, (1) systems of equations, (2) nonlinear stand <b>table</b> <b>projections,</b> (3) Markov chains, (4) matrix models, and (5) artificial neural network models. However, modeling the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands has received much less attention than that of even-aged stands. This paper reviews the current literature regarding growth and yield models for uneven-aged stands, discusses basic types of models and their merits, and reports recent progress in modeling the growth and dynamics of uneven-aged stands. Furthermore, future trends involving integration of new computer technologies (object-oriented programming and user-friendly interfaces), tree visualization techniques, and the spatially explicit application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) into uneven-aged modeling strategies are discussed. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Using China's 2000 census data, {{this paper}} conducts {{population}} projection under different fertility scenarios {{to gauge the}} likely trends in China's future population change. The range of fertility assumptions captures the uncertainty of current fertility estimates {{as well as the}} likely trends under the family planning policy and economic development. Only one mortality scenario is applied and net international migration is assumed to be null in the population <b>projection.</b> Future life <b>tables</b> are generated by Brass logit techniques with initial 2000 life tables and assumed annual life expectancy at birth following the United Nations medium improvement model. China is experiencing unprecedented demographic transition together with the radical social and economic transformation. Demographically speaking China is now a developed country. However, China's future population growth is substantial, a solely result of the population momentum built into the age structure by past fertility and mortality. 10 percent or 135 million increase is expected in the next 25 years under the medium fertility scenario. China would reach a maximum population of 1443 million in 2030, followed by a long-term population decline. Two major changes of the future population age structure of China are continuing demographic dividend and rapid population ageing. China's demographic window of opportunity opened at 1990 and will close at 2033. Having a work force of around one billion has many advantages if we consider only the dependency ratio in the population or the labour supply for the development. However, China will be also experiencing a rapid population ageing after 2015. One fifth to one quarter of the Chinese population would be older people at age 65 or over after 2035. The year of 2029 would be a turning point in China's age structure transition, when {{for the first time in}} Chinese history the elderly population would exceed the child population. population projection, Brass logit transformation, life table, China...|$|R
