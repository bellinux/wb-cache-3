Among other things, there is a plan {{to improve the quality of}} the holder's photo. All new IDs will contain contact chip (until now there was a possibility of opt out for the chip) and there will also be a RFID chip incorporated in the design. The ID will be readable by <b>passport</b> <b>readers</b> and it could be programmed to contain holder's electronic signature, health insurance data, public transport subscription information, as well as, information usually contained in a driving licence. E-government portals will be made compatible with the new ID design.|$|R

The new passports {{have been designed}} indigenously by the Central Passport Organization, the India Security Press, Nashik and IIT Kanpur. The passport contains a security chip with personal data and digital images. Initially, the new passports will have a 64KB chip with a photograph of passport holder and subsequently include the holder's fingerprint(s). The biometric passport has been tested with <b>passport</b> <b>readers</b> abroad and is noted to have a 4-second response time - {{less than that of}} a US Passport (10 seconds). The passport need not be carried in a metal jacket for security reasons as it first needs to be passed through a reader, after which generates access keys to unlock the chip data for reader access.|$|R
50|$|India has {{recently}} initiated {{the first phase}} of biometric e-passport for Diplomatic passport holders in India and abroad. The new passports have been designed locally by the Central Passport Organisation, the India Security Press and IIT Kanpur. It contains a security chip with all personal data and digital images. In the first phase new passports will have a 64KB chip carrying a photograph of the passport holder and in subsequent phases it will have a fingerprint. The new passport has already been tested with <b>passport</b> <b>readers</b> in the United States and has 4-second response time, while the US Passport has 10-second response time. It need not be carried in a metal jacket for security reasons. It will first need to be skimmed through a readers, after which it would generate an access code which then unlocks the chip for reader access.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Hindi is {{the most}} popular {{language}} in India and the world's third most commonly used language after Chinese and English. Hindi script presents great challenges to design due to the large number of letters present in the script and the sophisticated way, in which they combine. Automatic recognition of handwritten characters has long been a goal of many research efforts in the pattern recognition field. Written text image may be sensed "off line " from a piece of paper by optical scanning (optical character recognition). Devanagari script has 14 vowels and 33 consonants. Vowels occur either in isolation or in combination with consonants. The net result is that there are several thousand different shapes or patterns, which makes Devanagari OCR more difficult to develop. Here focus is on the recognition of offline handwritten Hindi characters {{that can be used in}} common applications like commercial forms, bill processing systems,bank cheques, <b>passport</b> <b>readers,</b> offline document recognition generated by the expanding technological society. A comparative study of various Handwritten recognition methods is being taken into account...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{an overall}} {{procedure}} of recognizing the machine reader zone {{of a real}} world picture of a passport. To begin with, the proposed method finds the area of pass-port from the input image and its rotation angle is determined. With the rectified passport image by counter-rotating the area of <b>passport,</b> the machine <b>reader</b> zone is found and an inverse projective transform is performed to remove projective dis-tortion. Then, each code is extracted and enhanced by us-ing adaptive posterization. Template matching with improved similarity measure is applied to classify the codes. To classify the number 0 and the character O, a support vector machine is used. The experimental results show the correct character recognition rate of 99. 77 % and the correct recognition rate o...|$|R
30|$|This {{project began}} in 2002, {{but it took}} 3  years to fully {{implement}} for all 16 US passports (Meingast et al. 2007). The appearance of the e-passport {{is very similar to}} old passports, but woven into the paper of the passport, there is RFID tag that information about owner of the passport is included. Information about nationality, sex, age, and so on is scanned, as airport staff members scan the <b>passport</b> through RFID <b>reader</b> (Lorenc 2007). The US government did not stop at this point and adopted VISA Waiver Program. By 2005, the US member countries had to adopt RFID based e-passports and VISA Waiver Programs in order for their citizens to enter the United States because without e-passports, passengers could not be accepted at American points of entry. Today, the e-passport includes not only individual data but biological data, such as fingerprints (ICAO TAG MRTD/TWF 2004).|$|R
