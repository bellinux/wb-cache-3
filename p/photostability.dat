5|$|The <b>photostability</b> of {{pigments}} can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E

40|$|Some basic {{concepts}} {{and principles of}} optical dielectric slab waveguiding and experimental methodology involving characterisation of waveguide films are introduced, Results from the characterisation of thin polymeric waveguide films and measurements of refractive indices of the films are presented. The birefringence of some polymer films is analysed and discussed. The <b>photostabilities</b> of several dopants (DEMI, Ultra-DEMI, Dicyclohexyl-DEMI, Mor 2, Morpip and DCM) are investigated in a polymer matrix (PMMA), and their measured <b>photostabilities</b> are presented. These organic chromophores change their properties {{in the course of}} photodegradation. Degradation experiments are carried out by exposing the doped waveguide films to light in air, vacuum and nitrogen environments. The degradation mechanisms of these chromophores are discussed. It is found that the degradation of the DEMI, Ultra-DEMI, Dicyclohexyl-DEMI and DCM are due to photooxidation, their <b>photostabilities</b> are much higher in vacuum than in air. The Mor 2 and Morpip degrade by direct photodecomposition, their <b>photostabilities</b> are in the same order when exposed to light in their main absorption bands. The oxygen free environment (e. g. vacuum) is essential to increase their <b>photostabilities.</b> A beam branching effect in DCM doped waveguide film is observed. Stacked multi-layer waveguides are investigated as possible humidity sensors. Symmetric structure (PMMA/P- 4 VP/PMMA/P- 4 VP/PMMA) (P 4 VP-I) and unsymmetric structure (Si 02 /P- 4 VP/Zeonex/P- 4 VP/Air) (P 4 VP-II) are studied. Special procedures and process have been developed to fabricate multi-layer waveguide structures in experiments. It is found that both structures have good reversibilities and show reasonable stabilities. 30 ppm concentrations of water vapour can be detected by the P 4 VP-II structure. The experimental results show that the overall response of P 4 VP-II structure exhibits good linearity with increase of the concentration of water vapour. The structures can not only measure the phase shift of interference, but also can measure the direction of fringe movement. The sensitivity of the structure can be further improved by using different combinations of polymers in the structure...|$|R

YAG:Ce 3 + nanoparticles were dispersed in polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix films, to improve their <b>photostabilities.</b> The well-dispersed YAG:Ce 3 + nanoparticles were confirmed from transmission electron microscopy observations.

40|$|The lasing {{properties}} of analogues {{of the commercial}} laser dye pyrromethene 567 (PM 567) incorporated (dissolved or copolymerized) into polymeric matrices have been studied using both linear and cross-linked methyl methacrylate-based copolymers with different degrees of functionalization. All synthesized dyes have the chromophore core of PM 567 but with an ?-acyloxypolymethylene chain at position 8. In general, the new materials exhibited laser emission with higher efficiencies and much higher <b>photostabilities</b> than those containing the commercial dye PM 567 under the same experimental conditions. Lasing efficiencies of up to 40 % were obtained under transversal pumping at 534 nm. The highest <b>photostabilities,</b> with the laser output remaining stable or dropping by less than 15 % after 100 000 pump pulses at the same position of the sample, were reached in cross-linked materials with dyes covalently linked to the polymeric chains. When the polymeric samples were incorporated into a grazing-incidence grating oscillator, narrow-line-width operation with tuning ranges of up to 40 nm was obtained.

30|$|TiO 2 {{has been}} widely used for photocatalysts because of its good chemical- and <b>photostabilities</b> to convert photon energy to {{electrical}} and chemical energies [1]. However, due to its wide bandgap, the light absorption is limited only to the ultraviolet (UV) region of the solar spectrum. Hence, sensitizing TiO 2 with small bandgap semiconductors, such as quantum dots or organic dyes, has been extensively studied to harvest more photons in the visible light region of solar spectrum for the applications to quantum dot-sensitized solar cells [2 – 4], dye-sensitized solar cells [5 – 7], and photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells [8 – 10].|$|R
40|$|New hybrid dyes, analogs of the BODIPY laser dye PM 567, {{with the}} {{chromophore}} group covalently bound to a POSS T 8 group, {{have been prepared}} and their photophysical properties in ethyl acetate solution and in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin film solution have been studied. In PMMA solution and under comparative conditions, the dyes show higher thermostability than the parent dye PM 567, the related compound POSS(iBu) 8, and the corresponding unbound model dyes, because the first mass loss takes place at higher temperatures. In addition, their <b>photostabilities</b> in the same medium under irradiation with 365 nm light are much {{higher than those of}} the dye PM 567 or an equimolar mixture of PM 567 plus POSS(iBu) 8 under the same conditions, indicating that the POSS moiety photostabilizes the bound BODIPY group. The different <b>photostabilities</b> could be a consequence of different reactivities of the hybrid dyes with self-generated singlet oxygen, because they show lower reaction rate constant values than PM 567, although the observed tendency of these values does not correlate with that of the photodegradation quantum yield values. The new hybrid materials can be employed in applications where highly photostable and highly emissive dyes are required. Work supported by the Spanish CICYT (Project MAT 2007 - 65778 -C 02 - 01).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to improve the laser performance, in terms of {{threshold}} and operational lifetime, of lasers based on polymer films doped with perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives as active media. For such purpose, we first investigated the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties of perylene orange (PDI-O), when doped into polystyrene (PS) films. Lower ASE thresholds and larger <b>photostabilities</b> than those of similar films containing another PDI derivative (PDI-C 6), recently reported in the literature, have been measured. Results have been interpreted {{in terms of the}} photoluminescence efficiency of the films, which depends on the type of molecular arrangement, inferred with the help of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. We also show that PS films have a better ASE performance, i. e. lower thresholds and larger <b>photostabilities,</b> than those based on poly(methyl methacrylate), which was recently highlighted {{as one of the best}} matrixes for PDI-O. Finally, a one-dimensional second-order distributed feedback laser using PS doped with PDI-O was fabricated and characterized.
