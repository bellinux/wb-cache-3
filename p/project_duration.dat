Due to many weather factors that affect <b>projects</b> <b>duration</b> the principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce unnecessary factors. Also the priority and the importance of determined factors are evaluated using and analytical network process (ANP).

40|$|Projects {{are usually}} {{performed}} in relatively unstable environments. As such, {{changes to the}} baseline schedules of projects are inevitable. Therefore, project progress needs to be monitored and controlled. The control process can be assumed as a continuum in which one side is continuous control {{and the other side}} is no-control. Continuous control and no-control strategies are cost-wise prohibited. Hence, project progress should be controlled at some discrete points in time during the <b>project's</b> <b>duration.</b> The optimal number and timing of control points are the main issues that should be addressed. In this paper, taking a dynamic view to the project control, {{for the first time we}} use an adapted version of the facility location model (FLM) to find the optimal timing of project control points. Initially, the adapted FLM determines the optimum timing of the control points in the <b>project's</b> <b>duration.</b> A simulation model is then used to predict the possible disruptions in the time period between the beginning of the project and the first control point (monitoring phase). If no disruptions are observed, the project's progress is monitored in the second control point, otherwise possible corrective actions are taken using an activity compression model. Whenever due to disruptions, the baseline schedule is to be updated, the FLM is run again to determine the new timing of the control points for the rest of the <b>project's</b> <b>duration.</b> In an iterative manner, this process continues until the timing of the last control point is determined. status: publishe...|$|R

Of the 130 edentulous patients, 30. 8 % needed dental treatment of a mean <b>projected</b> <b>duration</b> of about 194 min per patient. Patients exhibiting high (greater than 60 min) dental treatment needs were more frequently impaired in {{activities of daily living}} than patients with low (less than or equal to 60 min) dental treatment needs (e. g. impaired transfer function 60. 2 % vs. 28. 0 %). There was no difference in the oral hygiene or in the cleanliness of removable dentures between patients needing and not needing help in activities of daily living. In conclusion, the present results show a high amount of dental treatment needed in elderly patients. For the planning of an effective dental care program, special attention has to be paid to the interdisciplinary treatment of patients with limitations in activities of daily living. Furthermore, the improvement of the oral hygiene status is of paramount importance in most elderly patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
