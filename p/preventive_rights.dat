40|$|Background: Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} disease, which {{can go on}} for many decades with no {{clinically}} noticable changes. When clinical symptoms appear, the disease has usually already significantly progressed. There is currently no effective treatment for atherosclerosis.   The disease can only be prevented. This {{is why it is}} important to detect it in its early stages, when preventive measures are the most effective. Today, with a help of non-invasive investigation methods, mostly ultrasound based,  we can detect changes in the structure and function of artery wall, which are typical for the early stages of atherosclerosis or predict the disease course. Conclusions: Such changes are: lower capability of artery expansion during an increased blood flow (endothelial dysfunction), intima-media thickening, artery walls, artery calcination and ankle-brachial index decrease. The research showed that these symptoms of preclinical atherosclerosis are tightly connected to authenticity of the risk factors, their number and duration, {{and that there is a}} tight connection between the general cardiovascular danger and the manifestation of preclinical and morphological changes of an artery wall. Preclinical atherosclerotic changes are very important signals of cardiovascular changes and are independent of classical atherosclerotic risk factors. Contrary to the current means of evaluating risks (see tables) that enable us to evaluate statistical values concerning risks for the population based on present risk factors, assessing the preclinical forms of atherosclerosis enables us to recognize those individuals who are at greatest risk, i. e. those where a process of atherosclerosis has already begun and who need immediate elimination of the risk factors. In this way, the finding of a disturbance in the vein wall (endothelial dysfunction) or its structure (intima-media  thickening) can help choose the <b>right</b> <b>preventive</b> measure, meaning that in patients, where the general risk is, according to classical risk factors, which were established to be low or medium, suggesting the usage of intensive preventive measures, including the usage of drugs, used for treating current risk factors, even though there is a borderline or a minor increase of their values. </p...|$|R

40|$|Wind power, as {{a source}} of {{renewable}} energy, is growing very fast. Especially so, is consideration given to offshore wind farms where expansion {{is due in part to}} limited social and visual impact, reduced noise effect of turbines, and at the same time higher production of offshore wind turbines. Maintenance is always a considerable and costly part of the wind power investment, especially for offshore projects, but it could not improve as fast as the increasing wind industry in the world. The operation and maintenance management of wind farms should have always a reliable and structured planning to have an economical investment. At the beginning of the growth of wind industry, companies tried to transfer responsibilities of the failure and loss of production to the insurance companies, but it cannot be continued any more. These days even the insurance companies ask about regular inspection or condition monitoring. In other words, they ask for a reliable strategy for operation and maintenance. Both preventative and corrective maintenance are used in offshore wind farms. Preventive maintenance is usually performed at the first sign of failure, and in so doing it helps reduce costs associated from lost production. Having a perfect preventive maintenance program is not easy and it usually needs more inspection and online monitoring. To select a suitable strategy, data should be gathered from different stakeholders who are involved in the project. The stakeholders could be turbine designers, construction companies, transportation companies, operation staff, etc. The reason is that each group has the data which could help to define a reliable strategy of maintenance. Reliability includes measurements, e. g., failure rate, repair time, and availability. Reliability is the ability of components or system to perform their function under given operational condition and for a predicted period of time. However always preventive maintenance especially for offshore wind farm is faced with uncertainty due to bad weather, access difficulty, and logistic limitation. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a systematic qualitative technique that balances preventive and corrective maintenance. It chooses the <b>right</b> <b>preventive</b> maintenance activities for the right component at the right time to reach the most cost efficient solution. This research points out that RCM, as an experienced methodology in other industries, could be a good method for scheduled preventive maintenance in offshore wind power for purposes of lowering cost while improving reliability and safety. RCM implementation is always facing with uncertainty. Engaged uncertainty to RCM is known as Reliability and Risk Centered Maintenance RRCM and it could lead maintenance process to an optimal preventive schedule with minimum uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|During {{the winter}} of 2001 - 2002, in a sector of the {{district}} of Vaise (Lyons, Rhône), an archaeological excavation {{was carried out by}} the Institut national de recherches archéologiques <b>préventives.</b> On the <b>right</b> bank of the Saône, at a distance of approximately six kilometres {{to the north of the}} current junction of the river with the Rhône, the Vaise plain (altitude about 170 m) is limited by the buttresses of the Lyons plateau. Located 60 m from the bank of the Saône, above the plain, the sedimentary stratigraphy of Quai Paul Sédallian (168 m) depends on processes of slope and mainly of alluvial dynamics. The presence of an industrial fill and the poor legibility of the sedimentary succession did not facilitate analysis of the site. In such a context, geomorphological study thus proved essential. The occupation, attributed to the Burgundian Middle Neolithic era (NMB), is characterized by an anthropic ground level SL 303, the pit FS 229 and the structure E 246. The function of SL 303, the floor of a domestic area or a mere circulation level, remains unknown. Observed over a small area (43 m 2), it could form part of the installation characterised by the sub-quadrangular pit FS 229 and the structure E 246. The latter, with its irregular shape, yielded cremated human bones (0. 8 g and 128. 4 g) mixed with charcoals. A single burnt human bone comes from SL 303. The great majority of the bones are those of an adult, while some pieces belong to a child. These bones come from a true cremation (the bones were burnt fresh, at a temperature of between 750 and 1050 °). Pit FS 229 appears to contain selected bones (absence of trunk, hands and feet), while the structure E 246 holds pieces of various anatomical parts. The boundaries of the archaeological investigation reduce the possibilities of interpretation: the nature of the whole NMB occupation is difficult to identify; if FS 229 and E 246 concern funerary activity, the remainder delivered few indications arguing in favour of a domestic space. One argument rests on the representativeness of the ceramic ware, because we observe a clear prevalence of medium-sized containers. If the absence of fine forms can be explained by differential conservation, storage containers are missing. Cups and bowls represent the main pari of the identified recipients (ten out of eleven); only one large earthenware jar was identified. The sample seems incomplete or biased. The presence of human remains is not enough to draw the conclusion of a strictly funerary context. Neolithic dwellings, including some NMB examples, frequently deliver human bones, while in strictly sepulchral contexts, potsherds and partial remains are regularly present. Most of the data collected for the Middle, Recent and Late Neolithic show that the relationship between sepulchral and domestic spaces is very close, even if a true synchrony can seldom be established. Our configuration may as easily represent successive occupations as juxtaposed activities. Either the apparent selection of the ceramic goods on Quay Sédallian is to be put in relationship with conservation problems on the site, or it depends on the nature of the installation; the pots in that case would correspond to a choice with regard to funerary gestures. These two assumptions are not incompatible and can both be retained. Only truncated scraps remain from the occupation level: part of ground level SL 303, the pit FS 229 and the (probably natural) basin, E 246. Moreover, the distribution of the ceramological types by archaeological unit makes it possible to oppose the series of containers from SL 303 to those from E 246 and FS 229. The first contains only simple forms, whereas the definitely segmented profiles (earthenware jar with shoulders and vase with carinated and rounded bottom) come from the second. The simple forms are very fragmented, while the segmented profiles are complete or almost so. This difference, undoubtedly functional, leads us to interpret ground SL 303 as a circulation level, whereas E 246 and FS 229 concern deposits of cremated remains. From an archaeological point of view, structure E 246, FS 229 and SL 303 are dependent. The typology of the ceramics (24 pots, including 11 identifiable forms) attests to the synchrony of E 246 and FS 229 and of their contents (cremated bones). Ground SL 303, close to them, but with no stratigraphic relation, belongs to the same chrono-cultural phase. This surface could be contemporary with E 246 and FS 229. If SL 303 is a circulation level synchronous with the funerary activity, two different models can be proposed: 1) E 246 is a pit, in which part of the cremated remains was deposited, coming from a double pyre or two pyres. If the bone remains of FS 229 and E 246 concern the same two individuals, that implies an elaborate funerary process, but we cannot be sure that they belong to the same skeletons. The potsherds from these two entities cannot be connected to each other. 2) E 246 is not a pit, but a natural depression in an occupation level. It would represent an area on which funerary pyre remains were tossed aside, and E 246 would be part of this level, trapped in a depression. This assumption can be corroborated by the presence of the femur fragment found on the ground SL 303. The surface concerned by this level would include FS 229, E 246 and SL 303. The complete vessel VP 245, in E 246, combined with the random representation of the skeleton (head and members only present) suggests a voluntary deposit in connection with the remains of the cremation (bones and charcoals), thus meeting the definition of a «cremation deposit» (secondary burial). The poor conservation of the site (greatly damaged by the impact of industrial installations) and the sedimentary sequences did not facilitate the interpretation of the ground. To affirm an archaeological bond between the vestiges, we had AMS dating carried out on the cremated human bones. The results, consistent with NMB ceramic typology, ensure the chrono-cultural attribution and the association of the pots with the human bones (Lyon- 2164 (Oxa) : 5080 +/- 30 BP; more probable dates: - 3845, - 3817, - 3857, - 3939, - 3875 B. C.; for 95 %: from 3962 to 3792 B. C.). The treatment of the dead in NMB contexts concerns exclusively burials, practised in coffins or under a stone tumulus. Cases of partial cremation are however recorded at Mont-Vaudois (Héricourt, Haute-Saône). In the chrono-cultural context of the NMB (Cortaillod, Lagozza, Late Chassey), the tombs contain one or more skeletons. Sometimes, isolated human bones are found in dwellings. Some burials, often double, were carried out in caves or in storage pits in open domestic spaces. Generally, cremations are not encountered in the Late Chassey, Munzingen, Pfyn or Cortaillod horizons, contemporary with the NMB. We know only three examples of true cremation in the Middle Neolithic period: the necropolis of Camp-del-Ginebre (Caramany, Pyrénées-Orientales), two tombs of Abri 2, Fraischamp (Roque-sur-Perne, Vaucluse), and one deposit in a pit at Vallon de Gaude (Manosque, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence). In the majority of the cases where fire is used, the treatment concerns more the structure (stones, walls) than the bodies. While some skeletons carry specific traces of burning, it is not possible to speak of cremations. The use of fire in a sepulchral context seems more frequent during the Late Neolithic period. The practice of cremation appears marginal in the Neolithic era, and presents various forms in its final phase. The discovery of Sédallian seems to indicate that while inhumation seems to have dominated, cremation appears to have been more frequent than merely anecdotal or incidental. The latter emerges in Western Europe during the 4 th millennium ВС. It should be specified that the vestiges presented here illustrate the only certified cremation for the NMB. The ceramic corpus and the date agree for the attribution of this occupation to an early phase of the cultural group, in a southernmost position compared to the eponym zone of Franche-Comté and Burgundy. Un secteur du quartier de Vaise (Lyon, Rhône) a fait l'objet d'une fouille préventive au 51 - 53 quai Paul Sédallian. En rive droite de la Saône, à environ six kilomètres au nord de la confluence actuelle de cette rivière avec le fleuve Rhône, l'occupation attribuée au Néolithique moyen bourguignon (NMB) se caractérise par un sol anthropique SL 303, une fosse FS 229 et l'ensemble E 246. SL 303, observé sur une faible extension (43 m 2), pourrait faire partie de l'installation caractérisée par la fosse FS 229 et l'ensemble E 246, qui livrent des résidus de crémation. Un os humain brûlé provient de SL 303. Les os ont été brûlés à l'état frais et sont en majorité ceux d'un adulte, seuls quelques éléments appartiennent à un enfant. L'occupation NMB est difficile à caractériser, cependant FS 229 et E 246 se rapportent à une activité funéraire et peu d'éléments plaident en faveur d'un habitat. Parmi le corpus céramique, coupes et écuelles représentent l'essentiel des récipients identifiés (dix sur onze), une seule jarre a été reconnue. L'échantillon semble incomplet ou biaisé. Soit l'apparente sélection de ce mobilier est à mettre en relation avec l'état de conservation du site (fort impact destructeur des aménagements industriels), soit elle dépend de la nature de l'installation; les récipients traduiraient dans ce cas un choix en relation avec les gestes funéraires. En outre, la répartition des types par ensemble archéologique permet d'opposer la série des récipients issus du sol SL 303 à celle des excavations (E 246 et FS 229). La différence entre les formes représentées dans chaque contexte est sans doute fonctionnelle et conduit à interpréter le sol SL 303 comme un niveau de circulation, alors que E 246 et FS 229 se rapportent à des dépôts de vestiges de crémation. D'un point de vue archéologique, les faits E 246, FS 229 et SL 303 sont liés. La typologie de la céramique, ainsi que leur contenu (os humains brûlés), assurent la synchronie de E 246 et de FS 229. Le sol SL 303, proche, mais sans relation stratigraphique, appartient à la même phase chronoculturelle. Pour affirmer le lien archéologique entre les vestiges, un datage par le Centre de datation radiocarbone de Lyon sur os humains brûlés a été réalisé. Le résultat (Lyon- 2164 (Oxa) : 5080 +/- 30 BP), en adéquation avec la typologie céramique NMB, assure l'attribution chronoculturelle et l'association des récipients avec les os humains brûlés. Les vestiges de Sédallian illustrent la seule crémation certifiée pour le NMB. Le corpus céramique et la date sont en concordance pour attribuer cette occupation à une phase ancienne de ce groupe culturel, en position méridionale par rapport à la zone éponyme de la Franche-Comté et de la Bourgogne.

40|$|In {{order to}} survive, {{the human body}} has to protect itself against the {{continuous}} threat of external aggressions, as well as against endogenous stress caused by ageing, dysfunctional, mutated or damaged cells. In conditions of extreme stress, the organism will either recover quickly and survive, or will succumb. Thanks to innovations in intensive care medicine, patients are nowadays able to survive such acute life-threatening conditions. Unfortunately, not all patients will recover from this acuteinsult within a few days. A substantial proportion of the patients willthus enter a state of prolonged critical illness, which is characterised by, amongst others, profound disruption of endocrine and immune homeostasis. Traditionally, the immune system has been divided into innate and acquired components. The innate immune system comprises the primitive, first-line defences against invasion by microorganisms and {{plays an important role}} in healing of tissue damage. Inflammation is the basic reaction that aims at removing the nocuous intruder and at damage repair. However, uncontrolled inflammation can cause additionaldamage. Critically ill patients are extremely vulnerable to complications that develop due to dysregulated inflammation, leading to prolonged dependency on intensive care, organ dysfunction and eventually death. Critically ill patients typically develop hyperglycaemia during acute stress. This metabolic response has long been considered an adaptive phenomenon, that guarantees sufficient glucose supply to organs that depend on glucose for energy production but do not require insulin for its uptake. Unfortunately, during periods of prolonged stress, hyperglycaemia persists and fuels the inflammatory cascade, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Our research group demonstratedin three large randomised studies that maintaining normoglycaemia with intensive insulin therapy (IIT) reduced morbidity and mortality of critically ill patients, as compared with tolerating stress hyperglycaemia (conventional insulin therapy, CIT). The randomised intervention reduced infectious complications and prevented excessive inflammation and organ dysfunction. Both prevention of hyperglycaemia as well as direct effects of insulin may have contributed to the beneficial effects of the therapy. Unexpectedly, besides a lowering of the C-reactive protein (CRP), no effect of IIT could be demonstrated on the classical pro-inflammatory cytokines that traditionally are put forward as central mediators of inflammation after trauma or infection. This raised the question whether there could be an interaction with other components of innate immunity. The aim of this thesis was to increase insight in how criticalillness affects the innate immune system, in relation to the typical complications, and what the impact is of strict glycaemic control with insulin. Since the beneficial effects of the therapy could not be explainedby alterations in the classical pro-inflammatory cytokines, we hypothesised that other pathways are involved. We thus focused on the study of several components of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) axis, sCD 163 as a marker of macrophage activation, and the lectinpathway of complement activation. In addition, we investigated the potential role of genetic predisposition in the acquisition of the typical complications of prolonged critical illness, an insight that might enableus in the future to make the <b>right</b> <b>preventive</b> and therapeutic decisionsfor each individual patient. Engagement of the RAGE receptor by ligand binding leads to amplification and perpetuation of inflammation. NF-κB activation, amongst others, induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of the RAGE receptor, generating a positive feedback loop of persistent inflammation. Thus, RAGE activation has been linked to inflammation, organ damage and adverse outcome in for instance sepsis, myocardial dysfunction and acute lung injury. Moreover, we know from the diabetes literature that hyperglycaemiaplays a pivotal role in the development of typical inflammatory complications, which amongst others is driven by hyperglycaemia-induced production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), in turn leading to increased oxidative stress and enhanced RAGE activation. Other RAGE ligands include high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1, a ubiquitous nuclear protein released by cellular injury or cell death) and S 100 A 12 (a typical danger-signal protein released by activated neutrophils). sRAGE is the cleaved,circulating isoform of RAGE, which possibly acts as a decoy receptor and would thus protect against further RAGE activation. We studied the relation of sRAGE, HMGB 1 and S 100 A 12 with baseline characteristics and clinical outcome of a large heterogeneous group of prolonged critically ill patients who had undergone major surgery. We comparedthese parameters with CRP, which is the classical, routinely measured clinical parameter of inflammation. Levels of sRAGE, HMGB 1, S 100 A 12 and CRP were elevated upon admission to the ICU. HMGB 1, S 100 A 12 and CRP levels decreased during ICU stay, but remained above healthy control levels. In contrast, sRAGE decreased to levels that were significantly lower than those of healthy volunteers. Cardiac surgery was associated with a lower grade of inflammation, reflected by lower upon-admission CRP, HMGB 1 and S 100 A 12 levels, as compared with other types of surgery. Conversely, sepsis upon admission was associated with higher levels of CRP, HMGB 1 and S 100 A 12. sRAGE did not differ for these baseline characteristics. In particular a high upon-admission sRAGE level was associated with a higherrisk of hospital mortality and organ dysfunction (liver dysfunction, need for renal replacement therapy and hemodynamic support). Also in multivariable analysis correcting for baseline risk factors, sRAGE remained an independent predictor of organ dysfunction. Unexpectedly, the randomised IIT intervention did not affect circulating levels of sRAGE, HMGB 1 and S 100 A 12. From this study, we concluded that critical illness affects several components of the RAGE axis and that sRAGE is associated with clinical complications of critical illness. sRAGE likely reflects ongoing inflammation and shedding of the receptor. CD 163 is a receptor that is exclusively expressed by monocytes and macrophages and is considered to reflect macrophage activation. The receptor scavenges haemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes from the circulation and plays a role in the resolution of inflammation. Under inflammatory stimuli, CD 163 is cleaved from the membrane surface. The shedded, circulating soluble CD 163 thus reflects ongoing inflammation. sCD 163 has been proposed as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in small uniform groups of patients with systemic inflammation (SIRS), pneumococcal bacteraemia and liver failure, and also in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. We studied sCD 163 in a large group of critically ill patients with widely varying pathologies. We included short- and long-stay surgical and medical ICU patients. Critically ill patients presented with elevated sCD 163 levels upon admission to ICU, as compared with healthy controls. High admission levels were associated with an increased risk of mortality, organ dysfunction (liver and kidney dysfunction) and a prolonged stay in ICU, but was not associated with infection (bacteraemia). The already elevated sCD 163 levels upon admission further increased during ICU stay, especially in those patients who subsequently developed organ failure or who ultimately died. Preventing hyperglycaemia with IIT slightly attenuated the elevated sCD 163 levels. The CD 163 mRNA levels in postmortem liver samples from critically ill patients were approximately twice ashigh as those of healthy control patients (who underwent uncomplicated elective surgery) and correlated with the respective circulating levels. We concluded from this study that sCD 163 levels are increased during critical illness, with the liver as potential source. This study underscores the association between increased sCD 163 and organ damage and mortality in critical illness. Maintaining normoglycaemia with IIT decreased circulating sCD 163 levels, supporting the anti-inflammatory effect of the therapy. Most often, clinical studies in ICU exclude children, as they represent only a small population, spread over different developmental stages. Results obtained from adult studies are too often extrapolated to children. In this regard, a large randomised study onIIT in our paediatric ICU, represents a landmark. Children are admittedto the paediatric ICU after major or life-threatening surgery, extensive trauma or severe infection. Systemic inflammation, evoked by differentcauses, is a serious complication which is associated with high morbidity. Moreover, critically ill children are extremely prone to nosocomial infections. The question why some patients are more susceptible to developing these complications than others is intriguing and raises the possibility of genetic predisposition. Defects in complement activation have been linked to increased susceptibility to infections in young children with an immature adaptive immune system (like neonates) and in children with associated pathologies (like e. g. cancer). In these situations, combatting infection is predominantly based on the integrity of the innate immune system. The complement system has an important role in inflammation and repair of tissue damage, opsonisation and clearance of immune complexes, and in lysis of microorganisms. Insufficient as well as excessive activation of the complement system can be detrimental. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins are circulating receptor proteins that recognise and bind specific molecular patterns on e. g. microorganisms. They associate with a MBL-associated serine protease (MASP) or MBL-associated protein (MAp). MBL/MASP- or ficolin/MASP-complexes then activate the complement cascade by the so-called lectin-pathway of complement activation. We studied MBL, MASP- 1, MASP- 2, MASP- 3, MAp 44, and M- and H-ficolin in all critically ill children included in the randomised study on IIT as well as in a cohort of healthy children. As alreadydescribed in healthy children, there was a certain age-related variation in the levels of these proteins in critically ill children. Serum levels of MASP- 1, MASP- 2, MASP- 3 and MAp 44 were lower in critically ill children as compared with age-matched healthy controls, while levels of M-ficolin appeared to be higher upon ICU admission. In particular a low MASP- 3 level upon admission was independently associated with the risk of acquiring a new infection and with the risk of needing prolonged intensivecare. This association remained after correction for known risk factors. MASP- 3 levels varied with age, severity of illness and with two of thestudied genetic polymorphisms in the MASP- 1 gene, which encodes MASP- 1, MASP- 3 and MAp 44. This genetic variation, however, was not related to outcome. The different alleles for these polymorphisms were equally distributed in patients and controls. This means that genetic variation inthe studied polymorphisms does not engender predisposition to critical illness, nor to adverse outcome of critical illness. We analysed profiles of the proteins in a subgroup of patients, in order to detect any effect of the randomised IIT intervention. However, levels of the measured components of the lectin pathway were comparable in CIT and IIT patients. Thus, we were able to demonstrate that low upon ICU-admission MASP- 3 levels are independently associated with the risk of acquiring a new infection and with the risk of a prolonged ICU stay in critically ill children, while IIT did not appear to have any effect on circulating levels of several proteins of the lectin pathway of complement activation. As indicated, preventing stress-related hyperglycaemia with IIT in critical illness reduces morbidity and mortality, with a decreasein new infections and an attenuation of excessive inflammation. However, this intervention did not affect circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. In summary for this doctoral thesis, we can state that our studies did not provide a clear explanation to further understand this effect, as we only encountered a small effect on sCD 163. However, the studied pathways captured important signals as several components of the studied inflammatory pathways appeared to be strongly associated with outcome. The biological implications of these findings are unclear at this time and need to be clarified in future research. Additional epidemiological and molecular research is indeed needed to further unravel these insights in arelatively underexplored area of very complex processes in the critically ill patient. status: publishe...|$|R
