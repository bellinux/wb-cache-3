40|$|Abstract. Nuchal ligaments from midwestern U. <b>S.</b> <b>horses</b> {{infected}} with adult Onchocerca sp. were studied. The prevalence of Onchocerca sp. infection in horses increased with age. Ten percent of horses {{less than one}} year old were infected, 28 % of horses one to five years old, 48 % of horses six to 15 years old, and 90 % of horses over 16 years old. Lesions in Onchocerca sp. -infected nuchal ligaments varied with age of the horse. Horses less than five years old had few or no lesions, whereas most horses six to 15 years old had focal mineralization and granuloma formation around adult worms. In infected nuchal ligaments of horses over 16 years old, mineralization was much greater and fewer normal parasites were found. Our data suggest that infection by viable parasites is terminated naturally. Equine onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection of horses, with world-wide distribu-tion, caused by a filiarial worm of the genus Onchocerca. The adults of Onchocerca cervicalis, Railliet and Henry 1910, are found in the ligamentous tissue adjacent to the nuchal attachment of the thoracic vertebral spinous processes and in and around the supraspinous bursa. With one exception, the prevalence of Onchocerca sp. infections in U. <b>S.</b> <b>horses</b> ha...|$|R

40|$|Introduction In its heyday, the 1920 s {{through the}} late 1950 <b>s,</b> <b>horse</b> racing was a highly popular spectator sport. But after decades of prosperity, horse racing has flashed warning signs of {{economic}} trouble. Throughout the industry, old tracks, like Hialeah, are closing and new tracks are experiencing economic difficulties due to legalized off-track betting {{and other forms of}} legalized gambling. 1 Off-track betting and inter-track wagering, along with the proliferation of other gambling options, have been cited by many as reasons for the recent decline in both on-track horse racing attendance and handle. A widening gap between horse racing and other forms of wagering represents a shift in American gambling behavior. This shift in gambling preferences has long-term implications for the horse racing industry in general and specific implications for the industry in Nebraska.
