40|$|The Department of Physics at San Diego State University has {{maintained}} a Neutron Generator facility in room P- 32 C since the mid 1960 `s. This facility has provided students and faculty with a resource {{for the study of}} neutron interactions with matter, such as activation analysis, flux determinations, cross section determinations and shielding studies. The model 9500 was built by Texas Nuclear Research in the early 1960 `s, and could be used for either photon or neutron generation, depending on the source ions introduced into the accelerator`s <b>plasma</b> <b>bottle</b> and the target material. In February of 1988, the Texas Nuclear Research neutron generator was replaced by a unit manufactured by Kaman Sciences Corporation. The Texas Nuclear unit was then removed and stored for later disassembly and disposal. In the summer of 1993, the neutron generator was disassembled into three large sections consisting of the titanium-tritide target, the oil diffusion pump and the corona shield/accelerator tube assembly. The target was packaged and stored in room P- 33 A and the other 2 assemblies were wrapped in plastic for storage. In June of 1995 the neutron generator was further disassembled to enable storage in 55 gallon drums and thoroughly surveyed for loose surface contamination. Openings on the disassembled hardware components were closed off using either duct tape or bolted stainless steel flanges to prevent the possible spread of contamination. Significant levels of removable surface contamination could be found on system internal and some external surfaces, up to five hundred thousand disintegrations per minute. Initial analysis of the removable contamination using aluminum absorbers and a Geiger-Meuller tube indicated beta particle or possibly photon emitters with an energy of approximately 180 keV. This apparent radiation energy conflicted with what one would be expected to find, given knowledge of the source material and the possible neutron activated products that would be present in this type of unit. All activation products of neutron generator components, {{as a result of the}} exposure to 14 MeV neutrons are short lived, and would have decayed to below detection levels in the period of time since the unit was last operated, a period of approximately six years. This project consists of identifying the nuclide responsible for the apparent radiation energy. Additionally, as a service to San Diego State`s Radiation Safety Office, an estimate of the amount of activity in the unit will be made, as required for future disposal purposes as well as packaging the unit for shipment according to current state and federal regulations...|$|E
50|$|Roe {{also took}} part in the Battle of the Bulge at Bastogne. Allied {{supplies}} were low and Roe had to go from man to man to get more supplies. In the extreme cold weather, he had to tuck <b>plasma</b> <b>bottles</b> into his armpits to keep them from freezing.|$|R
5000|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of life above and {{beyond the call of duty}}. SP6 Joel demonstrated indomitable courage, determination, and professional skill when a numerically superior and well-concealed Viet Cong element launched a vicious attack which wounded or killed nearly every man in the lead squad of the company. After treating the men wounded by the initial burst of gunfire, he bravely moved forward to assist others who were wounded while proceeding to their objective. While moving from man to man, he was struck in the right leg by machine gun fire. Although painfully wounded his desire to aid his fellow soldiers transcended all personal feeling. He bandaged his own wound and self-administered morphine to deaden the pain enabling him to continue his dangerous undertaking. Through this period of time, he constantly shouted words of encouragement to all around him. Then, completely ignoring the warnings of others, and his pain, he continued his search for wounded, exposing himself to hostile fire; and, as bullets dug up the dirt around him, he held <b>plasma</b> <b>bottles</b> high while kneeling completely engrossed in his life saving mission. Then, after being struck a second time and with a bullet lodged in his thigh, he dragged himself over the battlefield and succeeded in treating 13 more men before his medical supplies ran out. Displaying resourcefulness, he saved the life of one man by placing a plastic bag over a severe chest wound to congeal the blood. As 1 of the platoons pursued the Viet Cong, an insurgent force in concealed positions opened fire on the platoon and wounded many more soldiers. With a new stock of medical supplies, SP6 Joel again shouted words of encouragement as he crawled through an intense hail of gunfire to the wounded men. After the 24-hour battle subsided and the Viet Cong dead numbered 410, snipers continued to harass the company. Throughout the long battle, SP6 Joel never lost sight of his mission as a medical aidman and continued to comfort and treat the wounded until his own evacuation was ordered. His meticulous attention to duty saved a large number of lives and his unselfish, daring example under most adverse conditions was an inspiration to all. SP6 Joel's profound concern for his fellow soldiers, {{at the risk}} of his life above and beyond the call of duty are in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his country.|$|R
30|$|Malitson et al. (1973) {{were also}} able to track an IP shock—from the Sun to 1 AU using a type II radio burst {{observed}} by the IMP- 6 mission. Watanabe et al. (1973) used the interplanetary scintillation (IPS) technique to identify transient interplanetary disturbances associated with solar flares. The transients were identified as an enhancement in the solar wind speed over a very short duration (see also Rickett 1975). Gosling et al. (1973) found that the ejecta behind interplanetary shocks detected by Vela 3 had unusually low proton temperature, high speed, low density, and helium enrichment. These authors suggested that the low temperature must have resulted from the magnetic bottle configuration in the ejecta and the adiabatic cooling of the <b>plasma</b> in the <b>bottle.</b> Gosling et al.’s (1973) observations provided direct confirmation of the Gold (1962) picture shown in Fig.  3.|$|R
40|$|At the Institute for Electrical Engineering and Plasma Technology (AEPT) {{investigations}} on plasma sterilization {{and surface}} modification of thermolabile materials are performed. Our first field is plasma treatment of medical implants made of titanium, UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight PolyEthylen) and degradable polylactide. In a total treatment time of two minutes the developed process reduces germs by six and pyrogens {{by more than}} four decades, respectively. A modified plasma discharge hardens the surface of UHMWPE. Gel content measurements indicate the improvement of abrasion resistance while the bulk material is unaffected. An increasing part of non-carbonated and non-acidic beverages have been bottled in PET (Polyethylentherephthalat). Sensitive products require aseptic filling. <b>Plasma</b> treatment prepares <b>bottles</b> without toxic residua. To improve the shelf-live of oxygen-sensitive soft drinks a diffusion barrier made of SiOx-layer can be deposited {{on the inner side}} of the PET bottle. At the end of an optimization phase the combined sterilization and coating process should take ten seconds. Figure 1 : Artificial hip joint made of compound material (Titanium, steel, UHMWPE...|$|R
40|$|Recently Shukurov et al [Phys Rev E (2008) ] {{presented}} a numerical solution of a Moebius strip dynamo flow, to investigate {{its use in}} modelling dynamo flows in Perm torus of liquid sodium dynamo experiments. Here, by analogy one presents an electric dynamo on a twisted torus or Klein bottle topology. An exact solution {{in the form of}} flat Klein bottle dynamo flow is obtained. It is shown that {{even in the absence of}} magnetic dynamos initial electric fields can be amplified in distinct points of the Klein bottle. In this case diffusion is taken as η≈ 5. 0 × 10 ^- 3 Ω-m the electric potential is obtained. The difference of electric fields at the beginning of plasma flow profile is ΔE_Dyn≈ 468 V/m, which is stronger than the electric dynamo field obtained in the magnetic axis of spheromaks, which is of the order of E_Dyn≈ 200 V/m. The potential of the dynamo at the surface of the Earth computed by Boozer [Phys Fluids B (1993) ] of Φ≈ 160 V, is used to obtain the magnetic vector constant A_ 0 ≈ 10 ^ 6 V. In general the associated magnetic dynamo is shown to be a fast dynamo in force-free <b>plasmas</b> in Klein <b>bottle.</b> Of course if the magnetic dynamo growth is turned on the electric dynamo shall be able to sustain itself along the Klein bottle.

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Medical Corpsman with a rifle company, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Okinawa Jima, Ryukyu Islands, 2 May 1945. Fearlessly braving the fury of artillery, mortar, and machinegun fire from strongly entrenched hostile positions, Bush constantly and unhesitatingly moved from one casualty to another to attend the wounded falling under the enemy's murderous barrages. As the attack passed over a ridge top, Bush was advancing to administer blood plasma to a marine officer lying wounded on the skyline when the Japanese launched a savage counterattack. In this perilously exposed position, he resolutely maintained the flow of life-giving <b>plasma.</b> With the <b>bottle</b> held high in one hand, Bush drew his pistol with the other and fired into the enemy's ranks until his ammunition was expended. Quickly seizing a discarded carbine, he trained his fire on the Japanese charging pointblank over the hill, accounting for six of the enemy despite his own serious wounds and the loss of one eye suffered during his desperate battle in defense of the helpless man. With the hostile force finally routed, he calmly disregarded his own critical condition to complete his mission, valiantly refusing medical treatment for himself until his officer patient had been evacuated, and collapsing only after attempting to walk to the battle aid station. His daring initiative, great personal valor, and heroic spirit of self-sacrifice in service of others reflect great credit upon Bush and enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.|$|R
