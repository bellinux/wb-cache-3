5|$|At {{the time}} of the attacks, {{approximately}} 18,000people worked in the <b>Pentagon,</b> which was 4,000fewer than before renovations began in 1998. The section of the <b>Pentagon</b> that was struck, which had recently been renovated at a cost of $250million, housed the Naval Command Center.|$|E
5|$|In Arlington County, The <b>Pentagon</b> Memorial was {{completed}} and {{opened to the}} public on the seventh anniversary of the attacks in 2008. It consists of a landscaped park with 184 benches facing the <b>Pentagon.</b> When the <b>Pentagon</b> was repaired in 2001–2002, a private chapel and indoor memorial were included, located at the spot where Flight 77 crashed into the building.|$|E
5|$|A monohedral tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a <b>pentagon</b> tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular <b>pentagon,</b> , is not a divisor of 2.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentagons</b> have a {{peculiar}} relationship with hexagons. As demonstrated graphically below, {{some types of}} hexagons can be subdivided into <b>pentagons.</b> For example, a regular hexagon bisects into two type 1 <b>pentagons.</b> Subdivision of convex hexagons is also possible with three (type 3), four (type 4) and nine (type 3) <b>pentagons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... {5,5} is {{composed}} of 3 coplanar <b>pentagons</b> around a vertex and two perpendicular <b>pentagons</b> filling the gap.|$|R
50|$|Each {{enumerated}} tiling family contains <b>pentagons</b> {{that belong}} to no other type; however, some individual <b>pentagons</b> may belong to multiple types. In addition, some of the <b>pentagons</b> in the known tiling types also permit alternative tiling patterns beyond the standard tiling exhibited by all members of its type.|$|R

5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the <b>Pentagon,</b> away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the <b>Pentagon,</b> and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the <b>Pentagon,</b> even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E
50|$|Both borders enclose a {{continuous}} {{region of the}} plane whose points map to unique equilateral <b>pentagons.</b> Points outside the region just map to repeated pentagons—that is, <b>pentagons</b> that when rotated or reflected can match others already described. <b>Pentagons</b> that map exactly onto those borders have a line of symmetry.|$|R
50|$|A dodecahedron can be {{considered}} a regular tiling of 12 <b>pentagons</b> on the surface of a sphere, with Schläfli symbol {5,3}, having three <b>pentagons</b> around each vertex.|$|R
50|$|There are 15 {{classes of}} <b>pentagons</b> that can monohedrally tile the plane. None of the <b>pentagons</b> have any {{symmetry}} in general, although some have special cases with mirror symmetry.|$|R
5|$|By October 2, 2001, {{the search}} for {{evidence}} and remains was complete and the site {{was turned over to}} <b>Pentagon</b> officials. In 2002, the remains of 25 victims were buried collectively at Arlington National Cemetery, with a five-sided granite marker inscribed with the names of all the victims in the <b>Pentagon.</b> The ceremony also honored the five victims whose remains were never found.|$|E

5|$|Early {{estimates}} on {{rebuilding the}} damaged {{section of the}} <b>Pentagon</b> were {{that it would take}} three years to complete. However, the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the one-year anniversary of the attack. The rebuilt section of the <b>Pentagon</b> includes a small indoor memorial and chapel at the point of impact. An outdoor memorial, commissioned by the <b>Pentagon</b> and designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman, was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11, 2008. Since September 11, American Airlines continues to fly from Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. As of August 2016, flight number 77 has been renumbered to 2636, now using a Boeing 737-800, departing at 7:40 in the morning.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to divide an equilateral triangle into three congruent non-convex <b>pentagons,</b> meeting {{at the center of}} the triangle, and to tile the plane with the resulting three-pentagon unit.A similar method can be used to subdivide squares into four congruent non-convex <b>pentagons,</b> or regular hexagons into six congruent non-convex <b>pentagons,</b> and then tile the plane with the resulting unit.|$|R
