40|$|The use of {{microphone}} phased arrays {{to acquire}} acoustic data of scaled models in standard wind tunnels {{has become a}} standard measurement technique. As shown by several authors, results obtained in a standard wind tunnel show differences when compared with results obtained from real flight tests: the differences {{can be attributed to}} lack of model-fidelity, installation effects, a discrepancy in Reynolds number, and the assumptions made in phased array processing. This work will address the effect of the Reynolds number in such measurements. Aerodynamic measurements are often performed in cryogenic and/or pressurized wind tunnels which are capable of higher (viz. real-flight) Reynolds number flows - conventional wind tunnels cannot generally achieve real-flight Reynolds numbers. Aeroacoustic measurements, however, have so far not been performed at real-flight Reynolds numbers on a small-scale aircraft model (i. e. under combined cryogenic and <b>pressurized</b> <b>conditions).</b> This study consists of data acquired with a microphone array in the European Transonic Windtunnel (ETW).

Data on performance time, range of motion, dexterity, strength, fatigue, and comfort were collected.

The results indicated that performance time wearing pressurized gloves is not adequately estimated by performance wearing unpressurized gloves.

A nanoparticle-stabilized air-water foam was fabricated by vigorously stirring the nano-fluid in <b>pressurized</b> <b>condition.</b> The foam bubble size distribution was analyzed with a microscope. The viscosities of foams generated with the solutions with several nanoparticle concentrations were measured as a function of time.

This concept shines light {{on the possibility of}} achieving adaptive energy absorption. To investigate the effect of internal pressure on energy absorption of thin-walled structures, this paper presents a study of axial crushing of pressurized thin-walled circular tubes. In the experiments, three groups of circular tubes with radius/thickness ratio R/t = 120 - 200 were axially compressed under different <b>pressurizing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The results show that with an increase of internal pressure, the deformation mode switches from diamond mode with sharp corners to that with round corners, and eventually to ring mode. in diamond mode, the mean force of the tubes increases linearly with internal pressure. The enhancement comes from two mechanisms: direct effect of pressure and indirect effect due to interaction between pressure and tube wall. After the deformation switches to ring mode, the enhancement resulting from the second mechanism becomes weaker. Based on experimental observations, the deformation mode, energy dissipation mechanisms as well as interaction between internal pressure and tube wall are analyzed theoretically and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones.

Since the major loss in the pipe is friction, {{it is possible to}} neglect energy losses while designing sewer systems with free surface flow, but under the <b>pressurized</b> <b>condition,</b> the energy losses may exceed the friction losses and reduce system capacity significantly, thus it is needed to consider the energy losses. Basically one-dimensional model is used to simulate sewerage system involving manholes and junctions with pipe configuration for calculating time and capacity efficiency although the head losses caused by manhole and pipe configuration are not one-dimensional (1 D) phenomena. It causes problems that non 1 D phenomena are artificially treated as one-dimensional. Therefore it is necessary to develop the model which can reflect the head losses depending on the pipe configuration and manhole shapes. In order to develop the simulation model, the fundamental laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate the effects of head loss depending on different manhole shapes with no benching and no invert. First, straight case experiments were conducted to evaluate the head loss for circular and square type manhole shape under the unsteady-state as well as steady-state condition and then numerical simulation model was developed and validated to confirm an applicability of the model using head loss coefficients obtained from laboratory experiments...|$|R
