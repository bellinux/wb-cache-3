Aralia spinosa is occasionally cultivated for its exotic, tropical appearance, having large lacy compound leaves.

The sturdy, ash gray to brown stems have dense, stout prickles, and diameters to 15 em are not uncommon (U. S. Department of Agriculture [no date]). Young sterns are mostly unbranched with leaves clustered near the top, producing a flat-topped, widely spreading crown. Stems tend to remain unbranched until the first tenninal inflorescences are produced (Sullivan 1992). Twigs are similar in color and armament to the sterns and have a large pith (Synor and Cowen [no date]). Leaf scars are distinctive. lined with spines, and can extend half way around the twigs. Leaves are alternate, bi- or tri-pi. nnately compound, and 0. 9 to 1. 8 m in length. The rachis is prickly and swollen at nodes (Bailey and Bailey 1976). The rachis and rachilla may be the functional equivalent of branches in this species (Briand and others devil's walking stick 1998). The dark green. glaucous leaflets are sessile, 5. 1 to 10. 2 ems long and 3. 0 to 4. 1 em wide, mostly paired, ovate, serrate, with pointed apex and rounded base (Dirr 2002,:Johnson and Hoagland 1999, K. riissmann 1986). There are prickles on the veins and lower surfaces; {{they appear to be}} outgrowths of epidermal and parenchyma cells (Briand and Soros 2002). The wood is lightweight, brown but streaked with yellow (Synor and Cowen [no date]). It may be that the pithy nature of the trunk of Devil's walking stick allows for rapid growth but ultimately restricts crown architecture and maximum size attainable (Briand and others 1 999). The species is deciduous and spreads b) underground runners. Range. -Devil's walking stick is found m th...|$|E
