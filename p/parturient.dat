6000|$|But Puritanism {{was already}} in the decline when such things were possible. What had been a wondrous and {{intimate}} experience of the soul, a flash into the very crypt and basis of man's nature from the fire of trial, had become ritual and tradition. In prosperous times the faith of one generation becomes the formality of the next. [...] "The necessity of a reformation," [...] set forth by order of the Synod which met at Cambridge in 1679, though no doubt overstating the case, shows how much even at that time the ancient strictness had been loosened. The country had grown rich, its commerce was large, and wealth did its natural work in making life softer and more worldly, commerce in deprovincializing the minds of those engaged in it. But Puritanism had already done its duty. As there are certain creatures whose whole being seems occupied with an egg-laying errand they are sent upon, incarnate ovipositors, their bodies but bags to hold this precious deposit, their legs of use only to carry them where they may safeliest be rid of it, so sometimes a generation seems to have no other end than the conception and ripening of certain germs. Its blind stirrings, its apparently aimless seeking hither and thither, are but the driving of an instinct to be done with its <b>parturient</b> function toward these principles of future life and power. Puritanism, believing itself quick with the seed of religious liberty, laid, without knowing it, the egg of democracy. The English Puritans pulled down church and state to rebuild Zion on the ruins, and all the while it was not Zion, but America, they were building. But if their millennium went by, like the rest, and left men still human; if they, like so many saints and martyrs before them, listened in vain for the sound of that trumpet which was to summon all souls to a resurrection from the body of this death which men call life,--it is not for us, at least, to forget the heavy debt we owe them. It was the drums of Naseby and Dunbar that gathered the minute-men on Lexington Common; it was the red dint of the axe on Charles's block that marked One in our era. The Puritans had their faults. They were narrow, ungenial; they could not understand the text, [...] "I have piped to you and ye have not danced," [...] nor conceive that saving one's soul should be the cheerfullest, and not the dreariest, of businesses. Their preachers had a way, like the painful Mr. Perkins, of pronouncing the word damn with such an emphasis as left a doleful echo in their auditors' ears a good while after. And it was natural that men who captained or accompanied the exodus from existing forms and associations into the doubtful wilderness that led to the promised land, should find more to their purpose in the Old Testament than in the New. As respects the New England settlers, however visionary some of their religious tenets may have been, their political ideas savored of the realty, and it was no Nephelococcygia of which they drew the plan, but of a commonwealth whose foundation was to rest on solid and familiar earth. If what they did was done in a corner, the results of it were to be felt {{to the ends of the}} earth; and the figure of Winthrop should be as venerable in history as that of Romulus is barbarously grand in legend.|$|E

Objectives: This study assessed the Igbo Women′s perception of labor pain and evaluated factors influencing their perception of labor pain as well as ascertained the level of utilization of obstetric analgesia by <b>parturients.</b> Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that spanned 6 months (January 1, to June 30, 2011) and involved <b>parturients</b> of Igbo extraction who delivered by vaginal route in 3 different referral hospitals. They were interviewed with self-administered questionnaires within the first 24 - 48 hours postpartum. Labor pains were rated using a 3 -pont verbal rating scale (VRS).

40|$|Background and Aim: Recent {{developments}} {{in the field of}} intrathecal adjuvants have led to accelerated functional recovery with adequate postoperative analgesia following caesarean section. Encouraging results have been obtained with the use of intrathecal magnesium with or without fentanyl in <b>parturients.</b> This study was conceived to evaluate the effects of adding magnesium sulphate and/or fentanyl to low-dose intrathecal bupivacaine in <b>parturients</b> undergoing caesarean section under subarachnoid block (SAB). Materials and Methods: Ninety, American Society of Anesthesiologists I or II, <b>parturients</b> for the elective caesarean section were enrolled in this prospective randomized, double-blind study. The <b>parturients</b> were randomly assigned to three groups. In Group M, <b>parturients</b> received 8. 5 mg (1. 7 mL) hyperbaric bupivacaine 0. 5 % with 50 mg (0. 1 mL) magnesium sulphate and 0. 4 mL normal saline. Group F received 8. 5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine 0. 5 % with 20 μg (0. 4 mL) fentanyl and 0. 1 mL of normal saline and Group MF <b>parturients</b> received 8. 5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine 0. 5 % with 20 μg fentanyl added to 50 mg magnesium sulphate. Results: <b>Parturients</b> in the group MF were pain free for longest period (273. 70 ± 49. 30 min) as compared to group M (252. 67 ± 40. 76 min) and group F (239. 80 ± 38. 45 mins) [gp MF vs F and, gp M vs F (P = 0. 00) ]. The total doses of rescue analgesics were least in group MF (2. 43 ± 0. 56) and maximum in group F (3. 30 ± 0. 63), with comparable neonatal outcomes in three groups. Conclusion: Our data supports synergistic action of intrathecal magnesium sulphate to fentanyl, and it is concluded that on addition of intrathecal magnesium sulphate and fentanyl to low-dose bupivacaine as adjuvant in subarachnoid block, results in prolonged duration of postoperative analgesia with lesser pain scores and lesser dose of rescue analgesia with better haemodynamic stability...|$|R

40|$|Background: Thrombocytopenia {{has been}} {{considered}} a relative or even absolute contraindication to neuraxial techniques due {{to the risk of}} epidural hematoma. There is limited literature to estimate the risk of epidural hematoma in thrombocytopenic <b>parturients.</b> The authors reviewed a large perioperative database and performed a systematic review to further define the risk of epidural hematoma requiring surgical decompression in this population. Methods: The authors performed a retrospective cohort study using the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group database to identify thrombocytopenic <b>parturients</b> who received a neuraxial technique and to estimate the risk of epidural hematoma. Patients were stratified by platelet count, and those requiring surgical decompression were identified. A systematic review was performed, and risk estimates were combined with those from the existing literature. Results: A total of 573 <b>parturients</b> with a platelet count less than 100, 000 mm(- 3) who received a neuraxial technique across 14 institutions were identified in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group database, and a total of 1, 524 <b>parturients</b> were identified after combining the data from the systematic review. No cases of epidural hematoma requiring surgical decompression were observed. The upper bound of the 95 % CI for the risk of epidural hematoma for a platelet count of 0 to 49, 000 mm(- 3) is 11 %, for 50, 000 to 69, 000 mm(- 3) is 3 %, and for 70, 000 to 100, 000 mm(- 3) is 0. 2 %.
