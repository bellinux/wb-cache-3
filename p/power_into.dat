5|$|The {{process by}} which an {{organisation}} achieves sufficient prominence that {{it is able to}} exercise naked power can be described as the rule of three phases (Russell 1938:63). According to this rule, what begins as fanaticism {{on the part of some}} crowd eventually produces conquest by means of naked power. Eventually, the acquiescence of the outlying population transforms naked <b>power</b> <b>into</b> traditional power. Finally, once a traditional power has taken hold, it engages in the suppression of dissent by the use of naked power.|$|E

Like the Great Lakes tribes, these people had a long history of close trading and other relations with the French. Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict.

5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind <b>power</b> <b>into</b> a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
5|$|Frances is {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to impact the entire archipelago since 1866. On September 4, teams from the Ministry of Works, the Department of Environmental Health Services, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Royal Bahamas Police Force were used to clear roadways of tree debris while utilities attempted to restore power and water in New Providence. The Family Islands were surveyed on September 5 and 6, when {{it was noted that}} major damage occurred within the island group. Telecommunications were restored to most of the island chain within 24 hours. As of September 21, electricity had been restored to half of the Bahamians who had lost power. Western sections of Grand Bahama Island remained without <b>power</b> <b>into</b> Hurricane Jeanne, which was the most significantly impacted island. The onion crop was expected to be late in 2005 due to the loss of seedbeds and seedlings during the storm.|$|E

5|$|Since Echmarcach's {{extensive}} imperium {{appears to}} have spanned the Irish Sea region, {{it is possible that}} he was regarded as a threat by Siward, Earl of Northumbria (died 1055). There is reason to suspect that, by the mid eleventh century, this Anglo-Danish magnate extended his authority into what had previously been the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Echmarcach's apparent descent from the Uí Ímaira dynasty that once reigned over York as kingscombined with Echmarcach's accumulation of power after Knútr's demise, could well have been a cause of concern to the York-based earl. Such unease could partly account for Siward's extension of <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the Solway region, a sphere of insecure territory which may have been regarded as vulnerable by Echmarcach.|$|E
5|$|The Era of Martyrs (Latin: anno martyrum or AM), {{also known}} as the Diocletian era (Latin: anno Diocletiani), is a method of {{numbering}} years used by the Church of Alexandria beginning in the 4th century anno Domini and by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the epoch, making Diocletian's first year in <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; Dionysius Exiguus replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his anno Domini era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.|$|E
5|$|The Oconee valley {{area was}} {{populated}} {{for thousands of}} years, and the core chiefdoms of Ocute emerged following {{the rise of the}} Mississippian culture around 1100. Ocute was invaded by the expedition of the Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1539. At that time, Ocute was locked in a longstanding war with the rival paramount chiefdom of Cofitachequi in present-day South Carolina. The chiefdom remained a significant regional <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the 17th century, although Altamaha eclipsed Ocute as the primary center, leading the Spanish to refer to the paramountcy as La Tama. In the 1660s the chiefdom fragmented due to slave raids by the English-allied Westo, though several of its towns relocated to Spanish Florida and formed part of the Yamasee confederacy.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots come from an appreciation for democracy and literacy that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they {{had to be able to}} read the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the hands of provincial governors, the use of military power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|When Sulla {{returned}} in 82BC, {{he was made}} dictator {{for the purpose of}} bringing order to the Republic's politics. Sulla attempted to concentrate political <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the Senate and the aristocratic assemblies, whilst trying to reduce the obstructive and legislative powers of the tribune and Plebeian council. However, his changes were not to last. With significant popular unrest, the tribunate's powers were quickly restored by 70BC. Sulla passed legislation to make it illegal to march on Rome as he had, but having just shown that doing so would bring no personal harm so long as one was victorious, this had little effect.|$|E

5|$|While the Trans-Siberian {{has always}} {{been used by the}} Czarist, Soviet and modern Russian {{government}} to project political <b>power</b> <b>into</b> their territories in Asia, in the 1960s it was opened by the USSR as an international trade route connecting the Western Pacific with Europe. Freight shipments on the Trans-Siberian, however, experienced increasing problems over time with dilapidated rail infrastructures, theft, damaged freight, late trains, inflated freight fees, uncertain scheduling for return of containers and geopolitical tension. As a result, use of the railway for international trade declined to almost zero by the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Archelaus I {{maintained}} {{good relations}} with Athens throughout his reign, relying on Athens to provide naval support in his 410 BC siege of Pydna, and in exchange providing Athens with timber and naval equipment. With improvements to military organization and building of new infrastructure such as fortresses, Archelaus was able to strengthen Macedonia and project his <b>power</b> <b>into</b> Thessaly, where he aided his allies; yet he faced some internal revolt as well as problems fending off Illyrian incursions led by Sirras. Although he retained Aigai as a ceremonial and religious center, Archelaus I moved {{the capital of the}} kingdom north to Pella, which was then positioned by a lake with a river connecting it to the Aegean Sea. He improved Macedonia's currency by minting coins with a higher silver content as well as issuing separate copper coinage. His royal court attracted the presence of well-known intellectuals such as the Athenian playwright Euripides.|$|E
5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E

5|$|Between the Humber and Forth the English {{had formed}} into two main kingdoms, Deira and Bernicia, often united as the Kingdom of Northumbria. A number of Celtic kingdoms also existed in this region, {{including}} Craven, Elmet, Rheged, and Gododdin. A native British kingdom, later called the Kingdom of Strathclyde, survived {{as an independent}} <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the 10th century in the area which became modern-day Dunbartonshire and Clydesdale. To the north-west of Strathclyde lay the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata, and to the north-east {{a small number of}} Pictish kingdoms. Further north still lay the great Pictish kingdom of Fortriu, which after the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 came to be the strongest power in the northern half of Britain. The Irish had always had contacts {{with the rest of the}} British Isles, and during the early 6th century they immigrated from the island of Ireland to form the kingdom of Dál Riata, although exactly how much conquest took place is a matter of dispute with historians. It also appears likely that the Irish settled in parts of Wales, and even after the period of Irish settlement, Irish missionaries were active in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twelfth century, the Earldom of Orkney, {{although}} weakened {{since the time}} of Earl Thorfinn, remained in control of Caithness and was dominant in Sutherland and parts of the Outer Hebrides. Thus the succession of the earldom was of great interest to the Scots king David I. The marriage of Matad and Margaret is believed to have taken place not long before 1134, shortly following David's suppression of a major revolt involving Mormaer Óengus of Moray, grandson of king Lulach, and Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair, the illegitimate son of David's brother Alexander, and the subsequent extension of royal <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the provinces of Moray and Ross. David's nephew William fitz Duncan was appointed to rule Moray, and it has been proposed that Matad, whose power lay in the Scottish kingdom's heartland of Atholl, may also have been granted authority in the new lands north of the Mounth, and that his marriage to Margarat Haakonsdaughter was arranged with this in mind.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Rebirth {{is set in}} a {{world where}} humans (called Huma) and beast people (Gajuma) coexist in {{relative}} peace. The world's magical power is called Force, which manifests in various people as control over an element or aspect of the physical laws. In ancient times, after a war sparked when Huma attempted to enslave Gajuma, both races joined forces to found the kingdom of Karegia. An unspecified time before the events of the game, Geyorkias, the ruler of a spirit race called the Sacred Beasts, sought to destroy the Huma as their dark emotions were fueling a primordial destructive force known as Yuris: the other Sacred Beasts put a stop to Geyorkias' plan by sealing him away, then acting to nullify Yuris' threat. The story opens with the death of Karegia's king, Ladras Lindblum, poisoned by the royal adviser Zilva Madigan: during his final moments, he releases his <b>power</b> <b>into</b> the world, causing many humans to become possessed by Force, including Veigue, Annie and Tytree. As the king has failed to name a successor, Karegia enters an interregnum at his death.|$|E
