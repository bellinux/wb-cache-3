5|$|One might {{believe that}} sodium or <b>potassium</b> <b>hydride</b> {{would be the}} ideal base for {{deprotonating}} these precursor salts. The hydride should react irreversibly {{with the loss of}} hydrogen to give the desired carbene, with the inorganic by-products and excess hydride being removed by filtration. In practice this reaction is often too slow, requiring the addition of DMSO or t-BuOH. These reagents generate soluble catalysts, which increase the rate of reaction of this heterogeneous system, via the generation of tert-butoxide or dimsyl anion. However, these catalysts have proved ineffective for the preparation of non-imidazolium adducts as they tend to act as nucleophiles towards the precursor salts and in so doing are destroyed. The presence of hydroxide ions as an impurity in the metal hydride could also destroy non-aromatic salts.|$|E

500|$|Stable carbenes {{are very}} reactive, {{and so the}} minimum amount of {{handling}} is desirable using air-free techniques. However, provided rigorously dry, relatively non-acidic and air-free materials are used, stable carbenes are reasonably robust to handling per se. By way of example, a stable carbene prepared from <b>potassium</b> <b>hydride</b> can be filtered through a dry celite pad to remove excess KH (and resulting salts) from the reaction. On a relatively small scale, a suspension containing a stable carbene in solution can be allowed to settle and the supernatant solution pushed through a dried membrane syringe filter. Stable carbenes are readily soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane, and so typically recrystallisation of stable carbenes can be difficult, due to the unavailability of suitable non-acidic polar solvents. Air-free sublimation as shown right {{can be an effective}} method of purification, although temperatures below 60°C under high vacuum are preferable as these carbenes are relatively volatile and also could begin to decompose at these higher temperatures. Indeed, sublimation in some cases can give single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. However, strong complexation to metal ions like lithium will in most cases prevent sublimation.|$|E

When used alone at ambient temperature in toluene, these salts exhibit no (K[H]) to low (K[A]) to modest (K[E]) polymerization activity.

The K[H]/ 2 Al(C 6 F 5) (3) system also exhibits high activity for polymerization of (M) MBL. In sharp contrast, addition of Al(C 6 F 5) (3) to K[A] shuts down the polymerization at various temperatures. The most active, controlled, and syndioselective polymerization system in this series is K[E]/ 2 Al(C 6 F 5) (3).

Starting from benzenesulfonyl chloride and propargyl bromide the key step of the synthesis is the addition of benzene sulfonyl iodide to phenylsulfonylpropyne. This is demonstrated to occur under thermal conditions {{in the presence of}} a radical initiator to obtain (E) - 2 -iodo- 1, 3 -bis(phenylsulfonyl) prop-I-ene. Triethylamine induced dehydroiodination of the above addition product afforded high quality 1, 3 bis(phenylsulfonyl) propadiene after an aqueous reverse quench procedure without further purification. I, 3 -Bis(phenylsulfonyl) propadiene was sho'TI to be stable under refluxing conditions towards diethyl ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and benzene. Reaction with methanol occurred to yield (E) - 2 -methoxy- 1, 3 -bis(phenylsulfonyl) prop-I-ene and with tetrahydrofuran to yield 2 -(2 -tetrahydrofuranyl) -(E) - 1, 3 -bis(phenylsulfonyl) propene, in a novel insertion reaction. The homocyclisation of 1, 3 -bis(phenylsulfonyl) propadiene under thermal conditions was demonstrated to yield the highly substituted 2, 7 bis(phenylsulfonylmethylene) - 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetraphenylsulfonyI-spiro[3. 3. 0]heptane. Reaction with cyclopentadiene, furan, butadiene and Danishefsky's diene has been conducted in a regio- and peri-selectivity study to yield the [4 + 2] cycloadducts.
