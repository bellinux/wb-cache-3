50|$|Traditionally, dynamic {{payables}} discounting, {{the early}} payment of trade <b>payables</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of the invoice due date, {{has been only}} related to invoices that are already approved. Given these discounted payments are paid post-goods receipt and approval, they don't carry any transaction risk which is common in cross border trade. Given the complexities of modern financing and payment techniques, invoicement including invoice automation and discount management initiatives need a framework to ensure that programs are approached on a strategic basis which bridges the supply chain, purchasing, accounts payable and finance organizations. Examples of solution providers are Misys TI Plus, TradeCard, Demica and Manhattan Associates.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the {{frequency}} of demanding rates under the Rating Ordinance, Government rent is <b>payable</b> quarterly <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> to the Commissioner {{in the first month}} of each quarter.

Therefore, like others in a difficulty, he determined to seek the assistance of an expert, namely, Black Meg, who, among her other occupations, for a certain fee <b>payable</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> was ready to give advice as a specialist in affairs of the heart.|$|E

I think we can get you through in three months if you will work; it all depends on that. You will find a lot of young men here of whom quite seventy per cent. do nothing, except see life. Very nice fellows in their way, {{but if you want to}} get into Sandhurst, keep clear of them. Now, my term opens next Monday.

50|$|During the 1880s, cattle prices {{remained}} {{high and}} the members of the Comanche Pool continued building their herd. In 1882 a lease was negotiated for over 3,000,000 acresof land for ten years at an annual rent of two cents an acre, <b>payable</b> semi-annually <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> By the fall of 1885, the Pool cattle numbered nearly 84,000 head. But by then, reacting to allegations of bribery and fraud, President Cleveland voided the leases that were never approved by the federal government, and ordered all cattle removed from the reservation within forty days. 210,000 head of cattle were moved to the already overstocked ranges of the adjoining states.|$|R

5000|$|In March 1883, Kansas cattlemen {{incorporated}} {{under the}} laws of Kansas to form the Cherokee Strip Live Stock Association. They negotiated a five-year lease for the entire outlet for $100,000 per year, <b>payable</b> semi-annually <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> At {{the end of the}} five years, the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council put the lease up for bid, hoping to get a better price. The Cherokee Strip Live Stock Association eventually got the bid for $200,000 per year, but the lease was nullified by Congress, which then authorized purchasing the land for $1.25 per acre. Having previously rejected a bid from the cattlemen to buy the land for $3.00 per acre, the Cherokee protested in vain that the government price was too low. President Benjamin Harrison forbade all grazing in the Cherokee Outlet after October 2, 1890, which eliminated all profit from leasing the land. After that, the Cherokee sold off the land at prices ranging from $1.40 to $2.50 per acre. [...] The Cherokee Strip Live Stock Association would disband in 1893, the same year the Outlet was opened to non-Indian settlement.|$|R
50|$|A time {{charter-party}} is {{a contract}} between the shipowner and charterers, {{by which the}} shipowner agrees to let and the charterers to hire the vessel for a specified term for employment—either generally in any lawful trade or on voyages within certain limits. The time charter-party usually names {{a place where the}} vessel must be re-delivered to the owners {{at the end of the}} term, and the freight is payable until then. The owner almost always pays the wages of the master and crew, and the charterers provide coals and pay port charges. The freight is usually fixed at a certain rate per gross register ton per month, and made <b>payable</b> monthly <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> Provision is made for suspension of hire in certain cases if the vessel is disabled. The master, though usually employed by the owner, must follow the orders of the charterers concerning use of the vessel. The charterers agree to indemnify the owners from all liability they may be exposed to by the master signing bills of lading or otherwise complying with the charterers' orders. The contract is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading and voyage charter-parties. This is the general outline of the ordinary form of a time charter-party, but forms and clauses can vary considerably.|$|R

50|$|In {{the latter}} part of 1854, the Star was sold to J. S. Waite & Co. The site donated to Foster by the council in 1850, on which to {{establish}} a printing house for the advancement of public enlightenment, seems not to {{have been a part of}} the Star outfit. A prospectus on the Spanish page informs us that “Imprenta de la Estrella, Calle Principal, Casa de Temple”—that is, the printing ofiice of the Star is on Main street, in the House of Temple, where was added, the finest typographical work will be done in Spanish, French and English. Waite reduced the subscription price of the Star to $6 a year, <b>payable</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> or $9 at the end of the year. Fifty per cent advance on a deferred payment looks like a high rate of interest, but it was very reasonable in those days.
