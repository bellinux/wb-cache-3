5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} horizon and set on the western horizon. North latitude is fairly easy to determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called <b>Polaris</b> (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the horizon indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, <b>Polaris</b> appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is <b>Polaris</b> directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, <b>Polaris</b> appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 degrees north latitude, <b>Polaris</b> is 45 degrees above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, <b>Polaris</b> will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E

5|$|On July 10, 2007, Neon Bible {{was named}} to the {{shortlist}} for the 2007 <b>Polaris</b> Music Prize. Patrick Watson was announced as the winner at a gala ceremony on September 24, 2007. However, due to the band's preference not to participate in compilation albums, they were the only nominee not to have a track on the <b>Polaris</b> promotional compilation 2007 <b>Polaris</b> Music Prize. Some media initially reported that the <b>Polaris</b> committee had snubbed the band by excluding them, leading the band and the committee to issue a joint press release confirming that the band chose not to have a track included on the album.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, {{the album}} was named as a longlisted nominee (one of 40) for the 2011 <b>Polaris</b> Music Prize. On July 6, {{the album was}} named as a shortlisted (one of 10) nominee for the 2011 award. On September 20, 2011, they were awarded the <b>Polaris</b> Prize.|$|E

5|$|He {{has also}} collaborated with Pierre Christin {{on a number}} of non-Valérian projects. The first of these was Lady <b>Polaris</b> in 1987, an {{illustrated}} novel about the mysterious disappearance of a cargo vessel, the Lady <b>Polaris.</b> The narrative comprises various documents related to the lost ship: comic strips, log books, even an investigative journalism account by a fictionalised Mézières and Christin. The action takes place against the backdrop of many of the great seaports of Europe. Mézières undertook considerable research in putting together this book, visiting the ports of Liverpool, Copenhagen, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Lübeck, Bordeaux, Bilbao and Genoa.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light was shortlisted for the <b>Polaris</b> Music Prize, {{which was}} Stetson's second {{nomination}} for the award after Vol. 2: Judges in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Marking the Little Bear's tail, <b>Polaris,</b> or Alpha Ursae Minoris, is the {{brightest}} star in the constellation, varying between apparent magnitude 1.97 and 2.00 over a period of 3.97days. Located around 432light-years away from Earth, it is a yellow-white supergiant that varies between spectral types F7Ib and F8Ib, and has around 6times the Sun's mass, 2,500times its luminosity and 45times its radius. <b>Polaris</b> is {{the brightest}} Cepheid variable star visible from Earth. It is a triple star system, the supergiant primary star having two yellow-white main-sequence star companions that are 17 and 2,400astronomical units (AU) distant and take 29.6 and 42,000years respectively to complete one orbit.|$|E
5|$|On Aug 18, 1871, {{the ship}} reached Upernavik on Greenland's west coast, where {{they picked up}} the Inuit hunter and {{interpreter}} Hans Hendrik. The <b>Polaris</b> proceeded north through Smith Sound and Nares Strait, passing previous furthest north records (by ship) held by Elisha Kane and Isaac Hayes.|$|E
5|$|The British {{information}} gathering vessel St Georges, {{which holds}} the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), the system {{used by the}} Ministry of Defence to communicate with and co-ordinate the Royal Navy's fleet of <b>Polaris</b> submarines, is sunk after accidentally trawling an old naval mine in the Ionian Sea. MI6 agent James Bond is ordered by the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray and MI6 Chief of Staff, Bill Tanner, to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets, as the transmitter could order attacks by the submarines' <b>Polaris</b> ballistic missiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} some glyphs are {{modified}} with the “guiding star” dependent glyph, while others are not, supports the idea that rongorongo was used for calendrical purposes in addition to astronomy and navigation. This is further evidenced by a tentative reading {{which is consistent with}} known astronomy. In the month of March, Rigel, Arcturus, and Sirius can be seen together, and the Milky Way appears in the north to the right of Arcturus. If one were sailing north, they would first see Arcturus on the horizon, and then <b>Polaris.</b> The arrangement of glyphs in this example, and the presence of 'guide modifiers' on Arcturus and <b>Polaris,</b> are consistent with these facts.|$|E
5|$|This {{rescue mission}} {{was the first}} {{official}} United States military expedition to the Arctic; previous expeditions, including that of the <b>Polaris</b> itself, had been led by civilians. The Tigress sailed from New York on July14, 1873, traveling first to St. John's, Newfoundland and then to Godhavn and Upernavik in Greenland before following the coast further north. The crew searched North Star Bay, Northumberland Island, and Hartstene Bay before discovering {{the first sign of}} the <b>Polaris</b> crew: a camp on Littleton Island where they had wintered, now occupied by Inuit. The missing men, the rescuers were told, had constructed makeshift boats salvaged from their destroyed ship and traveled south. Acting on this clue, the Tigress searched the Baffin Island coast to Cumberland Sound, and then the Greenland coast from Ivigtut to Fiskenæsset and the Davis Strait, before returning to St. John's for fuel. Once there, they learned that the <b>Polaris</b> survivors had been rescued by a British ship and that their search was over. After returning to New York the Tigress was transferred back to civilian use.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conversion}} {{project in}} early 1956 {{called for the}} installation of two <b>Polaris</b> nuclear ballistic missile launchers with a capacity for sixteen weapons. Also proposed were four RIM-8 Talos SAM launchers with eighty missiles per launcher and twelve RIM-24 Tartar SAM launchers with 504 missiles. A July 1956 estimate projected completing the ship by July 1961, {{but the cost of}} the conversion ultimately forced the Navy to abandon the project.|$|E
5|$|At the 2014 Juno Awards, Reflektor won Album of the Year and Alternative Album of the Year. The {{album was}} also a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 <b>Polaris</b> Music Prize.

5|$|Capella {{is closer}} to the north {{celestial}} pole than any other first magnitude star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are {{on opposite sides of the}} pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through <b>Polaris.</b> Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and <b>Polaris,</b> Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter sky in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} {{matching}} vocabulary and astronomical content {{is drawn from}} throughout Polynesia, far afield from Easter Island, this supports the argument that rongorongo was not a recent, localized development; rather it {{was a product of}} thriving Polynesian trade and cultural interaction throughout the Pacific. There is additional evidence in favor of this theory, such as the identification of <b>Polaris</b> among the glyphs, which is only visible from the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, William Edward Parry led a British Royal Navy {{expedition}} {{with the}} aim {{to be the first}} men to reach the North Pole. In the 50 years following Parry's attempt, the Americans would mount three such expeditions: Elisha Kent Kane in 1853–55, Isaac Israel Hayes in 1860–61, and Charles Francis Hall with the <b>Polaris</b> in 1871–73.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 he {{attended}} the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. In the course of discussing a small nuclear warhead for the Mark 45 torpedo, he started a discussion {{on the possibility of}} developing a physically small one-megaton nuclear warhead for the <b>Polaris</b> missile. His counterpart in the discussion, J. Carson Mark from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted it could not be done. However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton warhead of small enough size could be developed. This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, who was present in person, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to <b>Polaris</b> {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of {{transition}} to war, the V Bomber squadrons were to deploy four aircraft at short notice to each of 26 pre-prepared dispersal airfields around the United Kingdom. In the early 1960s the RAF ordered 20 Beagle Basset communication aircraft to move the crews to dispersal airfields; {{the importance of these}} aircraft was only brief, diminishing when the primary nuclear deterrent switched to the Royal Navy's <b>Polaris</b> Missile.|$|E
5|$|Neon Bible was {{a finalist}} for the 2007 <b>Polaris</b> Music Prize. Neon Bible was {{nominated}} for Best Alternative Album for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. It was #4 in NME albums of the year, fourth in Rolling Stones list of albums of the year and album of the year in Q in December 2007. The album won the 2008 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 2010, Cathay Pacific Flight 780 from Surabaya Juanda International Airport to Hong Kong landed safely after both engines failed due to {{contaminated}} fuel. 57 {{passengers were}} injured.

5|$|Ursa Minor is {{bordered by}} Camelopardalis to the west, Draco to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. Ursa Minor is colloquially {{known in the}} US as the Little Dipper because its seven {{brightest}} stars seem to form {{the shape of a}} dipper (ladle or scoop). The star {{at the end of the}} dipper handle is <b>Polaris.</b> <b>Polaris</b> can also be found by following a line through the two stars—Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris—that form the end of the 'bowl' of the Big Dipper, for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, and provide an easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.|$|E
5|$|According to Graham Spinardi in {{his book}} From <b>Polaris</b> to Trident (1994), STRAT-X was a {{response}} by the U.S. Department of Defense's Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Lloyd Wilson, to the U.S. Air Force; the service was demanding a large ICBM called the WS-120A. Spinardi suggests that STRAT-X was allowed to proceed so it could terminate the study for such a missile. Funding for the WS-120A would not be released by Secretary McNamara, and plans for such a missile were canceled in 1967.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the U.S. Naval Academy in 1867, Sebree was posted {{to a number of}} vessels before being {{assigned}} to a rescue mission to find the remaining crew of the missing <b>Polaris</b> in the Navy's first mission to the Arctic. This attempt was only a partial success—the <b>Polaris</b> crew was rescued by a British ship rather than the US Navy—but this led to Sebree's selection eleven years later for a second expedition to the Arctic. That mission to rescue Adolphus Greely and the survivors of the Lady Franklin Bay expedition was a success. Sebree was subsequently appointed as the second acting governor of American Samoa. He served in this position for only a year before returning to the United States. In 1907, he was promoted to rear admiral and given command of the Pathfinder Expedition around the South American coast before being appointed commander of the 2nd Division of the Pacific Fleet and then commander-in-chief of the entire fleet. He retired in 1910 and died in Coronado, California, in 1922. Two geographical features in Alaska—Sebree Peak and Sebree Island—are named for Admiral Sebree.|$|E
5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, <b>Polaris</b> {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Fifty {{people are}} interviewed in Not My Life, {{including}} Katherine Chon of the <b>Polaris</b> Project, investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest, Vincent Tournecuillert of Terre des hommes, Iana Matei of Reaching Out Romania, UNICEF Director of Programmes Nicholas Alipui, Susan Bissell of UNICEF's Child Protection Section, Antonio Maria Costa of UNODC, Somaly Mam of the Somaly Mam Foundation, Molly Melching of Tostan in Senegal, and Suzanne Mubarak, who was First Lady of Egypt at the time. The sex trafficking victims {{shown in the}} film include {{children as young as}} five and six years old.|$|E
5|$|Following {{continued}} turmoil {{between the}} centre-right parties, {{there was even}} an independent petition in 1926 gaining some momentum that proposed for Nansen to head a centre-right national unity government on a balanced budget program, an idea he did not reject. He was the headline speaker at the single largest Fatherland League rally with 15,000 attendees in Tønsberg in 1928. In 1929 he went on his final tour for the League on the ship Stella <b>Polaris,</b> holding speeches from Bergen to Hammerfest.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the film's release, July 12, 2013, another {{viral video}} was {{released}} to promote the film. It involved the collaboration of the film studio (including del Toro himself) and the YouTube network <b>Polaris</b> (also known as The Game Station). It featured members of the YouTube network (such as the Game Grumps) as Jaeger pilots fighting Kaiju. On July 16, a novelization by Alex Irvine was released. NECA began selling action figures of the film's Kaiju and Jaegers.|$|E
5|$|Stetson, whose {{contributions}} to the album were recorded live without overdubs or loops, is the sole musical performer on the album, with Bon Iver's Justin Vernon later providing vocals on four tracks. Production on the album was undertaken by Stetson in collaboration with Ben Frost. New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light was met with critical acclaim upon its release in April 2013 and was shortlisted for the 2013 <b>Polaris</b> Music Prize three months later.|$|E
5|$|The Bold Orion missile was {{developed}} {{as part of}} Weapons System 199, initiated by the United States Air Force (USAF) {{in response to the}} U.S. Navy's <b>Polaris</b> program, with funding authorised by the United States Congress in 1957. The purpose of WS-199 was the development of technology that would be used in new strategic weapons for the USAF's Strategic Air Command, not to deliver operational weapons; a primary emphasis was on proving the feasibility of an air-launched ballistic missile.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Polaris</b> {{expedition}} (1871) {{was led by}} the American Charles Francis Hall, who {{intended it}} to be the first expedition to reach the North Pole. Sponsored by the United States government, {{it was one of the}} first serious attempts at the Pole, after that of British naval officer William Edward Parry, who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. The expedition failed at its main objective being hampered by insubordination, incompetence, and poor leadership.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado {{is capable}} of {{delivering}} air-launched nuclear weapons. In 1979, Britain considered replacing its <b>Polaris</b> submarines with either the Trident submarines or alternatively the Tornado as the main bearer of its nuclear deterrent. Although the UK proceeded with Trident, several Tornado squadrons based in Germany were assigned to SACEUR to deter a major Soviet offensive with both conventional and nuclear weapons, namely the WE.177 nuclear bomb, which was retired in 1998. German and Italian Tornados are capable of delivering US B61 nuclear bombs, which are made available through NATO.|$|E
5|$|Under Hall's command, the <b>Polaris</b> {{departed}} from New York City in June 1871. By October, {{the men were}} wintering {{on the shore of}} northern Greenland, making preparations for the trip to the Pole. Hall returned to the ship from an exploratory sledging journey, and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew of poisoning him. An exhumation of his body in 1968 revealed that he had ingested a large quantity of arsenic {{in the last two weeks}} of his life.|$|E
5|$|X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse is not set in any {{particular}} Marvel Comics universe. The game takes place some time after the events of X-Men Legends. The mutant supervillain Apocalypse, having witnessed the X-Men's defeat of Magneto remotely, declares that the Age of Apocalypse is nigh. Prior to the game's campaign he kidnaps Professor X and <b>Polaris</b> for unknown purposes. Locations include a military prison in Greenland, the fictional mutant sanctuary of Genosha, the Savage Land and Egypt.|$|E
