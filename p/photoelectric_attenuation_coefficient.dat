40|$|PURPOSE. We present spatial {{retinal nerve}} fiber layer (RNFL) <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> maps for healthy and glaucomatous eyes based on optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) measurements. Quantitative analyses of differences between healthy and glaucomatous eyes were performed. METHODS. Peripapillary volumetric images of 10 healthy and 8 glaucomatous eyes were acquired by a Spectralis OCT system. Per A-line, the <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the RNFL was determined based on a method that uses the retinal pigment epithelium as a reference layer. The <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> describes the <b>attenuation</b> of light in tissue due to scattering and absorption. En-face maps were constructed and visually inspected. Differences between healthy and glaucomatous eyes were analyzed (Mann-Whitney U test), both globally (average values) and spatially (concentric and per segment). RESULTS. RNFL <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> maps of healthy eyes showed relatively high and uniform values. For glaucomatous eyes, the <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> were much lower and showed local defects. Normal and glaucomatous average RNFL <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> were highly significantly different (P < 0. 0001) and fully separable. The RNFL <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> decreased with increasing optic nerve head distance for both groups, with highly significant differences for all distances (P < 0. 001). The angular dependency showed high superio- and inferiotemporal and low nasal values, with most significant differences superio- and inferiotemporally. CONCLUSIONS. Maps of RNFL <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> provide a novel way of assessing {{the health of the}} RNFL and are relatively insensitive to imaging artifacts affecting signal intensity. The highly significant difference between normal and glaucomatous eyes suggests using RNFL <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> maps as a new clinical tool for diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma.

In such laterally heterogeneous media, estimated values of α not only reflect <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> related to quality factors but also include the effect of scattering (e.g., reflection) due to lateral heterogeneity. To detect lateral discontinuities, Bergamo and Socco (2014) utilized lateral variation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> related to scattered surface waves. They estimated two <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> at each local point (i.e., CMP in this study) from positive- and negative-offset data (e.g., Fig.  1 c). Their results demonstrated that a distinct difference between the lateral variation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> from positive- and negative-offset data is a good indication of the locations of a sharp lateral discontinuity. To effectively characterize lateral heterogeneities, we also focus on spatial variation of local <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> related to scattering and separately estimate <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> at each CMP from positive- and negative-offset data.|$|R

Methods: Linear <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> was calculated with a new method that base on the physics of interaction of photon with matter, mathematical calculation and x-ray spectrum consideration.

Results: The values of calculated linear <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> with this new method are in acceptable range.
