While interest in inland exploration was strong in the neighbouring colonies of New South Wales and South Australia, in Victoria enthusiasm was limited. Even the anonymous donation of £1,000 (later discovered to be from Ambrose Kyte) to the Fund Raising Committee of the Royal Society failed to generate much interest and it was 1860 before sufficient money was raised and the expedition was assembled.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of steam-power, the use of iron armour was leading to another revolution in design at about the same time. Dupuy de Lôme applied his talents to this field as well, by showing the <b>practicability</b> of armouring the sides of a wooden-built ship. In 1857 he was appointed to the highest office in the Constructive Corps—Directeur du Matériel—and his design for the earliest seagoing ironclad, La Gloire, was approved in the same year. La Gloire was built fairly quickly, and was followed by a construction program that delivered a total of five such ships by 1863.|$|E

In 1769, Arnold modified Maskelyne's centre seconds watch by John Ellicott, changing the cylinder escapement from steel to one made of sapphire. He lent this watch to the Astronomer William Wales for use in assessing the <b>practicability</b> of Maskelyne's Lunar distance method for finding the ship's longitude during the voyage of the Transit of Venus expedition to the West Indies in 1769. Around this time, Arnold also seems to have started to think about making an accurate timekeeper to find the longitude.|$|E
25|$|A hybrid marker, {{also known}} as a {{referencing}} exit marker or REM, is a more recently developed line marker used as a directional marker by the diver placing it, and seen as a cookie by others. They are rectangular with slots like the arrow and cookie forms for attachment to a line, and have a relatively large blank space on one end to add identification on one side and to write on the other side. Referencing exit markers are asymmetrical so can be used to show the direction which the diver came from.

As pilot of the United States airplane, by his masterly skill, courage, endurance, and tenacity of purpose, with his navigator, Lieutenant Maitland successfully piloted his airplane on 28–29 June 1927, from Oakland, California, to Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, over the greatest expanse of open sea yet crossed in a nonstop flight. Lieutenant Maitland, with full {{knowledge of the}} dangers and difficulties, traversed over 2,400 miles of the Pacific Ocean with marvelous accuracy of direction, and thereby demonstrated conclusively the <b>practicability</b> of accurate aerial navigation.

Together with hackers from the Chaos Computer Club, Floricic successfully created a working clone {{of such a}} SIM card, thus showing the <b>practicability</b> of the attack. He also engaged in cloning the German phonecard and succeeded. While Floricic only wanted to demonstrate the insecurity of the system, the proven insecurity was also abused by criminals {{which led to the}} attention of law enforcement agencies and the German national phone operator Deutsche Telekom. After Deutsche Telekom changed the system, Floricic tried to remove a complete public card phone from a booth by force (using a sledgehammer) on 3 March 1995 in order to, as he told, adapt his phonecard simulators to the latest changes. He and a friend were, however, caught by the police upon this attempt. Floricic was later sentenced to a prison term of 15 months which was suspended to probation.|$|E

The set was customized from a house built for The Stepfather (2009), which in turn was adapted from a block of apartments for Quarantine (2008). The Charles' living room had a ceiling [...] high, and a custom-built chandelier for the climactic ending of the film. According to Gainor, the house is symbolic of the family's aspirations, and is intentionally too large for the three occupants; he said, [...] "It's a little awkward and a little bit eerie."

The <b>practicability</b> of this plan was doubted by some of his advisors, {{and in any case}} the crown was only valuable if recognized by the European nobility, most important the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1699, negotiations [...] were renewed with emperor Leopold I, who in turn was in need of allies since the War of the Spanish Succession was about to break out. On 16 November 1700, the emperor approved Frederick's coronation in the Krontraktat ("Crown tract"). With respect to Poland-Lithuania, who held the provinces of Royal Prussia and Ermland, it was agreed that Frederick would call himself King in Prussia, instead of King of Prussia. Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, for similar reasons as the emperor, accepted Frederick's elevation prior to the coronation.|$|E

In the House of Commons on 8 May 1940, the day following Lansbury's death, Chamberlain said of him: [...] "There were not many hon. Members who felt convinced of the <b>practicability</b> of the methods which he advocated for the preservation of peace, but there was no one who did not realise his intense conviction, which arose out of his deep humanitarianism".

[...] From this directive Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker requested Thomas Buckingham Smith from St. Augustine to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three canals to the Gulf of Mexico would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he [...] "never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had {{it occurred to me that}} so great an undertaking, one so utterly impracticable, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, I should not have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but by those who have waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water." ...|$|E

Rosebush's aim was to [...] "test out exhaustively the <b>practicability</b> of large-scale, capitalistic manufacturing methods in agriculture" [...] by raising pedigreed Herefords. [...] Rosebush initially purchased 9,472acres near Amasa, built five enormous barns and other buildings, and rapidly developed the ranch.

Strictly speaking, the antitheses of good and bad and of free and necessary have no place in an ethical system, but simply in history, which is obliged to compare the actual with the ideal, but as far as the terms [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad" [...] are used in morals they express the rule or the contrary of reason, or the harmony or the contrary of the particular and the general.

2500|$|Hill's pamphlet, Post Office Reform: its Importance and <b>Practicability,</b> {{referred}} to above, was privately circulated in 1837. The report called for [...] "low and uniform rates" [...] according to weight, rather than distance. Hill's study reported his findings {{and those of}} Charles Babbage {{that most of the}} costs in the postal system were not for transport, but rather for laborious handling procedures at the origins and the destinations. Costs could be reduced dramatically if postage were prepaid by the sender, the prepayment to be proven by the use of prepaid letter sheets or adhesive stamps (adhesive stamps had long been used to show payment of taxes, on documents for example). Letter sheets were to be used because envelopes were not yet common; they were not yet mass-produced, and in an era when postage was calculated partly {{on the basis of the}} number of sheets of paper used, the same sheet of paper would be folded and serve for both the message and the address. In addition, Hill proposed to lower the postage rate to a penny per half ounce, without regard to distance. He first presented his proposal to the Government in 1837.|$|E

This book is in three volumes, and appears to be about magic—specifically, about using spirits to communicate over long distances. Since the publication of the decryption key to the first two volumes in 1606, they have been known to be actually concerned with cryptography and steganography. Until recently, the third volume was widely still believed to be solely about magic, but the [...] "magical" [...] formulae have now been shown to be covertexts for yet more cryptographic content. However, mentions of the magical work within the third book by such figures as Agrippa and John Dee still lend credence {{to the idea of a}} mystic-magical foundation concerning the third volume. Additionally, while Trithemius's steganographic methods can be established to be free of the need for angelic–astrological mediation, still left intact is an underlying theological motive for their contrivance. The preface to the Polygraphia equally establishes, the everyday <b>practicability</b> of cryptography was conceived by Trithemius as a [...] "secular consequent of the ability of a soul specially empowered by God to reach, by magical means, from earth to Heaven". Robert Hooke suggested in the chapter Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits, that John Dee made use of Trithemian steganography, to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I.|$|E

He likewise portrayed the perils and the restorative capability of [...] "transference"; the emotions coordinated towards the specialist by a patient reinstituting experiences from prior persuasive connections. A considerable lot of his thoughts were too broad to be in any way amiable to trial testing and conceivable invalidation, and he was reprimanded for this by Jaspers. Different examiners who gave bits of knowledge into the advancement of mental indications included Melanie Klein ('the neurotic schizoid position') and Donald Winnicott, who worked in London (1935), predominantly with kids. Since the 1960s, however, the utilization of analysis for the treatment of extreme emotional sickness has been logically dissolved. Different types of psychotherapy have been created, chiefly for non-maniacal conditions, with firmer establishments regarding evidence of adequacy and <b>practicability.</b> These incorporate subjective treatments (after Beck), behavioral treatments (after Skinner and Wolpe) and additional time-constrained and centered structures, for example, interpersonal psychotherapy. In youth issue and in schizophrenia, the systems of family treatment hold esteem. A portion of the thoughts emerging from therapy are presently pervasive and some are a piece of the armamentarium of ordinary clinical practice. They are not just medications, they additionally help to understand complex conduct.|$|E

A bill introduced by him imposing special taxes on recusants and subjecting Roman Catholic priests to imprisonment for life was only thrown out as too lenient because it secured offenders from the charge of treason. The same year he introduced a Test Oath by which all holding office or seats in either House of Parliament were to declare resistance to the royal power a crime, and promise to abstain from all attempts to alter the government of either church or state; but this extreme measure of retrograde toryism was rejected. The king opposed and also doubted the wisdom and <b>practicability</b> of this [...] "thorough" [...] policy of repression. Danby therefore ordered a return from every diocese of the numbers of dissenters, both Catholic and Protestant, {{in order to prove}} their insignificance, in order to remove the royal scruples (this became known as the Compton Census). In December 1676 he issued a proclamation for the suppression of coffee-houses because of the [...] "defamation of His Majesty's Government" [...] which took place in them, but this was soon withdrawn. In 1677, to secure Protestantism in case of a Roman Catholic succession, he introduced a bill by which ecclesiastical patronage and the care of the royal children were entrusted to the bishops; but this measure, like the other, was thrown out.|$|E
