5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} when Tetsuya Mizuguchi asked Masahiro Sakurai {{to make a}} falling block puzzle. Believing that the genre had not evolved since Tetris Attack (1995), Sakurai {{came up with the}} idea of having the blocks fall and shooting back up. The game's prototype was created in three days by a designer, a programmer, and a graphic artist. It was inspired by the TV series 24, the film The Matrix, and the Missile Command game. According to Mizuguchi, 24 camera work and the beginning of The Matrix (with dripping, green computer code) were the basis of the puzzle-game concept. In a Famitsu interview, Sakurai said that the opening CG video explaining its backstory was added to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the game's world.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E

They often manifest as motion bases for virtual vehicle simulation such as driving simulators or flight simulators. Motion bases are fixed in place but use actuators to move the simulator in ways that can produce the sensations pitching, yawing or rolling. The simulators can also move {{in such a way}} as to produce a sense of acceleration on all axes (e.g., the motion base can produce the sensation of falling).|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology. ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals. Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.|$|E
25|$|Most of Coleridge's juvenalia was posthumously published. Those written {{while he}} {{attended}} Christ's Hospitals were imitations of conventional models of poetry {{during the late}} 18th-century. In particular, he focused on John Milton's L'Allegro, Il Penseroso, and his Lycidas, along with the poems of Collins, Gray, and Thomson. In terms of form, Coleridge relied on many abstract nouns that he would mark with capitalisation, and his nouns were constantly modified {{with a set of}} two adjectives. He did not start working with his own poetic form until 1794. Although they don't <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> where Coleridge developed his poetry later, the school-age poems do give insight into Coleridge's thoughts and feelings during those years.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} centipedes lack eyes, but some possess a {{variable}} number of ocelli, which are sometimes clustered {{together to form}} true compound eyes. However, these eyes are only capable of discerning light and dark, and have no true vision. In some species, the first pair of legs at the head end of the centipede acts as sense organs similar to antennae, but unlike the antennae of most other animals, theirs point backwards. Unusual sense organs found in some groups are the organs of Tömösváry. These are located {{at the base of}} the antennae, and consist of a disc-like structure with a central pore surrounded by sensory cells. They are probably used for sensing vibrations, and may even <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hearing.|$|E

500|$|Grant {{retired from}} the screen at 62, when his {{daughter}} Jennifer was born, to focus on bringing her up and to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> permanency and stability in her life. He had become increasingly disillusioned with cinema in the 1960s, rarely finding a script that he approved of. He remarked: [...] "I could have gone on acting and playing a grandfather or a bum, but I discovered more important things in life". Grant knew after he had made Charade that the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of Hollywood was now over. He expressed little interest in making a career comeback, and continued to respond to invites or mention of it with [...] "fat chance". He did, however, briefly appear in the video documentary for Elvis's 1970 Las Vegas concert , in the audience. When he was gifted with the negatives {{from a number of}} his films in the 1970s, Grant sold them to television for a sum of over two million dollars in 1975.|$|E
500|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene where}} Alex swims underneath {{the ship was}} filmed in the Tongue of the Ocean {{off the coast of}} New Providence in the Bahamas. The location was chosen due to its water clarity, however, after viewing dailies of the scene, De Bont felt the water was too clear, so it was reshot with divers above the camera dusting the area in front of the lens with sediment to alter the clarity of the footage. [...] The scene was filmed underneath a propeller-less barge that was designed to resemble the Seabourn Legend. To <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> velocity in the scene, the barge was towed by tugboats at one and a half knots. The production crew did not have a winch system available for the underwater shoot as depicted in the scene, so a pulley system was created by feeding Patric a rope that was attached to the axle of a car that drove along the barge.|$|E

Richardson for Glessner; [...] these <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the street's former character. [...] Glessner House, which {{was the subject of}} a notable preservation battle in the 1960s, is considered to be Richardson's finest urban residence. This district includes the Henry B. Clarke House, which although twice relocated is purported to be the city's oldest standing house. [...] In addition to the Clarke House and the Glessner House, nine other houses from the late-19th century remain in the historic district portion of Prairie Avenue. [...] Both the Glessner House and the Clarke House are on the National Historic Register and now serve as museums. [...] Most of the Prairie Avenue families worshiped at the Chicago Landmark Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
500|$|In the US military, goats are {{commonly}} used to train combat medics. (Goats have become the main animal species {{used for this purpose}} after the Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s.) While modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body, some trainees feel that [...] "the goat exercise <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> urgency that only real life trauma can provide". Nevertheless, in 2014, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that it would reduce the number of animals it uses in its training exercises by half after PETA released video showing Guard members cutting off the limbs of unconscious goats with tree trimmers and inflicting other injuries with a shotgun, pistol, ax and a scalpel. That same year, citing the availability of human simulators and other alternatives, the Department of Defense announced it would begin reducing the number of animals it uses in various training programs. In 2013, several Navy medical centers stopped using ferrets in intubation exercises after complaints from PETA.|$|E
500|$|It took Watts {{three months}} into {{his first season}} before he made his debut with the club {{choosing}} their biggest match {{of the year to}} name him for his debut, the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood. The fanfare and expectation the club placed on him for his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club about how they mismanaged his first match; five years after his debut, Paul Roos said he was appalled at how the club handled him for his debut. His first touch of the football saw him [...] "gang tackled" [...] by three Collingwood players, with some suggesting the tackle [...] "ruined him"; teammate on the day, Russell Robertson, dispelled these thoughts and said the team did not do enough to protect him, with the Collingwood captain at the time, Nick Maxwell, admitting in 2016 that the hype surrounding Watts did lead them to purposely be rougher with him than a standard player to ensure they limited his impact. Despite then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, claiming he was ready to play and keeping him in the team for three weeks, the football industry disagreed and scrutinised the club for using him as a marketing tool to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hope for fans rather than doing what was best for Watts' development.|$|E

500|$|For the climatic {{scene when}} the ship crashes into an island, De Bont wanted to create and destroy an actual town. He opted against {{miniature}} scale models or computer-generated imagery (CGI) to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> realism for the actors and the audience. A $5 million, 35-building set was constructed in Marigot, Saint Martin based on the town's local architecture, which temporarily housed production offices. Despite De Bont's reason for choosing Saint Martin for filming, a hurricane struck the town and destroyed the set during construction. It had to be rebuilt with hurricane-proof buildings. Exteriors of the bow mockup on the bridge ship {{were used in the}} first part of the scene when the Seabourn Legend is crashing into sailboats in the harbor; the bridge ship was used in place of the actual Seabourn Legend, as the latter could not navigate the harbor's shallow waters. The captain of the bridge ship had great difficulty hitting the sailboats during filming, despite cameras placed on the boats for the captain to view. [...] A second mockup was constructed for the latter part of the scene, which featured a [...] long replica of the Seabourn Legend bow. This mockup, referred to as the [...] "rail ship", weighed , and sat atop a set of wheels along a [...] track built [...] underwater.|$|E
500|$|The titular [...] "Evolve" [...] game {{mechanic}} {{was inspired}} by the [...] "bomb planting" [...] mode from the Counter-Strike series. The Monsters started out as a relatively weak creature that could be defeated easily, but becomes stronger and gains more skills as it evolves. Early playtesters complained about the game mechanic, as they thought that this would bring an unfair disadvantage to the Hunters, since they do not [...] "evolve" [...] like the Monster. However, the design team still chose to maintain the game mechanic, as they thought that it would create an engaging experience. Ashton added that such game mechanics can create a [...] "turning the tables" [...] feeling for the Hunters, and that he thought that the sudden change in strategy – from offensive to defensive – could help deliver a dynamic experience to the players. The Monster was originally intended to play from a first-person perspective but was later shifted to a third-person perspective during development because the first-person control system was considered to be clumsy and confusing, and that the first person perspective took control away from players. The design team considered designing third-person gameplay a challenge, as they had no prior experience in creating such games. On the other hand, the design team implemented the first-person gameplay for the Hunters when Evolves development started. The design team thought that the first-person perspective would <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> tension as players {{would not be able to}} see what was behind them.|$|E
500|$|The nature writers Mark Cocker and Richard Mabey, {{reviewing}} people's love of birds, {{observe that}} people are touched by feelings for birds {{in a variety of}} ways, such as enjoying the lapwing's [...] "joyous display", or the [...] "beauty and mystery" [...] of the tawny owl's call on a cold winter's night. They argue that people feel the simple companionship of birds, are inspired by them to create art, let them mark the seasons and <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place, and use them [...] "as symbols of joy and love". A former statesman, Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, was able to express his feeling for birds in his 1927 book The Charm of Birds. Such feelings, in turn, have stimulated the intention to conserve birds and their habitats. Around the same time as Grey was writing, the first conservation organisations were coming into being, starting in Britain, triggered by the rapid disappearance of familiar species as they were captured for their feathers or for food. A substantial folklore rich in symbolism has accrued around birds; it was documented early in the 20th century as something that was already fading from memory. For example, the house sparrow has been associated with [...] "sex and lechery" [...] since ancient Egypt, where libidinousness was written with the sparrow hieroglyph. In the same vein, in the classical era the sparrow was sacred to the goddess of love, Aphrodite or Venus; the sparrow features in an erotic poem by Catullus for the same reason. Chaucer describes the summoner in his Canterbury Tales as being as [...] "lecherous as a sparwe".|$|E
