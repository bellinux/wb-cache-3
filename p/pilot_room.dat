It was {{intended}} to be a reproduction of Christopher Columbus' ship Niña. Inside the restaurant, the marine theme continued. Bernstein's had seven dining rooms styled to look like ship's cabins: the Fisherman's Cave, the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Room,</b> the Sun Deck, the Main Salon, the Cabin Nooks, the Upper Deck, and the Porthole Counter. The sister restaurant in Los Angeles, was also known for its Coo-Coo Clams from Coo-Coo Cove.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Optimizing energy {{consumption}} while maintaining an appropriate level of comfort {{is one of}} the current challenges in the Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ) field. In this paper, we propose an unified fuzzy controller for managing the different aspects involved in IEQ, overcoming the potentially inefficient interactions between several traditional controllers. We also describe the implemented web simulator to test the controller, and the results of applying the controller to a <b>pilot</b> <b>room,</b> measuring the air quality over a period of a month. Even though, further research and experimentation should be done, specially with the experts in order to fine tuning the rules and the controller, initial results are promising enough and the ease of use is quite remarkable by users.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the conference <b>room</b> <b>pilot</b> is to {{validate}} a software application against the business processes of end-users of the software, by allowing end-users to use the software to carry out typical or key business processes using the new software. A commercial advantage of a conference <b>room</b> <b>pilot</b> {{is that it may}} allow the customer to prove that the new software will do the job (meets business requirements and expectations) before committing to buying the software, thus avoiding buying an inappropriate application. The term is most commonly used in the context of 'out of the box' (OOTB) or 'commercial off-the-shelf' software (COTS).|$|R

2500|$|In 1927, the Japanese Department of Communications {{launched}} a competition {{to design and}} build an indigenous passenger transport aircraft. Mitsubishi's design to meet this requirement was based on its Mitsubishi B1M torpedo bomber, using {{the wings of the}} earlier aircraft combined with a new fuselage. The MC-1 was large three-bay biplane powered by a [...] Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar radial engine and it had an open cockpit behind the wings for the <b>pilot</b> and <b>room</b> for four passengers in an enclosed cabin in the forward fuselage. The MC-1 had a fixed conventional landing gear but could also be fitted with twin floats.|$|R

50|$|Many ground {{tests were}} carried out on the Gemini 2 and Titan rocket in November 1964. On November 24, Gemini-Titan (GT) 2 {{successfully}} completed the Wet Mock Simulated Launch, a full-scale countdown exercise which included propellant loading. Procedures for flight crew suiting and spacecraft ingress and egress were practiced during simulated launch. The prime flight crew for Gemini 3 donned pressure suits and full biomedical instrumentation, assisted by their backup crew and the space suit bioinstrumentation and aeromedical personnel who would participate in the GT-3 launch operation. As {{a result of this}} practice operation, it was established that all physical examinations, bioinstrumentation sensor attachment, and suit donning would be done in the <b>pilot</b> ready <b>room</b> at Launch Complex 16.|$|R
50|$|The Blues' McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets {{are former}} fleet {{aircraft}} that are nearly combat-ready. Modifications to each aircraft include {{removal of the}} aircraft gun and replacement with the tank that contains smoke-oil used in demonstrations, and outfitting with the control stick spring system for more precise aircraft control input. The standard demonstration configuration has a spring tensioned with 40 lb of force installed on the control stick as to allow the <b>pilot</b> minimal <b>room</b> for uncommanded movement. The Blues do not wear G-suits, because the air bladders inside them would repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with the control stick between the pilot's legs. Instead, Blue Angel pilots tense their muscles to prevent blood from rushing from their heads and rendering them unconscious.|$|R
50|$|Landing craft are {{designed}} to carry troops, vehicles, or cargo from ship to shore under combat conditions, to unload, {{to withdraw from the}} beach, and to return to the ship. They are rugged, with powerful engines, and usually armed. There are many types in today's navies including hovercraft. They will typically have a power-operated bow ramp, a cargo well and after structures that house engine <b>rooms,</b> <b>pilot</b> houses, and stowage compartments. These boats are sometimes carried by larger ships.|$|R

40|$|Rich-media {{describes}} {{a broad range}} of digital interactive media that is increasingly used in the Internet and also in the support of education. Last year, a special <b>pilot</b> audiovisual lecture <b>room</b> was built {{as a part of the}} MERLINGO (MEdia-rich Repository of LearnING Objects) project solution. It contains all the elements of the modern lecture room determined for the implementation of presentation recordings based on the rich-media technologies and their publication online or on-demand featuring the access of all its elements in the automated mode including automatic editing. Property-preserving Petri net process algebras (PPPA) were designed for the specification and verification of the Petri net processes. PPPA does not need to verify the composition of the Petri net processes because all their algebraic operators preserve the specified set of the properties. These original PPPA are significantly generalized for the newly introduced class of the SNT Petri process and agent nets in this paper. The PLACE-SUBST and ASYNC-PROC algebraic operators are defined for this class of Petri nets and their chosen properties are proved. The SNT Petri process and agent nets theory were significantly applied at the design, verification, and implementation of the programming system ensuring the <b>pilot</b> audiovisual lecture <b>room</b> functionality...|$|R

Adama watches his son's stern lecture from the doorway as Carolanne's image returns to his mind. She scoffs at the fact that he never tells Lee how much he loves him and that he lets performance reviews express his feelings instead of words. Afterwards, Adama tells his son of Roslin's request that he handle the legal proceedings. Apollo is flattered saying he remembers looking through his grandfather's legal textbooks and that he briefly considered becoming a lawyer instead of joining the military. Apollo refuses because the duties of the CAG already consume all his time.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of 1 -MCP treatments is partly {{determined by the}} uniformity {{of the distribution of}} the active substance over the whole storage area. The air circulation in the cool room must ensure the distribution of the active substance in the cool room and on the fruit. In this paper a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of the distribution of 1 -MCP in a loaded 500 L container and 42. 8 m 3 <b>pilot</b> cool <b>room</b> are presented. Respectively, 80 kg and 400 kg Jonagold apples at 1 °C and a dose of 1 μL L- 1 and 0. 625 μL L- 1 were used to collect validation data for container and cool room models. The container model takes detailed representation of apple fruits stacked in HDPE plastic bins by using discrete element (DE) method. In the cool room the fruit mass was assumed as a porous media. A convection-diffusion-adsorption model for 1 - MCP that was previously validated was applied in both cases. Model predictions agreed satisfactorily with experimental results. No significant spatial 1 -MCP concentration gradient was observed in both cases. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|He {{also took}} a new {{approach}} to Sherlock Holmes both in TV and later in novels with the 'Murder Rooms' cycle, of which Publisher's Weekly wrote [...] "This brilliant debut mystery from British screenwriter Pirie offers a novel twist on the Sherlock Holmes pastiche". It first saw life as a two episode <b>pilot</b> Murder <b>Rooms</b> (2000) which was partly based on Arthur Conan Doyle's early life. Echoing many other reviews from The Mail, The Times, The Independent and The Guardian (all viewable on murderrooms.com), the UK's Telegraph wrote, [...] "a premise with a real touch of genius ...the script skillfully weaved episodes from Doyle's own past into a richly textured, constantly wrong-footing plot ... with a denouement as clever as anything that had gone before." [...] Variety wrote, [...] "Writer David Pirie has crafted a clever blend of historical evidence and fiction in the grand manner of a traditional Holmes mystery." [...] The show was the second highest rated of all dramas on BBC2 in its year, spawning the series of books and TV shows, most notably Murder Rooms: The Patient's Eyes (2001). Pirie was credited as associate producer.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 11 May 1945, while {{supporting}} the invasion of Okinawa, Bunker Hill was struck and severely damaged by two Japanese kamikaze planes. A Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter plane piloted by Lieutenant Junior Grade Seizō Yasunori emerged from low cloud cover, dove toward the flight deck and dropped a 550-pound (250 kilogram) bomb that penetrated the flight deck and exited {{from the side of}} the ship at gallery deck level before exploding in the ocean. The Zero next crashed onto the carrier's flight deck, destroying parked warplanes full of aviation fuel and ammunition, causing a large fire. The remains of the Zero went over the deck and dropped into the sea. Then, a short 30 seconds later, a second Zero, piloted by Ensign Kiyoshi Ogawa, plunged into its suicide dive. The Zero went through the antiaircraft fire, dropped a 550-pound bomb, and then crashed into the flight deck near the carrier's [...] "island", as kamikazes were trained to aim for the island superstructure. The bomb penetrated the flight deck and exploded in the <b>pilot's</b> ready <b>room.</b> Gasoline fires flamed up and several explosions took place.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the flats}} above the <b>pilot's</b> <b>room</b> are hushed and chapel-like offices, all sumptuously fitted, where Englishmen write and {{telephone}} and telegraph, and deft Babus for ever draw {{maps of the}} shifting Hugli. Any hope of understanding {{the work of the}} Port Commissioners is thoroughly dashed by being taken through the Port maps of {{a quarter of a century}} past. Men have played with the Hugli as children play with a gutter-runnel, and, in return, the Hugli once rose and played with men and ships till the Strand Road was littered with the raffle and the carcasses of big ships. There are photos on the walls of the cyclone of '64, when the Thunder came inland and sat upon an American barque, obstructing all the traffic. Very curious are these photos, and almost impossible to believe. How can a big, strong steamer have her three masts razed to deck level? How can a heavy, country boat be pitched on to the poop of a high-walled liner? and how can the side be bodily torn out of a ship? The photos say that all these things are possible, and men aver that a cyclone may come again and scatter the craft like chaff. Outside the Port Office are the export and import sheds, buildings that can hold a ship's cargo apiece, all standing on reclaimed ground. Here be several strong smells, a mass of railway lines, and a multitude of men. [...] "Do you see where that trolly is standing, behind the big P. and O. berth? In that place as nearly as may be the Govindpur went down about twenty years ago, and began to shift out!" [...] "But that is solid ground." [...] "She sank there, and the next tide made a scour-hole on one side of her. The returning tide knocked her into it. Then the mud made up behind her. Next tide the business was repeated--always the scour-hole in the mud and the filling up behind her. So she rolled, and was pushed out and out until she got in the way of the shipping right out yonder, and we had to blow her up. When a ship sinks in mud or quicksand she regularly digs her own grave and wriggles herself into it deeper and deeper till she reaches moderately solid stuff. Then she sticks." [...] Horrible idea, is it not, to go down and down with each tide into the foul Hugli mud? ...|$|R

2500|$|Whiting was {{credited}} with establishing many basic tenets of carrier aviation, largely worked out during his first Langley tour. He established the first <b>pilot</b> ready <b>rooms</b> aboard Langley. He had a hand-cranked movie camera film every landing on the carrier {{to aid in the}} evaluation of landing techniques, and had a darkroom and photography laboratory installed on board to allow the landing films to be developed at sea. Langleys pilots had no signaling system with which shipboard personnel could assist them in landing, so when not flying himself, Whiting observed all landings from the aft port corner of Langleys flight deck. where he was visible to pilots in critical touchdown attitudes when the nose of the aircraft might obscure their view straight ahead as they approached the ship to land. Pilots found Whitings body language helpful and suggested an experienced pilot be assigned to occupy that position as a [...] "landing signal officer" [...] or [...] "landing safety officer" [...] (LSO), using signals to guide them to safe landings. In an advanced form, the LSO concept survives aboard aircraft carriers to this day. Whiting also was influential in the U.S. Navys decision to make pilot qualification a requirement for command of an aircraft carrier.|$|R
40|$|Emergency crew escape {{capabilities}} {{have been}} less than adequate for fighter aircraft since before WW II. From the over-the-side bailout of those days through the current ejection seat with a rocket catapult, escaping from a disabled aircraft has been risky at best. Current efforts are underway toward developing a high-tech, smart ejection seat that will give fighter <b>pilots</b> more <b>room</b> {{to live in the}} sky, but an escape capsule is needed to meet current and future fighter envelopes. Escape capsules have a bad reputation due to past examples of high weight, poor performance and great complexity. However, the advantages available demand that a capsule be developed. This capsule concept will minimize the inherent disavantages and incorporate the benefits while integrating all aspects of crew station design. The resulting design is appropriate for a crew station of the year 2010 and includes improved combat acceleration protection, chemical or biological combat capability, improved aircraft to escape system interaction, and the highest level of escape performance achievable. The capsule is compact, which can allow a reduced aircraft size and weighs only 1200 lb. The escape system weight penalty is only 120 lb higher than that for the next ejection seat and the capsule has a corresponding increase in performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{terms of}} popular debate {{concerning}} the drone and drone power have been quickly established. Debate typically centres around {{a set of}} issues which include: the diffusion of the conventional battlefield and the muddying of ‘territory’; the supposed precision of surgical strikes, or as the US military has it, ‘putting warheads on foreheads’ (Chamayou, 2015 : 141); and the system of seeing and killing from thousands of miles away, with the accompanying debates concerning, on one hand, the invulnerability of drone operators (Benjamin, 2012), and on the other, the various psychological disorders suffered by these same operators (Power, 2013). There are now familiar, officially sanctioned images to accompany such issues, too: images of the drone <b>pilot’s</b> control <b>room</b> with its multiple screens, images of the Predator drone aircraft soaring above unfamiliar terrain. These images serve to illustrate {{the fact that such}} debates have a tendency to focus either on the political subject (the civilian, the soldier, the terrorist), or on the technical object (the drone, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). What then of drone culture? What of the fundamental weirdness of the drone that can be felt beyond its military operations and that refuses reduction to a set of standardized discourses...|$|R
