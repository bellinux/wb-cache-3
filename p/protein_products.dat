5|$|The {{synaptic}} tag hypothesis {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas {{one might expect}} only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the <b>protein</b> <b>products</b> resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.|$|E

25|$|Curiously, around {{half of the}} <b>protein</b> <b>products</b> of {{transferred}} genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. Many became exaptations, {{taking on}} new functions like participating in cell division, protein routing, and even disease resistance. A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion. Some transferred chloroplast DNA <b>protein</b> <b>products</b> get directed to the secretory pathway though {{it should be noted}} that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just like if you were headed for the extracellular space. In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway.|$|E

Research using flow cytometry on {{another member of the}} herpes virus family, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, indicates the possibility of an additional lytic stage, delayed-late. These stages of lytic infection, particularly late lytic, are distinct from the latency stage.

25|$|When {{assaying}} epistasis {{within a}} gene, site-directed mutagenesis {{can be used}} to generate the different genes, and their <b>protein</b> <b>products</b> can be assayed (e.g. for stability or catalytic activity). This is sometimes called a double mutant cycle and involves producing and assaying the wild type protein, the two single mutants and the double mutant. Epistasis is measured as the difference between the effects of the mutations together versus the sum of their individual effects. This can be expressed as a free energy of interaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons why}} {{mitochondria}} have retained some genes are debated. The existence in some species of mitochondrion-derived organelles lacking a genome suggests that complete gene loss is possible, and transferring mitochondrial genes to the nucleus has several advantages. The difficulty of targeting remotely-produced hydrophobic <b>protein</b> <b>products</b> to the mitochondrion is one hypothesis for why some genes are retained in mtDNA; colocalisation for redox regulation is another, citing {{the desirability of}} localised control over mitochondrial machinery. Recent analysis {{of a wide range}} of mtDNA genomes suggests that both these features may dictate mitochondrial gene retention.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, the {{proteins}} {{expressed by the}} hMre11 (defective in ATLD) and Nbs1 (defective in NBS) genes exist in the cell as a complex, along with a third protein expressed by the hRad50 gene. This complex, known as the MRN complex, {{plays an important role}} in DNA damage repair and signaling and is required to recruit ATM to the sites of DNA double strand breaks. Mre11 and Nbs1 are also targets for phosphorylation by the ATM kinase. Thus, the similarity of the three diseases can be explained in part by the fact that the <b>protein</b> <b>products</b> of the three genes mutated in these disorders interact in common pathways in the cell.|$|E
25|$|The RNA {{segments}} of the viral genome have complementary base sequences at the terminal ends, allowing them to bond to each other with hydrogen bonds. After transcription from negative-sense to positive-sense RNA takes place, the positive-sense RNA strands are capped on the 5’ end by a process called cap snatching. This involves the viral protein NS1 binding to the host cell’s early messenger RNA transcripts. A second viral protein, PA, cleaves the cap from the host’s RNA. The short cap is then added to the influenza positive-sense RNA strands, allowing it to be processed by ribosomes and translated into its <b>protein</b> <b>products.</b> The positive-sense RNA strands also serve for synthesis of negative-sense RNA strands for new virions.|$|E
25|$|Animal <b>protein</b> <b>products</b> are a {{good source}} of B12, {{particularly}} organ meats such as kidney or liver. Other good sources are fish, eggs, and dairy products. It is suggested that vegans, who consume no animal meat or by-products, supplement their diet with B12. While there are foods fortified with B12 available, some may be mislabelled in an attempt to boost their nutritional claims. Products of fermentation, such as algae extracts and sea vegetables, may be labelled as sources of B12, but actually contain B12 analogues which compete for the absorption of the nutrient itself. In order to get adequate amounts of the vitamin, orally administered pills or fortified foods such as cereals and soy milk, are recommended for vegans.|$|E

50|$|Nagase et al. cloned and sequenced 100 {{individual}} cDNAs from fetal brain cDNA library, including clone KIAA1807 {{which was}} designated PHF17. The predicted 702-amino acid <b>protein</b> <b>product</b> of that clone {{was similar to}} the human zinc finger protein BR140 (BRPF1).

25|$|Functional {{genomics}} is a {{field of}} molecular biology that attempts {{to make use of}} the vast wealth of data produced by genomic projects (such as genome sequencing projects) to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. Functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription, translation, and protein–protein interactions, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures. Functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and <b>protein</b> <b>products.</b> A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional “gene-by-gene” approach.|$|E
25|$|The {{central core}} of a virion {{contains}} the viral genome and other viral proteins that package and protect the genetic material. Unlike the genomes of most organisms (including humans, animals, plants, and bacteria) which {{are made up of}} double-stranded DNA, many viral genomes are made up of a different, single-stranded nucleic acid called RNA. Unusually for a virus, though, the influenza type A virus genome is not a single piece of RNA; instead, it consists of segmented pieces of negative-sense RNA, each piece containing either one or two genes which code for a gene product (protein). The term negative-sense RNA just implies that the RNA genome cannot be translated into protein directly; it must first be transcribed to positive-sense RNA before it can be translated into <b>protein</b> <b>products.</b> The segmented nature of the genome allows for the exchange of entire genes between different viral strains.|$|E
25|$|Although {{some of the}} {{properties}} of PfEMP1 were firmly established, the protein was difficult to isolate due to its low occurrence. Five years after its discovery, {{one of the original}} researchers Irwin Sherman began to doubt the existence of PfEMP1 as a unique protein. He argued that the antigen could be merely a surface protein of RBCs that changes upon infection with malarial parasites. A consensus was achieved in 1995 following the identification (by cloning) of the gene for PfEMP1. The discovery of the genes was independently reported by Howard's team and two other teams at NIH. Howard's team identified two genes for PfEMP1, and recombinant <b>protein</b> <b>products</b> of these genes were shown to have antigenic and adhesive properties. They further affirmed that PfEMP1 is the key molecule in the ability of P. falciparum to evade the host's immune system. Joseph D. Smith and others showed that PfEMP1 is actually a large family of proteins encoded by a multigene family called var. The gene products can bind to a variety of receptors including those on endothelial cells. Xin-Zhuan Su and others showed that there could be more than 50 var genes which are distributed on different chromosomes of the malarial parasite.|$|E

500|$|The <b>protein</b> <b>products</b> of the {{regulatory}} toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of pleiotropy, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element {{just a few hundred}} base pairs long, the pleiotropic eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls [...] "scores to hundreds" [...] of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each. All this complexity enables genes involved {{in the development of the}} embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.|$|E
