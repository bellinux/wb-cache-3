Basic research sample is formed by employees of the enterprises (manufacturing and non-manufacturing) operating in the Slovak Republic.

This thesis analyzes the potential of business process reengineering (BPR) to dramatically improve the Military Pay Document Process (MPDP) for the United States Army and the United States Coast Guard financial communities. Based on Nissen's methodology the MPDP is analyzed and three redesign alternatives are developed, which are capable of yielding order of magnitude improvements in cycle time and cost. This thesis includes process simulation and intelligent systems analysis of the Army and Coast Guard's baseline MPDP to generate and evaluate the three redesign alternatives. Simulation runs demonstrate that cycle time and cost can be reduced substantially by redesigning the MPDP.
