5000|$|As in {{offset litho}} {{printing}} and traditional photographic printing, glossy papers give the highest color density (or Dmax), {{and therefore the}} widest color gamut. <b>Photo</b> <b>papers</b> vary in their longevity and their color gamut. Ink suppliers often provide color profiles for their ink systems when used with specific papers. Longevity depends on the specific combination of inks and paper. For maximum life, the paper substrate is [...] "wood-free" [...] (i.e., wood-based but without lignin), or cotton-based, {{or a combination of}} the two. Plastic substrates also exist.|$|R
