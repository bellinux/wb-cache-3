5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its <b>protective</b> <b>sheath,</b> providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|The paws of the cheetah are {{narrower}} {{than those}} of other felids. The slightly curved claws lack a <b>protective</b> <b>sheath</b> and are weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the big cats, which have fully retractable claws, and a similarity to canids. Additionally, the claws of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter {{than those of}} other cats. Absence of protection makes the claws blunt; however, the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E
5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a <b>protective</b> <b>sheath</b> for underwater cables.|$|E
50|$|Delivery of an opioid such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, sufentanyl or {{meperidine}} {{directly into}} the subarachnoid cavity (the space between the spinal cord's inner, waterproof sheath and its outer <b>protective</b> <b>sheaths)</b> provides enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects, and has reduced the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. The anxiolytic clonidine, or the nonopioid analgesic ziconotide, and local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, ropivacaine or tetracaine may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|R

50|$|Duprat, born in 1957, {{began his}} work with caddisfly larvae in the early 1980s. He {{collects}} the larvae from their normal environments and he takes them to his studio. There he gently removes their own natural cases and puts the larvae in tanks filled with his own materials, from which they begin to build their new <b>protective</b> <b>sheaths.</b> When he began the project, he only provided the caddis larvae with gold flakes. Since then, they have enjoyed various semi-precious and precious stones, including turquoise, coral and lapis lazuli, as well as sapphires, pearls, rubies, and diamonds.|$|R
5|$|Suillus salmonicolor {{occurs in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with various species of Pinus. This is a mutualistic relationship in which the subterranean fungal mycelia creates a <b>protective</b> <b>sheath</b> around the rootlets of the tree and a network of hyphae (the Hartig net) that penetrates between the tree's epidermal and cortical cells. This association helps the plant absorb water and mineral nutrients; in exchange, the fungus receives a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant's photosynthesis. Two-, three-, and five-needled pines have all been recorded to associate with S.salmonicolor. In North America, the fungus has been found growing with P.banksiana, P.palustris, P.resinosa, P.rigida, P.strobus and P.taeda. In Kamchatka (in the Russian Far East) {{it has been found}} in association with P.pumila, in the Philippines with P.kesiya, and in southern India with P.patula. The northern limit of its North American range is eastern Canada (Quebec), and the southern limit is Nuevo León and near Nabogame in Temósachi Municipality, Chihuahua, Mexico.|$|E
25|$|On 14 January 1949, {{staff at}} the Adelaide railway station {{discovered}} a brown suitcase with its label removed, which had been checked into the station cloakroom after 11:00a.m. on 30 November 1948. It was believed that the suitcase was owned by the man found on the beach. In the case were a red checked dressing gown; a size seven, red felt pair of slippers; four pairs of underpants; pyjamas; shaving items; a light brown pair of trousers with sand in the cuffs; an electrician's screwdriver; a table knife cut down into a short sharp instrument; {{a pair of scissors}} with sharpened points; a small square of zinc thought to have been used as a <b>protective</b> <b>sheath</b> for the knife and scissors and a stencilling brush, as used by third officers on merchant ships for stencilling cargo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thylacine}} was {{the largest}} known carnivorous marsupial of modern times. The thylacine {{was one of only}} two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes (the other is the water opossum). The male thylacine had a pouch that acted as a <b>protective</b> <b>sheath,</b> protecting the male's external reproductive organs while running through thick brush. The last known animal died in captivity in 1936. Many alleged sightings have since been recorded, none of them confirmed. The mature thylacine ranged from [...] long, plus a tail of around [...] The largest measured specimen was [...] from nose to tail. Adults stood about [...] at the shoulder and weighed [...] There was slight sexual dimorphism with the males being larger than females on average.|$|E
50|$|The {{buildup of}} unmetabolized lipids {{adversely}} affects {{the growth of}} the nerve's <b>protective</b> myelin <b>sheath</b> (the covering that insulates many nerves) resulting in demyelination and severe progressive degeneration of motor skills. As {{part of a group of}} disorders known as leukodystrophies, Krabbe disease results from the imperfect growth and development of myelin.|$|R
50|$|Viverra {{species are}} {{distinguished}} externally {{from the other}} genera of the Viverrinae by {{the structure of the}} fore feet, of which the 3rd and 4th digits are provided with lobes of skin, which act as <b>protective</b> <b>sheaths</b> for the retractile claws. They have a long and narrow skull, with narrow, nearly parallel-sided, not strongly constricted waist. The postorbital processes are small and a little in front of the middle point between the tip of the premaxillae in front and of the occipital crest behind. The sagittal crest is moderately strong in the adult. The sub-orbital portion of the cheek is comparatively short, the suture between the anterior bone of the zygomatic arch and the maxilla being much shorter than the median length of the nasals, than half the length of the cheek-teeth, and than the width across the occipital condyles, this width exceeding the length of the compound auditory bulla.|$|R
50|$|Orchids in {{the genus}} Calochilus are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, {{sympodial}} herbs {{with a few}} inconspicuous, fine roots {{and a pair of}} egg-shaped tubers lacking a <b>protective</b> fibrous <b>sheath.</b> The tubers produce replacement tubers {{on the end of a}} short, root-like stolons. There is either a single, linear, fleshy, convolute leaf, usually channelled, sometimes triangular in cross section, or there is no leaf.|$|R
2500|$|The bats {{emerge from}} their roosts 20 to 150 minutes after sunset, and forage {{for much of}} the night. Short-tailed bats spend only around 30% of their {{foraging}} time catching insects in the air, typically flying less than [...] above the ground, and a further 40% feeding from plants. The remaining 30% is spent hunting on the forest floor, a higher proportion than any other species of bat. To assist with this unusual style of hunting, short-tailed bats are able to fold their wings inside a <b>protective</b> <b>sheath</b> formed from their membranes, and the wings have only a very limited propatagium, making them more flexible and mobile. Movement along the ground is also assisted by strong hind limbs and a robust pelvic girdle, and by the additional talons on their claws.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the characteristics and costs of exogenous endoscopy-related infections, pseudo-infections, and toxic reactions in the US. METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific literature published between 1966 and 2005 was conducted in Medline. Data collection was based on a prospective protocol developed by the authors. RESULTS: The literature review included 70 outbreaks described in 64 scientific articles. Bronchoscopy accounted for half of all reported outbreaks. Inadequate decontamination practices were the leading cause of contamination; equipment malfunction became the second leading cause of contamination during the period 1990 - 2004. More than 91 % of the infections identified could be prevented by health care providers if quality control systems are improved and implemented. The available economic information concerning exogenous endoscope related events is very limited. A model for the analysis of the economic burden of exogenous endoscopy-related events is proposed. CONCLUSIONS: Proper decontamination practices, the use of <b>protective</b> <b>sheaths,</b> and the improvement of surveillance systems could reduce the clinical and economic burdens associated with exogenous endoscopy-related events...|$|R

50|$|In the {{peripheral}} nervous system, the myelin sheath of each axon in a nerve is {{wrapped in a}} delicate <b>protective</b> <b>sheath</b> known as the endoneurium. Within the nerve, axons targeting the same anatomical location are bundled together into groups known as fascicles, each surrounded by another <b>protective</b> <b>sheath</b> known as the perineurium. Several fascicles may be in turn bundled together with a blood supply and fatty tissue within yet another sheath, the epineurium. This grouping structure {{is analogous to the}} muscular organization system of epimysium, perimysium and endomysium.|$|E

50|$|Orchids in {{the genus}} Arthrochilus are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, {{sympodial}} herbs usually {{with a few}} inconspicuous, fine roots and a single oval-shaped tuber lacking a <b>protective</b> fibrous <b>sheath.</b> (A. huntianus lacks a true tuber.) Some species form colonies, reproducing asexually from daughter tubers formed {{on the end of}} root-like stolons. The stem is short, erect and unbranched with thin, leaf-like cataphylls at each node. There are up to six leaves at or near the base of the plant, sometimes forming a rosette around the stem.|$|R
50|$|Thermotoga elfii is a rod-shaped, glucose-fermenting bacterium. The type {{strain of}} T. elfii is SEBR 6459T. The genus Thermotoga was {{originally}} {{thought to be}} strictly found surrounding submarine hydrothermal vents, but this organism was subsequently isolated in African oil wells in 1995. A <b>protective</b> outer <b>sheath</b> allows this microbe to be thermophilic. This organism cannot function {{in the presence of}} oxygen making it strictly anaerobic. Some research proposes that the thiosulfate-reducing qualities in this organism could lead to decreased bio-corrosion in oil equipment in industrial settings.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this program is to develop structural silicide-based materials with optimum combinations of elevated temperature strength/creep resistance, low temperature fracture toughness, and high temperature oxidation and corrosion resistance for applications of importance to the US processing industry. A further objective is to develop silicide-based prototype industrial components. The ultimate aim {{of the program is}} to work with industry to transfer the structural silicide materials technology to the private sector in order to promote international competitiveness in the area of advanced high temperature materials and important applications in major energy-intensive US processing industries. The program presently has a number of developing industrial connections, including a CRADA with Johns Manville Corporation targeted at the area of MoSi{sub 2 }-based high temperature materials and components for fiberglass melting and processing applications. The authors are also developing an interaction with the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) to develop silicides for high temperature radiant gas burner applications, for the glass and other industries. With Combustion Technology Inc., they are developing silicide-based periscope sight tubes for the direct observation of glass melts. With Accutru International Corporation, they are developing silicide-based <b>protective</b> <b>sheaths</b> for self-verifying temperature sensors which may be used in glass furnaces and other industrial applications.
