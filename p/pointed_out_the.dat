5|$|In response, the Athenian navy under Xanthippus {{joined with}} the Allied fleet off Delos. They were then {{approached}} by a delegation from Samos, who suggested that the Ionian cities would revolt if the Allied fleet successfully engaged the Persian fleet. They furthermore <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> poor morale and reduced seaworthiness of the Persian fleet. Leotychides decided to attempt this, and sailed for Samos.|$|E
5|$|Mohandar {{tried to}} insist on only sending Nerazim to the sanctuary, but Selendis talked him into {{allowing}} {{a small number of}} templar warriors to accompany the expedition. He agreed, but only if there was no disrespect. Vartanil went along with them, and (much to Mohandar's annoyance) so did Dahl. Mohandar <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> protoss were still evaluating her, a terran female.|$|E
5|$|New {{classical}} economics had <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> inherent contradiction of {{the neoclassical}} synthesis: Walrasian microeconomics with market clearing and general equilibrium could {{not lead to}} Keynesian macroeconomics where markets failed to clear. New Keynesians recognized this paradox, but, while the new classicals abandoned Keynes, new Keynesians abandoned Walras and market clearing.|$|E

5|$|In 1836, British naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson {{proclaimed the}} red-eared cat {{commonly}} found in Nepal to be a lynx and therefore named it Lynchus erythrotus; Ceylonese naturalist Edward Frederick Kelaart described the first jungle cat skin from Sri Lanka in 1852 and stressed upon its close resemblance to Hodgson's red cat.

5|$|Scholars of anthropology, sociology, and {{feminism}} have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> symbolic {{nature of}} phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape {{as symbols of}} male domination, power and political authority.

There are many examples of modern architecture that {{can be interpreted as}} phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.|$|E
5|$|Zlín region {{politicians}} {{announced they}} would call {{for the establishment of}} a local tactical team. Meanwhile, the Minister of Interior commented that the police were already in the process of hiring 4,000 new officers (about 10% of its total manpower), thus reversing cuts enacted by previous governments. Experts further <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> necessity to provide more CQB training to policemen in small municipalities and at rural areas. This type of training had until that point been largely aimed and directed at police officers in large towns.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library {{publications}} such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> complexity, depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built) {{attracted the attention of}} reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies of}} morphology, the bluebuck has {{historically}} been classified as either a distinct species or as a subspecies of the roan antelope. After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began to doubt its validity as a species, with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name A.leucophaeus by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1821. The Austrian zoologist Franz Friedrich Kohl <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> distinct features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899.|$|E

5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Colin Renfrew has <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{dangers of}} {{applying}} modern values {{of art to}} past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{with the}} rise of {{interest}} in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and United States Constitution had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate pedestal for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed). In 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in the same building in which federal judges were holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
