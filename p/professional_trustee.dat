40|$|It {{is clear}} that the office of {{trusteeship}} is an onerous one. The traditional image of trusteeship would suggest a number of important duties, both positive and negative, are imposed upon trustees. A trustee is obliged to discharge these duties with utmost diligence in order to escape personal liability for breach of trust. Standing in a fiduciary relationship to his beneficiary, a trustee is expected to observe the highest standards of integrity and an objective standard of care when managing the trust. An increasingly important question in trust law is whether {{and the extent to which}} it is possible to exempt a trustee from liability from liability for breach of trust.

40|$|Pension scheme {{governance}} is an {{area that}} has not historically attracted much attention from companies and academia alike. However, the importance of pension scheme governance has recently been realised and many companies are now trying to manage the risks that are inherent in their occupational pension schemes. Consequently, academic interest in the subject has also begun to increase and this paper will look at this burgeoning field of pension scheme governance. However, this paper has a radically different approach to the subject than the previous, more quantitative, research in that it will follow a qualitative research methodology of semi-structured interviews followed by an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis of these interviews, which has previously not been undertaken. The aim of this research was to identify and understand the different experiences of pension scheme governance that exist in the pensions industry. Different experiences of pension scheme governance were found to exist in the pensions industry and these differences largely related to whether the research participant had experience of large or small pension schemes. What this research indicates is that there are many variances in the operation of pension scheme governance in practice with most of the best practices occurring with larger pension schemes, due to the impracticalities of these taking place on smaller pension schemes. Thus, this research suggests other governance mechanisms that could well be utilised by smaller pension schemes to improve their standards of governance. These mechanisms include: governance audits; codes of practice; and <b>professional</b> independent <b>trustees.</b> This research also indicates that it may well be useful for a review comparable to that conducted by Derek Higgs, on non-executive directors in public companies, to be conducted on the role and effectiveness of independent <b>professional</b> <b>trustees</b> in ensuring the good governance of pension schemes...|$|R

500|$|Part V of the Act, {{sections}} 28 to 33, {{deals with}} trustees' remuneration. Section 28 states the default {{position is that}} trustees are entitled to remuneration if it says so in the trust instrument or if a trustee acts in a [...] "professional capacity". A trust can differ from this default, but the Act confirms the recent developments in the common law from the old default position that trustees were entitled to nothing unless it was explicitly stated that they were. Section 29 {{goes on to say}} that non-charitable <b>professional</b> <b>trustees</b> are entitled to [...] "reasonable remuneration" [...] which will be a sum that the court thinks is commensurate to the work done, along the principles of quantum meruit. This is automatic if the trustee is a corporation, but will require consent of all other trustees if the trustees are natural persons. Section 30 stipulates that rules on charitable trustee remuneration are to be found in a statutory instrument drawn up by the Secretary of State. Trustees will be reimbursed from the trust fund itself, as will be authorised agents, nominees and custodians who are properly appointed by the trustees all so long as the expenses and payable remuneration are incurred while conducting the affairs of the trust.|$|R
5000|$|Originally to {{facilitate}} transfers of land, the Law of Property Act 1925 sections 2 and 27 make provision {{so that people}} with equitable interests in land may not assert them against purchasers of the land if there are two trustees. If a person has an equitable interest in a property, the law allows this interest to be detached from the property, or [...] "overreached" [...] and reattached to money given in exchange for land, {{so long as the}} exchange took place by at least two trustees. This was, however, applied not for the purpose of trading property by <b>professional</b> <b>trustees,</b> but against homeowners in City of London Building Society v Flegg. Here two parents, Mr and Mrs Flegg, had given their home to their children, who in turn mortgaged the property and defaulted on the loan. The House of Lords held that because the words of the statute were fulfilled, and the purchase money for the interest in the property (i.e. the loan that the children squandered) had been paid to two trustees, the Fleggs had to give up possession. Lastly, it is possible to lose an interest in land, even if registered, through adverse possession by another person after 12 years under the Limitation Act 1980 sections 15 to 17.|$|R
40|$|Section 61 of the Trustee Act 1925 {{provides}} that: “ 61.

It was originally intended to ensure that lay persons would not be deterred from acting as trustees, since the court could exercise its discretion under section 61 to relieve them from liability if they acted honestly and reasonably. But given the increasing prevalence of <b>professional</b> <b>trustees,</b> it was thought that section 61 might become of much reduced importance.

40|$|The well-institutionalised {{notion of}} audits put forth that {{information}} subjected to independent examination by third parties potentially contribute to better quality information for decision making (towards more sustainable companies?). The presence of different assurance providers offering {{a myriad of}} services {{in the name of}} “sustainability assurance” led to concerns about their quality and comparability and as a consequence a call for standards to regulate these services. This study analyses how standards by the accountancy profession interplay with hard law to regulate assurance engagements on sustainability reports in Sweden. Sustainability assurance engagements by the accountancy profession are performed according to RevR 6, developed based on international standards representing the accountancy profession’s commercial logic and conceptual understanding of assurance. These engagements are however potentially “supervised” by The Supervisory Board of Accountants (RN) whose role could apply by default due to the arguable over-inclusive definition of “audit business” in the Auditors Act. As RevR 6 only serve as “guidance material” to legal institutions, these engagements are supervised according to the legal audit concept and the auditors’ role as <b>professional</b> <b>trustees.</b> The fragmentation of regulatory systems, within which sustainability assurance engagements operate leads to legal uncertainty and systemic challenges. It is crucial for legal institutions to better deal with the lack of clarity through regulatory conversations or other means to better coordinate or steer the emergence of regulatory initiatives by private organisations in these new areas of “audit like” services as it clarifies the role assurance services can play in the drive towards sustainable companies...|$|R

40|$|Centuries ago, when land {{represented}} {{the majority of}} wealth, the trust was used primarily for holding and transferring real property. As the dominant form of wealth moved away from family land, the trust evolved into a device for managing financial assets. With this transformation came the use of exculpatory clauses by both amateur and <b>professional</b> <b>trustees,</b> providing an avenue for these fiduciaries to escape liability for designated acts. With the use of exculpatory provisions, discussion abounded about whether fiduciary duties were mandatory or subject to modification. The latter view eventually prevailed, {{with the majority of}} jurisdictions viewing fiduciary duties as default rules; that is, part of a private agreement around which the parties are free to contract. Contracting around fiduciary duties is of particular concern when a lawyer suggests himself for a fiduciary role and inserts an exculpatory clause into the governing instrument. Although the lawyer is subject to applicable legal ethics rules, such as those which govern communications and conflicts of interest, this contractarian view of the attorney-client relationship is less than ideal, especially when lawyers and non-lawyer professionals are involved in a reciprocal referral agreement. During the recent revisions to the UPC, mandates relating to the default nature of fiduciary duties were not addressed. Perhaps this was because the matter was outside the scope of the revisionists 2 ̆ 7 review, or perhaps the drafters of the revisions were comfortable with the recent position the Uniform Trust Code and the Restatement of Trusts have taken on exculpatory clauses. However the UPC revisions should have addressed this matter with specificity. Given public policy concerns, client protection, fiduciary responsibilities, and the professional responsibility of lawyers, {{it may be that the}} standard of prudence should not be abandoned so easily...|$|R
40|$|Trusts {{and their}} civil law equivalents, often known as {{foundations}} or associations, play {{a large and}} increasing role in the global economy, holding trillions {{of dollars worth of}} assets and generating billions of dollars worth of revenue and trustees’ fees annually.

To some extent, this is very much the case, with arbitration often being used to resolve conflicts between trusts and external third parties. However, arbitration of internal trust disputes – by far the more common type of concern in this area of law – is much more controversial and {{has been the subject of}} extensive and vigorous debate in the trust industry. Although trust experts have written extensively on mandatory trust arbitration, the arbitration community has been strangely silent in these discussions, and this article is among the first to consider the unique challenges facing future arbitration of internal trust disputes from the arbitral perspective. In so doing, this article provides new insights on the types of procedures that are necessary to ensure procedural fairness in what is often a complex, multiparty proceeding. This article also considers what steps settlors can take to improve the enforceability of an arbitration provision located in the trust itself and analyzes the only set of institutional rules targeted specifically toward trust disputes – the AAA Trust Arbitration Rules – by comparing the AAA approach to the newly identified best practices in this field and to certain related initiatives from the ICC and the DIS...|$|R

2500|$|The duty of {{care was}} codified in the Trustee Act 2000 section 1, as the [...] "care and skill that is reasonable" [...] to expect, {{regarding}} any special skills of the trustee. In practice this means that a trustee must be judged by what should be reasonably expected from another person in such a position of responsibility, being mindful not to judge decisions {{with the benefit of}} hindsight, and mindful of the inherent risk involved in any property management venture. As long ago as 1678, in Morley v Morley Lord Nottingham LC held that a trustee would not be liable if £40 of the trust fund's gold was robbed, so long as he otherwise performed his duties. Probably one of the main parts of the {{duty of care}}, in managing trust property, will relate to a trustee's investment choices. In Learoyd v Whiteley, Lindley LJ elaborated the general prudent person rule, that in investments one must 'take such care as an ordinary prudent man would take if he were minded to make an investment for the benefit of other people for whom he felt morally bound to provide'. This meant a trustee who invested £5000 in mortgages of a brick field and four houses with a shop, and lost the lot when the businesses went insolvent, was liable for the losses on the brick field, whose value must have known to be bound to depreciate as bricks were taken out. Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd suggests investments must be actively monitored, particularly by <b>professional</b> <b>trustees.</b> This duty was broken when the Barclays corporate trustee department, where trust assets held 99 per cent of a company's shares, failed to get any information or board representation before a disastrous property speculation. In making investments, TA 2000 section 4 requires that [...] "standard investment criteria" [...] must be observed, essentially along the lines of modern portfolio theory about diversification of investments to reduce risk. Section 5 suggests advice be sought on such matters if needed, but otherwise may invest anything that an ordinary property owner would. Additional restrictions, however, may be imposed depending on the how courts view the purpose of the trust, and the scope of a trustee's discretion.|$|R
