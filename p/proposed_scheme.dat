5|$|Despite this setback, Longton and Stoke {{submitted}} {{their proposal}} to the Local Government Board in early 1907. A local inquiry was held soon afterwards in Stoke, which reported back quickly and in April 1907 informed both Stoke and Longton councils that the <b>proposed</b> <b>scheme</b> was not sufficiently comprehensive and suggested holding another conference between the six towns to discuss a more complete proposal. The meeting took place in July and was addressed by John Burns, president of the Local Government Board, who called {{for a number of}} local conferences to agree a scheme for federation of all six towns.|$|E
40|$|In {{treatment}} comparison experiments, {{the treatment}} responses are often correlated with some concomitant variables {{which can be}} measured before or {{at the beginning of}} the experiments. In this article, we <b>propose</b> <b>schemes</b> for the assignment of experimental units that may greatly improve the efficiency of the comparison in such situations. The <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> are based on general ranked set sampling. The relative efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> are studied and compared. It is found that some <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> are always more efficient than the traditional simple random assignment scheme when the total cost is the same.

We also investigate the tradeoff of performance and complexity among <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> by evaluating the average number of active relays, path estimations, and signal- to-noise ratio comparisons.

40|$|In {{this work}} we <b>propose</b> <b>schemes</b> for joint model-order and step-size {{adaptation}} of reduced-rank adaptive filters. The <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> employ reduced-rank adaptive filters in parallel operating with different orders and step sizes, which are exploited by convex combination strategies. The reduced-rank adaptive filters {{used in the}} <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> {{are based on a}} joint and iterative decimation and interpolation (JIDF) method recently proposed. The unique feature of the JIDF method is that it can substantially reduce the number of coefficients for adaptation, thereby making feasible the use of multiple reduced-rank filters in parallel. We investigate the performance of the <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> in an interference suppression application for CDMA systems. Simulation results show that the <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> can significantly improve the performance of the existing reduced-rank adaptive filters based on the JIDF method.

25|$|The <b>proposed</b> <b>scheme</b> has {{a number}} of {{environmental}} effects. The dam would result in a loss of habitat for the endangered Canterbury mudfish. The dam would also affect amenity and landscape values, especially for the settlement of Coalgate. Water abstraction from the rivers will have an effect on ecology and other natural characteristics. The intensification of farming as a result of water being made available by the scheme has led to fears of increased nitrate contamination of the aquifers.|$|E
25|$|The Ediacaran {{period is}} not yet {{formally}} subdivided, but a <b>proposed</b> <b>scheme</b> recognises an Upper Ediacaran whose base corresponds with the Gaskiers glaciation, a Terminal Ediacaran Stage starting around , a preceding stage beginning around 557 Ma with the earliest widespread Ediacaran biota fossils; two proposed schemes differ on whether the lower strata should be divided into an Early and Middle Ediacaran or not, because it's {{not clear whether the}} Shuram excursion (which would divide the Early and Middle) is a separate event from the Gaskiers, or whether the two events are correlated.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we have <b>proposed</b> training-based {{compensation}} <b>schemes</b> for OFDM systems impaired with transmitter {{and receiver}} IQ imbalance. The <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> can decouple the compensation of the {{transmitter and receiver}} IQ imbalance from the compensation of the channel distortion. Once the IQ imbalance parameters are known, a standard channel equalizer can then be applied to estimate and compensate for channel variations in the system. The <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> result in an overall lower training overhead and a lower computational requirement. Simulation {{results show that the}} <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> provide a very efficient compensation with performance close to the ideal case without any IQ imbalance.|$|R
30|$|Two schemes, R-CMLF and D-CMLF, for the {{sequential}} {{convex combination}} of lattice filters {{have been presented}} in which the channels of modified SPMLSs represent multiple filters. The main advantages of the <b>proposed</b> combination <b>schemes</b> are that they are order-recursive and conform to high modularity, regularity, and reconfigurability of lattice filters. The MSD performances and complexities of the <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> are close; however, the D-CMLF scheme is more modular and better complies with the structure of SPMLSs due {{to the use of}} a single-in-stage combination processor as opposed to the use of dual combination processors in the R-CMLF scheme. It has also been illustrated that the <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> are better devised than a single filter in reacting to faulty components and statistical variations in the input signal. In addition, it has been determined that the transfer of coefficients and the use of momentum term do not have much effect on the performance of the <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes.</b> Even though the M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes are less complex than the <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes,</b> they perform worse than the <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes,</b> and in addition, {{they do not have the}} desired features such as modularity, order-recursiveness, and reconfigurability.|$|R
30|$|Meanwhile, the <b>proposed</b> AS <b>scheme</b> has {{significantly}} improved performance {{compared to the}} <b>proposed</b> DS <b>scheme.</b> Only within three or four iterations, the <b>proposed</b> AS <b>scheme</b> approaches nearly ICI-free level. This means that adaptively selecting the detection symbols for ICI reconstruction works properly, and as the iteration goes on, even the band edge subcarriers having high ICI power are gradually canceled. Despite the inferior performance of the <b>proposed</b> DS <b>scheme</b> to the <b>proposed</b> AS <b>scheme,</b> the <b>proposed</b> DS <b>scheme</b> has a merit that {{it is easy to}} implement and needs nearly no complexity overhead.|$|R
25|$|Western Australia deemed itself {{too large}} {{to fit into the}} <b>proposed</b> <b>scheme</b> and adhered to one of its own devising; plates in the Iaa-nnn series were to be skipped (as a capital I was {{believed}} to be easily mistaken for a number 1). This allowed the two populous states with greater registrations of vehicles 6 letter-series each (New South Wales had A to F, Victoria G to H and J to M), and others with 3 letter-series (Queensland N to Q, South Australia R to T, Western Australia was allocated U to V). Tasmania was only given one, W, due to its size, and the Australian Capital Territory Y. Z was for federal government department use Australia-wide, the 2nd letter reflecting the commonwealth department.|$|E
25|$|On 2 December 2014, the {{government}} {{announced that it will}} be investing £170m on the A57, A628 and A628 trans-Pennine route, including a bypass for the village of Mottram. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has given the go-ahead for an initial scheme of at least £170 million to resolve the traffic issue through Mottram and to build a link road to Glossop. The Government will also consult on whether to extend the <b>proposed</b> <b>scheme</b> to relieve pressure on Tintwistle as well. In addition to the works announced, there are also studies and proposals into the possibility of a tunnel under the Peak District to link Manchester with Sheffield, with some of the proposed tunnel routes using the existing M67 route to link the M60 and M1 motorways.|$|E

30|$|In this scenario, {{we assume}} that the wired path is {{congested}} with congestion packet loss rate of 1.5 % due to the forward cross traffic. The <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> improve the throughput by about 44 % compared with DCR over cellular network before handover. However, after handover to WLAN, both of <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> I and II improve the throughput by 480 % and 457 % compared with DCR and DCR-FRTO, respectively. The reason for this great difference is that unlike <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes,</b> the throughputs of previous schemes are suppressed by congestion after handover from a slow link to a fast link.|$|R
30|$|Figure 11 shows TCP {{throughputs}} for <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> (I and II) against known schemes when {{a mobile}} node performs the handover from cellular network to WLAN. Before the handover, the <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> I and II improve the throughput by 26 % compared with DCR. This result {{indicates that the}} modified loss differentiator improves TCP throughput of the DCR scheme. After the handover to WLAN, the packet-reordering does not happen any more. The only possible loss pattern is wireless loss (noncongestion). The <b>proposed</b> <b>schemes</b> improve the throughput by 60 % compared with other schemes (Sack, DCR, and DCR-FRTO).|$|R
