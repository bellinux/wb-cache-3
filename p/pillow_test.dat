Method: Eight subjects participated in the experiment. Three different materials such as polyester sponge, memory foam and the buckwheat shell used for Korean traditional <b>pillow</b> were <b>tested.</b> Electro-goniometer, six channels of electromyography(EMG), ten channels of the head pressure sensors were used to measure the biomechanical responses. Surface electrodes were attached to the right/left semispinal...|$|R
40|$|Anacom MedTek, {{a medical}} device company, {{produces}} pillow speakers as their main product line. Pillow speakers are a healthcare communications tool {{that allow for}} hospital patients to control many entertainment and environmental components of the hospital room from one controller. These pillow speaker devices have anywhere from 3 to 27 metal dome key cap buttons based on their customization. Before they can be shipped to a customer, each button must be tested {{to ensure that it}} is functioning properly. This test is currently done manually by a testing technician. With so many buttons to be tested for each unit and a production of 100, 000 units a year, Repetitive Strain Injuries have become a concern for the technicians. Such injuries have resulted in major costs to Anacom {{in the last several years}} in the form of workers compensation claims and lost worker time. To avoid this human factors issue this project is to design a prototype that will automate the <b>pillow</b> speaker <b>testing</b> process to avoid Repetitive Strain Injuries in the testing technicians while meeting specific production and usability requirements...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} tests {{that have been}} conducted with Tactile Dialogues, a textile pillow that can react to touch with vibrotactile stimuli and haptic sensations. Tactile Dialogues is designed to stimulate movement and interpersonal contact for patients in the late stages of dementia, their family members and their caregivers. The most recent prototype of the <b>pillow</b> has been <b>tested</b> during 15 separate visits of family members or caregivers with patients. The aim of these tests {{is to find out}} whether personalization of the vibrotactile stimuli is appreciated over a mirroring vibrotactile behavior. We propose a three-scale measurement to help family members and caregivers examine the responses of the patient: muscular relaxation, physical movement and interpersonal contact. Through the semi-structured interviews we identified that family members and caregivers do appreciate the opportunity to personalize the vibrotactile behavior and that the pillow mainly functions as a way to establish communication with the patient...|$|R
40|$|With NASA {{focused on}} researching and {{developing}} technology for deep space missions, {{the need for}} a reliable supplementary food source must also be considered. For the ISS, resupplying the food source is more practical and cost effect since the facility is in low Earth orbit. However, as NASA attempts to push the frontier in space, the costs and distance for resupply will surely increase. Plants would contribute to the proportion of food and reduce the dependency on food from Earth. In addition, plants would provide oxygen production, carbon dioxide removal, and psychological benefits. As a result, a vegetable production system, VEGGIE, was developed for NASA to produce salad crops with minimal resources and study the beneficial effects. The VEGGIE pillow is a single use bag for growing crops that is used with the VEGGIE hardware. The VEGGIE <b>pillow</b> was <b>tested</b> with four different species of plants with the cut-and-come-again harvest method to determine the greatest yield. Instead of harvesting the entire plant, the harvest consisted of cutting leaves to allow the plant to regrow leaves. The harvest methods included cutting the plants weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly. A fifth plant species, radishes, was also harvested and replanted. Microbial load analysis and an ANOVA significance test were utilized. The data suggest that the two Brassica plants have the greatest yields; however, the microbial load is also greatest for the two plants per gram of fresh weight. Furthermore, the results support the reuse of pillows for multiple harvests as shown by the replanted radishes...|$|R
40|$|VEGGIE {{is a small}} plant {{production}} chamber built by ORBITEC. This chamber can be collapsed for easy stowage and deployed in orbit. It is designed for gravity independent operation, and provides 0. 17 square m of crop growth area with three primary subsystems: an LED light panel, extendable transparent Teflon bellows to enclose the plants, and a wicking reservoir. VEGGIE would provide the capability for astronauts to grow fresh foods for dietary supplementation. Initial planting concepts tested with the VEGGIE included direct seeding or plug placement on the reservoir surface. These options had issues of salt accumulation and eventual toxicity if the reservoir was filled with nutrient solution, and hardware reuse was limited due to sanitation. In response a rooting packet or "pillow" concept was developed: single-use bags of media containing time release fertilizer with a wicking surface contacting the VEGGIE reservoir. <b>Pillows</b> being <b>tested</b> are small electrostatic bags with a Nitex nylon mesh side, each holding 100 mL of dry media. Six pillows fit in one VEGGIE unit; however pillow size could vary depending on crop selected. Seeds can be planted directly in pillows and planted pillows can be hydrated in space as desired. Our goals were to define optimal media and crops for an ISS mission scenario. Plant <b>tests</b> in <b>pillows</b> were performed in a controlled environment chamber set to habitat-relevant conditions, and capillary reservoir analogs were utilized. Media <b>tested</b> within <b>pillows</b> included: a commercial peat-based potting mix, arcillite (calcined clay), perlite: vermiculite, and peat-based: arcillite blends. Testing included 15 types of leafy greens, snow pea, radish, and herbs. Media performance was crop dependent, but generally plants showed the greatest growth in the peat-based: arcillite mixes. Crops with the best performance in pillows were identified, and testing is underway with select leafy greens examining plant and microbial load response to repeated harvest. We plan to use findings from previous flight testing with media to evaluate the effects of capillary flow from the reservoir to pillows in microgravity...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A graph {{that shows the}} snow water equivalent data during the 1975 - 76 winter season for the Ninemile and Michaud Farms snow pillows located in northern Maine is shown. The Bournes transducers used in the snow <b>pillow</b> interface were <b>tested</b> after field use under controlled laboratory conditions of temperature and pressure. It {{was found that the}} temperature calibration curve for the Bournes transducers became erratic below 0 C. On 8 - 10 August 1976, the remainder of hurricane, Belle, travelled through Vermont, New Hampshire, northern Maine, and on into Canada's Maritime Provinces dumping three inches of rain in many areas. In Canada and Maine, local storms dropped up to two inches during the following week. The Saint John River reached near flood stages at Fort Kent, Maine. During this storm, DCP data were received from Fort Kent, Ninemile Bridge, and Saint Francis River in New Brunswick. Resulting high runoff after these storms was studied in connection with the proposed Dickey-Lincoln School dams to be built in that area, and significantly, it was found that creditable flood hydrographs could be generated from LANDSAT DCP data in spite of the voids caused by the satellite being below the horizon...|$|R
40|$|Veggie {{is a small}} {{plant growth}} chamber {{designed}} and built by ORBITEC that will fly to the International Space Station on SpaceX- 3, scheduled for the summer of 2013. Ultimately Veggie {{will be used for}} research, education and outreach, and crew recreation. We want to demonstrate the functionality of this hardware by testing a scenario that could allow the crew to grow and consume fresh vegetables. Veggie will be collapsed and transported flat in a cargo transfer bag, and deployed on orbit, where it will be installed in an EXPRESS rack. The chamber consists of three subsystems: an LED light cap, a transparent bellows, and a root mat reservoir assembly. The bellows and flexible support arms allow the distance between plants and light cap to be adjusted for different ages and types of plants. Researchers at Kennedy Space Center and ORBITEC have been working to develop the plant growth interfaces for the proof of concept flight. We have developed a rooting pillow, consisting of a small bag containing media, time release fertilizer, seeds, and a wicking surface to conduct water from the root mat reservoir. Prototype <b>pillows</b> have been <b>tested</b> and results have influenced the design of flight pillows, which will be modified for microgravity from flight-approved materials. Several studies have been conducted selecting species and comparing media types in analog systems. Water content seems {{to be the most important}} factor differentiating media types in these small growth volumes (100 mL). Media type also influenced microbial levels on plants. Since produce sanitizing agents are not currently approved for growing food crops on orbit, plants and media types having very low microbial levels are being selected. Lettuce, mizuna, and other salad greens typically have microbial counts less than 10 (exp 4) colony forming units and thus are good candidates for spaceflight. As we approach flight verification testing, we will finalize species, media selection, harvesting, and microbial sampling procedures. Next steps include testing of Veggie flight and ground hardware and associated equipment. This research was funded by NASA...|$|R
