[...] The adapter connected the console to a cable television wire, doing so {{by the use of}} a coaxial cable output {{in the rear of the}} cartridge. [...] Starting up a Genesis console with an active Sega Channel adapter installed would <b>prompt</b> <b>for</b> the service's main menu to be loaded, which was a process that took approximately 30 seconds. [...] From there, gamers could access the content they wished to play and download it into their system, which could take up to a few minutes per game. [...] This data would be downloaded into the adaptor's on-board 4 MB [...] RAM, and would be erased when the system was powered off.|$|E
500|$|Actor Misha Collins, {{known for}} playing the angel Castiel on the American {{television}} series Supernatural, {{is the founder of}} GISHWHES. The competition began informally in 2010 when Holly Ollis, a publicist for Warner Bros., asked Collins to engage his audience to help Supernatural move from second place to first in the People's Choice Awards voting. Collins posted a message on Twitter, declaring that if the show won, Ollis had promised him a rhinoceros which he would share with everyone who helped by voting for the show. When Supernatural won the competition, Collins, partially inspired by his time at the University of Chicago as an undergraduate during which he participated in the school's annual scavenger hunt, asked his followers to send him self-addressed stamped envelopes into which he put scavenger hunt prompts written on the backs of jigsaw puzzle pieces from a puzzle depicting a rhino. Soon, participants began to respond to Collins's [...] "absurd" [...] requests. One successful <b>prompt,</b> <b>for</b> example, challenged fans to photograph a group of firemen wearing nothing but kale.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{performed}} by Sellen et al. (1997) compared event-based and time-based cues on prospective memory tasks. The experimenters gave participants a place (event-based cue) {{and a time}} (time-based cue) and were told to press a button each time those cues appeared during the study. [...] It was found that performance on event-based tasks was better than performance on time-based tasks, even when participants took more {{time to think about}} their responses. The difference in task performance between the two types of prospective memory suggests that the intended action was better triggered by external cues of the event-based task than internal cues of the time-based task. External cues, as opposed to internal cues, act as a <b>prompt</b> <b>for</b> better performance, making it easier to complete event-based tasks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{setting for}} telling family stories {{becomes part of}} the tradition. It can include the family {{occasions}} where stories are told, the location and <b>prompt</b> <b>for</b> the storytelling, the family members who initiate the session as well as the designated raconteurs and custodians of the stories. [...] Each of these elements needs to be documented along with the stories themselves {{as an integral part of}} the storytelling tradition within this family. In one family following the holiday meal, the men would retire to the study and the women would move into the kitchen. At some point in the cleanup, usually after the best dishes had been washed and put away, the mother would bring out a bottle of schnapps to help complete the work. This became the trigger for family stories and jokes, the laughter from the kitchen frequently bringing the men to join in the storytelling.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Vista changes this by {{introducing}} a privilege elevation system called User Account Control. When logging in {{as a standard}} user, a logon session is created and a token containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, {{and the second is}} a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the Windows shell, are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or [...] "Run as administrator" [...] is clicked, UAC will <b>prompt</b> <b>for</b> confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is {{not a member of the}} administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.|$|E

2500|$|Testing {{is often}} edited due to time {{constraints}} of a televised episode. It can often {{seem as if}} the teams draw results from fewer repetitions and a smaller data set than they actually have. During the Outtakes Special, they specifically stated that while they are, in fact, very thorough in testing myths and repeat experiments many times in many different configurations, it is simply impossible to display all of it during a program. Beginning in the fifth season, episodes typically contain a <b>prompt</b> <b>for</b> the viewer to visit the show's homepage to view outtake footage of either additional testing, or other facets of the myths being tested. However, Savage himself has acknowledged {{that they do not}} purport always to achieve a satisfactorily large enough set of results to overcome definitively all bias. In response to criticisms they receive about their methods and results in previous episodes, the staff produced several [...] "Myths Revisited" [...] episodes, in which the teams retest myths to see if the complaints have merit. These episodes have sometimes resulted in overturning results of several myths, as well as upholding some results for different reasons than originally concluded.|$|E
