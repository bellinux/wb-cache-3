5|$|In India, the Hindi {{version of}} Ra.One was {{released}} across more than 4,000 plus screens worldwide- 3,100 screens in 2,100 theatres, breaking {{the record for}} the widest Bollywood release previously held by Bodyguard (2011). The Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 275 <b>prints</b> and 125 <b>prints</b> respectively. A week before the release, multiplex owners throughout India decided to allot 95% of the total available screen space to the film. Overseas, Ra.One was released in 904 <b>prints.</b> This including 600 <b>prints</b> in Germany, 344 <b>prints</b> in the USA, 200–300 <b>prints</b> in South Korea, 202 <b>prints</b> in the UK, 79 <b>prints</b> in the Middle East, 75 <b>prints</b> in Russia, 51 <b>prints</b> in Australia, 49 <b>prints</b> in Canada and 25 <b>prints</b> in New Zealand and Taiwan. In early October 2011, a partnership deal was being finalised by the distributors to allow the film to be released in China across 1,000 <b>prints.</b> In addition, the film was released in Pakistan and non-traditional territories like Brazil, Spain, Italy, Greece and Hong Kong. The 3D version was released in 550 screens across the world. Ra.One was noted for the extensive use of digital <b>prints,</b> reportedly making up 50–60% of the total release; in India, the film was exhibited in over 1,300 digital theatres, breaking the record previously held by Bodyguard. The wide digital release was implemented to lower distribution costs, make the film accessible to a wider audience and reduce piracy. However, despite the measures taken, pirated versions of Ra.One were available on the Internet within hours of the film's release.|$|E

30|$|<b>Printed</b> {{electronics}} {{device is}} fabricated by several <b>printing</b> methods including the screen <b>printing,</b> gravure <b>printing,</b> and ink-jet <b>printing</b> [5 – 8]. First, screen <b>printing</b> was widely used from long ago {{because it had}} simple <b>printing</b> tools which included stencil and squeegee. However, screen <b>printing</b> is not suitable for fragile substrate due to inevitable contact of stencil with substrate and is not inexpensive because it accompanies large amount of ink. Furthermore, this <b>printing</b> method has a lower resolution than other <b>printing</b> methods. In gravure <b>printing,</b> ink was directly transferred through engraved roll. For this reason, it easily applies to roll-to-roll (R 2 R) process. Gravure <b>printing</b> has benefit of higher throughput because this <b>printing</b> method have advantages such as printable large area and fast <b>printing</b> speed by continuous process. However, a developed R 2 R <b>printing</b> equipment {{can be used by}} ink of one-type and <b>printed</b> structure can be damaged by contact of substrate with roll. Ink-jet <b>printing</b> technology creates a flexible electronics without contact of nozzle with substrate, which produces single droplet contained metal nano-particle through nozzle. This <b>printing</b> method offers relatively lower throughput than other <b>printing</b> methods, because ink-jet printer restricts the number of nozzles and directly draws a circuits of electronics device. However, the resolution is relatively higher than other <b>printing</b> methods, and various substrates are broadly utilized in order to use benefits of ink-jet <b>printing</b> technology. In addition, ink-jet <b>printing</b> provides distinguished advantage such as drop-on-demand <b>printing,</b> no wastage of ink, various functional inks, and non-contact <b>printing.</b> For this reason, research on ink-jet <b>printing</b> technology is required. In particular, RF performance of <b>printed</b> structure has to be investigated in regard to type of substrate because flexible device is fabricated on flexible substrate rather than rigid substrate.|$|R

And it is to improve product quality at the same time. Scope of Screen overprinting in Color film <b>printing</b> The Color film <b>printing</b> process is <b>printing</b> on a hydraulic permeability paper as what the customer requested.
