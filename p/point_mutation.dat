A recent report, showed that, in Sardinian population, the missense mutation Arg282Ser in APOA5 gene, correlates with a decrease in TG levels.

5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains {{of the heavy}} and light chains undergo {{a high rate of}} <b>point</b> <b>mutation,</b> by a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.|$|E
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} of a <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E

Twenty-two deletions extending into cysB but able to recombine with {{at least some of}} the <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> {{were isolated}} on a transmissible E. coli plasmid. Mapping of the <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> against the deletions divided the former into 16 deletion groups. Nine merodiploids were constructed in which the chromosome carried one of the three <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> most distal to the trp operon and in which a plasmid carried one of the three <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> most proximal to the trp operon.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the meiotic non-Mendelian {{segregation}} (NMS) pattern of seven large heterologous combinations located in the b 2 ascospore gene of Ascobolus. The NMS patterns of these aberration heterozygotes widely differ {{from each other and}} from those of <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> located in the same genetic region. They give lower gene conversion frequencies than <b>point</b> <b>mutations,</b> no postmeiotic segregations (PMS), and either parity or disparity that favors the wild type allele. Two related deletions, G 234 and G 40, were studied for their effects on the conversion behavior of closely linked <b>point</b> <b>mutations.</b> We found that, when heterozygous, the deletions impose their own NMS pattern onto close mutations. These effects occur {{on both sides of the}} heterologies. The effects upon PMS and disparity of linked <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> gradually disappear as <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> become more distant. The effects on NMS frequencies and on aberrant 4 : 4 are polar. They persist for all mutations located downstream from the high conversion end of the gene. This last effect can reflect a blockage of symmetric hDNA formation by large heterologies, whereas the epistasis of the NMS pattern of large heterologies over that of closely linked <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> suggests that large heterologies and <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> undergo conversion by means of distinct pathways...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{possible}} mutations that occurs is the replacement of a single nucleotide, known as a <b>point</b> <b>mutation.</b> If a <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> occurs within an expressed region of a gene, an exon, then this will change the codon specifying a particular amino acid in the protein produced by that gene.

25|$|Another {{possible}} cause of microsatellite <b>mutations</b> are <b>point</b> <b>mutations,</b> where only one nucleotide is incorrectly copied during replication.

25|$|Substitution mutations, often {{caused by}} {{chemicals}} or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. These changes {{are classified as}} transitions or transversions. Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C ↔ T). A transition {{can be caused by}} nitrous acid, base mis-pairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as BrdU. Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T ↔ A/G). An example of a transversion is the conversion of adenine (A) into a cytosine (C). A <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene. A <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> can be reversed by another <b>point</b> <b>mutation,</b> in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality).|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described that greatly increases {{the efficiency of}} recovering specific locus <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Founder individuals that were mosaic for <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> were produced by mutagenizing postmeiotic gametes with the alkylating agent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. Under optimal conditions, each founder carried an average of 10 mutations affecting genes required for embryogenesis. Moreover, approximately 2 % of these founders transmitted new mutations at any prespecified pigmentation locus. Analyses of new pigmentation mutations confirmed that most {{were likely to be}} <b>point</b> <b>mutations.</b> Thus, mutagenesis of postmeiotic gametes with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea yielded frequencies of <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> at specific loci that were 10 - to 15 -fold higher than previously achieved in zebrafish.

40|$|<b>Point</b> <b>mutations</b> of {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) {{were reported}} in various diseases. We studied them in patients with alcoholic heart muscle disease (AHMD). In habitual heavy drinkers with heart failure (ten men, mean age 53. 1 ± 8. 2 years, mean daily ethanol intake 119. 5 ± 40. 0 ml, mean drinking duration 30. 3 ± 7. 9 years), right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies were performed. MtDNA was extracted from the specimens and amplified using PCR. Then the total base-sequence was analysed and compared with the wild type. Eight <b>point</b> <b>mutations</b> which cause amino acid substitution were detected among five patients.

25|$|HGPS {{is caused}} by {{sporadic}} mutations (not inherited from parent) in the LMNA gene, which encodes for lamin A. Specifically, most HGPS are caused by a dominant, de novo, <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> p.G608G (GGC > GGT). This mutation causes a splice site within exon 11 of the pre-mRNA to come into action, leading to the last 150 base pairs of that exon, and consequently, the 50 amino acids near the C-terminus, being deleted. This results in a truncated lamin A precursor (a.k.a. progerin or LaminAΔ50).|$|E
25|$|In a mouse FOXP2 {{knockout}} study, loss of both {{copies of}} the gene caused severe motor impairment related to cerebellar abnormalities and lack of ultrasonic vocalisations normally elicited when pups are removed from their mothers. These vocalizations have important communicative roles in mother-offspring interactions. Loss of one copy was associated with impairment of ultrasonic vocalisations and a modest developmental delay. Male mice on encountering female mice produce complex ultrasonic vocalisations that have characteristics of song. Mice that have the R552H <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> carried by the KE family show cerebellar reduction and abnormal synaptic plasticity in striatal and cerebellar circuits.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulation}} of dietary iron absorption {{is complex and}} our understanding is incomplete. One of the better characterized genes responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis is HFE on chromosome 6, which codes for a protein that participates in the {{regulation of}} iron absorption. The HFE gene has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D. The C282Y allele is a transition <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 845 in the HFE gene, resulting in a missense mutation that replaces the cysteine residue at position 282 with a tyrosine amino acid. Heterozygotes for either allele do not manifest clinical iron overload but may display an increased iron uptake.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} {{clinical use}} of fusidic acid is its activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although many strains of MRSA remain sensitive to fusidic acid, {{there is a}} low genetic barrier to drug resistance (a single <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> {{is all that is}} required), fusidic acid should never be used on its own to treat serious MRSA infection and should be combined with another antimicrobial such as rifampicin when administering oral or topical dosing regimens approved in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere. However, resistance selection is low when pathogens are challenged at high drug exposure. An orally-administered mono-therapy with a high loading dose is under development in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{functionality}} of {{a protein}} is {{highly dependent on}} its structure. Changing a single amino acid in a protein may reduce its ability {{to carry out this}} function, or the mutation may even change the function that the protein carries out. Changes like these may severely impact a crucial function in a cell, potentially causing the cell — and in extreme cases, the organism — to die. Conversely, the change may allow the cell to continue functioning albeit differently, and the mutation can be passed on to the organism's offspring. If this change does not result in any significant physical disadvantage to the offspring, the possibility exists that this mutation will persist within the population. The possibility also exists that the change in function becomes advantageous. In either case, while being subjected to the processes of natural selection, the <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> has been accepted into the genetic pool.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the role}} of CKIε within the {{circadian}} clock of mammals was discovered {{as the result of}} a mutation in hamsters. The tau mutation in the Syrian golden hamster was the first to show a heritable abnormality of circadian rhythms in mammals. Hamsters with the mutation exhibit a shorter period than the wild-type. Heterozygotes have a period of about 22h while the period of homozygotes is even shorter, at about 20h. Because of previous research indicating {{the role of}} dbt in establishing period, the tau mutation was found to be at the same locus as the CKIε gene. Thus, this mutation relates to the mutations dbtS and dbtL, which both effect the internal period of the fly. However, it seems that the forces driving these changes in period are different. It was found that the <b>point</b> <b>mutation</b> resulting in the tau mutant decreased the activity of the CKIε kinase in vitro. In flies, on the other hand, the dbtL mutation is associated with a decrease in dbt activity and a longer period. This is consistent with another experiment done on hamsters that showed a lengthening of the period caused by CKI inhibition. To investigate this discrepancy, researchers studied the half-life of PER2 under the influence of wild-type CKIε, CKIεtau, and CKIε (K38A) which is a kinase-inactive mutant. The results indicated that the tau mutation was actually a gain-of-function mutation, instead of loss-of-function, that caused the more rapid degradation of the PER proteins. Therefore, the tau mutation in hamsters can be seen as similar to mutations in dbt that change the internal period.|$|E
