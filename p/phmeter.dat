40|$|Aim of the work. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} erosion effectiveness and fluoride concentration of pure citrus drinks and citrus soft drinks. Materials and methods. 7 pure citrus drinks and 12 citrus soft drinks were considered. In both cases, samples were analyzed for pH and fluoride concentration. The measurement of pH was carried out using a pH electrode connected with GLP 22 Crison® <b>pHmeter.</b> Fluoride concentration was carried out using a selective electrode Crison®. Results. The study demonstrated that both pure citrus drinks and citrus soft drinks show pH values ranged between 3. 6 and 1. 8 and thus lower respect to critical pHs which are expected for enamel and dentine demineralization and dissolution. Regarding fluoride, measurements carried out on citrus soft drinks, generally show an absence of this ion and, only in three cases, concentrations ranged between 0. 1 and 0. 16 ppm. Conclusion. Our data showed that erosive potential of pure citrus drinks and citrus soft drinks is capable of dissolving, in vitro, considerable amounts of enamel and dentine. In vivo, erosion is probably limited from many factors as calcium concentration and saliva buffering effect.

It is well known that, generally, venison contains less fat than traditional red meats, satisfying consumer demand for lean meat, but less are the knowledge about meat fatty acid profile. Therefore, from the carcasses of ten stags, shot during the last 2009 - 2010 hunting season at an age of 18 - 20 months, ten samples of longissimus lumborum were excised at the level of 7 th- 8 th ribs to determine pHu values (<b>pHmeter</b> Hanna pH 211) and fatty acid profile (by gas-chromatography after Folch extraction). pHu values are normal (5. 7 - 5. 8) indicating a good acidification of meat and no effect of stress due to hunting method. Meat fatty acid composition shows values similar to other authors on red deer: total saturated content (lauric, myristic, palmitic, margaric and stearic acids) is equal to 42. 08 %; total monounsaturated (myristoleic, palmitoleic, cis-heptadecanoic, oleic and cis-eicosenoic acids) is equal to 26. 04 %, while polyunsaturated ones (linoleic, α-linoleic, CLA, arachidonic, EPA, DPA, DHA) are equal to 31. 88 %. Polyunsaturated/saturated ratio is 0. 76 and is similar to the findings of other authors for red deer meat.

Even though there are potential benefits in probiotic usage, they have been little explored as an adjunctive therapy in celiac disease. OBJECTIVE This study aimed at the comparison of faecal bifidobacteria concentration and pH among celiac patients and healthy subjects {{before and after the}} daily intake of 100 g of yogurt containing probiotic for a thirty-day period. METHODS Feces from 17 healthy subjects and 14 celiac patients were analyzed, in which stool culture was performed for the isolation and quantification of faecal bifidobacteria. Furthermore, Gram’s method was employed for the microscopic analysis of the colonies, while the identification of the Bifidobacterium genus was made through determination of the fructose- 6 -phosphate phosphoketolase enzyme. Faecal pH was measured using a calibrated <b>pHmeter.</b> RESULTS Faecal bifidobacteria concentration before probiotic consumption was significantly higher in healthy individuals (2. 3 x 108 ± 6. 3 x 107 CFU/g) when compared to celiac patients (1. 0 x 107 ± 1. 7 x 107 CFU/g). Faecal pH values did not show a significant difference. After the daily consumption of probiotic-containing yogurt both groups showed {{a significant increase in the}} concentration of faecal bifidobacteria, but healthy subjects presented significantly higher bifidobacteria concentrations (14. 7 x 108 ± 0. 2 x 108 CFU/g) than the celiac group (0. 76 x 108 ± 0. 1 x 108 CFU/g). The obtained pH values from both groups were not significantly different, being 7. 28 ± 0. 518 for the celiac patients and 7. 07 ± 0. 570 for healthy individuals after the probiotic intake.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate salivary flow rate, pH and buffer capacity in saliva of individuals with CP, aged 3 - 16 years, with spastic neuromotor abnormality type and clinical patterns of involvement. Methods: Sixty-seven individuals with CP spasticity movement disorder, were divided in two groups according to age (3 - 8 - and 9 - 16 -years-old) and compared with 35 sibling volunteers with no neurological damage, divided in two groups according to age (3 - 8 - and 9 - 16 -years-old). Whole saliva was collected under slight suction and pH and buffer capacity were determined using a digital <b>pHmeter.</b> Buffer capacity was measured by titration using 0. 01 N HCL, and flow rate was calculated in ml/min. Results: In both age groups studied, whole saliva flow rate, pH and buffer capacity were significantly lower in the spastic CP group (P < 0. 05). The clinical patterns of involvement did not influence the studied parameters.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the pH {{over a period}} of 168 h and the ionic silver content in various concentrations and post-preparation times of aqueous silver nitrate solutions. Also, the possible effects of these factors on microleakage test in adhesive/resin restorations in primary and permanent teeth were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A digital <b>pHmeter</b> was used for measuring the pH of the solutions prepared with three types of water (purified, deionized or distilled) and three brands of silver nitrate salt (Merck, Synth or Cennabras) at 0, 1, 2, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 h after preparation, and storage in transparent or dark bottles. Ionic silver was assayed according to the post-preparation times (2, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168 h) and concentrations (1, 5, 25, 50 %) of solutions by atomic emission spectrometry. For each sample of each condition, three readings were obtained for calculating the mean value. Class V cavities were prepared with enamel margins on primary and permanent teeth and restored with the adhesive systems OptiBond FL or OptiBond SOLO Plus SE and the composite resin Filtek Z- 250. After nail polish coverage, the permanent teeth were immersed in 25 % or 50 % AgNO 3 solution and the primary teeth in 5 % or 50 % AgNO 3 solutions for microleakage evaluation. ANOVA and the Tukey's test were used for data analyses (&# 945;= 5 %). RESULTS: The mean pH of the solutions ranged from neutral to alkaline (7. 9 ± 2. 2 to 11. 8 ± 0. 9). Mean ionic silver content differed depending on the concentration of the solution (4. 75 ± 0. 5 to 293 ± 15. 3 ppm). In the microleakage test, significant difference was only observed for the adhesive system factor (p= 0. 000). CONCLUSIONS: Under the tested experimental conditions and based on the obtained results, it may be concluded that the aqueous AgNO 3 solutions: have neutral/alkaline pH and service life of up to 168 h; the level of ionic silver is proportional to the concentration of the solution; even at 5 % concentration, the solutions were capable of indicating loss of marginal seal in the composite restorations; the 3 -step conventional adhesive system had better performance regarding microleakage in enamel on primary and permanent teeth.

40|$|Poor (or low) quality {{medicines}} {{remain a}} crucial problem {{of public health}} around the world. They encompass falsified /counterfeit, substandard or degraded drugs. If proportion of 1 % is estimated in developed countries, they are globally about 10 % of counterfeit drugs according to Food and Drug Administration, with 30 % in low income countries and astonishing values (80 %) reported in some African countries. The consequences and dangers of such medicines are therapeutic failure, drug poisoning, microbial resistance or even death. For the pharmaceutical industries, there are loss of image, loss of financial income and employment. There is need to combat this scourge, {{but most of the}} time, means are very limited and even lacking. In this context, several means or tools are developed by the ULg Pharmacy Department including the simple ones including organoleptic tests, simple analytical tests such as analytical balance, <b>pHmeter,</b> thin layer chromatography (TLC), UV-visible spectrophotometry to the more complex including liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to UV-Vis detector, or to mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman imagery (RIM) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy associated with the principal component analysis (PCA). In this way, we have analyzed several suspected samples obtained via the public health authorities of the D. R. Congo, Benin and Rwanda after their seizure or through collaborations. The results are presented by therapeutic class, namely: analgesics: - by using LC and complementary information from victim patients, we were able to discover an abnormal presence of a benzodiazepine at very high doses in paracetamol tablets which was the cause of unusual adverse effects (sedative effects, polyuria and hypotension) in patients who have consumed it; - by using the NIR-PCA, we were able to elucidate the substitution of an excipient (glycerol) by diethylene glycol in paracetamol syrup which caused the death of a hundred babies. antimalarials: - we faced cases of arthemether-lumefantrine tablets which had no therapeutic effect. By means of TLC and LC, the absence of these two active ingredients was clearly demonstrated, but the presence of starch was revealed by RIM; - another case of quinine tablets that had no expected pharmacological effect was faced. The use of several combined techniques (TLC, LC-MS, NMR and RIM) allowed to detect the presence of a substance with an imidazole structure (antamoeba). antibiotics: - the case of amoxicillin powder which after reconstitution in hospital caused poisoning of the babies until death for some was investigated. The reconstitution of the suspension in the laboratory had revealed the misuse of hydrogen peroxide instead of distilled water; - we participated to a large-scale study (80 samples of amoxicillin powder) that showed 8 % of overdose.
