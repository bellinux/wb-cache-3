25|$|Religion {{played a}} large part in the <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, and even {{tolerance}} had its limits faced with the incompatible demands of both camps. As the Archduke closest to the Turkish threat, Maximilian II was to continue his father's policy of tolerance and reconciliation, granting Assekuration (legalisation of Protestanism for the nobles) in 1571, as did Charles II with Religionspazifikation in 1572, while in distant Tyrol, Ferdinand II could afford to be more aggressive. Maximilian II's policies were continued by his sons, Rudolf V and Mathias. The strength of the Reformation in Upper Austria was blunted by internal schisms, while in Lower Austria Melchior Khlesl led a vigorous Catholic response, expelling Protestant preachers and promoting reconvertion. A further concession by Charles II in 1578, the Brucker Pazifikation, met with more resistance.|$|E

25|$|Walter Allen Watson of Nottoway County, was {{the sitting}} Commonwealth’s Attorney {{and a member}} of the Martin machine’s Democratic State Committee; he would later serve at a Virginia Circuit Court Judge. Watson held that the purpose of the Convention {{movement}} in Virginia as endorsed in popular referendum was “the elimination of the negro from the <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> state.” The majority of the Convention quickly followed his lead by adopting a two-stage restriction of the electorate. First, for one year, property qualifications were reinstated, this time allowing any male citizen paying one dollar in property tax to vote, along with any Civil War veteran, or the son of a veteran, blue or grey, white or black. The second step was imposition of a poll tax to be paid for three consecutive years annually prior to voting.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 March Fitzwilliam said in {{a letter}} to Lord Carlisle that it was his removal of Beresford and his friends for their [...] "maladministration" [...] and not Emancipation that was his downfall. Pitt was {{determined}} to use the Bill as an excuse {{to get rid of the}} Whig government in Ireland, spurred on by [...] "secret, unavowed, insidious informations" [...] and breaking the terms of the coalition agreed with the Duke of Portland. The claim that he had breached the agreement was merely the excuse needed to get rid of him due to the resentment by the Ascendancy at their loss of power. He instead claimed his administration had been a success, enjoying widespread popularity amongst the Irish and granted by the Irish House of Commons [...] "the largest supplies that have ever been demanded". Fitzwilliam urged Lord Carlisle to show this to [...] "as many persons as you shall think proper". On 9 March Fitzwilliam {{said in a}} letter to James Adair: [...] "Here I am, abandoned, deserted and given up—an object of the general calumny of administration, for they must abuse me to justify themselves". After hearing reading in government newspapers that his recall was due to Emancipation, Fitzwilliam wrote to Lord Carlisle on 23 March and said that the Catholic question entered for nothing into the real cause of my recall" [...] and that he acted within the bounds of the agreement decided on 15 November. He said repeated requests for instructions to the Cabinet on the bill had been ignored whilst they had responded almost at once to the dismissal of Beresford and his friends. The visit of Beresford to London and the prospect of a [...] "change in system" [...] in Ireland made the Cabinet recall him. The Duke of Portland had been seduced into altering [...] "all his former opinions respecting the <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> country" [...] and he was now Pitt's instrument. Pitt had used the situation to abandon the coalition agreement with the Whigs that the Irish administration be under the Home Secretary, the Duke of Portland. Pitt had resumed control of it and handed it back to the corrupt Ascendancy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to analyse current developments in education through exploring {{shifts in the}} <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> education over time. Rather than looking at education policy in terms of political provenance (left or right) or ideological underpinnings (the state or the market, the public or the private), the paper compares education policies {{in terms of the}} domains of social injustice which they address. Based on Nancy Fraser's theorisation of different kinds of social justice, the paper uses examples from England to show how the <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> education have sequentially attempted to address injustices in economic, cultural and political domains. This has resulted in a changing orientation from a <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> redistribution to a <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> recognition and, in recent years, to a <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> representation. <b>This</b> approach reveals the complexity of educational inequalities and the fragility and incomplete nature of strategies to address them.

A {{plentiful}} fortune is reckoned necessary, in {{the popular}} judgment, to the completion of this man of the world: {{and it is a}} material deputy which walks through the dance which the first has led. Money is not essential, but this wide affinity is, which transcends the habits of clique and caste, and makes itself felt by men of all classes. If the aristocrat is only valid in fashionable circles, and not with truckmen, he will never be a leader in fashion; and if the man of the people cannot speak on equal terms with the gentleman, so that the gentleman shall perceive that he is already really of his own order, he is not to be feared. Diogenes,[394] Socrates,[395] and Epaminondas[396] are gentlemen of the best blood, who have chosen the condition of poverty, when that of wealth was equally open to them.

60|$|The <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{remarkable}} reign {{consisted of}} three branches: to redress the gross abuses which prevailed in the civil government and the revenue, to humble the great barons, and keep the aspiring spirit of the clergy within proper bounds. The introduction of a new law with a new people at the Conquest had unsettled everything: for whilst some adhered to the Conqueror's regulations, and others contended for those of St. Edward, neither of them were well executed or properly obeyed. The king, therefore, {{with the assistance of}} his justiciaries, compiled a new body of laws, in order to find a temper between both. The coin had been miserably debased, but it was restored by the king's vigilance, and preserved by punishments, cruel, but terrifying in their example. There was a savageness in all the judicial proceedings of those days, that gave even justice itself the complexion of tyranny: for whilst a number of men were seen {{in all parts of the}} kingdom, some castrated, some without hands, others with their feet cut off, and in various ways cruelly mangled, the view of a perpetual punishment blotted out the memory of the transient crime, and government was the more odious, which, out of a cruel and mistaken mercy, to avoid punishing with death, devised torments far more terrible than death itself.|$|E

I mention this circumstance to you with horror; for the creditors being in general servants of the Company renders my task, {{on the part of}} the Company, difficult and invidious." [...] "I have freed the sanction of this government from so corrupt a transaction. It is in my mind the most venal of all proceedings to give the Company's protection to debts that cannot bear the light; and though it appears exceedingly alarming, that a country on which you are to depend for resources should be so involved as to be nearly three years' revenue in debt,--in a country, too, where one year's revenue can never be called secure, by men who know anything of the <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> part of India." [...] "I think it proper to mention to you, that, although the Nabob reports his private debt to amount to upwards of sixty lacs, yet I understand that it is not quite so much."
