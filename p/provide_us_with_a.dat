We then deduce from this {{knowledge}} that there is a prime number greater than two.

2500|$|The 100 human genomes to be sequenced in this {{competition}} were donated by 100 centenarians (ages 100 or older) {{from all over}} the world, known as the 100 Over 100.

These centenarians’ genes would <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> window to the past, significantly impacting the future of healthcare. Although the contest is cancelled, the X PRIZE foundation collected blood samples and created cell-lines to preserve the DNA from more than 100 centenarians.

2500|$|Galileo once stated [...] "The {{intention}} of the Holy Spirit is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go." [...] In 1981 [...] John Paul II, then pope of the Roman Catholic Church, spoke of the relationship this way: [...] "The Bible itself speaks to us {{of the origin of}} the universe and its make-up, not in order to <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe.

2500|$|He has refined the {{explanation}} by shifting to {{the example of}} a [...] "Movitype" [...] screen, often used for advertisements and announcements in public places. A Movitype screen consists of a matrix—or [...] "raster" [...] as the neuroscientists prefer to call it (from the Latin rastrum, a [...] "rake"; think of the lines on a TV screen as [...] "raked" [...] across)—that is made up of an array of tiny light-sources. A computer-led input can excite these lights so as to give the impression of letters passing from right to left, or even, on the more advanced forms now commonly used in advertisements, to show moving pictures. Maund's point is as follows. It is obvious that there are two ways of describing what you are seeing. We could either adopt the everyday public language and say [...] "I saw some sentences, followed by a picture of a 7-Up can." [...] Although that is a perfectly adequate way of describing the sight, nevertheless, there is a scientific way of describing it which bears no relation whatsoever to this commonsense description. One could ask the electronics engineer to <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> computer print-out staged across the seconds that you were watching it of the point-states of the raster of lights. This would no doubt be a long and complex document, with the state of each tiny light-source given its place in the sequence. The interesting aspect of this list is that, although it would give a comprehensive and point-by-point-detailed description {{of the state of the}} screen, nowhere in that list would there be a mention of [...] "English sentences" [...] or [...] "a 7-Up can".|$|E

But {{director}} Bala doesn't really capitalize on its strengths, and never pulls you into the story except in parts which is disappointing, as he is among today's trend-setters in Tamil cinema." [...] Malathi Rangarajan from The Hindu claimed that [...] "the intermission leaves you wondering at the frivolousness and facileness of the story that's very much unlike Bala. Nothing much happens in the first hour or so. Thankfully, he makes amends with a riveting climax." [...] A critic from Oneindia.in cited: [...] "Watch the film for the expression of ‘Nava Rasas’ just after the interval bang and the climax scene and you will get a feel that it is a 100 per cent paisa vasool." [...] Chennai Onlines reviewer stated that Bala had [...] "attempted to <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> film that has comical elements as its major strength. He has gone overboard and failed to present it with coherent script. As a result the movie {{turns out to be a}} disappointing experience despite having stunning performances", while Indiaglitz commented: [...] "All said, Avan Ivan is not a typical Bala film, and it has its own dull moments, courtesy cliched scenes and dragging second half. But it also has many ingredients to entertain the masses." [...] CNN-IBN wrote: [...] "Overall Avan Ivan suffers from a sloppy script despite having some fine performances. The lack of balance between Bala's emphatic portrayal of different kind of life and his effort to provide fun is the major problem of the movie. The fun becomes farce and the seriousness turns out to be ineffective." ...|$|E

60|$|All this foreign {{life must}} be {{exterior}} to the aboriginal Spanish life which has so long outlasted the Moorish, {{and is not}} without hope of outlasting the English. I {{do not know what}} the occupations and amusements of that life are, but I will suppose them unworthy enough. There must be a certain space of neutral life uniting or dividing the two, which would form a curious inquiry, but would probably not lend itself to literary study. Besides this middle ground there is another neutral territory at Gibraltar which we traversed after luncheon, in order to say that we had been in Spain. That was the country of many more youthful dreamers in my time than, I fancy, it is in this. We used then, much more than now, to read Washington Irving, his Tales of the Alhambra, and his history of The Conquest of Granada, and we read Prescott's histories of Spanish kings and adventures in the old world and the new. We read Don Quixote, which very few read now, and we read Gil Blas, which fewer still now read; and all these constituted Spain a realm of faery, where every sort of delightful things did or could happen. I for my part had always expected to go to Spain and live among the people I had known in those charming books, yet I had been often in Europe, and had spent whole years there without ever going near Spain. But now, I saw, was my chance, and when the friend who had been lunching with us asked if we would not like to drive across that neutral territory and go into Spain a bit, {{it seemed as if the}} dream of my youth had suddenly renewed itself with the purpose of coming immediately true. It was a charmingly characteristic foretaste of Spanish travel that the driver of the state coach which we first engaged should, when we presently came back, have replaced himself by another for no other reason than, perhaps, that he could so <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> worse horse. I am not sure of this theory, and I do not insist upon it, but it seems plausible.|$|E
