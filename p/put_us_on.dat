When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other.

Iowa quarterback Chuck Long said, [...] "That game didn't <b>put</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> the map, but it was the one that kept us on the map".

2500|$|After the game, Allen {{was cited}} {{as one of}} the main reasons for Duke's {{comeback}} and win by commentators. Mike Krzyzewski agreed, saying, [...] "We were kind of dead in the water.

[...] Commenting on his team's loss, Bo Ryan credited Duke's physical defense saying [...] "There was more body contact in this game than any game we played all year, and I just feel sorry for my guys that all of the sudden a game was like that, and I think they're struggling with that a little bit." [...] Ryan, however, also blamed the officials, citing the disparity in fouls called during the second half (Wisconsin's 13 to Duke's 6) and the controversial replay review near the end of the game.|$|E

[...] These grass roots advocates often begin with a concern about perceived [...] "clusters" [...] of disease. [...] The Newtown Florist Club {{on the south side of}} Gainesville, Georgia was founded by women who pooled their money to buy wreaths for funerals in their community; in the 1980s they began to recognize that there were [...] "far too many deaths due to cancer and lupus in the neighborhood.
