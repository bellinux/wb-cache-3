40|$|Aim To {{determine}} the diagnostic {{accuracy of the}} combination of quantitative capnometry (QC), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> in differentiating heart failure (HF) -related acute dyspnea from pulmonary-related acute dyspnea in a pre-hospital setting. Methods This prospective study was performed in the Center for Emergency Medicine Maribor, Slovenia, January 2005 – June 2007. Two groups of patients with acute dyspnea apnea were compared: HF-related acute dyspnea group (n = 238) vs pulmonary-related acute dyspnea (asthma/COPD) group (n = 203). The primary outcome was the comparison of combination of QC, NT-proBNP, <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> vs NT-proBNP alone or NT-proBNP in combination with <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment,</b> in differentiating HF-related acute dyspnea from pulmonary- related acute dyspnea (asthma/COPD) in pre-hospital emergency setting, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The secondary outcomes end points were identification of independent predictors for final diagnosis of acute dyspnea (caused by acute HF or pulmonary diseases), and determination of NT-proBNP levels, as well as capnometry, in the subgroup of patients with a previous history of HF and in the subgroup of patients with a previous history of pulmonary disease. Results In differentiating between cardiac and respiratory causes of acute dyspnea in pre-hospital emergency setting, NT-proBNP in combination with PetCO 2 <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> (AUROC, 0. 97; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 90 - 0. 99) was superior to combination of NT-proBNP <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> (AUROC, 0. 94; 95 % CI, 0. 88 - 0. 96; P = 0. 006) or NT-proBNP alone (AUROC, 0. 90; 95 % CI, 0. 85 - 0. 94; P = 0. 005). The values of NT-proBNP≥ 2000 pg/mL and PetCO 2 ≤ 4 kPa were strong independent predictors for acute HF. In the group of acute HF dyspneic patients, subgroup of patients with previous COPD/asthma had significantly higher PetCO 2 (3. 8 ± 1. 2 vs 5. 8 ± 1. 3 kPa, P = 0. 009). In the group of COPD/asthma dyspneic patients, NT-proBNP was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with previous HF (1453. 3 ± 552. 3 vs 741. 5 ± 435. 5 pg/mL, P = 0. 010).

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the performance of}} a newly developed examination chair as compared with the clinical standard of assessing internal rotation (IR) of the flexed hip with a goniometer. MethodsThe examination chair allowed measurement of IR in a sitting position simultaneously in both hips, with hips and knees flexed 90 °, lower legs hanging unsupported and a standardized load of 5 kg applied to both ankles using a bilateral pulley system. <b>Clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> of IR was performed in supine position with hips and knees flexed 90 ° using a goniometer. Within the framework of a population-based inception cohort study, we calculated inter-observer agreement in two samples of 84 and 64 consecutive, unselected young asymptomatic males using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and determined the correlation between IR assessed with examination chair <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment.</b> ResultsInter-observer agreement was excellent for the examination chair (ICC right hip, 0. 92, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 89 – 0. 95; ICC left hip, 0. 90, 95 % CI 0. 86 – 0. 94), and considerably higher than that seen with <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> (ICC right hip, 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 49 – 0. 77; ICC left hip, 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 54 – 0. 80, P for difference in ICC between examination chair <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> ≤ 0. 001). The average range of motion (ROM) obtained with examination chair <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> were similar (difference 1. 1 °, 95 % CI – 0. 7 – 2. 8 °, P= 0. 23), and the correlation was strong (Pearson's coefficient, 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 62 – 0. 84).

Topics were wide-ranging and included phenotypic analyses of yeast mutants defective in enzymes of dinucleoside polyphosphate degradation, virally encoded catabolic enzymes, the structure and function of the Fhit tumor suppressor and Fhit-nitrilase fusion proteins and the relationship of Fhit to human diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, site-directed mutagenesis of diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, novel nucleotide analogs for studying hydrolase function, the synthesis of dinucleoside polyphosphates by ligases, and the possible roles of diadenosine tri- and tetraphosphates in insulin function and of diadenosine tetraphosphate in the heat-shock response of Escherichia coli.
