40|$|Archives of German and Dutch {{publishing}} houses {{can provide}} valuable {{information on the}} Dutch-German book trade. One such resource is the archive of the Haarlem publishing house, De Erven F. Bohn, housed at Leiden University Library. At {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century De Erven F. Bohn had several international partners, who <b>published</b> their work <b>on</b> <b>commission,</b> helped with the distribution of their publications, collaborated on projects and were asked for advice. One such partner was Gustav Fischer in Jena, Germany. Johannes Leendert Tadema, who was director of De Erven F. Bohn from 1899 to 1949, worked as an apprentice at Gustav Fischer Verlag before entering the management at Bohn. The personal and professional relationship that existed between Johannes Tadema and Gustav Fischer is apparent in the letters that passed between them and they offer a window into the publishing industry at {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century. This edition focuses on the letters exchanged between Gustav Fischer and De Erven F. Bohn from 1899 until 1909...|$|R
5000|$|On 8 February 2011, {{a working}} paper <b>published</b> <b>on</b> the Competition <b>Commission</b> website, {{entitled}} [...] "Profitability of Sky", said Sky is making [...] "excessive profits" [...] from its Sky Movies service. The media regulator was particularly concerned that Sky's near exclusive control over first-run films from the six major Hollywood studios {{has given the}} firm an [...] "incentive and ability to distort competition". The Competition Commission's preliminary findings published over the summer found that Sky has a case to answer. The commission found that the prices at which Sky wholesales its film channels to other broadcasters is too high, Sky's contracts with the six major Hollywood studios mean no rival operators can afford to risk bidding for them and that Sky prevented BT and Virgin Media from developing a business selling films on demand via subscription by warehousing - or buying without using - the exclusive right to let viewers watch films on demand via subscription.|$|R

60|$|It is {{the fashion}} {{to say that}} the public will have what it wants. Certainly the Public will have what it wants if what it wants is given to the Public. If what it now wants were {{suddenly}} withdrawn, the Public, the big Public, would by an obvious natural law take the lowest of what remained; if that again were withdrawn, it would take the next lowest, until by degrees it took a relatively good article. The Public, the big Public, is a mechanical and helpless consumer at the mercy of what is supplied to it, and this must ever be so. The Public then is not to blame for the supply of bad, false fiction. The Press is not to blame, for the Press, like the Public, must take what is set before it; their Critics, for the most part, like ourselves have been to no school, passed no test of fitness, received no certificate; they cannot lead us, it is we who lead them, for without the Critics we could live but without us the Critics would die. We cannot, therefore, blame the Press. Nor is the Publisher to blame; for the Publisher will publish what is set before him. It is true that if he <b>published</b> no books <b>on</b> <b>commission</b> he would deserve the praise of the State, but it is quite unreasonable for us to expect him to deserve the praise of the State, since it is we who supply him with these books and incite him to publish them. We cannot, therefore, lay the blame on the Publisher.|$|R
