25|$|As {{with most}} rail companies, non-folding {{bicycles}} were banned from peak-time trains {{to and from}} London. However, these restrictions applied only to cyclists boarding or alighting in the area bounded by Hook, Alton, Guildford, Reading and Dorking. The aim was to maximise available <b>passenger</b> <b>space</b> on the most crowded trains.|$|E
25|$|All stops are request stops, {{made only}} on {{passenger}}s' requests. In order {{to leave a}} tram at a given stop, a passenger must push a special button in the tram. This invokes a short sound signal, and a special red indicator lamp is lit in the <b>passenger</b> <b>space,</b> along with a signal lamp on the driver's control panel.|$|E
25|$|The Debonair took full {{advantage}} of the front-wheel drive to allow for lots of <b>passenger</b> <b>space.</b> The cavernous trunk was also designed so as to ensure that two sets of golf clubs could be carried. The new Debonair was a reasonable success; sales in its first full year (1987) were 6230 cars in Japan, compared to a mere 205 of its predecessor in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The Sylvania, {{like her}} sisters, was {{originally}} built {{with a general}} arrangement of three cargo holds located both to aft and forward of the superstructure, the <b>passenger</b> <b>spaces</b> located between them, with tourist class dominating the <b>passenger</b> <b>spaces.</b> Despite {{the dominance of the}} tourist class, her interiors were built to the elegant standards maintained by Cunard on their previous ships. Notable public spaces included a cinema with a balcony and even a soda fountain. The ship was also built with full air-conditioning.|$|R
25|$|Tram nos. 6202 — 6223 were modernized in 1998-2003. The {{interior}} was completely changed, doors were replaced, and driver's cab were completely separated from <b>passenger's</b> <b>space.</b> It is supposed that those trams {{will work for}} 11–14 years more.|$|R
25|$|By contrast, the {{interiors}} of the Île de France represented something new. For the first time, a ship's <b>passenger</b> <b>spaces</b> {{had been designed}} not to reproduce decorative styles of the past but to celebrate {{the style of the}} present.|$|R
25|$|The prototypes of the Mizar {{were made}} by mating the rear portion of a Cessna Skymaster to a Ford Pinto. The pod-and-twin-boom {{configuration}} of the Skymaster was a convenient starting point for a hybrid automobile/airplane. The <b>passenger</b> <b>space</b> and front engine of the Skymaster were removed, leaving an airframe ready to attach to a small car. AVE planned {{to have their own}} airframe purpose-built by a subcontractor for production models, rather than depending on Cessna for airframes.|$|E
25|$|The {{new ship}} {{improved}} upon {{the design of}} Queen Mary with sufficient changes, including {{a reduction in the}} number of boilers to twelve instead of Mary twenty-four, that the designers could discard one funnel and increase deck, cargo and <b>passenger</b> <b>space.</b> The two funnels were self-supporting and braced internally to give a cleaner looking appearance. With the forward well deck omitted, a more refined hull shape was achieved, and a sharper, raked bow was added for a third bow-anchor point. She was to be eleven feet longer and of 4,000 tons greater displacement than her older sister ship, Mary.|$|E
25|$|Some buyers {{lamented the}} small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) {{introduced}} larger cars such as the Toyota Corona MarkII, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda616 and Datsun 810, which added <b>passenger</b> <b>space</b> and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.|$|E

50|$|As a {{semi-rigid}} design it {{was built}} about a rigid keel - though the keel was partially articulated to allow some flexibility. The <b>passenger</b> <b>spaces</b> and control cabin were within the keel. The engines, 400 hp Ansaldos, were mounted outside, angled such that the slipstreams would not interfere with each other.|$|R
5|$|Car types include coaches, dining cars, lounges, and {{sleeping}} cars. Most <b>passenger</b> <b>spaces</b> {{are on the}} upper level, which features a row of windows on both sides. The Sightseer Lounge observation cars have distinctive floor-to-ceiling windows on the upper level. Boarding is on the lower level; passengers climb up a center stairwell to access the upper level.|$|R
25|$|The EC155 B {{features}} a completely redesigned cabin providing 30% more <b>passenger</b> <b>space</b> than previous Dauphin helicopter models, plus a 130% increase in baggage hold volume. Other major improvements include a five-blade Spheriflex composite main rotor {{combined with the}} familiar shrouded Fenestron tail rotor to reduce vibration levels significantly. The EC155 B is powered by two 635kW (851 shp) Turbomeca Arriel 2C1 turboshaft engines mounted over the luggage hold, which feature a dual-channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system. The EC155 B1 features uprated 697kW (935 shp) Arriel 2C2s. The helicopter can be fitted with an anti-icing system to enable the aircraft to operate in very cold climates. The all-glass cockpit is equipped with an 'Avionique Nouvelle' integrated digital flight control system featuring Eurocopter's Vehicle and Engine Management Display (VEMD), which utilizes active matrix liquid crystal displays. The EC155 is also equipped with a four-axis digital autopilot, coupled to the engine FADECs for full-envelope protection, and is offered with a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS).|$|E
25|$|All DT3 {{units are}} {{equipped}} with passenger intercom panels near every door {{in addition to the}} standard emergency brakes and emergency door release handles. Controllers can access CCTV cameras in every unit from the control centre through a Wireless LAN link installed in all tunnels that are used by DT3 trains. Flame-retardant materials are used wherever possible. Temperature sensors and smoke detectors are spread throughout every unit in the <b>passenger</b> <b>space</b> and in every underfloor machinery compartment to detect possible fires as early as possible. Circuit integrity retaining electrical cables (cables that can keep their insulation for a certain time in the presence of fire) are used to allow a unit to proceed to the next station in case of a fire. German regulations mandate that all subway trains must not stop inside a tunnel after the emergency brake has been pulled or if any other hazard like a fire is detected, but instead should proceed to the next station if possible to ease rescue operations. Since the longest travel time between two stations on the Nuremberg U-Bahn is about 3 Minutes (between Ziegelstein and Flughafen) and most stations are less than 60 seconds apart, this is deemed a superior option to stopping inside a tunnel, where evacuation, rescue and firefighting attempts would be much more difficult than on a station platform.|$|E

2500|$|... 1985 saw the Ninety-Eight {{downsized}} for {{a second}} time, this time switching from rear-wheel drive to a new front-wheel drive platform, with sales beginning in April 1984. Although this Ninety-Eight was nearly [...] shorter in length and weighed over [...] less than its predecessor, <b>passenger</b> <b>space</b> was nearly equal to 1984 models. Buyers seemed to prefer this new, more manageable Ninety-Eight, as 1985 model year sales, at 169,432 units, were more than double 1984's 76,833 units, an all-time sales record.|$|E
2500|$|The inside {{design of}} the pods vary by team. Some of the teams are solely {{building}} pods designed for cargo transport. Other teams designed pods to transport passengers, while other designs would allow adjustments {{to be made to}} the pod to allow both, while MIT's team's initial design did not have room for a passenger or cargo and solely relied on the engineering of the pod. The University of Colorado, Denver's team incorporated a removable capsule that allows it to be exchanged for a cargo hold or <b>passenger</b> <b>space.</b> [...] New York University's team has created a vehicle that only allows cargo transportation.|$|E
