5000|$|In Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, 483 U.S. 825 the Court {{reviewed}} {{a regulation}} {{under which the}} California Coastal Commission demanded a lateral <b>public</b> <b>easement</b> across the Nollans' beachfront lot {{in exchange for a}} permit to demolish an existing bungalow {{and replace it with a}} three-bedroom house. The <b>public</b> <b>easement</b> was designed to connect two public beaches that were separated by the Nollan's property. The Coastal Commission had asserted that the <b>public</b> <b>easement</b> condition was imposed to promote the legitimate state interest of diminishing the [...] "blockage of the view of the ocean" [...] caused by construction of the larger house. The Court observed that requiring a dedication of private property in exchange for a building permit was [...] "out and out extortion" [...] unless it could be shown that the private development imposed a burden on public facilities or resources, and the dedication would mitigate such impact. This became known as the [...] "essential nexus" [...] between a legitimate state interest and the permit condition.|$|E

The public has [...] "free and uninterrupted use of the beaches," [...] and property owners are required to seek state permits for building and other uses of the ocean shore.

[...] On January 16, 2014, the Montana Supreme Court, in a lawsuit filed by the Public Land/Water Access Association over access via county bridges on the Ruby river in Madison County, Montana reaffirmed the Montana Stream Access Law and the public's right to access rivers in Montana from <b>public</b> <b>easements.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although traffic {{conditions}} are generally quiet, {{the road and}} street network has a meandering structure and moderate to hilly terrain, which impose some impediment to local walking opportunities. However, the presence of urban borders (verges) on all roadways promote relatively safe walking conditions. There is also a small network of narrow, and generally steep heritage walking paths located within <b>public</b> <b>easements</b> between residential properties. The higher order local streets and the major roads mostly have paved footpaths on one or both sides.

5000|$|Ongoing {{litigation}} {{continues to}} clarify {{the effect of the}} act on beachfront property owners. The Texas Supreme Court {{has made it clear that}} once acquired, <b>public</b> <b>easements</b> do not [...] "roll" [...] when the mean high-tide line changes due to an avulsive event such as a hurricane. [...] The state will own the [...] "wet beach" [...] (any land seaward of the mean-high-tide line), but the [...] "dry beach" [...] (beach that is landward of the mean-high-tide line, but seaward of the vegetation line) may be privately owned, regardless of any pre-existing easements on the beach prior to the avulsive event. However, an easement will [...] "roll" [...] with the vegetation line as long as its movement is gradual/natural and not caused by an avulsive event like a hurricane. Some have criticized the court's decision based on the fact that hurricanes result in [...] "natural" [...] erosion; critics argue that the distinction between what is [...] "avulsive" [...] and what is [...] "gradual" [...] is unclear.|$|R
5000|$|In Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, {{the court}} ruled that an exaction is {{legitimate}} if it shares an [...] "essential nexus" [...] with the reasons that would allow rejection of the permit altogether. In Nollan the court required compensation for a <b>public</b> <b>easement</b> over the dry sand area of the beach as a condition for development, because they found that the easement was not closely related enough to fighting the psychological barrier to beach access that the development would present.|$|E

Ranger safaris teach people what the actual laws are, and educate them on how to safely and legally use these beautiful beaches without trespassing on the complicated property easements. The Malibu Safaris include activities such as a <b>public</b> <b>easement</b> potluck, a lateral easement hike, a sign-watching activity and a no kill access way hunt.|$|E
5000|$|Property rights {{defined by}} {{points on the}} ground were {{believed}} to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before air travel became popular in the 20th century. To promote air commerce, legislators established a legal height for any interests associated with lands; thereby establishing a public right to transit through the higher altitudes. [...] Both the <b>public</b> <b>easement</b> in the space at higher altitudes and a landowner right to exclusive use of the space at lower altitudes have been well documented by the U.S. judiciary.|$|E
50|$|The Oregon Beach Bill of 1967 allows free beach {{access to}} everyone. This bill allows private beach landowners to retain certain beach land rights, but it removes the {{property}} tax obligation of the beach landowner. In exchange, the beach landowner grants an easement passage to pedestrians. The Beach Bill grants a <b>public</b> access <b>easement</b> on the beach that cannot be taken away by the landowner; nor can the landowner build on the beach.|$|R
5000|$|Recreational access may be {{provided}} for through Section 7, <b>Public</b> Access <b>Easements</b> or Appendices which set out [...] "Continuing Recreational Use" [...] for organisations (clubs) within {{the control of the}} Licensee (and with the ability for the licensee to charge for use). In practice, the licensed tree harvesting companies frequently breach these contracts, and LINZ does little or nothing to enforce the licence conditions on behalf of the public, nor rectify these breaches.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{element of}} the tort is [...] "interference". This must be both direct and physical, with {{indirect}} interference instead being covered by negligence or nuisance. [...] "Interference" [...] covers any physical entry to land, {{as well as the}} abuse of a right of entry, when a person who has the right to enter the land does something not covered by the permission. If the person has the right to enter the land but remains after this right expires, this is also trespass. It is also a trespass to throw anything on the land. For the purposes of trespass, the person who owns the land on which a road rests is treated as the owner; it is not, however, a trespass to use that road if the road is constructed with a <b>public</b> use <b>easement,</b> or if, by owner acquiescence or through adverse use, the road has undergone a common law dedication to the public. In Hickman v Maisey and Adams v. Rivers, the courts established that any use of a road that went beyond using it for its normal purpose could constitute a trespass: [...] "although a land owner's property rights may be subject to the right of mere passage, the owner of the soil is still absolute master."British courts have broadened the rights encompassed by <b>public</b> <b>easements</b> in recent years. In DPP v Jones, the court ruled that [...] "the public highway is a public place which the public may enjoy for any reasonable purpose, providing that the activity in question does not amount to a public or private nuisance and does not obstruct the highway by reasonably impeding the primary right of the public to pass and repass; within these qualifications there is a public right of peaceful assembly on the highway." [...] The principles established in Adams remain valid in American law.|$|R
