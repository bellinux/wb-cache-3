2500|$|In 2006, the {{pedestrian}} area surrounding the large stone drinking fountain monument (1874) at {{the centre of}} the village was re-modelled, and given the name 'Fountain Square'. New granite <b>paving,</b> <b>brick</b> planters and trees were introduced in a design which created a haven from traffic and a new focal point for community events. [...] During the refurbishments the old [...] "threepenny bit" [...] bus shelter was moved to Snoxhall behind the leisure centre. [...] The old [...] "threepenny bit" [...] bus shelter had been a popular shelter for the youths of Cranleigh to drink and smoke in. [...] The shelter stood in its new location for only a few weeks before it was vandalised and completely pulled to the ground. The main financial sponsors of this refurbishment were Surrey County Council (SCC) and the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), and the design was undertaken in-house by SCC.|$|E
5000|$|In 1876 Henry {{went to the}} Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia {{and there}} saw the {{original}} stiff mud brick making machine. He became inspired to make paving and fire brick. Henry’s <b>paving</b> <b>brick</b> was the first known use of <b>paving</b> <b>brick</b> {{in the city of}} Canton. Brick pavements then spread quickly throughout the county and state.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exterior}} of the building was clad in <b>paving</b> <b>brick</b> rejects. Walker & Weeks had used uniformly-colored <b>paving</b> <b>brick</b> on the Renkert Building, which it had designed shortly before beginning work on the W. Bingham Co. warehouse. Architect Harry Weeks recommended <b>paving</b> <b>brick</b> for the Bingham building because it was strong, long-wearing, and inexpensive. [...] "Seconds" [...] (bricks which were not uniform in color due to chemical differences, miscasting, or after {{spending too much time}} curing in the kiln) were recommended by Weeks because they created an aesthetically pleasing [...] "tapestry effect which might be assumed to have resulted from careful artistic design, rather than accident and economy." [...] Windows in the building all had steel sashes and wire mesh glass. The roofline was a simple concave cavetto cornice.|$|E

5000|$|By 1908, {{thousands}} of tonnes of clay had been mined [...] "without making any appreciable impression upon the enormous deposit". The works had the latest machinery of that time, with drying sheds for the weeks-long process of drying large fire-lumps that occurs {{after they are}} removed from the furnace. Products the company started to make [...] included <b>paving</b> <b>bricks,</b> garden tiles, and surface drain blocks. The 9 by 9 by 4 in <b>paving</b> <b>bricks</b> were used by the Perth City Council along Wellington Street.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{permeable}} concrete <b>paving</b> <b>bricks</b> tend to {{lose their}} color in relatively short time which can be costly to replace or clean and is mainly due {{to the problem of}} efflorescence.|$|R
50|$|Most brick {{plants are}} {{located near the}} clay source they use to make brick. Bricks are molded and baked blocks of clay. Brick {{products}} come in many forms, including structural brick, face brick, roof tile, structural tile, <b>paving</b> <b>brick,</b> and floor tile.|$|E

5000|$|The {{structure}} is widely celebrated for the inspired use of <b>paving</b> <b>brick</b> seconds, which adds {{color and texture}} to the building. The exterior is considered unusually sophisticated, with [...] "subtle refinements of proportion and detail". It has also won praise for the simple, repetitive piers that bring it to life.|$|E
50|$|Block paving {{also known}} as <b>brick</b> <b>paving</b> is a {{commonly}} used decorative method of creating a pavement or hardstanding. The main benefit of bricks over other materials is that individual bricks can later be lifted up and replaced. This allows for remedial work {{to be carried out}} under the surface of the paving without leaving a lasting mark once the <b>paving</b> <b>bricks</b> have been replaced. Typical areas of use would be for driveways, pavement, patios, town centres, precincts and more commonly in road surfacing. Bricks are typically made of concrete or clay, though other composite materials are also used. Each has its own means of construction. The biggest difference is the way they set hard ready for use. A clay brick has to be fired in a kiln to bake the brick hard. A concrete brick has to be allowed to set. The concrete <b>paving</b> <b>bricks</b> are a porous form of brick formed by mixing small stone hardcore, dyes, cement and sand and other materials in various amounts. Many block paving manufacturing methods are now allowing the use of recycled materials {{in the construction of the}} <b>paving</b> <b>bricks</b> such as crushed glass and crushed old building rubble.|$|R
50|$|Clinker bricks {{are also}} known as Dutch <b>paving</b> <b>bricks.</b> In 18th century New York, the Dutch {{interspersed}} dark clinkers with regular bricks. Some used clinkers to spell out their family initials on brick dwellings such as the Jan Van Hoesen House.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Construction garbage <b>paving</b> <b>bricks</b> {{were made}} of {{recycled}} coarse and fine aggregates which were prepared by the waste concrete. The influence of replacement rate of recycled coarse aggregates, water-binder ratio and excitation agent dosage on the compressive strength and flexural strength of construction garbage <b>paving</b> <b>bricks</b> were researched. The experimental results show that optimum replacement rate of recycled coarse aggregates, water-binder ratio and excitation agent dosage were 100 %, 0. 43 and 1. 5 % respectively. In this proportion, the 7 d, 28 d compressive strength of the products were 15. 6 MPa, 37. 5 MPa respectively, and the 7 d, 28 d flexural strength were 2. 0 MPa, 4. 3 MPa respectively, which fit {{the requirements of the}} Cc 30 level of compressive strength and the Cf 4. 0 level of flexural strength involved in JCT 446 - 2000 "concrete pavers"...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to coal mines, Lehigh {{was home to}} several other industries. The most prominent were brickyards that used the shale of the coal measures {{as a source of}} clay to make both brick and drain tile, firing their kilns with local coal. One of these, the Lehigh Brick and Tile company, won the contract to provide <b>paving</b> <b>brick</b> for Dubuque, Iowa in 1896, but suffered a serious fire in late 1897.|$|E
50|$|Other outdoor {{features}} {{are within the}} historic district boundaries. The Grand Promenade runs in a north-south direction on the hillside behind the bathhouses, between Reserve Avenue and Fountain Street. Construction on the promenade began in the 1930s and {{by the beginning of}} World War II the promenade was a graded pathway covered with gravel. After many false starts due to planning and funding problems the promenade was finally completed in the early 1960s. The <b>paving</b> <b>brick</b> was replaced in 1984.|$|E
50|$|Emporium is a borough and {{the county}} seat of Cameron County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It is located 100 mi west-northwest of Williamsport.

50|$|The Westport <b>Paving</b> <b>Brick</b> Company of Baltimore reopened one of {{the slate}} {{quarries}} from 1913-1937; company records from 1922 show 120 tons of slate and shale being shipped daily. After about 1925, the easy availability of automobiles led {{to the death of}} the railroad. The Ijamsville depot was bypassed, though the actual railroad tracks were still open to non-local traffic. As a result, when the Westport Company's operation closed down in 1937, there were no longer any advantages to mining in a small town like Ijamsville, and no quarry has existed in the town since.|$|E
