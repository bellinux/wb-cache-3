5|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) into the substrate, is frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing behaviour of L.canarium consists {{of a series of}} movements characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal <b>pushes</b> the anterior portion of the foot into the substrate to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where it <b>pushes</b> the substrate with its long, extensible proboscis. Retraction is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle the substrate around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal shell is usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E

5|$|Ajay {{ends up in}} Yuma's {{mountain}} prison, {{from which}} he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother. The Golden Path <b>pushes</b> into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other {{to prevent them from}} starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and <b>pushes</b> on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.|$|E
5|$|Amelia and Kanyenke next {{fight the}} Circle at their last stronghold in Cuba, and, after allying with the Spanish colony of Havana and {{awaiting}} {{the arrival of}} the U.S. Navy, they destroy the Ossuary and the fixed guns guarding it. As the battle is ending, Amelia and Kanyenke pass under an archway in which Beaumont is concealed. Beaumont jumps down and attempts to stab Amelia but Kanyenke <b>pushes</b> her out of the way. All three tumble to the ground. Beaumont charges at Amelia, about to stab her, but when Beaumont gets near, Amelia kicks him and <b>pushes</b> him backwards. He quickly charges at her again, but she grabs her shotgun and shoots him. Amelia later uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company and succeeds in building railroads to the west coast.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pushing</b> is {{a motion}} {{primitive}} useful to handle {{objects that are}} too large, too heavy, or too cluttered to be grasped. It {{is at the core}} of much of robotic manipulation, in particular when physical interaction is involved. It seems reasonable then to wish for robots to understand how <b>pushed</b> objects move. In reality, however, robots often rely on approximations which yield models that are computable, but also restricted and inaccurate. Just how close are those models? How reasonable are the assumptions they are based on? To help answer these questions, and to get a better experimental understanding of <b>pushing,</b> we present a comprehensive and high-fidelity dataset of planar <b>pushing</b> experiments. The dataset contains timestamped poses of a circular <b>pusher</b> and a <b>pushed</b> object, as well as forces at the interaction. We vary the <b>push</b> interaction in 6 dimensions: surface material, shape of the <b>pushed</b> object, contact position, <b>pushing</b> direction, <b>pushing</b> speed, and <b>pushing</b> acceleration. An industrial robot automates the data capturing along precisely controlled position-velocity-acceleration trajectories of the <b>pusher,</b> which give dense samples of positions and forces of uniform quality. We finish the paper by characterizing the variability of friction, and evaluating the most common assumptions and simplifications made by models of frictional <b>pushing</b> in robotics.
