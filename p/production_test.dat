25|$|Pre-production began almost {{immediately}} after Broadchurch was given the green light. Heads for each department of the production—cinematography and lighting, editing, casting, make-up and hair, costuming, locations, administration, sound, etc.—were hired, and research began {{in all areas of}} <b>production.</b> <b>Test</b> footage was shot and screened for ITV executives at a pre-shoot meeting, so they could see more clearly what the series' mood and style would be like. Although ITV made a sizeable financial investment in Broadchurch, additional funds were needed because {{of the cost of the}} large ensemble cast. Additional funds were sought from international partners, who were given distribution rights in their territories in return. Before principal photography began, ZDF (German public-service television broadcaster) and BBC America (the American cable and satellite television network jointly owned by the BBC and AMC Networks) came aboard the production as financial partners.|$|E
25|$|While {{on a tour}} of the United States, Caldwell visited Curtiss-Wright in Buffalo, New York. On August 6, 1942, he {{was invited}} to come on an {{acceptance}} re-flight of a Curtiss C-46 Commando, the latest transport aircraft destined for overseas use. The aircraft was also loaded with Curtiss executives, and flown by Chief <b>Production</b> <b>Test</b> Pilot Herbert O. Fisher. The landing gear became stuck in a three-quarters down position, and after an extended eight-hour attempt to release the gear, Fisher calmly belly-landed the C-46. With the weight of the aircraft gently pushing the gear back into the wheel wells, a minimum of damage resulted. Caldwell had taken over as the co-pilot on the eight hours of circling over Buffalo, receiving certification that he was checked out on the C-46, under the tutelage of Fisher. Finishing his tour at Curtiss-Wright, Caldwell went on to visit the North American Aviation factory and was able to personally evaluate their new P-51 fighter, then in development.|$|E

Throughout this period, improved models of the Pegasus engine were rapidly developed, such as the Pegasus 3 being capable of 15,000lbf (67kN) of thrust. Apart from the improved powerplants, the first four P.1127 prototypes were quite similar; the fifth prototype, XP980, introduced the taller fin and tailplane anhedral which were later used on the production Harrier. The fourth machine was partially used to provide Hawker <b>production</b> <b>test</b> pilots with type familiarisation. [...] The first carrier vertical landing was performed by the first prototype on [...] in 1963. The last P.1127, XP984, introduced the swept wing.

2500|$|The Typhoon did {{not begin}} to mature as a {{reliable}} aircraft {{until the end of}} 1942, when its excellent qualities — seen from the start by S/L Roland Beamont of 609 Squadron — became apparent. Beamont had worked as a Hawker <b>production</b> <b>test</b> pilot while resting from operations, and had stayed with Seth-Smith, having his first flight in the aircraft at that time. During late 1942 and early 1943, the Typhoon squadrons were based on airfields near the south and south-east coasts of England and, alongside two Spitfire XII squadrons, countered the Luftwaffes [...] "tip and run" [...] low-level nuisance raids, shooting down a score or more bomb-carrying Fw 190s. Typhoon squadrons kept at least one pair of aircraft on standing patrols over the south coast, with another pair kept at [...] "readiness" [...] (ready to take off within two minutes) throughout daylight hours. These sections of Typhoons flew at [...] or lower, with enough height to spot and then intercept the incoming enemy fighter-bombers. The Typhoon finally proved itself in this role; for example, while flying patrols against these low-level raids, 486(NZ) Squadron claimed 20 fighter-bombers, plus three bombers shot down, between mid-October 1942 and mid-July 1943.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{improved}} method of back-ground calibration that reduces <b>production</b> <b>testing</b> time of mixed-signal ICs. <b>Production</b> <b>testing</b> time typically consists of “calibra-tion convergence time ” + “functional testing time after calibration convergence”. The method that is proposed here reduces average calibration convergence time. This method {{does not require}} extra ADC operation for functional testing after calibration convergence, and can be implemented with little additional on-chip test-support circuitry when testing is performed by ATE (Automatic Test Equipment). As an application of this method, we discuss background calibration of pipelined ADCs and present simulation results that demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing testing time...|$|R
