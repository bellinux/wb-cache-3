40|$|ABSTRACT The {{response}} to eight generations of selection for duration of fertility of frozen-thawed chicken semen, the correlated responses of other fertility parameters of frozen-thawed semen and the fertility of fresh semen, and the heritabilities of frozen-thawed and fresh semen were studied.

Selection has improved duration of fertility of frozen-thawed semen significantly (P<. 01) with the mean increasing from 1 day in Generation 1 to 5 days in Generation 8 and an average improvement per generation of. 29 day since Generation 3.
