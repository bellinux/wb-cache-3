5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, <b>prophage</b> induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E

Stress can be from starvation, poisons (like antibiotics), or other factors that can damage or destroy the host. In response to stress, the activated <b>prophage</b> is excised from the DNA of the host cell by one of the newly expressed gene products and enters its lytic pathway.|$|E

40|$|Bacteriophages {{are major}} genetic factors {{promoting}} horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between bacteria. Their roles in dynamic bacterial genome evolution have been increasingly {{highlighted by the}} fact that many sequenced bacterial genomes contain multiple <b>prophages</b> carrying a wide range of genes. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 is the most striking case. A sequenced strain (O 157 Sakai) possesses 18 <b>prophages</b> (Sp 1 –Sp 18) that encode numerous genes related to O 157 virulence, including those for two potent cytotoxins, Shiga toxins (Stx) 1 and 2. However, most of these <b>prophages</b> appeared to contain multiple genetic defects. To understand whether these defective <b>prophages</b> have the potential to act as mobile genetic elements to spread virulence determinants, we looked closely at the Sp 1 –Sp 18 sequences, defined the genetic defects of each Sp, and then systematically analyzed all Sps for their biological activities. We show that many of the defective <b>prophages,</b> including the Stx 1 phage, are inducible and released from O 157 cells as particulate DNA. In fact, some <b>prophages</b> can even be transferred to other E. coli strains. We also show that new Stx 1 phages are generated by recombination between the Stx 1 and Stx 2 phage genomes. The results indicate that these defective <b>prophages</b> are not simply genetic remnants generated in the course of O 157 evolution, but rather genetic elements with a high potential for disseminating virulence-related genes and other genetic traits to other bacteria.

25|$|An {{important}} distinction {{here is that}} between the two decisions; lysogeny and lysis on infection, and continuing lysogeny or lysis from a <b>prophage.</b> The latter is determined solely by the activation of RecA in the SOS response of the cell, as detailed in the section on induction. The former will also be affected by this; a cell undergoing an SOS response will always be lysed, as no cI protein {{will be allowed to}} build up. However, the initial lytic/lysogenic decision on infection is also dependent on the cII and cIII proteins.|$|E
25|$|At high {{concentrations}} of cI, the dimers will also bind to operators OL1 and OL2 (which are over 2 kb downstream from the R operators). When cI dimers are bound to OL1, OL2, OR1, and OR2 a loop is induced in the DNA, allowing these dimers to bind together to form an octamer. This is a phenomenon called long-range cooperativity. Upon formation of the octamer, cI dimers may cooperatively bind to OL3 and OR3, repressing transcription of cI. This autonegative regulation ensures a stable minimum concentration of the repressor molecule and, should SOS signals arise, allows for more efficient <b>prophage</b> induction.|$|E
25|$|Phages may be {{released}} via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, {{in a few}} cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called endolysin, which attacks and breaks down the cell wall peptidoglycan. An altogether different phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as <b>prophage.</b>|$|E

500|$|Release – Viruses can be {{released}} from the host cell by lysis, a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present: This is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses. Some viruses undergo a lysogenic cycle where the viral genome is incorporated by genetic recombination into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a [...] "provirus" [...] or, {{in the case of}} bacteriophages a [...] "prophage". Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. However, at some point, the provirus or <b>prophage</b> may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells. Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by budding. During this process the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane.|$|E

2500|$|The phage {{particle}} {{consists of}} a head (also known as a capsid), a tail, and tail fibers (see image of virus below). The head contains the phage's double-strand linear DNA genome.

Usually, a [...] "lytic cycle" [...] ensues, where the lambda DNA is replicated and new phage particles are produced within the cell. This is followed by cell lysis, releasing the cell contents, including virions that have been assembled, into the environment. However, under certain conditions, the phage DNA may integrate itself into the host cell chromosome in the lysogenic pathway. In this state, the λ DNA is called a <b>prophage</b> and stays resident within the host's genome without apparent harm to the host.

Also the first genome to be sequenced was a bacteriophage. However, bacteriophage research did not lead the genomics revolution, which is clearly dominated by bacterial genomics. Only very recently has the study of bacteriophage genomes become prominent, thereby enabling researchers to understand the mechanisms underlying phage evolution. [...] Bacteriophage genome sequences can be obtained through direct sequencing of isolated bacteriophages, but can also be derived as part of microbial genomes.

40|$|Background: Shiga toxin (stx) genes {{have been}} {{transferred}} to numerous bacteria, {{one of which is}} E. coli O 157 :H 7. It is a common belief that stx gene is transferred by bacteriophages, because stx genes are located on lambdoid <b>prophages</b> in the E. coli O 157 :H 7 genome. Both E. coli O 157 :H 7 and non-pathogenic E. coli are highly enriched in cattle feedlots. We hypothesized that strong UV radiation in combination with high temperature accelerates stx gene transfer into nonpathogenic E. coli in feedlots. Methodology/Principal Findings: E. coli O 157 :H 7 EDL 933 strain were subjected to different UV irradiation (0 or 0. 5 kJ/m 2) combination with different temperature (22, 28, 30, 32, and 37 uC) treatments, and the activation of lambdoid <b>prophages</b> was analyzed by plaque forming unit while induction of Stx 2 <b>prophages</b> was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR. Data showed that lambdoid <b>prophages</b> in E. coli O 157 :H 7, including phages carrying stx 2, were activated under UV radiation, a process enhanced by elevated temperature. Consistently, western blotting analysis indicated that the production of Shiga toxin 2 was also dramatically increased by UV irradiation and high temperature. In situ colony hybridization screening indicated that these activated Stx 2 <b>prophages</b> were capable of converting laboratory strain of E. coli K 12 into new Shiga toxigenic E. coli, which were further confirmed by PCR and ELISA analysis.

2500|$|Just as importantly, {{horizontally}} transferred segments need {{to exhibit}} the donor's genomic signature. This {{might not be}} the case for ancient transfers where transferred sequences are subjected to the same mutational processes {{as the rest of the}} host genome, potentially causing their distinct signatures to [...] "ameliorate" [...] and become undetectable through parametric methods. For example, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a predatory δ-Proteobacterium, has homogeneous GC content, and it might be concluded that its genome is resistant to HGT. However, subsequent analysis using phylogenetic methods identified a number of ancient HGT events in the genome of B. bacteriovorus. Similarly, if the inserted segment was previously ameliorated to the host's genome, as is the case for <b>prophage</b> insertions, parametric methods might miss predicting these HGT events. Also, the donor's composition must significantly differ from the recipient's to be identified as abnormal, a condition that might be missed in the case of short- to medium-distance HGT, which are the most prevalent. Furthermore, it has been reported that recently acquired genes tend to be AT-richer than the recipient's average, which indicates that differences in GC-content signature may result from unknown post-acquisition mutational processes rather than from the donor's genome.|$|E
2500|$|The use of E. coli as the {{experimental}} organism has allowed many generations and large populations {{to be studied}} {{in a relatively short}} period of time. Moreover, due to the long use of E [...]coli as a principle model organism in molecular biology, a wide array of tools, protocols, and procedures were available for studying changes at the genetic, phenotypic, and physiological levels. The bacteria can also be frozen and preserved while remaining viable. This has permitted the creation of what Lenski describes as a [...] "frozen fossil record" [...] of samples of evolving populations that can be revived at any time. This frozen fossil record allows populations to be restarted in cases of contamination or other disruption in the experiment, and permits the isolation and comparison of living exemplars of ancestral and evolved clones. Lenski chose an E. coli strain that reproduces only asexually, lacks any plasmids that could permit bacterial conjugation, and has no viable <b>prophage.</b> As a consequence, evolution in the experiment occurs only by the core evolutionary processes of mutation, genetic drift, and natural selection. This strict asexuality also means that genetic markers persist in lineages and clades by common descent, but cannot otherwise spread in the populations.|$|E

In eukaryotes, the DNA bending is related to chromatin structure and nucleosome positioning. However, the physiological role of strong sequence periodicity detected in many prokaryotic genomes is not clear. Results We developed measures of intensity and persistency of DNA curvature-related sequence periodicity and applied them to prokaryotic chromosomes and phages. The results indicate that strong periodic signals present in chromosomes are generally absent in phage genomes.
