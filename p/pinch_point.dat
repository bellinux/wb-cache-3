5|$|By 1910, {{there were}} 18 daily {{services}} along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut {{was built in}} the 1910s at the east end of the eastbound platform, but this was removed some ten years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate and cigarettes, and issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, now up to 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat this latter problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station – east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish level crossing on 26 May 1925. The station itself however remained a two-track <b>pinch</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{occurrence}} of π in the Mandelbrot set {{was discovered by}} David Boll in 1991. He found that {{when looking at the}} pinch points of the Mandelbrot set, the number of iterations needed for the point (−3/4, ε) before escaping, multiplied by ε, was equal to π. Based on this initial finding, Aaron Klebanoff developed a further test near another <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> (1/4 + ε, 0) in the Mandelbrot set and found that the number of iterations times the square root of ε was equal to π.|$|E
50|$|The pinched torus {{is perhaps}} the {{simplest}} parametrization of the klein bottle in both three and four dimensions. It's a torus that, in three dimensions, flattens and passes through itself on one side. Unfortunately, in three dimensions this parametrization has two <b>pinch</b> <b>points,</b> which makes it undesirable for some applications.

We develop a theory which establishes the fate of the <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> at low and high temperature, for hard and soft spins, for short- and long-ranged (dipolar) interactions, as well as in the presence of disorder. We find that their detailed shape can be used to read off the relative sizes of entropic and magnetic Coulomb interactions of monopoles in spin ice, and we resolve the question why <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> have been experimentally observed for Ho_ 1. 7 Y_ 0. 3 Ti_ 2 O_ 7 even at high temperature in the presence of strong disorder.

25|$|In 2008, Alberta {{completed}} a functional planning {{study to determine}} the best course of action for upgrades to the incomplete interchange of Glenmore Trail and Deerfoot Trail. The interchange carries 130,000 vehicles per day on Deerfoot Trail and 100,000 vehicles on Glenmore {{making it one of the}} busiest interchanges in Alberta, but there is no direct access for traffic turning from northbound Deerfoot to westbound Glenmore. Traffic must first exit to the east, proceed through a traffic light behind Calgary Auto Mall, and enter Glenmore Trail from the north side. Stage1 of the proposed improvements would not remedy this problem, but rather correct a <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> on Deerfoot Trail by constructing a new three lane bridge to carry the northbound lanes over Glenmore. Ultimately, a large cloverstack interchange is planned with north-west and east-north flyovers to provide free-flowing access to and from Deerfoot Trail, but it will require acquisition of land from adjacent properties. The plans also call for widening of Glenmore Trail to as many as 10 lanes between Blackfoot and Deerfoot, modifications of the interchange at Blackfoot Trail, and braided ramps.|$|E

[...] Being a lowest bridging point of a critical prehistoric military route compounds the problem- towns had to built above the flood plain at a <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> and flat land on the Rochester {{side of the river}} was needed for a walled town with castle and cathedral, in effect sterilising the land that side of the river from future major development.The land was locked by the construction of the London, Chatham and Dover railway in an embankment and arches. Small shops grew up around The Angel,in Strood forming the town centre. Further small rows were built within the housing, along Gun Lane, at Darnley Road.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this note}} we {{construct}} strange attractors {{in a class}} of skew product dynamical systems. A dynamical system of the class is a bundle map of a trivial bundle whose base is a compact metric space and the fiber is the non-negative half real line. The map on the base is a homeomorphism preserving an ergodic measure. The fiber maps either are strictly monotone and strictly concave or collapse at zero (<b>pinching</b> condition). The <b>points</b> on the base space whose fibers collapse are the <b>pinched</b> <b>points</b> of the skew product. We also assume that the set of <b>pinched</b> <b>points</b> has zero measure, {{and that there is a}} <b>pinched</b> <b>point</b> whose orbit is dense in the base space. Moreover, we assume that the zero-section is a super-repeller, in the sense that it is invariant and its Lyapunov exponent is +∞. For such a skew product dynamical system, we prove the existence of a measurable but non-continuous invariant graph, whose Lyapunov exponent is negative. We will refer to such an object as a strange attractor. Since the dynamics on the strange attractor is the one given by the base homeomorphism, we will say that it is a strange chaotic attractor or a strange non-chaotic attractor depending on the fact that the dynamics on the base is chaotic or non-chaotic. 1...|$|R
40|$|In synthesizing optimal heat {{recovery}} networks, Composite Curve (CC) plots and Problem Table Algorithms (PTAs) {{have been the}} most popular tools for determining the minimum energy targets, whereas Grid Diagrams (GDs) have been widely utilized for heat exchanger network (HEN) design. However, CCs are cumbersome to construct. Additionally, PTAs offer numerical advantages but little insight into the impact of process streams on <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> and {{heat recovery}} bottlenecks. Meanwhile, GDs are separately needed to diagnose HEN pinch rule violations. This paper introduces the Grid Diagram Table (GDT) as an alternative tool for determining <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> and utility targets {{as well as for the}} retrofitting of HEN. The GDT combines numerical and visualization advantages into a single diagram. The GDT, which is represented according to a stream interval temperature scale and is developed based on fundamental Composite Curve geometry, can provide vital information during the identification of the <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> and energy targets of a process as well as enhance the intuitive visualization of pinch rule violations that are especially useful for the rapid and effective debottlenecking of an existing heat recovery system to maximize its thermal energy efficiency. This paper also demonstrates the application of the GDT in addressing a single-pinch problem, multiple-pinch problem and an industrial case study involving a palm oil refinery...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} origin of spin {{correlations}} observed in neutron scattering experiments on the paramagnetic phase {{of a number of}} frustrated spinel compounds, most notably ZnCr 2 O 4.

Second, they are very different from those calculated for the nearest neighbour Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet, in which Coulomb phase correlations generate sharp scattering features known as <b>pinch</b> <b>points.</b> Using large-$n$ calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that very weak further neighbour exchange interactions can account for both the apparent formation of clusters and the suppression of <b>pinch</b> <b>points.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, published version.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unifying approach for a reliable calculation of all azeotropes and <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> for homogeneous and heterogeneous non-reactive mixtures. The approach builds on a reformulation of the pinch-equation system and an efficient continuation algorithm including bifurcation analysis. The calculation of azeotropes {{is based on}} an analogy of univolatility curves and the pinch branches for pure component products. The resulting method can efficiently and reliably calculate all homogeneous and heterogeneous non-reactive azeotropes. The only exception would be the existence of isolated univolatility curves inside the composition space, which to the best knowledge of the authors has never been reported. Since the method can further determine the pinch branches and <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> based on the knowledge of the azeotropes, it {{presents a}} self-contained method for calculation of the most important information on nonideal multicomponent mixtures to support process synthesis. The application of the method is illustrated by means of several complex mixtures...|$|R
40|$|We study {{singularity}} {{formation in}} the lubrication model for the unforced Hele-Shaw system, describing the breaking in two of a fluid droplet confined between two narrowly spaced glass plates.
