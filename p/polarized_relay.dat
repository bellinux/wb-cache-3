2500|$|In 1952, Jewell James Ebers from Bell Labs {{developed}} a prototype solid-state analog of thyratron â€“ a four-layer transistor, or thyristor. William Shockley simplified its design to a two-terminal [...] "four-layer diode" [...] (Shockley diode) and attempted its industrial production. Shockley {{hoped that the}} new device will replace the <b>polarized</b> <b>relay</b> in telephone exchange; however, the reliability of Shockley diodes was unacceptably low, and his company went into decline.|$|E
50|$|A <b>polarized</b> <b>relay</b> {{places the}} {{armature}} between the poles {{of a permanent}} magnet to increase sensitivity. Polarized relays were used in middle 20th Century telephone exchanges to detect faint pulses and correct telegraphic distortion. The poles were on screws, so a technician could first adjust them for maximum sensitivity and then apply a bias spring to set the critical current that would operate the relay.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} {{the performance of the}} electric drive of the tank turret device is developed, using an electronic circuit in place of the <b>polarizing</b> <b>relay.</b> This system is designed according to the theory of electronic optimal regulation. Tests proved the improvement to be quite effective. The Volume of the sample product employed in this method is smaller and its price is lower. </span...|$|R
25|$|By {{use of a}} {{permanent}} magnet in the magnetic circuit, a relay {{can be made to}} respond to current in one direction differently from in another. Such <b>polarized</b> <b>relays</b> are used on direct-current circuits to detect, for example, reverse current into a generator. These relays can be made bistable, maintaining a contact closed with no coil current and requiring reverse current to reset. For AC circuits, the principle is extended with a polarizing winding connected to a reference voltage source.|$|R
50|$|The {{stepping}} switch transmitted the traction current to the motors, which were connected in series circuit. The flat track {{stepping switch}} was {{mounted on the}} transformer and consisted of 18 steps providing voltages between 237V and 1350V. To suppress sparks during switching, spark switches were used. The switch was operated by a 36V motor powered by a battery. To operate the step switches the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle, later changed to a horizontal controller. These controllers drove two <b>polarized</b> <b>relays,</b> which switched up until the requested step was reached.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interrupter}} bell {{evolved from}} various oscillating electromechanical mechanisms which were devised following {{the invention of}} the electromagnet by William Sturgeon in 1823. [...] One of the first was the oscillating electric wire invented by James Marsh in 1824. [...] This consisted of a wire pendulum dipping into a mercury trough, suspended between the poles of an electromagnet. When current was passed through the wire, the force of the magnet made the wire swing sideways, out of the mercury, which broke the current to the magnet, so the wire fell back. The modern electric bell mechanism had its origin in vibrating [...] "contact breaker" [...] or interrupter mechanisms devised to break the primary current in induction coils. Vibrating [...] "hammer" [...] interrupters were invented by Johann Philipp Wagner (1839) and Christian Ernst Neeff (1847), and was developed into a buzzer by Froment (1847). [...] John Mirand around 1850 added a clapper and gong to make the standard electric bell for use as a telegraph sounder. Other types were invented around that time by Siemens and Halske and by Lippens. [...] The polarized (permanent magnet) bell used in telephones, which appeared about 1860, had its beginning in the <b>polarized</b> <b>relay</b> and telegraph developed by Werner Siemens around 1850.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analogue computer simulation of an on-off pneumatic servomechanism comprising a <b>polarized</b> <b>relay</b> with dead zone and hysteresis, power relays, and an on-off four-way spool valve supplying air to a cylinder driving an inertia load acted upon by viscous damping and Coulomb friction. The effect of varying {{the amount of}} friction and of position, velocity, and acceleration feedback is studied. The effect of the addition of stabilizing tanks is also considered...|$|E
5000|$|Hall's {{response}} to this (for them) dire situation was to buy the 1918 filed patents from one Mr. Blake for his [...] "Searchlight" [...] signal. In reality, the searchlight signal was an updated and modernized variation of the old Hall enclosed disc signal. What Blake had done was to harness the standard railroad three position <b>polarized</b> vane <b>relay,</b> add a miniature spectacle and Pyrex, low expansion Borosilicate glass roundels, and couple that with a very efficient elliptical reflector and optical lens system with a very large 10-1/2 diameter stepped outer lens. This revolutionary development, provided a signal with a visible indication of over {{a mile from the}} signal in broad daylight, when the signal was located on tangent track. The early color light signals were visible for only about half that distance (2,500 feet) while using about the same current consumption, then a major concern in [...] "Primary Battery Territory." [...] By 1925, the development of [...] "High Transmission Colors" [...] of railroad glassware by Churchill and Corning Glass improved this limited distance to an acceptably competitive 3,500 feet on tangent track.|$|R
40|$|The {{motional}} Stark effect (MSE) diagnostic on Alcator C-Mod uses an in-vessel {{optical system}} (five lenses and three mirrors) to <b>relay</b> <b>polarized</b> light to an external polarimeter because port access limitations on Alcator C-Mod preclude a direct {{view of the}} diagnostic beam. The system experiences unacceptable, spurious drifts of order several degrees in measured pitch angle {{over the course of}} a run day. Recent experiments illuminated the MSE diagnostic with polarized light of fixed orientation as heat was applied to various optical elements. A large change in measured angle was observed as two particular lenses were heated, indicating that thermal-stress-induced birefringence is a likely cause of the spurious variability. Several new optical designs have been evaluated to eliminate the affected in-vessel lenses and to replace the focusing they provide with curved mirrors; however, ray tracing calculations imply that this method is not feasible. A new approach is under consideration that utilizes in situ calibrations with in-vessel reference polarized light sources. 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
