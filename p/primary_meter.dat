40|$|This thesis {{addressed}} {{the need for}} improved analysis and interpretation of <b>primary</b> <b>meter</b> half-hourly energy consumption data. The current work offers a novel benchmarking technique that was tested for 6 types of municipal buildings. This approach is different from conventional annual benchmarking mainly because it uses electricity and gas data in half-hourly periods, together with outside temperature data. A survey to European local authorities’ metering and monitoring practices was conducted {{in order to assess}} municipal energy managers' current procedures and needs in terms of data analysis to assess building energy performance and to identify potential energy saving opportunities. The benchmarking approach was developed considering the energy managers’ needs, but also the state-of the art in terms of building energy monitoring techniques, particularly building energy signatures, and the analysis techniques used on electricity grid demand forecasting. The benchmarking approach is based on the use of a metric composed of several indicators that are related to the load demand shape profile and the building energy signature. The comparison of indicators for buildings of the same type using standard scores identifies uncommon load demand profile characteristics and/or gas dependency on outside temperature in specific buildings. The metric is able to support the identification of potential energy wastage, which is linked to the detection of opportunities to save energy. The benchmarking technique was tested in 81 municipal building owned by Leicester City Council. This methodology can be applied to any non-domestic building equipped with primary meters for registering half-hourly electricity and gas consumption. In theory, this approach can also be applied to residential buildings, and to other short time series data types, for example quarter-hourly or 10 minutes interval data. The main contribution of this thesis is to improve the objectivity of building <b>primary</b> <b>meter</b> half-hourly electricity and gas consumption data analysis and interpretation by using quantitative parameters, instead of subjective visualisation techniques. The interpretation of building consumption data in short time series periods can now be streamlined, automated and perhaps incorporated in existing energy analysis software. This thesis raises questions that can lead to future research projects aiming to improve the metric and also to enlarge the scope of its application to national and European scale, to other building types and to other utilities...|$|E

It {{is designed to}} have a combination of sensitivity, foreground mitigation, and rejection of systematic errors {{to search for the}} B-mode signature of Inflationary gravity waves over much of the parameter range suggested by simple power-law Inflation models. POLARBEAR is designed to detect a gravitational-wave signature with a tensor-to-scalar ratio r as low as 0. 025 (95 % confidence). POLARBEAR will also measure polarized lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background which will give valuable information on large-scale structure at z> 1 and bound the total mass of the neutrinos. POLARBEAR will have a 3. 5 meter <b>primary</b> <b>meter</b> giving it an angular resolution of 3. 0 ' at its main observation frequency band centered at 150 GHz. The 250 mK focal plane design contains 637 dual-polarization pixels (1274 bolometers) that are coupled to the telescope using microlithographed planar antennas. The experiment will be sited in the Atacama Desert in Chile at 5000 meter (16, 500 ft) altitude starting in 2009 after a prototype testing stage at Cedar Flats California. The first configuration of the experiment will observe at only one frequency band with the first season at 150 GHz and the second at 220 GHz. The optics will be upgraded to have simultaneous observations in those two bands in the third season of observations. POLARBEAR and QUIET will observe the same sky patches, and together they will have frequency bands at 30, 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz giving broad coverage of galactic foregrounds and a valuable cross-check by comparison of polarization maps. In POLARBEAR, polarization systematic errors are mitigated by a continuously rotating 50 K half-wave plate and an observation strategy that takes advantage of parallactic angle rotation to rotate the experiment relative to polarization patterns on the sky...|$|E

50|$|Operation {{begins when}} the controller/timer sends {{a signal to}} the pump to start the lube event. The pump then feeds {{lubricant}} into the supply line which connects to the <b>primary</b> <b>metering</b> valve, for either a preprogrammed amount of time or number of times as monitored through a designated piston cycle switch. Lubricant is fed to the multiple lubrication points one after another via secondary progressive metering valves sized for each series of lubrication points, and then directly to each point via the feed lines.|$|R
50|$|Quadrajet carburetors have {{mechanical}} secondary {{throttle plates}} {{operated by a}} progressive linkage; the primaries open before the secondaries, and use on-demand air valve plates above the secondary throttle plates. The air valves are connected by a cam and linkage to the secondary fuel metering rods. As the airflow increases through the secondary bores, the air valves are pushed down, rotating a cam that lifts the secondary metering rods. The secondary rods are tapered {{in a similar fashion}} to the <b>primary</b> <b>metering</b> rods, effectively increasing the size of the fuel metering holes as the rods are lifted and delivering more fuel. Therefore, the position of the air valve will control both fuel and air flow through the secondary venturis, even if the secondary throttle plates are fully opened. Thus the Quadrajet acts like a vacuum-secondary carburetor and only delivers more fuel as it is needed.|$|R

Most Quadrajets use a vacuum operated piston to move the <b>primary</b> <b>metering</b> rods to control the air-fuel ratio, allowing the mixture to be lean under low load conditions and rich during high load conditions.

The electronic versions have a throttle position sensor that is mounted inside the carburetor body, actuated by the accelerator pump lever.|$|R

40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas {{reservoirs}} {{the knowledge}} of the produced volumes of oil, gas and water from single well is important for efficiency and performance monitoring. Conventional metering systems require a two or three phase separator, followed by independent metering device for each phase. This systems need expensive and cumbersome test separators, high maintenance and field personnel intervention. They require also regular intervention by trained personnel and cannot provide continuous well monitoring. A viable and functional alternative to multiphase separators are Multiphase Flow Metering (MFM) systems. A Multiphase Flow Meter is a device to simultaneously quantify oil, water and gas flow rates in pipelines. These measurement are generally unmet but vital in the oil industry, that began to develop and use MFM in the early 1980 s especially in the off-shore oil production. The oil companies that give their main contribution to the development of MFMs are BP, Texaco, Shell, Agip and Petrobas. MFM also find a lot of application in the nuclear, food, mining and biofuels industries. MFM applications can help facility production, well testing, reservoir management, allocation metering production, well monitoring for optimization and flow assurance, subsea metering and costs, including minimizing environmental impact. MFM focus is to determinate the flow rates of the individual components (oil, water and gas) without physically separating of the flow stream in each phase. MFM is considered among the <b>primary</b> <b>metering</b> solutions for new field development. Cause the great diversity of oil field conditions, MFMs are required to work under a very wide range conditions of flow rates, gas/oil ratio, water/oil ratio, pressure, temperature, pipe size, viscosity. Hence, it is necessary to study and describe the expected flow regimes from the wells. The biggest obstacle to the successful implementation of multiphase metering is the general lack of understanding of what it is about. Multiphase flow is a complex phenomenon which can be difficulty predicted by numerical simulations. The aim of the present work is to contribute to the MFM improvement. The device studied in this work is a control valve with a measurement system integrated which can measure the flow of each phase in two-phase flow, constituted by liquid and gas. The measuring system consists of a flow meter based on pressure difference measurements on the valve body, that allows to calculate liquid flow rate, and on the internal part present {{in the body of the}} valve, that allows to calculate the total flow. In this way it will be possible to calculate liquid and gas flow rates. The device should have a good accuracy. This focus have been set on an error less than ± 10 %...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{potential}} energy savings {{due to the}} application of power managed PCS, monitors, and workstations. The basis of this effort includes electric metering of such equipment at six preliminary and one primary location, a large business office in Boston, Massachusetts. Metering there occurred over an 8 week period, using an in-line metering device, and at a resolution of one minute intervals. The {{results of this study}} show that many problems exist in the field today which prevent any energy savings from being realized. These include both software and hardware incompatibilities. It was found that either the equipment was not enabled from the beginning; that various problems caused inadvertent disabling of the energy saving features, or that lack of knowledge about specific power management techniques caused the user to intentionally disable the features. Since this work began, the EPA's Energy Star Computers and Monitors Program updated their requirements such that energy saving features are now enabled when they are shipped from the manufacturer. All computers tested in this investigation were installed before the application of this condition, which was October 1, 1995. However, many problems exist other than those remedied by this requirement, including: computers which disengage from the network environment upon entering the lowest power management levels, various software incompatibilities, problematic methods of achieving power reduction, and little to no training of users or even prior negative experiences with power managed equipment There is a need for manufacturers to develop suitable or standard methods of achieving power management In addition, computer procurement employees or users must be taught about power management methods, and must have an opportunity to voice questions or concerns to manufacturers regarding power managed equipment. More research needs to be focused on network incompatibilities. Specifically, many computers are disconnected from their network upon engaging the lowest power level. This is due to either unacceptable power management methods or "stand-alone" power manageable computers which are placed on a network. Users purchasing computers intended for network use should be informed about whether the energy saving features are compatible with their type of network.

FBG is a thermo-chemical method for converting solid biomass to a gaseous fuel, termed syngas. Several instrumentation and control issues were particularly challenging with this pilot plant, including development of the fuel feeding system, pressure measurement of high temperature fluids, and metering of steam as a process reactant. The fuel feeding system was tested using MBM (meat and bone meal) to determine the output rate stability, and predictability and measurability of the system as the components in the fuel feeding system were integrated. The fuel feeding system that was tested included a 150 mm <b>primary</b> <b>metering</b> screw conveyor, a 150 mm rotary airlock, and a 50 mm secondary injection screw conveyor. Each component of the system was fitted with a 3 -phase electric motor and a variable speed drive {{to allow for a}} variable output rate. The weighing system that was integral to the metering conveyor was tested as well, but upon pressurizing the metering conveyor and hopper, the weighing system sustained an unreasonable amount of noise. Integrating a pneumatic injection nozzle with the injection conveyor was found to work effectively both under ambient temperatures and hot FBG conditions up to 725 oC. Above 725 oC, {{it was found that the}} test fuel would char and coat the nozzle, causing it to plug. Testing of the feeding system with the injection nozzle removed illustrated that the system could work well without it. It was determined that the injection conveyor speed to metering conveyor speed ratio that should be used for this system was 1 : 110 for absolute rotational speeds, or 1 : 1 of the full conveyor speeds. The complete system, including the injection nozzle, was analyzed and determined to produce a fuel output rate (FS) for % speeds from 5 - 25 %, which roughly corresponded to the desired plant fuel feed rate of 1 - 5 g/s. Techniques for remote pressure measurement of {{fluidized bed}}s were examined as well, including the use of long tubes to cool hot gases and filters for blocking solid particles. The pressure measurement delay of these techniques was examined in comparison to a direct local measurement. This was conducted by comparing the pressure readings from two identical sensors; one mounted directly to a manifold, and the other mounted via a variable assembly (comprised of a variable length of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 ") PE tubing and a porous plate filter). Assemblies without a porous plate were found to have a minimal delay of up to 0. 303 seconds for 30 m length of PE impulse tubing. More significant delays were found for systems using both a 10 media grade porous plate filter and impulse tubing; a 3 m tube length with filter has a delay of up to 0. 221 s, and a 30 m impulse tube combined with the filter has a measurement delay of up to 1. 915 s, a significant delay in cases where high-frequency analysis of pressure is used for bed agglomeration prediction, or systems where fast response is required to changing pressure conditions. Additionally, a steam flow measurement system using an orifice plate and differential pressure sensor was installed and calibrated. By collecting time-based steam samples and process data, the physical system coefficients were determined for this system, allowing for steam flow measurement, accurate within 5 % over a flow range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 g/s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCharacterization Of High-Stroke High-Aspect Ratio Micro Electro Mechanical Systems Deformable Mirrors For Adaptive OpticsMohamed Amine BouchtiAdaptive optics MEMS {{deformable}} mirror, {{in conjunction}} with Shack Hartman wave front sensor and real-time controller, is capable of correcting time-varying aberrations in imaging applications through manipulating its mirror surface. Adaptive optics systems in astronomy for next generation large telescopes (30 <b>meter</b> <b>primary</b> mirrors) require a high stroke of 10 &# 956;m of mechanical displacement. This required stroke would be achieved by MEMS deformable mirrors fabricated with high aspect ratio techniques. This thesis will review the designs of various types of high aspect actuators consisting of folded springs with rectangular and circular membranes as well as X-beam actuators. Finite element analysis (FEA) simulations of these designs have shown the ability of each design to achieve a stroke of approximately 9. 4 µm. Also, FEA simulations proved that the X-beam actuators provide the best spring support while preventing tilting. In addition, this thesis will discuss device characterization and voltage vs. displacement test results for the high aspect ratio gold MEMS 16 x 16 X-beam actuators deformable mirror that has been bonded and packaged. The results {{have shown that the}} device is capable of achieving approximately 5. 5 µm in individual actuator testing and 7 µm in dual actuator testing...|$|R
40|$|Isolated {{population}} III {{stars are}} postulated to exist at approximately z= 10 - 30 and may attain masses up {{to a few}} hundred solar masses. The James Webb Space telescope (JWST) is the next large space based infrared telescope and is scheduled for launch in 2014. Using a 6. 5 <b>meter</b> <b>primary</b> mirror, {{it will probably be}} able to detect some of the first galaxies forming in the early Universe. A natural question is whether it will also be able to see any isolated population III stars. Here, we calculate the apparent broadband AB-magnitudes for 300 solar masses population III stars in JWST filters at z= 10 - 20. Our calculations are based on realistic stellar atmospheres and take into account the potential flux contribution from the surrounding HII region. The gravitational magnification boost achieved when pointing JWST through a foreground galaxy cluster is also considered. Using this machinery, we derive the conditions required for JWST to be able to detect population III stars in isolation. We find that a detection of individual population III stars with JWST is unlikely at these redshifts. However, the main problem is not necessarily that these stars are too faint, once gravitational lensing is taken into account, but that their surface number densities are too low.

40|$|This {{contract}} {{and the work}} described was {{in support of a}} Seven Segment Demonstrator (SSD) and demonstration of a different technology for construction of lightweight mirrors. The objectives of the SSD were to demonstrate functionality and performance of a seven segment prototype array of hexagonal mirrors and supporting electromechanical components which address design issues critical to space optics deployed in large space based telescopes for astronomy and for optics used in spaced based optical communications systems. The SSD was intended to demonstrate technologies which can support the following capabilities; Transportation in dense packaging to existing launcher payload envelopes, then deployable on orbit to form space telescope with large aperture. Provide very large (less than 10 <b>meters)</b> <b>primary</b> reflectors of low mass and cost. Demonstrate the capability to form a segmented primary or quaternary mirror into a quasi-continuous surface with individual subapertures phased so that near diffraction limited imaging in the visible wavelength region is achieved. Continuous compensation of optical wavefront due to perturbations caused by imperfections, natural disturbances, and equipment induced vibrations/deflections to provide near diffraction limited imaging performance in the visible wavelength region. Demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating such systems with reduced mass and cost compared to past approaches. While the SSD could not be expected to satisfy all of the above capabilities, the intent was to start identifying and understanding new technologies that might be applicable to these goals...|$|R
40|$|The GMT is an {{aplanatic}} Gregorian telescope {{consisting of}} 7 {{primary and secondary}} mirror segments that must be phased to within {{a fraction of an}} imaging wavelength to allow the 25. 4 meter telescope to reach its diffraction limit. When operating in Laser Tomographic Adaptive Optics (LTAO) mode, on-axis guide stars will not be available for segment phasing. In this mode, the GMT's Acquisition, Guiding, and Wavefront Sensing system (AGWS) will deploy four pickoff probes to acquire natural guide stars in a 6 - 10 arcmin annular FOV for guiding, active optics, and segment phasing. The phasing sensor will be able to measure piston phase differences between the seven primary/secondary pairs of up to 50 microns with an accuracy of 50 nm using a J-band dispersed fringe sensor. To test the dispersed fringe sensor design and validate the performance models, SAO has built and commissioned a prototype phasing sensor on the Magellan Clay 6. 5 meter telescope. This prototype uses an aperture mask to overlay 6 GMT-sized segment gap patterns on the Magellan 6. 5 <b>meter</b> <b>primary</b> mirror reimaged pupil. The six diffraction patterns created by these subaperture pairs are then imaged with a lenslet array and dispersed with a grism. An on-board phase shifter has the ability to simulate an arbitrary phase shift within subaperture pairs. The prototype operates both on-axis and 6 arcmin off-axis either with AO correction from the Magellan adaptive secondary MagAO system on or off in order to replicate as closely as possible the conditions expected at the GMT...|$|R

40|$|Current {{uncertainty}} {{requirements for}} the measurement of global variables relevant to climate change modeling in the reflected solar range are 0. 5 % to 1 % for solar and lunar spectral irradiance and 0. 5 % to 2 % for Earth reflected radiance. Future uncertainty requirements, as defined by CLARREO mission requirements, include laboratory calibration uncertainties are 0. 2 % over the 500 nm to 900 nm spectral range and 1 % or less {{over the rest of}} the spectral region from 320 nm to 2300 nm. The uncertainties in lamp-illuminated integrating spheres, a principal calibration artifact, ranging from 2 % to 3 % in the visible to near-infrared and 3 % to 5 % in the short-wave infrared, do not meet either current or future uncertainty requirements. NIST uncertainties in broad-band lamp-based calibration artifacts are traceable to primary standard blackbodies.

The SIRCUS facility has demonstrated that moving from source-based scales traceable to primary standard blackbodies to detector-based scales offer opportunities to reduce the uncertainties in disseminated standards.
