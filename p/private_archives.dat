The AJL is a {{national}} effort to preserve and document the unique, rich history of traditional Jewish congregations, individuals, rabbis and communities in the United States from Colonial times to the present. Working with noted academics, educational institutions, public and <b>private</b> <b>archives,</b> regional and national historic organizations {{across the country and}} abroad, the AJL has initiated projects and activities which seek to save this important historical resource and to gather archival information which is in imminent danger of being lost. The AJL also seeks to publicize the role Orthodox Jews played in the historical development of the American Jewish community.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Los Angeles, California, which doubled for scenes set in a 1950s-era New York City. The Palladium Ballroom, a former New York City concert hall, was recreated {{to serve as a}} centrepiece in the film. [...] In {{describing}} the look of the film, production designer Stuart Wurtzel stated, [...] "There are lots of photographs and some film from that period. ... There's a film called Mambo Madness from 1955 with some footage of Tito Puente and Desi Arnaz we looked at, and we got pictures from the Cuban Society in New York and from libraries. The Cuban community has been enormously supportive of the film, so we've also been privy to the <b>private</b> <b>archives</b> of many people." [...] Ann Roth served as the film's costume designer, using vintage textiles to create the custom-made wardrobe. [...] The I Love Lucy segment of the film was filmed at Ren-Mar Studios, the former site of Desilu Productions. The set of the Ricardos' living room was re-created, with film editors intercutting footage with Banderas, Assante and Arnaz, Jr. with an actual episode featuring Lucille Ball." ...|$|E
500|$|Harland and Wolff, the RMS Titanic builders, {{opened their}} <b>private</b> <b>archives</b> to the crew, sharing {{blueprints}} that were thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for {{artifacts from the}} era. The newness of the ship meant every prop {{had to be made}} from scratch. Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunken by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, {{but the rest of the}} ship was just steel plating. Within was a fifty-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. Towering above was a [...] tower crane on [...] of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.|$|E
