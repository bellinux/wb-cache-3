5000|$|After the Congress, deaf {{education}} in America changed. Manualists, those who advocated for sign language usage, were effectively [...] "kicked out" [...] {{and replaced with}} teachers who used the <b>pure</b> <b>oral</b> method. Deaf teachers {{were removed from the}} profession and replaced with hearing ones. Most schools switched to the oral method or were created as <b>oral</b> <b>schools</b> in the first place, and few manual schools remained in existence. The work of deaf educators in the oralist schools, who were mostly women, was to prepare the deaf children for life in the hearing world, which required them to learn English, speech, and lipreading. All students that were sent to the <b>oral</b> <b>schools</b> were forced to use the oral method, and oralist schools restricted the deaf students' use of American Sign Language (ASL) in class and in public. Students in <b>pure</b> <b>oral</b> programs were not allowed to sign in class and were also forbidden to sign in dormitories. Students caught signing were punished, but students continued to learn sign from each other anyway. One type of punishment used on deaf students was to force them to wear white gloves that were tied together to prevent them from using signs. Those who were not successful under the oral method after several years were transferred to manual classes and considered [...] "oral failures" [...] who would never know anything or {{be able to make it}} in the world. Some consider this the [...] "Dark Age of Oralism".|$|R
