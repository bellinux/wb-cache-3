40|$|This paper {{presents}} exact bending solutions of circular and {{annular plates}} under rotationally symmetric loads {{based on the}} Reissner plate theory.

Some illustrative examples in determining the Reissner <b>plate</b> <b>solutions</b> using the relationships are given. These example problems involve circular and annular plates under different loading and support conditions. In order to verify the correctness of the relationships, the results are compared with numerically obtained Reissner plate results and also with Mindlin plate results...|$|R

Disadvantages compared to tank plating can include greater operator involvement (tank plating can frequently be done with minimal attention), and inability to achieve as great a plate thickness.|$|R

Most factories transferred the master matrix after an initial flash of nickel from a slow warm nickel electroplating bath at around 15 amperes to a hot 130 degree nickel plating bath.

40|$|Electroless plating is the {{controlled}} chemical reduction of metals {{without the use}} of an applied external potential. The use of electroless plating has a number of advantages over electroplating including the ability to deposit coatings onto complex-shaped objects which can be metallic or non-metallic, such as plastics. The most widely used electroless coating is electroless nickel prepared using sodium hypophosphite as reductant. This results in coatings which contain phosphorus. The properties of metal coatings containing non-metals are frequently superior compared to those of the pure metal. The first part of present work was concerned with the development of an electroless <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> capable of depositing palladium-boron coatings. The <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> is based on EDTA-stabilised palladium (H) ions in the presence of dimethylamine borane as the reducing agent. At a pH of 10. 5 the solution deposits bright adherent coatings at 1 μm per 10 h. The <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> operates at room temperature within narrow limits of composition and concentration: small deviations in composition from the optimum results in solution decomposition. Characterisation of electroless palladium-boron coatings indicates that the inclusion of boron decreases the corrosion resistance of the coating. Examination of palladium-boron coatings by X-ray diffractometry show that the lattice parameter has been increased by 2. 86 %. The second part of the present work was concerned with the development of pure ruthenium coatings. The <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> developed uses hydrazine hydrate as the reducing agent with methylamine as stabiliser. The <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> operates at a pH of 13 and at 60 °C, and deposits 65 % of the available ruthenium in 5 h. This corresponds to a 3 gm coating over a substrate surface area of 25 cm 2. The coatings produced are bright and adherent. The roughness of the substrate surface was found to be important to obtaining adherent coatings over 2 gm thick. A roughness in the order of 1100 A was found to be satisfactory. Scanning electron microscopy shows the coatings to be dense with no obvious pores. The porosity of the coatings was found to be low, decreasing with increasing coating thickness. However, the electrochemical properties of the coatings indicate that ruthenium coatings have poor corrosion resistance. The chemistry of the <b>plating</b> <b>solution,</b> particularly for ruthenium, is considered in some detail...|$|R

The electrochemical methodology for quantifying the filling performance of the copper <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> is based on the adsorption and mass transfer of chloride ions. The potential difference that was obtained from galvanostatic measurements at two different rotating speeds of a copper working electrode was confirmed to be an effective indicator of filling performance. A larger potential difference reflected better filling performance. The individual contribution of each additive in the potential difference was explored in detail. The leveler and chloride ion concentrations dominated the potential difference, i. e., the filling performance. When the potential difference was larger than a critical value, i. e., 11 mV, the filling performance was higher than 80 %. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.
