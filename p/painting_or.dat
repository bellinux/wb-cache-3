5|$|Big Painting No. 6 (sometimes Big <b>Painting</b> <b>or</b> Big Painting VI) is a 1965 oil and Magna {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. Measuring 235cm × 330cm (92.5 in × 129 in), {{it is part}} of the Brushstrokes series of artworks that includes several paintings and sculptures whose subject is the actions made with a house-painter's brush. It set a record auction price for a painting by a living American artist when it sold for $60,000 in 1970. The painting is in the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen collection.|$|E
5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a <b>painting</b> <b>or</b> events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E
5|$|The symphonic {{poems of}} the Hungarian {{composer}} Franz Liszt are {{a series of}} 13 orchestral works, numbered S.95–107. The first 12 were composed between 1848 and 1858 (though some use material conceived earlier); the last, Von der Wiege bis zum Grabe (From the Cradle to the Grave), followed in 1882. These works helped establish the genre of orchestral program musiccompositions written to illustrate an extra-musical plan derived from a play, poem, <b>painting</b> <b>or</b> work of nature. They inspired the symphonic poems of Bedřich Smetana, Antonín Dvořák, Richard Strauss and others.|$|E
5000|$|A density cup is an {{instrument}} {{that is used to}} ensure quality control in a <b>paint</b> <b>or</b> lacquer. [...] It does this by measuring the density of the <b>paint</b> <b>or</b> lacquer, and comparing this density with the density of a standard for that <b>paint</b> <b>or</b> lacquer. [...] If the density reading is different from the standard, then there is an error in paint composition because if there were no error in paint composition, then the measurement would match up to the standard density for that <b>paint</b> <b>or</b> lacquer.|$|R

5|$|The Prison Gallery showcases {{and offers}} for sale the artworks {{of current and}} ex-prisoners of Western Australia. It also hosts other {{exhibits}} related {{to the history of}} the prison, including historical artefacts. Many cells and areas of the prison depict prisoners' artwork, including that of the 19th-century forger James Walsh, whose artwork was hidden beneath layers of white-wash for decades. <b>Painting</b> <b>or</b> drawing on walls was originally forbidden, though graffiti, which could be viewed as art or vandalism, occurred throughout the prison's operational years. This rule was relaxed in special cases – including, from 1976, long-term prisoners within their own cells – but only for work considered art and not graffiti. Art, or art therapy, was not officially permitted until the 1980s; graffiti was never formally permitted, but in the prison's last six months, with closure imminent, the rule was not enforced.|$|E

25|$|China <b>painting,</b> <b>or</b> {{porcelain}} painting, is {{the decoration}} of glazed porcelain objects such as plates, bowls, vases or statues.

The broader term ceramic painting includes painted decoration on lead-glazed earthenware such as creamware or tin-glazed pottery such as maiolica or faience.|$|E

25|$|No {{contemporary}} <b>painting</b> <b>or</b> {{sculpture of}} Confucius survives, {{and it was}} only during the Han Dynasty that he was portrayed visually. Carvings often depict his legendary meeting with Laozi. Since that time there have been many portraits of Confucius as the ideal philosopher. The oldest known portrait of Confucius has been unearthed in the tomb of the Han dynasty ruler Marquis of Haihun (died 59 BC). The picture was painted on the wooden frame to a polished bronze mirror.|$|E

25|$|Gleizes {{practically}} subjugates The Tree in the foreground—its thin trunk slightly off-center and foliage cropped at the top—to {{a secondary}} role within a meticulously geometric World landscape. Here, the receding landscape marked by protruding hills and steep cliff-like formations, is perhaps more naturalistic than the {{core group of}} Gleizes' subsequent 1911–12 landscapes (e.g., Le Chemin (Paysage à Meudon), 1911, and Les Baigneuses (The Bathers), 1912) yet does not replicate any other known <b>painting</b> (<b>or</b> specific location) in any of its parts. This fact strongly points towards it being an invention born out of Gleizes' studio.|$|E
