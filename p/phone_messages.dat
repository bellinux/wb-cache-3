5|$|The {{album is}} part of a larger Year Zero project which {{includes}} a remix album, an alternate reality game and a potential television or film project. The Year Zero alternate reality game expanded upon the album's fictional storyline by using media such as websites, pre-recorded <b>phone</b> <b>messages,</b> and murals. However, disputes arose between Reznor and Universal Music Group, the parent company of Interscope Records, over overseas pricing of the album. In October 2007, Reznor announced that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope, effectively ending the band's relationship with the label; thus Year Zero was the last Nine Inch Nails studio album released on the Interscope label.|$|E

500|$|Series co-creator Larry David co-wrote {{the episode}} with Seinfeld in two days, as, with the {{cancellation}} of [...] "The Bet", they had little time to write the script. George's storyline was largely based on David's personal experiences of leaving <b>phone</b> <b>messages</b> to women that would {{mean the end of}} a relationship. David had previously written a sketch for Saturday Night Live regarding a man who went into his girlfriend's house to erase her answering machine. The sketch was never produced, allowing David to use its storyline for the Seinfeld episode. Jerry's storyline was based on Seinfeld's own predicaments, as he extremely disliked the cotton Dockers commercial discussed in the episode.|$|E
