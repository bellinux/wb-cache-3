25|$|VeloBind {{is used to}} {{permanently}} rivet pages together using a <b>plastic</b> <b>strip</b> on {{the front}} and back of the document. Sheets for the document are punched with a line of holes near the bound edge. A series of pins attached to a <b>plastic</b> <b>strip</b> called a Comb feeds through the holes to the other side and then goes through another <b>plastic</b> <b>strip</b> called the receiving strip. The excess portion of the pins is cut off and the plastic heat-sealed to create a relatively flat bind method. VeloBind provides a more permanent bind than comb-binding, but is primarily used for business and legal presentations and small publications.|$|E
25|$|Aquarium heaters {{combine a}} heating element with a thermostat, {{allowing}} the aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature. Thermometers used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external <b>plastic</b> <b>strip</b> thermometers, and battery-powered LCD thermometers. In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to airstones or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.|$|E

The score for his piece Refrain, for instance, includes a rotatable (refrain) on a transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>strip.</b> Early in the 1970s, he ended his agreement with Universal Edition and began publishing his own scores under the Stockhausen-Verlag imprint [...] This arrangement allowed him to extend his notational innovations (for example, dynamics in Weltparlament [...] are coded in colour) and resulted in eight German Music Publishers Society Awards between 1992 (Luzifers Tanz) and 2005 (Hoch-Zeiten, from Sonntag aus Licht) [...] The score of Momente, published just before the composer's death in 2007, won this prize for the ninth time [...]|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn apiary {{trial was}} {{conducted}} in 1999 in Northern Sardinia (Italy) {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and the persistence of amitraz impregnated in <b>plastic</b> <b>strips</b> against Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman. Twelve colonies of bees derived from Apis mellifera ligustica Spin. in Dadant Blatt hives were used; six colonies were treated with 2 strips per hive and the other six were left untreated control. Two methods for the evaluation of treatment efficacy were compared: the percent effectiveness measured as the percent reduction of V. destructor infestation in treated hives, and the percent control which took into consideration natural mortality in the control hives. Percent effectiveness was greater than the percent control. Amitraz residues were determined in honey and the <b>plastic</b> <b>strips.</b> No amitraz residue higher than 0. 01 mg·kg^- 1 was detected in honey. The amitraz content was stable during the trial in <b>plastic</b> <b>strips</b> placed in the colonies, and in the control strips.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{represented}} are the calculations of initial plastic strips-zones, {{developed from the}} corner points of elastoplastic body, which are stress concentrators. With the aim of conducting of these calculations there has been made a transition from the problem on plastic zones {{to the problems of}} the theory of elasticity for the wedge-shaped body with the rupture displacement line at the vertex. The exact solutions of the above-mentioned problems are constructed by Wiener-Hopf method. Based on these solutions the lengths of <b>plastic</b> <b>strips</b> and the directions of their development are defined. The results of symmetric cases of the crack end, which is on the media-separating boundary, and the corner point of the hole brings us to a conclusion that the process of development of the initial plastic zone has two stages. At the first stage two side <b>plastic</b> <b>strips</b> are developed from the corner point, and at the second stage one more additional strip, which is considerably smaller than the side ones. In the case of a hole at the second stage before the appearance of the third <b>strip,</b> the side <b>plastic</b> <b>strips</b> deviate from their primary direction of development, thus, leading to the angle increase in between them...|$|R

40|$|With rapid {{urban and}} {{industrial}} developments, {{large quantities of}} wastes are being generated worldwide. The disposal of these wastes in landfills is not a sustainable solution for countries like India due to availability of limited land space. Waste management and waste reduction can be achieved through recycling or re-use. Utilization of industrial wastes in geotechnical applications is likely to provide viable, environmentally friendly, and sustainable solutions. In view of these requirements, an experimental study was carried out to demonstrate the potential of using two industrial wastes, namely fly ash and waste recycled product (WRP) generated after recycling of blast furnace slag from steel plant, reinforced separately with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) <b>plastic</b> waste <b>strips.</b> Three different sizes of waste <b>plastic</b> <b>strips</b> were used in this study. The effect of strip content (0. 25 % to 4 %) and strip length on the California bearing ratio (CBR) and the secant modulus of plastic strip-reinforced fly ash and plastic strip-reinforced WRP were investigated. The study reveals that the addition of waste <b>plastic</b> <b>strips</b> to fly ash and WRP results in appreciable increase in CBR and secant modulus.

Utilization of the industrial wastes in geotechnical applications is likely to provide an acceptable solution. Keeping this in view, an experimental study was carried out to demonstrate the potential application of three industrial wastes, namely fly ash, stone dust, and waste recycled product (WRP) generated after recycling of blast furnace slag from steel plant, in pavements after reinforcing them randomly with high density polyethylene (HDPE) <b>plastic</b> waste <b>strips.</b> Three different sizes of waste <b>plastic</b> <b>strips</b> were used in this study.

The study has revealed that the addition of waste <b>plastic</b> <b>strips</b> to industrial wastes results in an appreciable increase in CBR and subgrade modulus (ks).
