25|$|The modern {{construction}} {{plan for}} the Second Avenue Subway, developed in 2004, would make use of most of these tunnel segments. Phase 1 of service built new tunnels up to 99th Street, where the new tunnels connect to the tunnel segment between 99th and 105th Streets. The new tunnels between 96th and 99th Street are used for train storage of up to four trainsets, or two per track. By mid-2013, work had resumed in this tunnel segment, involving upgrading mechanical and <b>plumbing</b> <b>equipment,</b> and upgrading the tunnels to meet modern fire code standards. Phase 2, which {{does not have a}} set timetable for construction, is planned to extend Q train service from 96th Street to 125th Street. During Phase 2, both East Harlem segments will be connected, modified, and used for normal train service. In 2007, the MTA reported that the segments were in pristine condition. In December 2016, there were rumors that the 110th–120th Streets segment might go unused, though the MTA refuted the claim.|$|E

In 1852, the first school {{was replaced by a}} stone schoolhouse built on Ventnor Road. The school section serving Ventnor was known as section #14, with its school being known as S.S. #14 Ventnor School. Attendance was low as only a third of the enrolled students regularly attended in the mid-1800s. In 1884, the stone schoolhouse was in such bad repair it was condemned and the school board purchased the brick building formerly used as the Episcopal Methodist church to be used as the new school; the spire was removed and replaced with the belfry from the dilapidated stone schoolhouse. In 1898, enrolment and attendance increased and a second school section was opened to serve the village known as section #27, with the school being named S.S. #27 Dobbie’s School. The school, located at the corner of County Road 22 and Ventnor Road, was a primitive schoolhouse, originally without running water. In the 1930s, Dobbie’s School was upgraded to include basic <b>plumbing</b> and <b>equipment</b> for home economics class.

5000|$|Drain rods are <b>plumbing</b> <b>equipment</b> used {{to attempt}} to unblock drains and sewers. The set {{normally}} consists of several stiff, but flexible, rods, each approximately one meter long, which may be screwed together end-to-end. The material is often polypropylene heavy gauge tubing. Jointing of the plastic to metal is done in hydraulic presses and these joints are the achilles heel of this rod type. Often, when subjected to force, the joint breaks. Better quality ends have securing pins through the differing materials. More expensive rods are high tensile steel. End connections are often brass or steel, the better steel type having cadmium plating for corrosion resistance. Two types of threaded end can be purchased. Cheaper ones simply screw together, male to female but have the disadvantage of needing one-way rotation in use to prevent unscrewing. Better quality rods have their ends formed into a square peg, mating in a matching square hole in the adjacent rod. A captive threaded nut then screw locks both lengths together making a firm joint. A spanner tightens the joint firmly.|$|E

50|$|As {{it turned}} out, PALC 1-1 was not seriously {{damaged by the}} {{explosion}} of Samos 3's booster and repair work only consisted of <b>plumbing</b> and electrical <b>equipment,</b> replacing the launcher mechanism, and cleaning and repainting. By October 29, the pad was fully restored to working condition and on November 22, Samos 4, the first Program 101B satellite, lifted off. Extensive {{efforts were made to}} ensure mission success, such as X-ray testing for bad transistors and super-clean propellant tanks. Unfortunately, the launch was another failure, albeit less dramatic than Samos 3. The Atlas suffered a guidance malfunction at T+245 seconds into launch that resulted in loss of pitch control, as well as improper booster and sustainer cutoff signals. Booster jettison happened a few seconds early, while the sustainer engine burned to LOX depletion. The booster pitched up about 160 degrees at SECO, leaving the Agena oriented in the wrong direction for orbital insertion, so when its engine fired, it drove Samos 4 into the Pacific Ocean instead of orbit.|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} simple risk {{analysis}} tool and evaluation {{level for the}} probable infection due to a contaminated drainage stack in residential high-rise buildings in some Asian cities which have equivalent drainage systems. The methodology would follow the conception of FMEA (Failure Mode Effects Analysis). In particular, key risk factors including connections between appliance and stack, the <b>plumbing</b> system, ventilation, <b>equipment</b> life and maintenance were surveyed and {{used to evaluate the}} overall risk associated in high-rise residential buildings with Monte Carlo simulations. With the proposed tool, regional risks of infection due to the building drainage systems were estimated, with respect to the city building age and height profiles. The results showed that a city with a high-rise environment would associate a higher spreading risk due to the drainage system. Practical applications: Following the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in early 2003, the operational performance of drainage systems in high-rise residential buildings has become a major concern. The assessment system would be practical and sensible for evaluating the infection risk in building drainage systems for both existing buildings and new construction. The assessment tool may provide the government, designers and the occupants a source of reference to judge drainage system performance in either new construction or the existing building, so that improvements would be conducted.
