5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, <b>picking</b> <b>at</b> the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E

25|$|Australia needed quick {{runs for}} a declaration, but Lawry spent {{two and a}} half hours making 42 and Ian Chappell over two hours for 30. John Snow bowled 12 eight ball overs for a mere 21 runs and the wickets of Lawry and Redpath. He was warned for intimidatory bowling by Max O'Connell after bowling short at Doug Walters (39 not out), despite no action having been taken against Thomson's bouncers earlier in the Test. Snow was also photographed <b>picking</b> <b>at</b> the seam of a Kookaburra cricket ball, which caused a furore in the Australian press until it was {{realised}} that the Kookaburra did not have a seam and Snow had been playing a practical joke on the cameraman. Lawry finally declared at 169/4, leaving England to make 271 in four hours.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to season}} six, Kenny died {{in almost every}} episode. The nature of the deaths were often gruesome and portrayed in a comically absurd fashion, and usually {{followed}} by Stan and Kyle respectively yelling [...] "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!" [...] and [...] "You bastards!" [...] Shortly afterward, rats would commonly appear and begin <b>picking</b> <b>at</b> his corpse. In a following episode, Kenny would reappear alive and well, usually without any explanation. Most characters appear oblivious or indifferent to the phenomenon, although occasionally one will acknowledge an awareness of it. In [...] "Cherokee Hair Tampons", Kenny gets irritated and offended when Stan laments Kyle's critical condition while utterly ignoring Kenny's past demises. Eric Cartman commented on Kenny's deaths in the episode [...] "Cartmanland", when he is being sued for unsafe rides insisting to attorneys representing his family that [...] "Kenny dies all the time!" ...|$|E
500|$|Starting with Caged Bird, Angelou made a {{deliberate}} attempt while writing all her autobiographies, including Mom & Me & Mom, {{to challenge the}} usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction. [...] Valerie Sayers, in her review of Mom & Me & Mom in The Washington Post, calls Angelou's books memoirs because of their limited focus, but praises her for describing {{what it was like}} to grow up Black in [...] "Jim Crow America". [...] Sayers states: [...] "She manages to fully reveal that national sore without <b>picking</b> <b>at</b> it, a neat trick that...requires considerable restraint and her own steely goodwill". [...] Angelou stated in a 1989 interview that she was the only [...] "serious" [...] writer to choose the genre to express herself. [...] As critic Susan Gilbert stated, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agreed, and viewed Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that spoke for an entire group of people. [...] Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able to convince her to write Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered [...] "high art", which she continued throughout her series. [...] Although Angelou was successful, she was, as Sayers insisted, smart and gifted enough to write for any audience, but chose not to write for [...] "a highbrow literary audience", but for [...] "readers as open, playful and straightforward as herself".|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s and 60s (and, to lesser extent, currently) {{a facial}} mole {{was known as}} a [...] "beauty mark" [...] when it {{appeared}} in certain spots on a woman's face. Examples include Marilyn Monroe, model Cindy Crawford, singer Madonna, and the fictional Ms. Pac-Man. Madonna's facial molebelow her right nostrilhas been surgically removed. Some folklore about moles includes the notion that <b>picking</b> <b>at</b> a mole can cause it to become cancerous or grow back larger.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922, {{the people}} of al-Bassa founded a local council which was {{responsible}} for managing its local affairs. The British census of September 1922 [...] listed a population of 867 Christians, 150 Metawalis and 1 Jew, though Kaufman reports that the Muslims were Sunni rather than Metawali. The Christians were listed as Greek Catholic (Melchite) (721), Orthodox (120), Church of England (17), Armenian Catholic (8), and one Roman Catholic. Its main economic activity was olive <b>picking.</b> <b>At</b> the [...] 1931 census, which did not distinguish Metawalis from other Muslims, the village had 868 Muslims, 1076 Christians, and 4 Bahais.|$|E

2500|$|The ball {{is a hard}} leather-seamed spheroid, with a {{circumference}} of [...] The ball has a [...] "seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of {{the ball to the}} string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable, and {{during the course of this}} deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will therefore attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through the air, but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or <b>picking</b> <b>at</b> the seam is illegal ball tampering.|$|E
2500|$|A quiet, {{friendly}} series erupted with {{controversy in}} the third and fourth Tests of the series. On the third day of the third Test, television images showed Stuart Broad standing on the ball, and fellow England pace-bowler James Anderson <b>picking</b> <b>at</b> the leather of the ball, causing South Africa to raise concerns about the condition of the ball, and the actions of the England duo. After some delay, the South African team announced that they were not making an official complaint to the International Cricket Council (ICC), who in turn confirmed that the matter was closed. In the fourth Test, after an apparent nick by Graeme Smith was taken by wicket-keeper Matt Prior, the umpire Tony Hill turned down the appeal, and third umpire Daryl Harper upheld Hill's decision on review. However, TV replays showed an audible noise as the ball passed the bat. England announced that they would lodge an official complaint with the ICC, with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) asking for the review to be reinstated. The ICC defended Harper, but said that it would launch a [...] "full and comprehensive investigation" [...] into the incident after the match.|$|E
