5|$|The {{blue and}} red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several {{competing}} theories have been put forth for the {{blue and red}} design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it {{was the idea of}} his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used many times.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in particular political opponents, {{has been a}} cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E
25|$|The {{major problem}} in visual <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> what people see {{is not simply a}} {{translation}} of retinal stimuli (i.e., the image on the retina).

25|$|Public <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{renewable}} energies such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal {{are having a}} significant positive impact on global warming.

25|$|A common <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the birth}} of Cooperative Extension {{followed}} passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, which provided federal funds to land-grant universities to support Extension work. In a formal sense, this is true. But the roots of Cooperative Extension extend {{as far back as}} the late 18th century, following the American Revolution, when affluent farmers first began organizing groups to sponsor educational meetings to disseminate useful farming information. In some cases, these lectures even were delivered by university professors– a practice that foreshadowed Cooperative Extension work more than a century later.|$|E
25|$|As {{the nuclear}} power debate continues, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions are not decreasing, they are increasing. Predictions estimate that even with draconian emission reductions within the ten years, the world will still pass 650ppm {{of carbon dioxide and}} a catastrophic 4C average rise in temperature. Public <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> renewable energies such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal are significantly affecting global warming. All of these sources combined only supplied 1.3% of global energy in 2013 as 8 billion tonnes of coal was burned annually. This too little, too late may be a mass form of climate change denial, or an idealistic pursuit of green energy.|$|E

25|$|Motivation is {{a factor}} that {{encourages}} a person to perform and succeed at the task at hand. In an experiment done by Roebers, Moga and Schneider (2001), participants were placed in either forced report, free report or free report plus incentive groups. In each group, {{they found that the}} amount of correct information recalled did not differ, yet in the group where participants were given an incentive they had higher accuracy results. This means that presenting participants with an encouragement to provide correct information motivates them to be more precise. However, this is only true if the <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> success is providing correct information. When it is believed that success is the completion of the task rather than the accuracy of that completion, the number of responses is higher, yet its accuracy is lowered. This shows that the results are dependent on how success is defined to the participant. In the referred experiment, the participants that were placed in the forced response group had the lowest overall accuracy; they had no motivation to provide accurate responses and were forced to respond even when they were unsure of the answer. Another study done by Hill RD, Storandt M, and Simeone C tested the impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists. Effects similar to those reported in the previous study were seen in children—in contrast to older learners.|$|E
25|$|Expanding and {{improving}} secondary vocational education {{has long been}} an objective of China’s educational reformers, for vocational schools are seen as those which are best placed to address (by providing trained workers) the rising needs of the nation’s expanding economy, especially its manufacturing and industrial sectors. Without an educated and trained work force, China cannot have economic, hence social and national, development. Yet, given a finite, and often quite limited, pot of money for secondary schools, an allocation competition/conflict necessarily exists between its two sub-sectors: general education and vocational/technical education. Regardless, an over-enrollment in the latter has been the overall result of the mid-1980s reforms. Yet firms that must seek workers from this graduate pool have remained unimpressed with the quality of recruits and have had to rely on their own job-training programs that provide re-education for their newly hired workers. The public, also, has not been very enthusiastic over vocational secondary education which, unlike general education, does not lead to the possibility of higher education. The public’s <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these schools provide little more than a dead end for their children. Also, vocational institutions are more expensive to run than their counterparts in general education, and they have not had sufficient money to modernize their facilities, as China’s modernizing national economy demands. By mid-decade of the 21st Century, therefore, academics and policy-makers alike began to question the policy that pours funds into vocational schools that do not do their intended function.|$|E

I'd like to believe that, because I read for entertainment, and I write to entertain. Period." ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{numerous}} raids by police, O'Leary {{was found}} guilty of gambling only one time during his thirty-year career. The <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> O'Leary, along with gambling bosses Mont Tennes and [...] "Hot Stove" [...] Jimmy Quinn, controlled the Chicago Police.|$|R

500|$|Wales {{hosted the}} All Blacks at Cardiff Arms Park in November 1978, losing 13–12 after a late penalty goal by the {{replacement}} All Black fullback, Brian McKechnie. The penalty was controversial because All Black lock Andy Haden had dived {{out of a}} line-out {{in an attempt to}} earn a penalty. Haden later admitted that he and Frank Oliver had pre-agreed this tactic should the All Blacks find themselves in difficulties. Referee Roger Quittenton was roasted by the press for failing to notice the dive, but he later stated he had the penalty was in for Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of Frank Oliver. Quittenton later said, [...] "Haden's <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his dive secured the penalty. That is a load of rubbish". The All Blacks went on to secure their first Home Nations Grand Slam. Wales then {{went on to win the}} 1979 Five Nations with a Triple Crown.|$|E
2500|$|Argentine courts [...] "are slow, inefficient, and {{vulnerable}} to corruption and executive branch influence," [...] {{according to a}} 2013 Heritage Foundation report. The general <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many members of Argentina's judiciary are political appointees who enjoy {{a close relationship with}} the executive branch. Another major problem is that the judicial system is plagued by inefficiency, delays, and insufficient administrative support. It is a common practice for government officials to offer political jobs to judges in charge of important cases, thereby derailing the cases.|$|E
2500|$|A common <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> white tail spider bites can be {{associated}} with long term skin infections, and in rarer cases progression to necrosis. This is an attribution of infections presenting to medical care with a complaint of [...] "spider bite." [...] Venom has no bacteria, and infections do not arise from spider bites. The well-described brown recluse bite is direct damage to skin and tissue. It has a limited area and does not spread. No formal studies have found evidence for associating necrosis with white tail spider bites.|$|E

2500|$|Although Alexandru Macedonski {{frequently}} {{changed his}} style and views on literary matters, {{a number of}} constants have been traced throughout his work. Thus, a common <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his literature had a strongly visual aspect, the notion being condensed in Cincinat Pavelescu's definition of Macedonski: [...] "Poet, therefore painter; painter, therefore poet." [...] Traian Demetrescu too recalled that his mentor had been dreaming of becoming a visual artist, and had eventually settled for turning his son Alexis into one. This pictorial approach to writing created parallels between Macedonski and his traditionalist contemporaries Vasile Alecsandri and Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea.|$|E

2500|$|More particularly, two {{incidents}} involving Trudeau are {{remembered as}} having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During {{a visit to}} Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met {{with a group of}} farmers who were protesting the Canadian Wheat Board. The widely remembered <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with [...] "Why should I sell your wheat?"– however, he had asked the question rhetorically and then proceeded to answer it himself. Years later, on a train trip through Salmon Arm, British Columbia, he [...] "gave the finger" [...] to a group of protesters through the carriage window– less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.|$|E

50|$|As the 1960s {{came to a}} close, {{an economy}} reeling from over {{reliance}} on construction and labour troubles at the Dockyards, acted as political brickbats on Borg Olivier's administration.

5000|$|The {{first goal}} was to decentralise power. The <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Rwanda's {{centralised}} governing system had been a contributing factor to the genocide.

2500|$|Public <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Iraqis were confrontational and {{blocking}} {{the work of}} the inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when we got into issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, Iraqis raised a flag and said, [...] "Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq." [...] So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if we came to a site and the Iraqis called it 'sensitive,' we go in with four people.|$|E
2500|$|The contest {{has long}} been accused by some of {{political}} bias; the <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> judges and televoters allocate points based on their nation's relationship to the other countries, rather than the musical merits of the songs. According to one study of Eurovision voting patterns, certain countries tend to form [...] "clusters" [...] or [...] "cliques" [...] by frequently voting in the same way. Another study concludes that as of 2006, voting blocs have, {{on at least two}} occasions, crucially affected the outcome of the contest. On the other hand, others argue that certain countries allocate disproportionately high points to others because of similar musical tastes and cultures and because they speak similar languages, and are therefore more likely to appreciate each other's music.|$|E

[...] Harris quotes Philip Weiss: [...] "Things are changing.... My <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Jewish community, the Jewish progressives, are feeling licensed and rising up." [...] Weiss himself notes two recent developments: the launch by Jewish Voice for Peace of the Muzzlewatch Project dedicated to chronicling the alleged suppression of criticism of Israel, and the failure of the Zionist Organization of America to oust a liberal Jewish group from a national pro-Israel alliance.|$|E
50|$|Ward {{actually}} gained considerable popularity as {{a result}} of his financial troubles; Ward was widely seen as a great benefactor of the Southland region, and public <b>perceptions</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> being persecuted by his enemies over an honest mistake.
