Abstract: Amine precursors such as NH-Boc (5) and NH-formyl (6) protected glycines were grafted by esterification on the hydroxylated arms of 1 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) - 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphates 4 h or tetrafluoroborates 4 t. The Boc cleavage was then realized {{at room temperature}} by successively treating acetonitrile solutions of the carbamates 7 h or 7 t with methanol and acetyl chloride (2 equivalents each).

40|$|Abstract- Dithiocarbamate chitosan, an {{insoluble}} derivative {{obtained from}} carbon disulfide, and N-(o—carboxybenzyl) chitosan and N—car— boxymethyl chitosan, two water—soluble olyamoholytes obtained from <b>phthalaldehydic</b> <b>acid</b> and glyoxylic acid, {{can be used}} for removal of metal ions from dilute solutions. Their characteristic properties are described in terms of infrared, ultraviolet and circular dichroism spectrometry, alkalimetry, metal ion collection percentage and metal ion capacity. The new polyampholytes form insoluble chelates upon addition of their solutions to metal ion solutions. INTRODUCT ION The chelating ability of chitosan for transition metal ions (Ref. 1 — 3) can be enhanced by reacting the amino groups of this biopolymer with suitable chemicals (Ref. 4). Va-rious chemical derivatives of chitosan have thus far been prepared: in this lecture, we shall devote our attention to three derivatives recently prepared in our laboratory (Ref. 5 — 8) which appear to represent significant advances in the field of the selectiv...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to develop the {{strategies}} necessary to synthesize the rubromycin class of natural products. Synthesis of fully functionalized isocoumarin and naphthoquinone moieties of rubromycin and related compounds are reported. The isocoumarin is formed by a modified condensation reaction of diethyl bromomalonate with a substituted <b>phthalaldehydic</b> <b>acid.</b> The naphthoquinone system is assembled from readily available 2 -bromo- 5, 7, 8 -trimethoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone that is oxygenated in a copper-catalyzed, addition-elimination reaction with methanol to yield the intermediate 2, 5, 7, 8 -tetramethoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone, which is also easily converted to the natural products mompain and 2, 7 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone. A model for the spiroketal core of the rubromycins is also discussed. Multiple coupling strategies of the isocoumarin and naphthoquinone fragments are also discussed. This thesis represents the founding work for this project in the Behar group...|$|E
40|$|The gamma-hydroxybutyrate biosynthetic enzyme succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSR) was {{purified}} to homogeneity from rat brain. Peptides {{were generated}} by tryptic cleavage and sequenced. PCR primers were designed from the amino acid sequences {{of two of}} the peptides showing a similarity (75 - 85 %) to a mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. A PCR-amplified DNA fragment was generated from recombinant plasmids prepared by a mass excision procedure from a rat hippocampal cDNA library and used as a probe to screen this cDNA library. One cDNA of 1341 bp had an open reading frame encoding a protein of 447 residues with a deduced molecular mass of 47967 Da. The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli. Immunoblotting analysis revealed the existence of a protein with the same electrophoretic mobility as the SSR purified from rat brain and with an estimated molecular mass of 45 kDa. Northern blot experiments showed that this enzyme was not expressed in the kidney or in the liver. In the brain tissue, a single but rather broad band was labelled under high stringency conditions, suggesting the presence of more than one messenger species coding for SSR. Hybridization in situ performed on brain tissue slices showed specific labelling of the hippocampus, the upper cortex layer, the thalamus, the substantia nigra, the cerebellum, the pons medulla and the olfactory tract. The recombinant enzyme showed catalytic properties {{similar to those of the}} SSR purified from rat brain, particularly in regard to its substrate affinities and Ki for inhibition by <b>phthalaldehydic</b> <b>acid.</b> Valproic acid did not inhibit the cloned SSR. This enzyme had 20 - 35 % identity in highly conserved regions involved in NADPH binding with four other proteins belonging to the aldo-oxo reductase family...|$|E
