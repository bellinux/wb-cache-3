5|$|The {{quality of}} Type 94 Nambu <b>pistols</b> {{decreased}} {{towards the end}} of World War II as the Japanese faced bombing raids from allied forces and material shortages increased. This drastic change in quality from late March 1945, onwards with all quality standards appearing to disappear {{towards the end of}} June 1945. The smooth wooden finished grip was replaced by a bakelite checkered pattern. Many <b>pistols</b> were not serialized and no <b>pistols</b> have been reported that bear July 1945 manufacture date. Only four unserialized and undated <b>pistols</b> are known to exist and include mismatch parts with no inspection marks, lanyard loops, and extractors. A small number of <b>pistols</b> made during the final production stages include earlier production dates and appear to have been salvaged from previously discarded <b>pistols</b> that had minor or cosmetic defects.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex <b>Pistols</b> were never meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex <b>Pistols</b> were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex <b>Pistols</b> were all of these things.|$|E

5|$|Bernard Rhodes, a {{sometime}} {{associate of}} McLaren {{and friend of}} the Sex <b>Pistols,</b> was similarly aiming to make stars of the band London SS. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning off two new bands: the Damned and the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer, former lead singer of the 101'ers. On June 4, 1976, the Sex <b>Pistols</b> played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in {{what came to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex <b>Pistols</b> in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths.|$|E
5|$|The Sex <b>Pistols</b> were an English {{punk rock}} band formed in London in 1975. Although they {{initially}} lasted just {{two and a}} half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex <b>Pistols,</b> they have been called one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music, having initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom, and inspired many later punk and alternative rock musicians.|$|E
5|$|A general {{overhaul}} of the gun laws took place through act No. 288/1995 Coll. Under the new act, gun license became shall issue. Also possession and concealed carry of <b>pistols</b> and revolvers became shall issue. The law further introduced mandatory firearms registration.|$|E

5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} the Sex <b>Pistols</b> at the Black Swan in Sheffield. The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in the Damned—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the <b>Pistols</b> broke up.|$|E
5|$|Blank pistol {{cartridges}} carrying CS in {{powder form}} have been released to the public.

5|$|In early September, Levene {{was fired}} from the Clash. Strummer would claim that Levene's dwindling {{interest}} in the band owed to his supposedly extravagant use of speed, a charge Levene has denied. Levene and Lydon would form Public Image Ltd. in 1978. On 21 September, the Clash performed publicly {{for the first time}} without Levene at another seminal concert: the 100 Club Punk Special, sharing the bill with the Sex <b>Pistols,</b> Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect. Chimes left in late November; he was briefly replaced by Rob Harper as the Clash toured in support of the Sex <b>Pistols</b> during December's Anarchy Tour.|$|E
5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with brown eyes and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two <b>pistols.</b> The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or light brown shirts. When exploring, she often carries two <b>pistols,</b> but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E

5|$|The {{group had}} been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes, and had {{performed}} publicly {{for the first}} time. Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale {{was kicked out of}} the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties. According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex <b>Pistols</b> (or QT Jones & His Sex <b>Pistols,</b> as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} four Sex <b>Pistols</b> reunited in 1996 for {{the six-month}} Filthy Lucre Tour, which included dates in Europe, North and South America, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. The band members' {{access to the}} archives associated with The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle facilitated {{the production of the}} 2000 documentary The Filth and the Fury. This film—directed, like its predecessor, by Temple—was formulated as an attempt to tell the story from the band's point of view, in contrast to Swindles focus on McLaren and the media. In 2002—the year of the Queen's Golden Jubilee—the Sex <b>Pistols</b> reunited again to play the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. In 2003, their Piss Off Tour took them around North America for three weeks.|$|E
5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} {{can use a}} variety of weapons, {{including}} dual <b>pistols,</b> dual Uzis, a Desert Eagle, a shotgun, an MP5 submachine gun, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and a harpoon gun for underwater use. The dual <b>pistols</b> have infinite ammunition and are Lara's default weapons, while the other weapons have finite ammunition and must be found in the levels. At one point in the game, Lara will be stripped of all her weapons, leaving the player defenceless and forced to use stealth, before recovering her <b>pistols</b> later. Lara has a certain amount of health that decreases if she falls from a great height or when she is attacked by enemies. If Lara's health is fully depleted, the player must start the game again from a previous save point. Saving the player's progress on the PlayStation version of the game requires a memory card and consumes a Save Crystal from Lara's inventory. These can be found throughout each level and do not require the player to save the game at the pick-up spot.|$|E
