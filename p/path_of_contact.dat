40|$|To {{determine}} {{the time course of}} synaptic differentiation, we made successive observations on identified, nerve-contacted muscle cells developing in culture. The cultures had either been stained with fluorescent alpha-bungarotoxin, or were maintained {{in the presence}} of a fluorescent monoclonal antibody. These probes are directed at acetylcholine receptors (AChR) and a basal lamina proteoglycan, substances that show nearly congruent surface organizations at the adult neuromuscular junction. In other experiments individual muscle cells developing in culture were selected at different stages of AChR accumulation and examined in the electron microscope after serial sectioning along the entire <b>path</b> <b>of</b> nerve-muscle <b>contact.</b> The results indicate that the nerve-induced formation of AChR aggregates and adjacent plaques of proteoglycan is closely coupled throughout early stages of synapse formation. Developing junctional accumulations of AChR and proteoglycan appeared and grew progressively, throughout a perineural zone that extended along the muscle surface for several micrometers on either side of the nerve process. Unlike junctional AChR accumulations, which disappeared within a day of denervation, both junctional and extrajunctional proteoglycan deposits were stable in size and morphology. Junctional proteoglycan deposits appeared to correspond to discrete ultrastructural plaques of basal lamina, which were initially separated by broad expanses of lamina-free muscle surface. The extent of this basal lamina, and a corresponding thickening of the postsynaptic membrane, also increased during the accumulation of AChR and proteoglycan along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> nerve <b>contact.</b> Presynaptic differentiation <b>of</b> synaptic vesicle clusters became detectable at the developing neuromuscular junction only after the formation of postsynaptic plaques containing both AChR and proteoglycan.

40|$|Simple, {{traditional}} methods for computation of {{the efficiency of}} spur gears {{are based on the}} hypotheses of constant friction coefficient and uniform load sharing along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> However, none of them is accurate. The friction coefficient is variable along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact,</b> though average values can be often considered for preliminary calculations. Nevertheless, the nonuniform load sharing produced by the changing rigidity of the pair of teeth has significant influence on the friction losses, due to the different relative sliding at any contact point. In previous works, the authors obtained a nonuniform model of load distribution based on the minimum elastic potential criterion, which was applied to compute the efficiency of standard gears. In this work, this model of load sharing is applied to study the efficiency of both standard and high contact ratio involute spur gears (with contact ratio between 1 and 2 and greater than 2, resp.). Approximate expressions for the friction power losses and for the efficiency are presented assuming the friction coefficient to be constant along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> A study of the influence of some transmission parameters (as the gear ratio, pressure angle, etc.) on the efficiency is also presented...|$|E

40|$|The old {{model of}} an unevolved, cool contact binary, {{in which the}} {{secondary}} component is strongly oversized due to energy transfer from the primary, and the whole system is out of thermal equilibrium, encounters serious problems. I present a new scenario for evolution <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> binaries, which solves the problem of thermal nonequilibrium by assuming that contact binaries are past mass exchange with a mass ratio reversal. The scenario {{is divided into three}} phases. In Phase I loss of angular momentum (AM) due to magnetized wind of a detached binary is followed until the primary component fills its critical Roche lobe. In Phase II mass transfer takes place until mass ratio reversal. Arguments are given in favor of such a process in pre-contact binaries. In Phase III an approximate evolutionary <b>path</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contact</b> binary is followed until a possible coalescence.

The {{extent and}} fidelity of postsynaptic depolarization triggered by AMPAR activation {{are shaped by}} AMPAR auxiliary subunits, including the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs profoundly influence gating, an effect thought to be mediated by an interaction with the AMPAR ion channel and ligand binding domain (LBD). Here, we show that the distal N-terminal domain (NTD) contributes to TARP modulation. Alterations in the NTD-LBD linker result in TARP-dependent and TARP-selective changes in AMPAR gating. Using peptide arrays, we identify a TARP interaction region on the NTD and define the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> TARP <b>contacts</b> along the LBD surface. Moreover, we map key binding sites on the TARP itself and show that mutation of these residues mediates gating modulation.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four papers, which treat the modelling of a spur gear set and a disc brake, and {{the interaction between the}} machine elements. Features of the performance are studied in relation to the initial stated assumptions. Initially, a method for analysing the influence of profile errors upon load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness of spur gears was proposed. The contacts between mating gear teeth were identified in the deformed state. In addition, artificial neural networks were employed for system identification. The discussion was focused upon the dependency between the contact ratio and the load in addition to the influence of profile and pitch errors. Experimental data validated the reliability of the approach. Following, a non-linear damping model for shaft torsional vibration studies was proposed and experimentally validated. The experiments showed that the internal shaft damping was highly non-linear. The damping tended to be not only stiffness related but also noticeably depended on the type of material. Friction induced noise due to the interaction of the mating teeth of a spur gear set was studied. For the shaft bearings, a non-linear damping model based upon the coefficient of restitution describing the interaction between the rolling elements and the inner- and outer race of the bearing was proposed. The non-linear support bearing model created a relation between the bearing stiffness in the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> of the mating teeth and the movement of the gears perpendicular to the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> The presence of friction had its greatest effect upon the bearing force in the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> of the mating gear teeth at low angular velocities, and at mesh frequencies close to the natural frequency of the vibration perpendicular to the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> Finally, the influence of the interaction between the disc of a floating disc brake assembly and connecting members was studied. In the initial process of the experimental research, high drag torque was acquired without applying force to the pads. The spline profile and the nave width were proven to have little effect upon drag, whilst the position on which the caliper was mounted had a considerable influence. Both the analytical study and the experimental measurements showed a strong correlation between the caliper position and the drag torque...|$|E

40|$|To explore {{whether a}} neural {{modulation}} of muscle integrins' extracellular ligand interactions contributes to synapse induction, {{we compared the}} distributions of beta 1 -integrins and basal lamina proteins on Xenopus myotomal myocytes developing in culture. beta 1 -Integrins formed numerous organized aggregates scattered over the entire muscle surface, with particularly dense accumulations at specialized sites resembling myotendinous and neuromuscular junctions. Integrin aggregates on muscle cells differed from those on surrounding fibroblasts and epithelial cells, both in their lack of response to cross-linking by multivalent ligands and in their consistent association with the cells' own extracellular matrices. Muscle integrin clusters were usually associated with congruent basal lamina accumulations containing laminin and a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), sometimes including fibronectin and vitronectin acquired from the surrounding medium. Immediately prior to synaptic differentiation, any existing laminin and HSPG accumulations along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>contact</b> were eliminated, disrupting otherwise stable laminin-integrin complexes. This apparently proteolytic modulation of integrins' extracellular ligand interactions was soon followed by the accumulation of new congruent accumulations of laminin and HSPG in the developing synaptic basal lamina.

The numerical analysis model for starved elastohydrodynamic lubrication (SEHL) of {{spiral bevel gears}} is established {{on the basis of}} the analysis of load tooth contacts analysis and SEHL in elliptical contacts. The SEHL characteristics of spiral bevel gears are also analyzed.

In electrical contact theory, the relatively small area where electrical current flows between two contacts is called the a-spot where [...] "a" [...] stands for asperity.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{which can be}} used to calculate dynamic gear tooth force and bearing forces. The model includes elastic bearings. The gear mesh stiffness and the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> are determined using the deformations of the gears and the bearings.

In a numerical example it is found that the only important vibration mode for the gear contact is the one where the gear tooth deformation is dominant. The bearing force variation, however, will be much more affected by the other vibration modes. The influence of the friction force is also studied. The friction has no dynamic influence on the gear contact force or on the bearing force in the gear mesh line-of-action direction. On the other hand, the changing of sliding directions in the pitch point is a source for critical oscillations of the bearings in the gear tooth frictional direction. These bearing force oscillations in the frictional direction appear unaffected by the dynamic response along the gear mesh line-of-action direction. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
