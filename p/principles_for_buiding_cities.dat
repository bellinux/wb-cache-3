In 1946, UNESCO made a social contract to use culture, education and science as a tool <b>for</b> <b>buiding</b> international solidarity, peace and security. Its trajectory presents challenges related to vopice, representation, power and hegemony which often result in conflict {{in most parts of}} the globe. For instance, the recent acceptance of Palestine to UNESCO has increased tensions amongst states because of Palestine’s positioning in global peace processes. This research surfaces some of these challenges and recomends further research on how to ensure the independents of UNESCO in fulfilling its mandate...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the so-called “unavoidable quantum anomalies ” can be avoided {{in the framework of}} a special non-linear quantization scheme. In this scheme, the quantized hamiltonians are represented by non-linear but homogeneous operators in Hilbert space. The nonlinear terms are of the same order as quantum anomalies, and their role is to cancel anomalies. The quantization method proposed is applicable to integrable classical dynamical systems and the result of quantization is again an integrable (but, generally, non-linear) ”quantum ” system. A simple example is discussed in detail. Irrespective of the existence of possible physical applications, the method provides a constructive way for extending the notion of quantum integrability to non-linear spectral problems and gives a practical tool <b>for</b> <b>buiding</b> completely integrable non-linear spectral equations in Hilbert space. ...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{ventilation}} {{of indoor}} environments shall guarantee {{not only a}} proper oxygen flow for human breathing, but also an effective removal of pollutants released by human metabolism and building materials. Usually, high ventilation rates are adopted to reach these two goals, with a consequent high energy consumption <b>for</b> <b>buiding</b> climatization. A good compromise between good indoor air quality and energy saving {{can be achieved by}} adopting local ventilation systems, such as the so called “task ventilation”. Local ventilation {{has turned out to be}} a very effective way to respond to specific personal requirements and therefore also to improve satisfaction and productivity in working places. In this paper some local ventilation systems are analysed and compared with the traditional “well-mixed ventilation”. A small movie theatre is simulated as a test case by using a CFD computer model: this way, local comfort indices as well as energy demands, have been determined for the different ventilation systems, in order to optimize the ventilation strategy...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study weight {{homology}} of singular schemes. Weight homology is an invariant of a singular scheme {{defined in terms}} of hypercoverings of resolution of singularities. Our main result is McKay <b>principle</b> <b>for</b> weight homology of quotient singularities, i. e. we describe weight homology of a quotient scheme in terms of weight homology of an equivariant scheme. Our method is to reduce the geometric McKay <b>principle</b> <b>for</b> weight homology to Kato's cohomological Hasse <b>principle</b> <b>for</b> arithmetic schemes. The McKay <b>principle</b> <b>for</b> weight homology implies McKay <b>principle</b> <b>for</b> the homotopy type of the dual complex of the exceptional divisors of a resolution of a quotient singularity.
