Modern equipment fitted for some klotoks include purse seine, inboard engines, halogen lamps, cool box and radio. A few klotoks are also used for <b>pole-line</b> fishing. However, for seine fishing, the klotok is equipped with a converted drive shaft. When fitted with the additional fishing equipment, klotoks may be known as [...] "mini-trawlers".
