50|$|As memory prices declined, {{application}} {{programs such}} as spreadsheets and computer-aided drafting were changed {{to take advantage of}} more and more physical memory in the system. Virtual memory in the 8088 and 8086 was not supported by the processor hardware, and disk technology of the time would make it too slow and cumbersome to be practical. Expanded memory was a system that allowed application programs to access more RAM than directly visible to the processor's address space. The process was a form of bank switching. When extra RAM was needed, driver software would temporarily make a piece of expanded memory accessible to the processor; when the data in that <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> was updated, another part could be swapped into the processor's address space. For the IBM PC and IBM PC/XT, with only 20 address lines, special-purpose expanded memory cards were made containing perhaps a mebibyte, or more, of expanded memory, with logic on the board to make that memory accessible to the processor in defined parts of the 8088 address space.|$|E

5000|$|Water drops are {{translucent}} and glistening, nonetheless vanishing within moments. Kim Tschang-yeul's {{water drops}} are intimately connected to his life, that is, the wars, poverty, love and pain he's been through. He keeps painting the water drops, over and over, with {{an attempt to}} erase the pains and to look for absolute transparency, absolute withering, until he reaches a spiritual state of emptiness. [...] "The process of painting the water drops is to filter, to dissolve all the impurities out of them and return them to a clear state of nothing. When all the rage, anxiety, and fear come to the moment of nothing, we reach a state of peace and comfort." [...] To Kim, the pure clean water drop is a consolation, a remedy for himself, seeking, not forgetting, peace, forgiveness, and reflection {{between now and the}} past. Regardless of single drops or in groups, the water drops of Kim Tschang-yeul are sprinkled non-uniformly upon the canvas of sleek or rough surface. It is as if they are falling off the canvas, or they are absorbed by the canvas but afloat, or it is that they are pulled out of the canvas by gravity. And a ray of light gleams from the side, slightly gliding through the isolated water drops, reflecting their crystal clarity. The water drops give the extremely realistic impression made out of fiction, enticing people to touch them. Time also finds its own refraction in the water drops with enormous layers and transparency: every temporary moment that doesn't seem to be is actually permanent existence. How we captures the flashes of our creative mind determines how insightful that particular <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> unfolds to us. Kim Tschang-yeul is convinced that he shall make water drops the thematic subject of his painting career, for which he does with such care, details, and joy of art in everyday life, so much so that it paves the way to art for him. By 1972, new Waterdrops works revealed a substantial conceptual shift as opposed to the Phenomenon series which appeared to visualize the quality of existence. Water drop on his canvas was no longer alone. The number of water drops radically increases in all sizes, which turns reality into beauty and reflects the lightness of life and the wonder of existence.|$|E
