60|$|Both {{funerals}} {{took place}} at the same time in our little church next day. Everybody was there, including the party guests. Satan was there, too; which was proper, for it was on account of his efforts that the funerals had happened. Nikolaus had departed this life without absolution, and a collection was taken up for masses, to get him out of purgatory. Only two-thirds of the required money was gathered, and the <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try to borrow the rest, but Satan furnished it. He told us privately that there was no purgatory, but he had contributed in order that Nikolaus's parents and their friends might be saved from worry and distress.

5000|$|However, in {{the present}} system, for people {{receiving}} care in their own home, {{the value of their}} home does not count towards the £23,000 threshold; people with less than £23,000 in savings, but a house worth £4 million (a situation comparatively common in Central London), are currently able to receive council funding to cover 100% of their care costs. Under Theresa May's proposal, the value of the home counts - so a person with a house worth £4 million would have to pay all of their care costs until their assets have been depleted to £100,000. Political commentators - including extreme opponents of the Prime Minister, like Polly Toynbee - have called the proposed package of changes brave but Tim Farron said was a [...] "callous blow for people who have dementia and other long-term conditions, like multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease, and of course their families. It is not just a massive mistake but a cruel attack on vulnerable people the length and breadth of this country." [...] It appears the Conservatives have made a U-turn and now plan a regressive tax that will hit those with relatively low savings hardest. [...] Conservatives plan an unspecified cap on total spending and as of 23 May 2017 they say they will give no more information till after the election. Jeremy Corbyn said the Tories, “ haven’t explained to the millions of people, who are desperately worried at the moment about what kind of care {{they are going to get}} in the future, desperately worried for children as well about how their <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be looked after,” he said.|$|E

On the other hand, child’s education is religiously mandated by Allah. Islam puts family education as the primary education for children. Parents are obligated to direct, to guide, {{and to be a}} role model for their children. Hence, <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be children’s reference in dealing with social issues. The parents’ fairness in educating children is the foundation of gender education.
