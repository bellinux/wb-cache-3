40|$|Work in {{the area}} of digital pulse {{position}} modulation (digital PPM) has shown that this type of modulation can yield sensitivities that are typically 4 - 5 dB better than an equivalent PCM system. Recent experimental work has shown that the receiver in a digital PPM system does not need to have a wide bandwidth. Instead, the bandwidth can be very low so that the receiver is effectively impulsed by the digital PPM signal. The advent of very high speed Si digital ICs, and fast lasers, means that digital PPM can now be used to code gigabit <b>PCM</b> <b>signals.</b> This paper presents original theoretical results for a digital PPM system coding 1 Gbit/s <b>PCM</b> <b>signals</b> into 8 Gbit/s digital PPM signals.

50|$|In {{digital signal}} processing, a digital signal is a {{representation}} of a physical signal that is a sampled and quantified. A digital signal is an abstraction which is discrete in time and amplitude. The signal's value only exists at regular time intervals, since only {{the values of the}} corresponding physical signal at those sampled moments are significant for further digital processing. The digital signal is a sequence of codes drawn from a finite set of values. The digital signal may be stored, processed or transmitted physically as a pulse code modulation (<b>PCM)</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|DSD is {{a method}} of storing a delta-sigma signal before {{applying}} a [...] "decimation" [...] process that converts the signal to a <b>PCM</b> <b>signal.</b> Delta-sigma conversion was originally described in patent 2,927,962, filed by C.C. Cutler in 1954, but was not named as such until a 1962 paper by Inose et al. Previously, decimation had not existed and the intention was to have oversampled data sent as-is. Indeed, the first proposal to decimate oversampled delta-sigma data to convert it into PCM audio did not appear until 1969, in D.J. Goodman's paper [...] "The Application of Delta Modulation of Analog-to-PCM encoding".|$|E
50|$|Companding is used {{in digital}} {{telephony}} systems, compressing before input to an analog-to-digital converter, and then expanding after a digital-to-analog converter. This is equivalent to using a non-linear ADC as in a T-carrier telephone system that implements A-law or μ-law companding. This method is also used in digital file formats for better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at lower bit rates. For example, a linearly encoded 16-bit <b>PCM</b> <b>signal</b> {{can be converted to}} an 8-bit WAV or AU file while maintaining a decent SNR by compressing before the transition to 8-bit and expanding after a conversion back to 16-bit. This is effectively a form of lossy audio data compression.|$|E
40|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} metaplasia is a pre-cancerous condition {{caused by}} chronic esophagitis. Chromosomal instability (CIN) {{is common in}} Barrett's cells: therefore, we investigated the possible presence of centrosomal aberrations (a main cause of CIN) by centrosomal protein immunostaining in paraffined esophageal samples of patients who developed a Barrett's adenocarcinoma. In most (55 %) patients, alterations of the pericentriolar material (<b>PCM)</b> <b>signals</b> were evident and consistently marked the transition between normal epithelium to metaplasia. The alterations could even be found in adjacent native squamous epithelium, Barrett's mucosa and submucosal gland cells, {{as well as in}} the basal/epibasal layers of the mucosa and submucosal gland duct, which are the regions hosting esophageal stem and progenitor cells. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the three esophageal histotypes (one being pathological) can have a common progenitor. Surprisingly, <b>PCM</b> defective <b>signal</b> eventually decreased with neoplastic progression, possibly to enhance the genome stability of advanced cancer cells. Importantly, <b>PCM</b> altered <b>signals</b> in Barrett's mucosa and their apparent evolution in successive histopathological steps were correlated to adenocarcinoma aggressiveness, suggesting PCM as a possible prognostic marker for tumor relapse. Extending our observations in a prospective study might help in the development of new prevention protocols for adenocarcinoma patients...|$|R

50|$|Digital eXtreme Definition (DXD) is {{a digital}} audio format that {{originally}} {{was developed for}} editing high-resolution recordings recorded in DSD, the audio standard used on Super Audio CD (SACD).

50|$|High-quality PCM audio {{requires}} a significantly larger bandwidth than a regular FM analog audio signal. For example, a 16-bit <b>PCM</b> <b>signal</b> {{requires a}}n analog bandwidth of about 1-1.5 MHz (compared to about 15-20 kHz of analog bandwidth required for an analog audio signal), and, clearly, a standard analog audio recorder could not meet that requirement. One solution arrived {{at in the}} early 1980s, was to use a video tape recorder, which is capable of recording signals with this high bandwidth, to store the audio information, but a means of converting the digital audio into pseudo-video was necessary. Such an audio recording system therefore includes two devices, namely the PCM adaptor, which converts audio into pseudo-video, and the video tape recorder itself. A PCM adaptor has the analogue audio (stereo) signal as its input, and translates it {{into a series of}} binary digits, which, in turn, is coded and modulated into a monochrome (black and white) video signal, appearing as a vibrating checkerboard pattern, modulated with the audio, which can then be recorded as a video signal.|$|E
