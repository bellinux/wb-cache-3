50|$|The process uses an {{abrasive}} and corrosive chemical slurry (commonly a colloid) {{in conjunction}} with a <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> and retaining ring, typically of a greater diameter than the wafer. The pad and wafer are pressed together by a dynamic polishing head and held in place by a plastic retaining ring. The dynamic polishing head is rotated with different axes of rotation (i.e., not concentric). This removes material and tends to even out any irregular topography, making the wafer flat or planar. This may be necessary to set up the wafer for the formation of additional circuit elements. For example, CMP can bring the entire surface within the depth of field of a photolithography system, or selectively remove material based on its position. Typical depth-of-field requirements are down to Angstrom levels for the latest 22 nm technology.|$|E

Polyurethane <b>polishing</b> <b>pads</b> {{with specific}} physicochemical characteristics have shown a great ability to produce very high surface quality.

This study aims to characterize the mechanical behavior of the filled polyurethane <b>polishing</b> <b>pads</b> and its influence on the quality and efficiency of the polishing process.

The <b>pads</b> behavior during the compression and creep tests was characterized. The polished surfaces quality and the process efficiency were also evaluated. The obtained results have shown the existence of the creep phenomenon of polyurethane polishers.

However, a variation of the compression module was observed according to the polishers filling by the abrasive grains used in the polishing operation.

40|$|A {{thermomechanical}} {{model to}} describe the mechanisms of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> scratching in chemical–mechanical planarization (CMP) has been formulated and investigated. CMP is a necessary process in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication to planarize wafers with nanoscale features after patterned layer deposition. <b>Polishing</b> <b>pad</b> asperities can produce microscale scratches on the wafer surface during CMP, reducing IC manufacturing yields. The constructed thermomechanical model accounts for stresses of the pad and wafer contact and also provides the means to track input energy dissipation during CMP. Tracking energy dissipation offers information about processes that may influence scratch production. This knowledge ultimately produces a greater physical understanding of CMP {{for the prevention of}} pad scratching. <b>Polishing</b> <b>pad</b> stress relaxation experiments demonstrate the importance of viscoelastic and plastic strain energy dissipation with its effects on the wafer stress field. Scratch producing ability of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> is found to decrease with use in CMP, with slurry soaking and increasing polishing time. Mechanical behavior of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> is demonstrated to differ when in compression and in tension. Compressibility of the pad material is shown to be significant in stress modeling through experimental measurement of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> volume change.

40|$|Variable {{rotation}} polishing (VRP) {{method is}} proposed {{in order to}} improve polishing performance such as material removal rate (MRR). The VRP method is characterized as a combination of the additional backward rotation with the forward rotation only (i. e. the conventional polishing). The MRR increases as the angle of additional backward rotation becomes higher until 360 degrees. In that case, the MRR of the VRP method was 38 percent higher than that of the conventional polishing. Asperity of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface is one of the dominant parameters affecting the MRRs and stabilities of the Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process. According to the investigation of a <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface topography suggests that the asperity of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface was kept standing upright by backward rotation of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad.</b> Particularly, the peak area of the asperities on <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface, the roughness became higher in the VRP method than in the conventional method. This result predicts that there are more the number and the area of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> asperities, which would approach near to the wafer surface being polished, are kept standing upright in the VRP method. Therefore, these asperities was able to consequently sustain the MRRs. In other words, this behavior suggests that in the VRP method, the preservation of the asperity on <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface would sustain the MRR because of the backward rotation, which may contribute to the realization of a <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> conditioning treatment-free CMP process. This feature also indicates that this method could result in the longer <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> life, namely the cost reduction of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad.</b> Slurry flow distribution and slurry film thickness were also evaluated in the VRP method comparing to the conventional polishing method. The slurry flow distribution was analyzed through a transparent quartz substrate by a high-speed camera. The slurry flow distribution of the VRP method was not uniform as compared with the conventional method, although the MRR of the VRP method was higher than that of the conventional method. The slurry film thickness variation was measured using a surface scanning laser confocal displacement meter on the upper surface position of a quartz substrate with and without slurry. The position of a quartz substrate varied from 9 μm to 8 μm during the CMP process. This implies that the slurry film thickness in the VRP method was 1 μm thinner than that of the conventional polishing. These results suggest that these 2 parameters are not dominantly effective against the MRR of the CMP process. As above mentioned, the preservation of the asperity on <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface is one of the dominant parameters to sustain the MRR. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:情工博甲第 301 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 25 日CHAPTER 1 Introduction|CHAPTER 2 The Chemical Mechanical Polishing Technology|CHAPTER 3 The Variable Rotation Polishing Method in theCMP Process|CHAPTER 4 The Polishing Performance of Variable Rotation Polishing Method|CHAPTER 5 Mechanisms Analysis of the Variable Rotation Polishing Method|CHAPTER 6 <b>Polishing</b> <b>Pad</b> Analysis by 3 D Topography Observation|CHAPTER 7 Conclusions九州工業大学平成 26 年...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In a {{chemical}} mechanical polishing (CMP) process, the removal rate {{is affected by}} the actual contact conditions between the wafer and the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad.</b> The <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> {{is one of the most}} important consumable materials: when the wafer is polished, the pad surface asperity changes. Further, the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface asperity has a substantial influence on the actual contact conditions. Therefore, measurement and quantitative evaluation methods for the pad surface asperity have been proposed by various research institutes. We have developed a novel measurement and quantitative evaluation method for <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface asperity based on contact image analysis using an image rotation prism. We have proposed four effective evaluation parameters: the number of contact points, the contact ratio, the maximum value of the minimum spacing of the contact points, and the half-width of the peak of the spatial Fast Fourier transform (FFT) result of a contact image. This paper discusses the change in the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface asperity measured by the proposed evaluation parameters in serial batch polishing tests. In particular, this research focused on the relationships between the proposed evaluation parameters and the removal rate, which change with an increase in the number of serial batch polishing tests.

The angular velocity of workpiece vibrated at the moment of contacting with the ring. After that the angular velocity of workpiece increased gradually and fluctuated at a given value, while the angular velocity of ring decreased gradually and also fluctuated at a given value. Since the contact between the workpiece and the ring was linear, their linear velocities and directions should be the same. But the angular velocity of workpiece was larger than that of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> on the condition that the radius of the workpiece was less than that of the ring.

40|$|Abstract. For {{manufacturing}} of Integrated Circuits (IC), Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CPM) is {{the most}} popular method to reach a global flatness in wafer fabrication. One of the most important factors to be concerned in CMP is the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad.</b> The <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> needs to be dressed to maintain the quality and the throughput of production. This is due to the wear of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> and the influence of impurities. Particularly important targets in the pad dressing are to increase the material removal rate (MRR) and a low non-uniformity (N. u.). A higher material removal rate (MRR) is achieved by higher stresses acted on to the pad. Meanwhile, stiffness properties of pad are changeable because of depth elimination and deterioration in the non-uniformity (N. u.) of pad surface. Therefore, in order to conduct an improved planarization process with higher MRR and lower N. u., an investigation of pad deformation is necessary. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop pad deformation equations for pad dressing. Firstly, the uniform circular distribution pressure is used to simulate applied loading on <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> done by dresser during dressing process. Then, the three-dimensional pad deformation depth and stiffness of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> are obtained by using Hertizian contact theorem and principle of elasticity. Finally, the superposition method is introduced to calculate the deformation resulted from total dressing force.
