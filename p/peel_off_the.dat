Takeda, who {{was a part of the}} group, explains in Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, but they found that the cost of the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing the vinyl cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> cels. To keep costs low, they made their own tap to punch holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production.|$|E

Nick visits the gas station, where he {{questions}} Bo about Carly's whereabouts. When she tries to gain Nick's attention, Bo cuts off the tip of Carly's finger, but she uses the blood from her finger to open her glued lips apart and screams for help. Nick fends off Bo and frees Carly. Meanwhile, Dalton finds Wade, who is still alive but unable to move because of the wax. Attempting to <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> wax, Dalton realizes that he is unintentionally removing Wade's skin in the process. Vincent finds Dalton and slashes Wade's face with a machete, killing him. After a chase through the museum, Vincent catches Dalton and beheads him. Meanwhile, Nick and Carly realize {{that all of the}} town's inhabitants are real people covered in wax and that Bo and Vincent have been luring people in and covering them in wax to make the figures look more realistic.|$|E
2500|$|Blocking is {{an attempt}} to direct an attack hit by the opponents back into their court by {{reaching}} above the top of the net. [...] Players often decide against blocking (if the pass and set are not in a good position to produce a spike attack) and instead opt to <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> net and dig. [...] This peeling action is a skill almost exclusive to beach volleyball.|$|E

2500|$|Capitol {{initially}} ordered plant {{managers to}} destroy the covers, and the Jacksonville plant delivered most of its copies to a landfill. However, faced with so many jackets already printed, Capitol decided instead to paste a much more conventional cover over the old ones. The new cover, featuring {{a picture of the}} band posed around an open steamer trunk, had to be trimmed on the open end by about 3mm (1/8inch) because the new sheet, known as a [...] "slick", was not placed exactly [...] "square" [...] on top of the original cover. Tens of thousands of these so-called [...] "Trunk" [...] covers were sent out. As word of this manoeuvre became known to the public, owners of the altered cover attempted, usually unsuccessfully, to <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pasted-over cover, hoping to reveal the original image hidden beneath. Eventually, the soaring value and desirability of unpasted-over Butcher covers spurred the development of intricate and complex techniques for peeling the Trunk cover off {{in such a way that}} only faint horizontal glue lines remained on the original cover.|$|E

The decorticator which makes through this research may achieve good results that the husking yield is bigger than 85 %, percentages of damage is smaller than 10 %, the broken kernel rate is smaller than 7 %. And it provides the theory basis for the improvement design and use of the next generation installment for peeling the shell...|$|R
50|$|Peel, {{also known}} as rind or skin, is the outer {{protective}} layer of a fruit or vegetable which can be <b>peeled</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> rind is usually the botanical exocarp, but the term exocarp also includes the hard cases of nuts, which are not named peels since they are not <b>peeled</b> <b>off</b> by hand or peeler, but rather shells because of their hardness.|$|R

60|$|By degrees {{the hull}} of the Demerara began to break up. Her timbers writhed and snapped under {{the force of the}} ever-thundering waves as if tormented. The deck was blown out by the {{confined}} and compressed air. The copper began to <b>peel</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> planks to loosen, and soon it became evident that the mast to which the crew were lashed could not long hold up. Thus, for ten apparently endless hours the perishing seamen hung suspended over what seemed to be their grave. They hung thus in the midst of pitchy darkness after their blazing tar-barrels had been extinguished.|$|E

The animals always know when they are coming, and when I see the mules uneasy and apprehensive, I always choose some level spot {{where there is no}} fear of rocks coming rolling down on us, and halt there. The first shock may be so slight that one hardly feels it, but the mules know all about it. They {{straddle}} their legs and brace themselves up or else lie down on the ground. When I see them do that I know that the next shock {{is going to be a}} smart one, and I lie down too. It is nothing when you are out in the country, but in the towns it is terrible. People rush out into the streets screaming with fear, If they are near a church they make for that; if not, they kneel down in the streets, where they are pretty safe, the houses being so low and mostly thatched. I have never seen one severe enough to bring the houses down, but I have seen them crack, and parapets tumble down, and great pieces <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> walls. What with the dust, and the screams of the women and children, and the ringing of all the church bells, it is enough to shake a man’s courage I can tell you.” ...|$|E
60|$|On this, {{the first}} occasion, the whale made the water foam, half-filled the boat, {{and would have}} dragged it under, but for the vigour of the negro's arm, and the home {{character}} of the blow, which caused the fish to turn up and breathe his last, before {{he had time to}} run any great distance. The governor arrived on the spot, just as Bob had got a hawser to the whale and was ready to fill away for the South Cape channel again. The vessels passed each other cheering, and the governor admonished his friend not to carry the carcass too near the dwellings, lest it should render them uninhabitable. But Betts had his anchorage already in his eye, and away he went, with the wind on his quarter, towing his prize at the rate of four or five knots. It may be said, here, that the Martha went into the passage, and that the whale was floated into shallow water, where sinking was out of the question, and Bob and his Kannakas, about twenty in number, went to work to <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> blubber in a very efficient, though not in a very scientific, or artistical manner. They got the creature stripped of its jacket of fat that very night, and next morning the Martha appeared with a set of kettles, in which the blubber was tried out. Casks were also brought in the sloop, and, when the work was done, it was found that that single whale yielded one hundred and eleven barrels of oil, of which thirty-three barrels were head-matter! This was a capital commencement for the new trade, and Betts conveyed the whole of his prize to the Reef, where the oil was started into the ground-tier of the Rancocus, the casks of which were newly repaired, and ready stowed to receive it.|$|E
