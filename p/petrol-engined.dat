25|$|Enrico Bernardi's 1882 one-cylinder <b>petrol-engined</b> tricycle, the Motrice Pia, is {{considered}} by a few sources as the first gasoline internal combustion motorcycle, {{and in fact the}} first ever internal combustion vehicle. The Motrice Pia is not mentioned in any mainstream sources. While there is some discussion in mainstream sources of the merits of Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede or Roper steam velocipede versus the Reitwagen, there is no debate that considers the merits of the Motrice Pia.|$|E
25|$|On March 18, 2010, Holden {{issued a}} recall for 9,098 <b>petrol-engined</b> 2010 model year Cruzes in Australia and a further 485 in New Zealand over a faulty fuel hose. According to Holden, some hoses on 1.8-liter cars had {{developed}} a leakage, although no accidents or injuries had been reported prior to the recall. The recall followed a stop-delivery notice issued by Holden to its dealers on March 3 while the automaker conducted {{an investigation into the}} matter.|$|E
25|$|There {{was only}} one mass-produced {{derivative}} of the PS1, this was the coach variant with drop-frame extension for a luggage boot. This was coded PS1/1, and {{was a very strong}} seller, forming the major postwar fleet renewals for large UK coach firms such as Southdown Motor Services, Ribble, Wallace Arnold, Grey-Green and Barton Transport. Sales of the PS1 only ended in 1950 although it was nominally replaced by the PS2 on the home market from 1948, this gives an idea of the scale of advance orders for this coach. Many coachbuilers worldwide produced bodies on the Tiger PS, as the model was introduced at the all-time peak in demand for new buses and coaches few operators could get the body of their first choice within an acceptable time. Barton got most of its coaches fitted with Duple bodies but built its own body for its 490 (HVO729), to an American outline with shallow full-depth sliding side glazing. Wallace Arnold bought over a Leeds coachbuilder, Wilks and Meade, in 1942 to get enough bodies reserved for postwar reconstruction. Between 1946 and 1950 Wallace Arnold took 37 PS1, 11 PS2, 34 Bedford OB, 24 AEC Regals, ten Daimler CVD6 and one Guy Arab, a fairly typical sample of coach-buying preferences at the time. Southdown used six coachbuiilders on its all-Tiger coach fleet. Whilst Ribble refitted its later prewar Tiger coaches (which had previously been <b>petrol-engined)</b> with PS1 running units as well as taking PS1/1s.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only <b>petrol-engined</b> vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. Heater plugs were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|E
25|$|At {{the launch}} of the Ninety Land Rover had insisted that there would not be a 2.5-litre {{development}} of the petrol engine. However, buyer demand and economics made the change inevitable. The larger petrol engine was launched in 1985 (having been developed under the codename 'Project Harrier') and, like its 2.25-litre predecessor it had much in common with the diesel engine. The block was identical, as were most ancillary parts. The key difference was that the petrol engine retained its timing chain, since it lacked the need to drive an injector pump. The cylinder head was adapted to use unleaded fuel. As before, the engine was smooth and refined, and provided the Land Rover with adequate road performance. However, as fuel prices rose and diesel engines improved sales of the petrol engines fell, especially in Europe. It remained a popular option in Africa and other areas where fuel prices or the simplicity of the engine made it an attractive option. It remained available until 1994; although by this time sales had dwindled to almost nothing {{in the face of a}} new generation of refined diesel engines. By this time buyers were limited to those with specific reasons to buy <b>petrol-engined</b> vehicles- for example several police forces in the UK bought fleets of 2.5 petrol Defenders in the mid-1990s because a diesel-engined vehicles would have caused maintenance and logistical problems when operated alongside the fleet of standard patrol cars, all of which were petrol fuelled.|$|E
2500|$|A fuel {{efficient}} two-cylinder diesel was prototyped {{in the mid}} 1980s with a G40 supercharger to overcome its small capacity, although this {{did not make it}} to production. A high fuel efficiency model which did make production was the <b>petrol-engined</b> Formel E (E for Economy), introduced at the launch in 1981 with a 1.1 litre engine and from 1983 with a 1.3 litre engine, overdrive top-gear ratio and an early stop-start ignition system (called [...] "SSA") which would cut the engine when idle for more than two seconds to save fuel whilst temporarily stopped in traffic, and restart the engine on moving the gear lever to the left in neutral.|$|E
50|$|Alpina {{produced}} two variants of the F10/F11 5 Series, the <b>petrol-engined</b> B5 and diesel-engined D5.|$|E
50|$|Alpina {{produced}} two variants {{based on the}} BMW 5 Series (F10), the <b>petrol-engined</b> B5 and diesel-engined D5.|$|E
50|$|She {{was built}} in 1931 by Thornycrofts of Southampton, as a twin <b>petrol-engined</b> wooden {{carvel-built}} motor yacht.|$|E
50|$|The last <b>petrol-engined</b> BF {{was built}} on 30 June, while LPG E-Gas models {{continued}} until September 2010.|$|E
50|$|The launch {{models were}} the <b>petrol-engined</b> 420i, 428i and 435i, and the diesel 418d and 420d. The 435i Gran Coupe is {{approximately}} 200 lb {{heavier than the}} equivalent F30 335i sedan.|$|E
5000|$|Atco in {{more recent}} years have been {{producing}} rotary mowers powered by either petrol or electricity. Production of <b>petrol-engined</b> cylinder mowers continues with the [...] "Clipper" [...] range, in three sizes.|$|E
50|$|Belhaven built {{steam and}} <b>petrol-engined</b> {{vehicles}} from 1908 at their 'Belhaven Engineering and Motors' works in Wishaw Scotland. The petrol-powered, chain driven lorries (trucks) initially used Tyler engines, then latterly Aster units.|$|E
50|$|Its {{international}} launch was in Las Vegas in January 2014. The launch {{models were}} the <b>petrol-engined</b> 428i and 435i, and the diesel 420d. All-wheel drive (xDrive) became available {{a few months}} after the launch.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, where petrol is {{much more}} {{expensive}} than in the USA, V6 diesels have proved a more popular option. The American-designed Chrysler 300C has a 3-litre Mercedes V6 engine, which vastly outsells the <b>petrol-engined</b> car.|$|E
50|$|From 1968, the SB series used {{computer}} classification codes from Bedford's parent company General Motors, with the <b>petrol-engined</b> SB3 variant becoming NFM, and the diesel-engined SB5 variant becoming NJM. However, they were rarely referred to under these codes.|$|E
50|$|The Bertone {{cabriolet}} {{was sold}} in various European markets in <b>petrol-engined</b> form only (75S, 85S, 100S; some with fuel injection) until 1988. There were various special editions including the Ritmo Cabrio Chrono and Ritmo Cabrio Bianco (all white).|$|E
50|$|Across the range, {{two types}} of {{six-speed}} automatic transmission became default depending on model variants. For <b>petrol-engined</b> RWDâ€”the ZF 6HP26 transmission; for diesel-engined RWD and AWD the ZF-based, 6R80 transmission produced by Ford in the United States is used.|$|E
5000|$|From 1943 to 1945 a {{total of}} 408 <b>petrol-engined</b> 3Ro BM (564B), for Benzina Militare or [...] "petrol, military", were produced. Like the natural gas engine, the Tipo 102B inline-five petrol {{was derived from the}} diesel, with new 16-valve heads.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century, {{railways}} were exploring ways to provide more frequent, lower-cost ways of providing local passenger facilities, and the LBSCR introduced <b>petrol-engined</b> railcars in the early 1900s. They had 48 seats and were acquired from Dick Kerr.|$|E
5000|$|The sixth {{generation}} Minicab (U60-series) {{was introduced}} in 1999 now sporting a new semi-front design. By April 1999, a [...] "wagon" [...] version called the Town Box was introduced. 419,070 <b>petrol-engined</b> U60s were built, but the Minicab MiEV remains in production as of 2017.|$|E
5000|$|... 14. Narrow Gauge Railway System: A {{network of}} [...] narrow gauge {{railways}} was built {{so as to}} rearm and resupply the main fortresses (ouvrages) from supply depots up to 50 km away. <b>Petrol-engined</b> armoured locomotives pulled supply trains along these narrow-gauge lines. (A similar system was developed with armored steam engines back in 1914-1918.) ...|$|E
50|$|Beach Armoured Recovery Vehicle (BARV) - British {{conversion}} of Sherman III with large boat-shaped superstructure that {{was capable of}} deep wading near the shore. A simple push/pull ARV that served until replaced by Centurion BARV in the mid-1960s. The diesel-engined Sherman III was considered {{less likely to be}} affected by the wet environment than <b>petrol-engined</b> versions.|$|E
50|$|The Fiat 1900, {{introduced}} in 1952, was an upmarket model that {{used the same}} body as the 1400, but came with a 1.9 litre engine and more standard features. The <b>petrol-engined</b> Fiat 1900 A, {{introduced in}} 1954, now offered a claimed 70 bhp. It also featured a hydraulically operated clutch and, unusually for that time, a five speed column shifted manual transmission.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was also}} {{assembled}} by Scaldia-Volga SA in Brussels, Belgium. In Belgium {{the car was}} sold as the Scaldia 1300/1400, although Scaldia also installed Perkins' 1.8-litre 4.108 engine in the Scaldia Diesel beginning in 1968. This model offered [...] SAE but lacked the twin headlamps of the <b>petrol-engined</b> export 408. Some sources also list the 1.6-litre Perkins 4.99 as having been available earlier.|$|E
50|$|The Comprex {{system has}} two shortcomings; one, that the exhaust gases intermingles with {{the fresh air}} needed for combustion, leading to some {{recirculation}} of burnt gas. Secondly, this co-mingling also raises {{the temperature of the}} intake gas. Both of these are much less of a problem in a diesel than a petrol engine, hence the Comprex' rarity in <b>petrol-engined</b> applications.|$|E
50|$|In 1948 {{restrictions}} on purchasing new vehicles were relaxed, {{and the bus}} fleet was quickly standardised almost entirely on locally-built Daimler double deckers with an open platform at the rear and the diesel engine at the front. The last <b>petrol-engined</b> bus was replaced in 1949. Many of the wartime specification buses were in poor condition {{and had to be}} re-bodied, some at the department's Keresley works.|$|E
5000|$|A {{delegation}} {{from the}} US, {{in addition to}} UK-based organisers, was flown to Egypt. Israel then allowed a [...] "convoy of 200 U.S. activists ... to cross into the Gaza Strip via Egypt on" [...] 17 July 2009. Much of their aid (including 33 small Chinese-built Geeley 1.6-litre <b>petrol-engined</b> sedan cars) was refused entry. The operation was figure-headed by George Galloway and Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic.|$|E
50|$|The {{cement works}} had three {{industrial}} railway systems: one standard gauge, one three foot gauge and one 1ft 11in gauge. The standard gauge system used saddle tank steam locomotives: four 0-4-0s and one Hunslet 0-6-0. The three foot gauge system used {{a mixture of}} Peckett and other 0-4-0 saddle tanks, a Kerr, Stuart 0-4-2ST, Sentinel vertical-boiler locomotives and Fowler diesel locomotives. The 1 ft 11in gauge system used Simplex <b>petrol-engined</b> locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|Three new {{diesel engines}} were {{developed}} for the trucks, respectively of 3.97 litres, 5.42 litres and 5.95 litres cylinder capacity. [...] The smallest unit was of four cylinders while the larger engines employed six cylinders. [...] Claimed power ranged from 82.5 bhp to 128 bhp. [...] Possibly {{with an eye to}} export markets outside Europe, <b>petrol-engined</b> versions with power outputs of 129 bhp and 149 bhp were also offered.|$|E
50|$|Enrico Bernardis 1882 one-cylinder <b>petrol-engined</b> tricycle, the Motrice Pia, is {{considered}} by a few sources as the first gasoline internal combustion motorcycle, {{and in fact the}} first ever internal combustion vehicle.

While there is some discussion in mainstream sources of the merits of Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede or Roper steam velocipede versus the Reitwagen, there is no debate that considers the merits of the Motrice Pia.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{powered by a}} {{rear-mounted}} four-stroke engine, manufactured by Peugeot themselves. The engine's two cylinders were mounted in parallel {{and not in the}} V-format used for the company's first <b>petrol-engined</b> vehicle. The engine was mounted behind the driver and his (or, at least in principle, her) passenger above the rear axle. A maximum output of between 3 and 5 hp was delivered to the rear wheels via a chain-drive mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|From 1906 {{to around}} 1930, New Zealand Railways had {{been experimenting with}} ways to provide for fast {{passenger}} services where numbers of passengers were too few to warrant a full passenger train. 'One locomotive and one carriage' combinations were tried in 1906 and 1929 but proved unsuccessful. A long succession of railcars (including <b>petrol-engined,</b> petrol-electric, battery-electric, and steam) was tried from 1912, but these were all mechanically unreliable, mechanically unsuitable, or uneconomic.|$|E
50|$|On March 18, 2010, Holden {{issued a}} recall for 9,098 <b>petrol-engined</b> 2010 model year Cruzes in Australia and a further 485 in New Zealand over a faulty fuel hose.

50|$|By 1935 the {{trolleybus}} fleet {{had reached}} its peak at 106 vehicles, making it the largest fleet in the country. The last tram ran in September 1936. World War II brought reduced services, economy measures (including diluting diesel with creosote) and blackout screens on vehicles. Before the war some diesel-engined buses were introduced, although large scale deliveries of buses {{did not take place}} until after the war. The advent of diesel services enabled the last <b>petrol-engined</b> buses to be withdrawn.|$|E
