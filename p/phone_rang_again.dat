5000|$|Cheri {{leaves her}} house {{to have sex with}} Aaron at the cemetery. Aaron is {{reclining}} against a tombstone that has a stone angel on top. The angel's neck is damaged and the heavy stone head falls onto Aaron's face, killing him instantly and mutilating his face. Cheri runs away from the scene, not realizing that she has dropped the set of keys that Frank found in the earlier scene. Cheri borrows her father's car and goes to the convenience store to get Duffy's bowling ball, intending to replace the angel head with the bowling ball and implicate Duffy as killing Aaron.

50|$|The play {{opens with}} the ominous ringing of an off-stage {{telephone}}. As the lights come up Ruth and Jack, {{a couple in}} their mid-thirties, are dancing in their apartment. The telephone <b>rings</b> <b>again,</b> the couple stops, the music backs up a few measures and they begin to dance. Ruth and Jack dance on and converse about what a good time they are having; after a few lines the telephone rings, the music backs up a few measures and the conversation also goes back a few lines and this time changes direction. A few lines go by and the <b>phone</b> <b>rings</b> <b>again,</b> and the conversation once more rewinds and restarts, yet again changing focus. This pattern of rewinding and restarting the conversation in a different vein continues throughout the play whenever the unseen telephone rings. This convention {{is similar to the}} bell ringing in Ives’s previous work Sure Thing (one of six plays in the collection All in the Timing). As the play progresses the audience learns that the couple is in a tenuous state in their relationship and the happiness seen as the play opens is not the prevalent mood. Ruth is Jewish; Jack is a former Catholic. Ruth believes in hard work and success; Jack is lazy and has no goals. Ruth desperately wants to be married; Jack hates the idea of marriage. With each <b>ring</b> of the <b>phone,</b> the love affair dissolves into a more intense argument about religion, the future or marriage; however, this does not prevent a build-up of hope with each ring that perhaps the couple may work out their differences and come to an agreement. At one point Ruth and Jack even switch positions: Jack argues for marriage, Ruth argues against it, and it is this final argument that leads to the dissolution of their relationship. After a slew of “fuck you’s” from Jack and “leave’s” from Ruth, the two realize they can no longer be together, but they also {{do not know how to}} function without one another. The play ends with a final <b>phone</b> <b>ring</b> and the couple beginning to dance as they did in the start of the play.|$|R
