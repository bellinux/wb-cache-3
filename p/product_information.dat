25|$|Just under {{half the}} world's {{population}} {{is currently on}} the Internet. Roughly 75% {{of those people are}} on social media and ¾ of those folks have social media accounts on their mobile phones. Mobile phone usage is beneficial for social media marketing because mobile phones have social networking capabilities, allowing individuals immediate web browsing and access to social networking sites. Mobile phones have grown at a rapid rate, fundamentally altering the path-to-purchase process by allowing consumers to easily obtain pricing and <b>product</b> <b>information</b> in real time and allowing companies to constantly remind and update their followers. Many companies are now putting QR (Quick Response) codes along with products for individuals to access the company website or online services with their smart phones. Retailers use QR codes to facilitate consumer interaction with brands by linking the code to brand websites, promotions, <b>product</b> <b>information,</b> or any other mobile-enabled content. In addition, Real-time bidding use in the mobile advertising industry is high and rising because of its value for on-the-go web browsing. In 2012, Nexage, a provider of real time bidding in mobile advertising, reported a 37% increase in revenue each month. Adfonic, another mobile advertisement publishing platform, reported an increase of 22 billion ad requests that same year.|$|E

Very rare effects include abnormal behaviour, psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide. In {{a total of}} 5577 adverse reactions reported to the UK's MHRA up to 31 March 2017, the majority (1207, or 22%) concerned psychiatric effects. There were 85 reports of suicidal ideation, 56 of completed suicide and 43 of suicide attempts. Isotretinoin is the only non-psychiatric drug on the FDA's top 10 list of drugs associated with depression and is also within the top 10 for suicide attempts.|$|E
25|$|In February 1982, AMD {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Intel, becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of 8086 and 8088 processors. IBM wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its IBM PC, but IBM's policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the Am286 under the same arrangement. In 1984 Intel, in order to shore up its advantage in the marketplace, internally decided to no longer cooperate with AMD in supplying <b>product</b> <b>information,</b> and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the Intel 80386 to AMD. In 1987, AMD invoked arbitration over the issue, and Intel reacted by cancelling the 1982 technological-exchange agreement altogether. After three years of testimony, AMD eventually won in arbitration in 1992, but Intel disputed this decision. Another long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the Supreme Court of California sided with the arbitrator and AMD.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, the company's {{growth has been}} fueled by an {{increase}} in broadband Internet access, which loads virtual catalogs faster than dial-up Internet access. When catalogs first appeared online in the late 1990s, the graphics took too long to load. After high-speed Internet access became more popular, virtual catalogs quickly grew to become a popular feature of online stores. In addition to faster Internet connectivity, a study in 2000 noted that an online presence for brick and mortar businesses increased offline sales by an average of 27%. Mack also pointed out that having more <b>product</b> <b>information</b> disseminated helps play a role in increasing sales: [...] "We have the ability to provide consistent information...

500|$|The {{antivenom}} manufacturer's <b>product</b> <b>information</b> recommends one vial, {{although more}} has been used. Past guidelines indicated two vials, with a further two vials recommended if symptoms did not resolve within two hours, however recent guidelines state [...] "antivenom is sometimes given {{if there is}} a history, symptoms and signs consistent with systemic envenoming, and severe pain unresponsive to oral analgesics ... however recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. The antivenom can be given by injection intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). The manufacturer recommends IM use, with IV administration reserved for life-threatening cases. In January 2008 toxicologist Geoffrey Isbister suggested IM antivenom was not as effective as IV antivenom, after proposing that IM antivenom took longer to reach the blood serum. Isbister subsequently found the difference between IV and IM routes of administration was, at best, small and did not justify routinely choosing one route over the other.|$|E

40|$|Context. For {{the product}} manager, the product context analysis, {{which aims to}} align their {{products}} to the market needs, is very important. By understanding the market needs, the product manager knows the <b>product</b> context <b>information</b> about the environment the products conceived and the business the products take place. The product context analysis using the <b>product</b> context <b>information</b> helps the <b>product</b> manager find the accurate position of his/her products and support the decision-making of the products. The <b>product</b> context <b>information</b> generally {{could be found in}} the user feedbacks. And the traditional techniques of acquiring the user feedbacks can be replaced by collecting the existed online user feedbacks with a cheaper cost. Therefore, researchers did studies on the online user feedbacks and the results showed those user feedbacks contain the <b>product</b> context <b>information.</b> Therefore, in this study, I tried to elicit the <b>product</b> context <b>information</b> from the user feedbacks posted on Twitter. Objectives. Objectives of this study are 1. I investigated what kinds of Apps can be used to collect   more related Tweets, and 2. I investigated what kinds of <b>product</b> context <b>information</b> can be elicited from the collected Tweets. Methods. To achieve the first objective, I designed unified criteria for selecting Apps and collecting App-related Tweets, and then conduct the statistical analysis to find out what is/are the factor(s) affect (s) the Tweets collection. To achieve the second objective, I conducted the directed content analysis on the collected Tweets with an indicator for identifying the <b>product</b> context <b>information,</b> and then make a descriptive statistical analysis of the elicited <b>product</b> context <b>information.</b> Results. I found the top-ranked Apps or Apps in few themes like “Health and Fitness” and “Games” have more and fresher App-related Tweets. And from my collected Tweets, I can elicit at least 15 types of <b>product</b> context <b>information,</b> the types include “user experience”, “use case”, “partner”, “competitor”, “platforms” and so on. Conclusions. This is an exploratory study of eliciting <b>product</b> context <b>information</b> from the Tweets. It presented the method of collecting the App-related Tweets and eliciting <b>product</b> context <b>information</b> from the collected Tweets. It showed what kinds of App are suitable to do so and what types of <b>product</b> context <b>information</b> can be elicited from the Tweets. This study let us be aware of that the Tweets can be used for the product context analysis, and let us know the appropriate condition to use the Tweets for the product context analysis...|$|R

40|$|Concern about {{asymmetric}} information in markets for consumer {{goods and services}} has focused on <b>product</b> attribute <b>information.</b> We highlight the importance of another category of information—product use information.

Moreover, we show that the classic unraveling results do not extend to <b>product</b> use <b>information,</b> and thus sellers {{are less likely to}} voluntarily disclose this type of information. Our findings have important policy implications: While most disclosure mandates target <b>product</b> attribute <b>information,</b> our analysis suggests that mandating disclosure of <b>product</b> use <b>information</b> may be more important.
