It is suggested that the export growth at this sea port will positively influence the economical development of the Batam city. The secondary data collection is originated from BPS sources.

Preliminary findings showed that the industrial activities of the Batam Island had a positive impact to the industrial, construction, transportation and trade segments. Additionally, primary data were accessed from the port users. These data were processed by the factor analysis methodology. The findings indicate that the larger the terminal, storage facilities and transportation networks were at the port, the higher the attraction factor becomes to the user.

Further, as {{there is no evidence that}} value is highly correlated with costs (regardless of functional form) a possible method for designing a national user fee structure to replace the HMT is presented. This structure would be compliant with the US Supreme Court requisites for a user fee; it includes variables such as tonnage, port stay and draft, which are found to be correlated with costs using regression analysis. In addition, a method to statistically derive appropriate fee weights (rather than arbitrarily assigning) for each of these variables is outlined and illustrated by a numerical example. Currently, missing data represent a severe restriction to the design and appropriate implementation of user fees in the United States; these data could be collected but not without new procedures and incurring additional costs. ...|$|E
40|$|Industry {{standard}} numerical {{models are}} excellent and accurate tools {{for analysis of}} port plans and design. They link meteorological and oceanographic information to impacts on moored vessels and thereby provide the metocean conditions along the berths. By use of relevant motion and safety criteria for moored vessels, numerical modelling studies can assist the designer and the port owner to determine the optimal protection for the port operation. Operators and users of an exposed port or terminal will {{from time to time}} experience downtime due to adverse weather conditions. Downtime can be associated with strong currents in the approach channel and port entrance or with difficulties encountered for pilot assistance. It can also be due to excessive motions of the vessel resulting in suspension of loading/unloading by cranes or over ramps. If the port operator and the <b>port</b> <b>user</b> receive early information on conditions in and around the port and is able to interpret this information into expected conditions for arriving vessels {{they will be able to}} make prudent decisions on optimal and safe arrival at the port.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyse the effect of the type of concession contracts on <b>port</b> <b>user</b> surplus and on profits of terminal operators (or port authorities) with the help of game theory. We have selected three ports in Pakistan to perform this analysis. These ports function as ‘landlords’ and have signed concession contracts with private container terminal operators. However, the features of the contracts at present are different for each terminal. We analyse four cases in this article. The first case is the present situation in which we treat competition between terminals as a Bertrand game in which each terminal non-cooperatively determines charges for container handling and pays fees to port authorities according to the contract. The Bertrand model seems to reproduce, to a satisfactory degree, the market shares and handling fees observed. Furthermore, in the second and third cases, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted by solving the Bertrand model. The results reveal that in the long run it is profitable for the Karachi Port to establish a same fixed fee contract with its private terminals. However, users are better off in a situation where a percentage fee concession contract would be adopted instead. The game theoretic framework is then extended to the analysis of the strategic decision faced by port authorities with respect to the trade-off between unit fees and annual rent in the last case. An optimal concession contract is obtained that is feasible for both parties in the sense that it contains high unit fees (variable cost) and low annual rent (fixed cost). ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} and {{validate}} the dimensions of supply chain collaboration and collaborative advantage in the containerised maritime industry and explores the impact of supply chain collaboration on collaborative advantage and port performance. Additionally, this thesis tests a mediation effect of collaborative advantage {{on the relationship between}} supply chain collaboration and port performance. This thesis employs a quantitative method. A theoretical model is built based on thorough literature reviews of supply chain management and maritime studies, in-depth discussions with experts, item review and Q-sorting techniques to signify ambiguity or misunderstanding with the scales and to suggest modifications. The proposed model is empirically tested with survey data using 178 responses from terminal operators, shipping lines, inland transport companies, freight forwarders, ship management companies and third-party logistics providers involved in maritime logistics in the major containers ports of Busan, Gwangyang and Incheon for a comprehensive and balanced view by using structural equation modelling. With regard to the findings of the empirical research, three main constructs were successfully validated as multi-dimensional constructs. The structural paths support hypotheses that supply chain collaboration has a positive influence on collaborative advantage, and collaborative advantage has a strong contribution to port performance. However, the direct impact of supply chain collaboration on port performance is insignificant. A hierarchical approach of the mediation test and bootstrapping test found that the association between supply chain collaboration and port performance is fully mediated by collaborative advantage. In other words, the greater degree of supply chain collaboration between the port and <b>port</b> <b>user</b> enables them to gain a higher degree of collaborative advantage, and, in turn, this collaborative advantage can contribute to augmenting port performance. This thesis synthesises transaction cost theory, resource based theory and a relational view to explain how supply chain collaboration influences collaborative advantage and port performance. Its theoretical contribution expands the concept of supply chain collaboration and collaborative advantage into containerised maritime contexts, capturing the perspective of the ports and port users. Further, despite numerous maritime studies which extol the importance of collaboration between the ports and port users, no systematic approach has previously developed and validated those constructs and relationships. The various maritime logistics organisations would benefit from applying {{the results of this study}} to their supply chain collaboration practices when seeking greater collaborative advantage. The results heed practitioners in containerised maritime logistics organisations to focus on balancing the facets of supply chain collaboration to transport flows of containers seamlessly and efficiently from door-to-door, as supply chain management philosophy drives the maritim...|$|E
