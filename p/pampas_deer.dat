The felines found in Brazil are the jaguar, the puma, the margay, the ocelot, the oncilla, and the jaguarundi. Other notable animals include the giant anteater, several {{varieties}} of sloths and armadillos, coati, giant river otter, tapir, peccaries, marsh deer, <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer,</b> and capybara (the world's largest existing rodent).

2500|$|<b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> {{have been}} seen eating new green growth, shrubs, and herbs. [...] Most of the plant life they consume grows in moist soils. [...] To see if <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> compete with cattle for food, their feces were studied and {{compared}} to cattle feces. [...] They do in fact eat the same plants, but in different proportions. [...] The <b>pampas</b> <b>deer</b> eat less grass and more forbs (flowering broad leafed plants with soft stems) and browse (shoots, leaves, and twigs), respectively. [...] During the rainy season, 20% of their diet consists of new grasses. [...] They will move with the availability of food, particularly the flowering plants.

2500|$|The <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> {{have been}} {{harvested}} into the millions. [...] Between 1860 and 1870, documents for {{the port of}} Buenos Aires alone show that two million <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> pelts were sent to Europe. [...] Many years later, as roads were built through the pampas, cars made it even easier for poachers {{to get to the}} deer. [...] They were also killed for food, medicinal purposes, and for sport. [...] As of 2003, there are fewer than 2,000 of them in Argentina and Uruguay. [...] Both Argentina and Uruguay have declared the <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> [...] "natural monuments" [...] but the hunting continues, although much less frequently now. [...] The decimation of the <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> has been likened to that of the bison of North America. [...] Also similar to the bison, is the role they played {{in the life of the}} Native Americans of Uruguay and Argentina, being used for food, hides, and medicine. [...] The Native Americans at first participated in the harvesting of the <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> pelts for sale, and in spite of that, the deer population stayed strong until the Native Americans of those countries were defeated by European settlers. [...] The settlers brought large agricultural expansion, uncontrolled hunting, and new diseases to the deer with the introduction of new domestic and feral animals.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> {{are very}} curious and like to explore. [...] Although this is endearing to observers, {{their lack of}} fleeing {{at the site of}} humans makes them easier for poachers to kill.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> are {{the most}} {{polymorphic}} mammals. [...] This large genetic variation {{reflects the fact that}} there were millions at one time. [...] Their current high nucleotide diversity shows that they had very large numbers even in just the recent past; so recent it is not reflected in their genes yet.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> have 3 subspecies: [...] O. b. bezoarticus {{that live}} in eastern and central Brazil, south of the Amazon river into Uruguay. [...] O. b. leucogaster {{that live in}} southwestern Brazil, to southeastern Bolivia, to Paraguay and into {{northern}} Argentina. [...] O. b. celer from {{the southern part of}} Argentina. [...] They are the most rare and are an endangered species.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) {{live in the}} grasslands of South America at low elevations. They {{are known}} as [...] or [...] in Spanish and as [...] in Portuguese. Their habitat {{includes}} water and hills, often with winter drought, and grass that is high enough to cover a standing deer. [...] Many of them live on the Pantanal wetlands, where there are ongoing conservation efforts, and other areas of annual flooding cycles. [...] Human activity has changed much of the original landscape.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> do {{not defend}} {{territory}} or mates, but do have displays of dominance. [...] They show dominance by keeping their heads up {{and trying to}} keep their side forward, and use slow, deliberate movements. [...] When bucks are challenging each other, they rub their horns into vegetation and scrape them on the ground. [...] They may urinate into the scrape they've made, and sometimes defecate. [...] They rub the scent glands on their heads and faces into plants and objects. [...] They usually do not fight, but just spar with each other, and they do commonly bite. [...] Sparring is initiated by the smaller buck touching noses with the larger buck.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> of {{southern}} Argentina once were very abundant but now considered a threatened species by the IUCN. [...] The IUCN separates the subspecies O. b. celer in southern Argentina as endangered. [...] The diseases that particularly plague O. b. celer are gut parasites {{and food and}} mouth diseases. [...] Their overall decline {{is due in part}} from hunting and poaching, but also from habitat loss due to agriculture, diseases from domesticated and feral livestock, competition from more recently introduced wildlife, and general over-exploitation. There is less than 1% of their natural habitat left that was present in 1900. The deer in Argentina and Uruguay have no natural predators. They used to be the prey of cougars and jaguars. Those in Brazil still have cougars to fear. Some areas of population loss are easily tracked to poaching because of the few number of deer in an area. In the mid-1970s, 10 individuals out of a group of 16 located in Punta Medanos were killed by poachers. [...] The rest were wiped out by extensive human activity. [...] Lack of funding and technology have made it difficult for biologists to track and help the deer population, but donations and grants from organizations and universities in the United States have helped immensely with the situation. [...] In 1975, there were less than 100 of subspecies O. b. celer, but by 1980 there were 400. [...] The population has been continuing to increase, although not at that high of a rate. [...] Some of the discrepancy {{is due to the fact}} that later they found groups they did not know existed.|$|E

The settlers brought large agricultural expansion, uncontrolled hunting, and new diseases to the deer with the introduction of new domestic and feral animals. Some landowners have set aside some of their property as a reserve for the deer, as well as keeping cattle instead of sheep. Sheep graze much more on the land and are more of a threat to the deer. The owners that choose cattle are doing it as a service, because more money is made from raising sheep than cattle. Conservationists encourage this trend by sharing research that more edible vegetation is available on ranches with cattle and deer during times of drought than on ranches with cattle and sheep.|$|E

[...] They are known {{to live up to}} 12 years in the wild, longer if captive, but are threatened due to over-hunting and habitat loss. [...] Many people are concerned over this loss, because a healthy deer population means a healthy grassland, and a healthy grassland is home to many species, some also threatened. Many North American birds migrate south to these areas, and if the <b>Pampas</b> <b>deer</b> habitat is lost, they are afraid these bird species will also decline.
