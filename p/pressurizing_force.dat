40|$|An {{important}} aspect of the Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) program is the development of a casting process by which volatile actinide element (i. e., americium) can be incorporated into metallic alloy fuel pins. The traditional metal fuel casting process uses an inductively heated crucible. The process involves evacuation of the furnace. The evacuation of the furnace also evacuates quartz rods used as fuel pin molds. Once evacuated the open ends of the molds are lowered into the melt; the casting furnace is then rapidly <b>pressurized,</b> <b>forcing</b> the molten metal up into the evacuated molds where solidification occurs. This process works well for the fabrication of metal fuel pins traditionally composed of alloys of uranium and plutonium, but does not work well when highly volatile actinides are included in the melt. Candidate design concepts are being evaluated for their potential to successfully cast alloys containing volatile actinides. The selection of design concepts has been conducted in close cooperation with ANL staff. The research centers on the development of advanced numerical models to assess conditions that significantly impact the transport of volatile actinides during the melt casting process...|$|R

In practice, a metering valve prevents hydraulic pressure from reaching the front calipers until pressure rises enough to overcome the return springs in the drum brakes. If the metering valve were left out, the vehicle would stop only with the front discs until return spring pressure on the rear shoes were overcome.|$|R
50|$|The Fountain Paint Pot {{is named}} for the reds, yellows and browns of the mud in this area. The differing colors are derived from {{oxidation}} states of the iron in the mud.

40|$|AbstractDouble-stranded DNA bacteriophages {{are highly}} <b>pressurized,</b> {{providing}} a <b>force</b> driving ejection {{of a significant}} fraction of the genome from its capsid.

We employed an in vitro osmotic suppression system with high-molecular-weight polyethylene glycol to study P 22 E protein release. While slow ejection of the DNA can be triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the rate is significantly enhanced by the membrane protein OmpA from Salmonella. In contrast, E proteins are not ejected unless both OmpA and LPS are present and their ejection when OmpA is present is largely complete before any genome is ejected, suggesting that E proteins {{play a key role in}} the early stage of transferring P 22 DNA into the host...|$|R

The electrostatic membrane was found to operate well in an open-loop sense, showing a high degree of position stability and negligible power consumption in dry air. Visco-electric creep was not evident, but the polymer membrane did expand and contract considerably due to its hygroscopic expansion coefficient. A residual roughness of about 0. 75 mm existed with the polymer used in these tests; this error is attributed to seams and membrane anisotropy where the material is stiffer in one direction...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{processing}} {{has been}} limited {{by the lack of}} direct flow and pressure control of the polymer melt at multiple points in space and time. Improved axial and radial valve designs are discussed that require negligible actuation force to control the flow of the <b>pressurized</b> melt. The <b>forces</b> resulting from pressure loads and shear stresses are first analyzed for an axial valve pin. Subsequently, a radial valve design is implemented and experimentally characterized using neat polycarbonate. A sigmoidal response surface is fit to the experimental data and found to very well model the observed pressure drop as a function of flow rate and valve pin position. The juncture loss at the valve port is then characterized by estimating and removing the pressure drops in the circular flow segments of the valve. Analysis indicated that the juncture loss is inversely proportional to the exposed area, or vesica piscis, formed between the circular flow channel in the valve body and the flow port on the moving valve pin. While applicable to many different polymer processing operations, the validated models are used to show the dynamic valve pin position {{as a function of the}} desired flow rate and desired cavity pressure in the hot runner of an injection mold.

40|$|The DOE {{is faced}} with the {{responsibility}} of decommissioning and dismantling many of its nuclear process facilities. Much of this will involve piping systems {{which may or may}} not be contaminated with radioactive material. It is important to be able to differentiate contaminated from non-contaminated material, since the disposal costs for radioactive waste are significant (on the order of hundreds of dollars per cubic foot). In the case of pipes, this determination may be particularly difficult if the pipes are not easily accessible. As a solution to this problem, SEA is developing an inverting membrane technology, called Pipe Explorer{trademark} which uses commercial gamma spectroscopy systems to characterize the radiation levels inside of pipes. The heart of the system is an air-tight membrane which is initially spooled inside of a canister. The end of the membrane protruding out of the canister is folded over and attached to a basepipe. With this configuration, when the canister becomes <b>pressurized</b> the pressure <b>force</b> on the membrane causes the membrane to be pulled from the spool. This continues until the membrane is completely off the spool. A radiation detector is attached to the end of the membrane and towed into the pipe as the membrane continues to evert. The detector cabling is also towed into the pipe. To retrieve the system from a pipe the process is simply reversed, where the cabling, detector, and membrane are wound back onto the spool. The system can thus be used to move a detector freely back and forth through a pipe to provide high resolution analysis of the location of radioactive contamination in pipes. This unique method can deploy the detector and analyze piping systems with multiple elbows and vertical runs. The membrane also serves to protect the expensive detector from contamination...|$|R
40|$|High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) {{can provide}} clean electricity,as well as process heat {{that can be}} used to produce {{hydrogen}} for transportation and other sectors. A prototypic HTGR, the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP),will be built at Idaho National Laboratory. The need for HTGR analysis tools and methods has led to the addition of gas-cooled reactor (GCR) capabilities to the light water reactor code MELCOR. MELCOR will be used by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing of the NGNP and other HTGRs. In the present study, new input techniques have been developed for MELCOR HTGR analysis. These new techniques include methods for modeling radiation heat transfer between solid surfaces in an HTGR, calculating fuel and cladding geometric parameters for pebble bed and prismatic block-type HTGRs, and selecting appropriate input parameters for the reflector component in MELCOR. The above methods have been applied to input decks for a water-cooled reactor cavity cooling system (RCCS); the 400 MW Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR), the input for which is based on a code-to-code benchmark activity; and the High Temperature Test Facility (HTTF), which is currently in the design phase at Oregon State University. RCCS results show that MELCOR accurately predicts radiation heat transfer rates from the vessel but may overpredict convective heat transfer rates and RCCS coolant flow rates. PBMR results show that thermal striping from hot jets in the lower plenum during steady-state operations, and in the upper plenum during a <b>pressurized</b> loss of <b>forced</b> cooling accident, may be a major design concern. Hot jets could potentially melt control rod drive mechanisms or cause thermal stresses in plenum structures. For the HTTF, results will provide data to validate MELCOR for HTGR analyses. Validation will be accomplished by comparing results from the MELCOR representation of the HTTF to experimental results from the facility. The validation process can be automated using a modular code written in Python, which is described here...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigations}} on the accident behaviour of the HTR-Modul was an assessment of expected risk. In addition to accidents in which forced cooling of the core is not possible for a prolonged period of time/ a further priority issue was the analysis of event sequences after steam generator leaks. It {{became apparent that the}} accident topology of the HTR-Modul is no longer characterized by failure of the core cooling system, {{as in the case of}} larger plants, since the possible temperature loads on the fuel elements only slightly impair their capacity to retain fission products. This is the characteristic design feature of the modular reactor; due to the coregeometry, power and power density', there is no need for a forced cooling of the core in order to prevent fission product release, even in the long term. In the case of failure of the operational cooling system, the afterheat is passively dissipated via the surface of the reactor pressure vessel to a surface cooling system lining the concrete reactor cell. The reactor pressure vessel and concrete structures are thus protected against excessively high temperatures. The fuel element temperatures reach a maximum of 1100 °C in a <b>pressurized</b> reactor without <b>forced</b> cooling. The temperatures rise to 1000 °C in the top reflector and to 320 °C in the reactor pressure vessel wall; they thus remain below the respective values specified. In the case of a depressurized reactor, the fuel element temperature increases to 510 °C and the vessel temperature to 350 °C, whereas the temperature of the top reflector decreases to 600 °C. An additional failure of the surface cooler essentially affects only the temperatures in the walls of the reactor pressure vessel and reactor cell. The vessel then reaches 600 °C and has to be depressurized. The concrete structures retain enough of their load-carrying capacity to ensure the stability of the vessel. Rupture of the sphere discharge tube was examined in order to comprehensively cover problems of criticality in hypothetical events. A high subcriticality was ascertained even for the most unfavourable rearrangement of the pebble bed. In order to control operational disturbances which would prevent a shutdown of the plant, in all cases scram of the reactor and also of the blower is envisaged for the HTR-Modul. In the case of failure of the steam generator feed together with postulated failure of blower scram, a thermal overloading of the primary circuit is not expected. The heat capacity of the primary circuit components is sufficient to absorb the stored energy of the core without the. vessel temperatures exceedingthe permissible value of 400 °C. If the reactor scram were assumed to fail simultaneously the blower would be endangered in the first instance. Studies on the pressure build-up in the primary circuit in connection with steam generator leaks have revealed that the primary circuit remains completely functional as a barrier for the risk-relevant leak sizes (< IF) even if steam generator depressurization fails. Only if the gas purification plant also fails does the pressure limiting valve of the primary circuit respond with a filtered release of the activity to the environment. If the steam generator is properly depressurized, the valve responds only once, releasing about 10...|$|R
