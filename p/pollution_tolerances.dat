40|$|The Multiple Habitat Sampling Protocol (MHSP) is a bioassessment method {{designed}} to assess the ecological health of South Carolina streams {{on the basis of}} macroinvertebrate samples collected from natural substrates. The MHSP is computed by averaging the EPT (number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera taxa) and BI (a biotic index that reflects the <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerances</b> of individual taxa) to produce a bioclassification score. The MHSP produced low bioclassification scores that could falsely indicate environmental degradation in some undisturbed, high quality streams in the Sandhills ecoregion. This problem had two causes: (1) the metrics (especially EPT) were significantly related to stream size, which confounded stream size effects with environmental impacts, and (2) the scoring criteria for EPT were too high for some Sandhills streams, likely because of unrecognized heterogeneity among the Sandhills streams from which the criteria were derived. We corrected these problems by developing new scoring criteria from ecologically comparable undisturbed streams and by utilizing residuals from regressions of the metrics on stream width to normalize for stream size. The MHSP and related protocols are effective methods for assessing environmental quality but allowances must be made for the effects of stream size and the potential ecological heterogeneity that naturally exists among streams in some ecoregions...|$|E
40|$|Globally, {{wetlands}} {{are being}} degraded and destroyed {{largely as a}} result of anthropogenic activity. Monitoring and assessment are required to maintain functional ecosystems and the valuable services they provide. Surface sediment cores were taken from 4 points around an urban wetland (Princess Vlei) on the Cape Flats, Cape Town, South Africa. Diatoms were and used as a proxy for water quality variables to determine whether the diatom flora preserved in organic sediments accumulating in and around an urban wetland is a useful tool in determining the changes in water quality over time. In addition, the project attempts to establish whether there are spatial patterns in diatom flora within a small lake. Diatoms from three depths from each of the four sites were identified, counted and analyzed according to their trophic preferences and <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerances</b> which were acquired from a variety of resources. Results showed clear spatial differences between sites as a result of positioning in relation to effluent input, output and specific site characteristics such as reed stands. Differences between depths were evident although no significant trends were observed. In summation; spatial heterogeneity in the diatom assemblage of an urban wetland reveal that diatoms are suitable indicators of water quality, even within a small system, due to their niche specificity. The project also shows that Princess Vlei remains a eutrophic and polluted wetland, although not uniformly so. Continual monitoring is required to prevent the vlei from becoming a health hazard for the surrounding community and to maintain its ability to act as a buffering zone to protect the Rondevlei nature reserve, as well as acting as a functional ecosystem in an area threatened by urbanization...|$|E

40|$|The {{freshwater}} {{systems of}} Bhutan and Bangladesh offer marked contrasts in anthropogenic disturbance, surrounding land uses, watershed population density, and benthic macroinvertebrate ecology. However, {{they share a}} lack of published research on water quality monitoring, specifically in regard to biological monitoring with benthic macroinvertebrates. With their high diversity, high abundance, and spectrum of <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerances,</b> benthic macroinvertebrates are an inexpensive yet powerful tool for monitoring freshwater health. In November of 2015, the Stroud Water Research Center performed physical, chemical, microbiological, and macroinvertebrate sampling at 18 stream sites in western Bhutan, with sites representing a variety of surrounding land uses and disturbance levels. In August of 2016, the author and fellow Penn MES student Naimul Islam performed {{a second round of}} sampling at fourteen sites in Bhutan, and a first round of sampling at ten sites in Bangladesh, using both quantitative collection techniques as well as less technical citizen-science techniques. After extraction and identification to the taxonomic level of family, macroinvertebrate taxa were compared across land uses and in relation to collected physico-chemical and microbiological metrics. In Bhutan, significant changes in macroinvertebrate taxa were correlated with changes in upstream versus downstream condition, as well as with monsoon versus postmonsoon sampling times. In Bangladesh, the citizen-science collection technique of leaf packs selected overwhelmingly for Chironomidae and thus could not distinguish between upstream and downstream conditions, necessitating an in-field or lab modification of the technique for future use. Given each country 2 ̆ 7 s direct interests in maintaining clean, functioning freshwater systems, both Bangladesh and Bhutan – and much of South Asia – are ripe for the implementation of both citizen-science and technical biomonitoring techniques that connect communities and public officials to measures of water quality and stream condition...|$|E
40|$|Historically, when {{urban land}} has been developed, stream burial {{has been a}} common practice. Today, many urban communities, {{including}} the city of Oslo, are increasingly attempting to restore buried streams through deculverting. In addition to ecological and aesthetical improvements, deculverting may also be an effective management method {{for the removal of}} nutrients. However, it is largely unknown how species assemblages and ecosystems in such newly created streambeds develop and function. This thesis investigates the first year following a deculverting project in the stream Hovinbekken in Oslo, Norway. In order to determine how macroinvertebrates colonise newly created streambeds, samples were collected monthly from May to November in 2016, from six sites within the restored reach and one upstream reference site. Water chemistry samples were also taken. Similar macroinvertebrate samples were collected along a gradient of increasing urbanisation from the urban stream Akerselva. Results from Hovinbekken showed that all species found in the restored reach were also found at the reference site. The upper restored sites had both higher family richness and larger population sizes compared to downstream restored sites. They also had the species assemblages in the restored reach most closely resembling that of the reference site. This is suggestive that the initial colonisation by macroinvertebrates occurred primarily via drift and depended on the species assemblage upstream of the restored site as a source of colonists. Family assemblage comparisons using NMDS ordination between Hovinbekken and Akerselva indicated that the reference site had a similar assemblage to the lower urbanised reaches of Akerselva, suggesting the local species pool was limited to that of a highly urbanised stream. The initial colonists were those with high <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerances,</b> as indicated by low ASPT scores, and consisted mainly of Chironomidae and Oligochaeta. This indicated that the restored reach was affected by organic pollutants. Water chemistry showed that in the growing season, the restored reach removed nitrogen and phosphorus, while in autumn, nutrient demand declined and nutrients were released. This suggests that such restored systems may, for part of the year, remove nutrients from polluted water and function as natural water purification facilities. Based on these results, the success of restoration projects where the objective is to increase biodiversity depends on whether potential colonisers are able to disperse to the restored site, and whether there is a local species pool to disperse from. In addition, stressors in the environment, such as organic pollutants, may negatively impact successful colonisation...|$|E

Air <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerance</b> index (APTI) {{is used to}} select plant species which are tolerant to air pollution. Four biochemical parameters such as leaf relative water content (RWC), ascorbic acid (AA) content, total leaf chlorophyll (TCh), and leaf extract pH were used to develop an APTI. Five tree species growing near a sugar mill, an air pollution point source, were collected during six months from October, 2010 to March, 2011. The data suggested that combining a variety of biochemical parameters could give a more reliable result than those air <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerance</b> classifications based on a single biochemical parameter. High values of APTI were recorded in Ficus religiosa (44. 39) and Ficus benghalensis (42. 38). The order of tolerance is given as: Ficus religiosa> Ficus benghalensis> Pongamia pinnata> Delonix regia> Azadirachta indica. The percentage increase in APTI was maximum for Delonix regia (69. 22 %) and minimum for Ficus benghalensis (18. 33 %) when compared to control site. The Anticipated Performance Index (API) of these tree species were also calculated by considering their APTI values together with other socio-economic and biological parameters. According to API, the most tolerant plant species were Ficus religiosa (100 %) and Ficus benghalensis (100 %) whereas the species with poor tolerance were Delonix regia and Azadirachta indica.

40|$|Macroinvertebrates can be {{successfully}} used as biomonitors of pollutants {{and environmental health}} because some groups are sensitive whereas, others are relatively tolerant to pollutants. An issue of ongoing debate is what constitutes an appropriate group for biomonitoring; should the group represent species, genera or higher taxonomic levels? A phylogenetic framework can provide new insights into this issue. By developing phylogenies for chironomids and mayflies, this investigation shows that there is strong phylogenetic signal for pollution responses, and that phylogenetic nodes are common to tolerant and sensitive groups of species. A phylogenetic analysis of biotic indices developed for mayflies based on their response to organic pollution shows that mayfly families varied in <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerance.</b> In contrast, based on sediment zinc concentrations {{as an indicator of}} <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerance,</b> Australian chironomids tend to vary in tolerance at lower taxonomic levels. Published data on North American chironomids shows much of the signal for pollution responses is contained within genera rather than sub-families. Tools are now available to distinguish whether this signal reflects historical evolutionary constraints or environmental effects leading to common evolved responses. This suggests that ideally higher taxonomic levels should be used for biomonitoring when there are strong phylogenetic constraints at higher levels. Evolutionary considerations can therefore help to guide the development of macroinvertebrate biomonitors and provide insights into processes that produce sensitive and tolerant taxa...|$|R

The comparison between pre- and post-exposure measurements of stress biomarkers revealed that the different thallus hydration regime modiﬁed the <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerance</b> as well as the physiology of the exposed samples. The non-watered group B suffered an evident decrease in Fv/Fm and reduced glutathione, but increased ion leakage, whereas the watered groups C and D showed only decreased non-photosynthetic-quenching, possibly derived from NOx exposure. Ozone, which was hi...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of mycorrhizal fungi in uptake of heavy metals, pollution response index and yield of sunflower in degraded soils were investigated. It was a greenhouse experiment with 2 arbuscular mycorrhizae (Glomus mosseae, Glomus intraradices) and a non-inoculation {{that served as}} control. The treatments were replicated 3 times in a completely randomized design. Each of the treatment consisted of 30 pots and each pot was filled with 5 kg by weight of dried top soil. Solutions of lead acetate and cadmium sulphate at variable levels of: 0, 250, 500, 750, 1000 mg kg- 1 and 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 mg kg- 1 respectively were used to pollute the soils. Increase in pollution-stressed conditions significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the infection of sunflower roots, and the uptake of Pb and Cd in the dry root of sunflower was also significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced. Also, arbuscular mycorrhizae enhanced the root infection of sunflower, increased the <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerance</b> and consequently increased the yield of sunflower...|$|R
50|$|At three {{sites on}} Hull Creek, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) Taxa Richness ranged from 4.00 to 16.00 in a 2013 study. The Total Taxa Richness ranged from 7.00 to 24.00. The Taxa Richness and the EPT Taxa Richness are {{the total number}} of macroinvertebrate taxa {{observed}} in a sample and {{the total number of}} those taxa that are in the three aforementioned orders, respectively. The Percent Intolerance Index ranged from 2.5% to 53% and the Beck's Index value ranged from 10.00 to 26.00. These two methods count individuals with PTVs of 0 to 3 and taxa with PTVs of 0 to 2, respectively. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value ranged from 0.28 to 2.70 and the Shannon Diversity Index value ranged from 1.45 to 2.05. The former is a method of determining community composition by considering both taxonomic richness and evenness of individuals. The latter is a count of individuals, weighted by <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The IBI Score of the creek ranged from 38.79 to 74.96.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, two {{important}} medicinal plants of genus Ocimum, O. basilicum and O. sanctum have been compared {{in a number}} of phytochemical parameters. Effect of extraction techniques, solvent extraction, Soxhlet extraction and hydro-distillation, on the yield in different solvents have been investigated. Hydro-distillation gave a better yield of more volatile components than hexane fraction of the other two techniques. Both the plants showed good urease inhibitory activity. Hydro-distillate was stronger inhibitor than hexane or methanolic extracts of solvent or Soxhlet extractions. The extracts of O. basilicumshowed a greater urease activity than extracts of O. sanctum. Alpha-amylase inhibitory activity of O. basilicum was also higher than that of O. sanctum. Notably, the synergistic effect of the extracts of the two plants was much higher than their individual efficacy against alpha-amylase. The activity decreased with decrease in concentration. Both the species had almost equal air <b>pollution</b> <b>tolerance</b> index (APTI) with O. basilicum(10. 558) having slightly higher value than O. sanctum (9. 202). Both plants contained alkaloids and phenolics. Both the plants also had almost same nutritional values...|$|R
