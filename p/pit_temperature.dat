5000|$|Once {{the scrap}} has {{completely}} melted {{down and a}} flat bath is reached, another bucket of scrap can be charged into the furnace and melted down, although EAF development is moving towards single-charge designs. After the second charge is completely melted, refining operations take place to check and correct the steel chemistry and superheat the melt above its freezing temperature in preparation for tapping. More slag formers are introduced and more oxygen is blown into the bath, burning out impurities such as silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, aluminium, manganese, and calcium, and removing their oxides to the slag. Removal of carbon takes place after these elements have burnt out first, as they have a greater affinity for oxygen. Metals that have a poorer affinity for oxygen than iron, such as nickel and copper, cannot be removed through oxidation and must be controlled through scrap chemistry alone, such as introducing the direct reduced iron and pig iron mentioned earlier. A foaming slag is maintained throughout, and often overflows the furnace to pour out of the slag door into the slag <b>pit.</b> <b>Temperature</b> sampling and chemical sampling take place via automatic lances. Oxygen and carbon can be automatically measured via special probes that dip into the steel, but for all other elements, a [...] "chill" [...] sample—a small, solidified sample of the steel—is analysed on an arc-emission spectrometer.|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{resistant}} alloys (CRAs) used in subsea pressure-retaining components must {{be compatible}} with production fluids and resistant to pitting and crevice corrosion in seawater. Whereas materials selection in production environments is governed by well-established international standards such as ISO 15156, much debate still exists as of how to determine the seawater localized corrosion resistance of higher grade CRAs such as duplex super duplex stainless steels (DSS and SDSS, respectively). While most industry specifications rely on the ASTM G 48 standard to determine localized corrosion resistance, for duplex and super-duplex stainless steels {{there is no consensus}} on surface finish prior testing (e. g. polishing or pickling) and test temperature (e. g. 50 &# 176;C in NORSOK 630 versus 40 &# 176;C in ASTM A 923). Moreover, it is unclear whether existing procedures are sensitive enough to determine the onset of deleterious phases such as &# 963;-phase and chromium nitrides. The objective of this investigation was to quantify the seawater pitting corrosion resistance of a type 25 Cr SDSS (UNS S 32750) and its correlation with microstructure and surface finish before testing. Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) testing was used to determine the effect &# 963;-phase on the corrosion response of the system. CPP results were then compared against industry standard practices based on the ASTM G 48 Method A test. In addition, CPP tests were conducted at various temperatures, ranging from 25 to 90 &# 176;C, to determine the effect of deleterious phases on critical <b>pitting</b> <b>temperature</b> (CPT) and overall localized corrosion resistance. The results from this project indicate that the Critical <b>Pitting</b> <b>temperature</b> for standard solution annealed Super Duplex Stainless Steel is 60 - 70 &# 176;C.

Within Star+ also measurements at housing level were done. From this study it is concluded that the ammonia emission level from houses with a paved outside yard can be similar to houses without outside yard. This can be realized by a good pen design that enables a reduced area of the manure pit and reduced floor fouling. Furthermore, it is concluded that the determination of ammonia emission by model calculation based on local measured input parameters has good prospects.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the effect of sodium chloride (NaCl) or calcium chloride (CaCl₂) on the formation and stability of n-dodecane/non-ionic surfactant/aqueous nanoemulsions produced by the Phase Inversion Temperature (PIT) method. It is because there are only few works done to investigate the effect of electrolyte on the production of nanoemulsions, especially those produced by the PIT method. Furthermore, in this research, the ability for ageing nanoemulsions to reverse their physical properties to freshly-prepared state has also been investigated [...] The nanoemulsions were produced by heating aqueous-continuous emulsions (O/W) to oil-continuous (W/O) emulsions, followed by a quenching process to produce O/W nanoemulsions. Pure milliQ water and concentration from 0. 001 M to 0. 1 M NaCl or CaCl₂ were used as continuous phase. The non-ionic surfactants used were polyoxyethylene (4) lauryl ether (Brij 30) and sorbitan monooleate (S 80). The stability was determined by dynamic light scattering technique by measuring the growth of the droplet size and size distribution (PdI) before the nanoemulsions were phase separated, which was determined by visual observation. The reversibility testing was done by measuring the droplet size and PdI as a function of temperatures for a three-day ageing nanoemulsion system. Droplet size as small as 65 nm was produced from a brine system while there was 77 nm in a pure milliQ water system, with PdI lower than 0. 2. The <b>PIT</b> <b>temperature</b> was found to be depressed when: (1) oil or surfactant concentration increased; (2) HLB number of surfactant system decreased; and (3) NaCl or CaCl₂ was added. The transitional temperature (∆Ttrans[trans in subscript]), a temperature difference between the temperature for producing O/W and W/O emulsions, has linked with the stability of the nanoemulsions. The largest ∆Ttrans [trans in subscript] in a emulsion system with low oil concentration (R= 0. 2) appeared at 7 wt% Brij 30 at pure milliQ water system but at 6 wt% Brij 30 at NaCl system, showing that the surfactant concentration used to produce the most stable nanoemulsions was reduced by the aid of compression effect from NaCl. When the oil concentration increased, more NaCl was needed to produce stable nanoemulsions. Nanoemulsions produced by a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic non-ionic surfactant was extremely unstable, with a big difference in <b>PIT</b> <b>temperature</b> and ∆Ttrans [trans in subscript]compared to a pure surfactant system. It was found that NaCl was a better electrolyte than CaCl₂ to produce nanoemulsions with smaller droplet sizes and PdI and higher stability. For the most stable nanoemulsions, 20 °C was better than 10 °C, to keep the sample from phase separation for more than 30 days. Additionally, the addition of CaCl₂ was found to have no difference in the production of nanoemulsions by adding it either before or after the emulsification process. It has been found that only system with NaCl appeared {{to have the ability to}} revert the droplet size and PdI, from ageing to freshly-prepared nanoemulsions. Furthermore, the reversibility ability was governed by phase inversion process as only system experiencing heating process could be reverted. However, nanoemulsions with high stability were partially reversible, where only droplet size was reversible. The positive effects (increasing stability, smaller droplet size and PdI, and reversibility ability) from the addition of NaCl could only be achieved at certain electrolyte and surfactant concentrations.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of sodium {{chloride}} on the formation and stability of n-dodecane/surfactant/NaCl/water nanoemulsions are {{discussed in terms of}} oil concentration (R) and the type of surfactant. Nanoemulsions, widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries, are a dispersion system consisting droplets with sizes ranging from 20 to 200 nm. Among the low energy methods, phase inversion temperature (PIT) method was used to prepare nanoemulsions by heating an emulsion system to a temperature close to PIT point followed by a quenching process as it works with the changes in affinity of a non-ionic surfactant with temperatures. Phase inversion process was determined by plotting the conductivity of emulsions versus temperatures. The change of the phase inversion process and the decrease of the <b>PIT</b> <b>temperature,</b> with increasing oil concentration, were more significant in brine system especially at high salt concentration. At low surfactant concentration, the nanoemulsions were monodispersed in either pure water or brine system, when R was 0. 2 to 0. 4. More sodium chloride was needed to produce stable nanoemulsions when the oil concentration was increased, viz. 0. 001 M NaCl in R= 0. 3 and 0. 01 M NaCl in R= 0. 4. When the oil concentration was increased, there was partial reversible system in low salt systems but irreversible system in high salt systems. In both pure water and brine system, nanoemulsions formed with mixed surfactant (Span 80 /Brij 30) were polydispersed and had larger droplet size compared to n-dodecane/Brij 30 systems.

In this study the influence of quenched-in (size range ca. 50 - 100 nm) and isothermal (size range ca. 80 - 250 nm) types of nitrides on the corrosion behavior of a 2507 super duplex stainless steel has been investigated at room temperature and at 90 C (above the critical <b>pitting</b> <b>temperature)</b> in 1 M NaCl solution. The microstructure has been characterized by scanning electron microscopy and magnetic force microscopy. The isothermal nitrides exhibit a higher Volta potential compared to the matrix, but such difference could not be observed for the quenched-in nitrides.

In the transpassive region isothermal nitrides appear to be slightly more deleterious than quenched-in nitrides. At 90 C isothermal nitrides largely reduce the corrosion resistance of the austenite phase, while the quenched-in nitrides reduce the corrosion resistance of the material to a much lesser extent.

40|$|Driven by {{temperature}} gradients, kinetic snow metamorphism {{is important}} for avalanche formation. Even when gradients appear to be insufficient for kinetic metamorphism, based on temperatures measured 10 cm apart, faceting close to a~crust can still be observed. Recent studies that visualized small scale (< 10 cm) thermal structures in a profile of snow layers with an infrared (IR) camera produced interesting results. The studies found melt-freeze crusts to be warmer or cooler than the surrounding snow depending on the large scale gradient direction. However, an important assumption within the studies was that a thermal photo of a freshly exposed snow pit was similar enough to the internal temperature of the snow. In this study, we tested this assumption by recording thermal videos during the exposure of the snow pit wall. In the first minute, the results showed increasing gradients with time, both at melt-freeze crusts and at artificial surface structures such as shovel scours. Cutting through a crust with a cutting blade or a shovel produced small concavities (holes) even when the objective was to cut a planar surface. Our findings suggest there is a surface structure dependency of the thermal image, which is only observed at times with large temperature differences between air and snow. We were able to reproduce the hot-crust/cold-crust phenomenon and relate it entirely to surface structure in a temperature-controlled cold laboratory. Concave areas cooled or warmed slower compared with convex areas (bumps) when applying temperature differences between snow and air. This {{can be explained by}} increased radiative transfer or convection by air at convex areas. Thermal videos suggest that such processes influence the snow temperature within seconds. Our findings show the limitations of the use of a thermal camera for measuring pit-wall temperatures, particularly in scenarios where large gradients exist between air and snow and the interaction of snow pit and atmospheric temperatures are enhanced. At crusts or other heterogeneities, we were unable to create a sufficiently homogenous snow pit surface and non-internal gradients appeared at the exposed surface. The immediate adjustment of snow <b>pit</b> <b>temperature</b> as it reacts with the atmosphere complicates the capture of the internal thermal structure of a snowpack even with thermal videos. Instead, the shown structural dependency of the IR signal may be used to detect structural changes of snow caused by kinetic metamorphism. The IR signal {{can also be used to}} measure near surface temperatures in a homogenous new snow layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of peasants in Hararghe, eastern Ethiopia, store sorghum grain in underground pits. These pits usually elevate grain moisture and storage temperature to levels that favour insect pests and fungi, causing grain spoilage.

The district mean grain weight loss varied between 2 and 13 % for the same storage period. Mean germination in the districts decreased from 83 to 27 % in 7 to 9 months.

The grain bulk density of samples from the soil pits decreased by 9 % in 17 months while the changes in the other three store types were not significant. Germination of grain from the soil pits decreased by 6 % per storage month while no significant difference was detected among the above-ground bin and non-soil pits.

EBM alloy did not pit when performing potentiostatic test at 800 mV vs. Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) even under different pH of the solution. Due to the manufacturing technique and conditions of the EBM machine, the resulted object has irregularities on the exterior surface and voids that are formed within the part which affects samples? properties like surface roughness, CPT, density and porosity. In this study, a statistically designed experiment was employed to manufacture Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples in EBM machine under different process parameters of beam current, beam speed and offset focus. Surface roughness was measured for as-built samples. Then, a potentiostatic test was conducted under 2. 40 V vs. SCE to determine the critical <b>pitting</b> <b>temperature</b> in 3. 5 % mass NaCl solution for the same samples of different processing parameters. Moreover, density was measured and porosity was calculated from density values. Finally, a model equation was established in order to relate EBM?s process parameters to measured properties of surface roughness, CPT, density and porosity. It was noted that offset focus had the main influence on surface roughness more than beam current and beam speed. Changing processing parameters did not affect corrosion behavior of EBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V as CPT did not vary widely, with a slight effect obtained from beam current and beam speed.

However, damage was found mainly {{in the vicinity of the}} circumferential and longitudinal welds, and part of the subsequent failure investigation was therefore focused on the possibility of poor weld quality being the cause of failure. This task was approached primarily by measuring the influence of welding parameters on the value of the critical <b>pitting</b> <b>temperature</b> (CPT), and attempting to correlate the results with observed changes in the weld microstructure. CPT values were determined by a potentiodynamic method, using samples cut from the failed vessel and from a range of reference welds manufactured using known welding parameters. [URL]...|$|R

A morphological transition is clearly identified around 1040 K between hexagonal <b>pits</b> at low <b>temperatures</b> and circular <b>pits</b> at high <b>temperatures,</b> with apparently {{no change in}} the kinetic law. A kinetic Monte Carlo model allows rationalizing these findings in terms of the competitive oxidation of armchair and zig-zag edge sites and provides an estimate of the rate laws associated to these two events. Extended to three dimensions, the model also explains the "in-depth" transition between the stepwise hexagons and the hemispheres observed by atomic force microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Chromium {{nitrides}} may precipitate in {{duplex stainless}} steels during processing and {{their influence on}} the corrosion behavior is of great importance for the steel performance. In this study, the influence of nano-sized quenched-in chromium nitrides on the corrosion behavior of a heat treated 2205 duplex stainless steel was investigated at room temperature and 50 °C (just above critical <b>pitting</b> <b>temperature).</b> The microstructure was characterized by SEM/EDS and AFM analyses, and quenched-in nitrides precipitated in the ferrite phase were identified by TEM analysis. Volta potential mapping at room temperature suggests lower relative nobility of the ferrite matrix. Electrochemical polarization and in-situ AFM measurements in 1 M NaCl solution at room temperature show a passive behavior of the steel {{despite the presence of}} the quenched-in nitrides in the ferrite phase, and preferential dissolution of ferrite phase occurred only at transpassive conditions. At 50 °C, selective dissolution of the austenite phase was observed, while the ferrite phase with the quenched-in nitrides remained to be stable. It can be concluded that the finely dispersed quenched-in nitrides do not cause localized corrosion, whereas the exposure temperature has a strong influence on the corrosion behavior of the duplex stainless steel.

40|$|Critical <b>pitting</b> <b>temperature</b> (CPT) {{determination}} by potenciostatic {{procedure is}} often used {{as a method of}} screening stainless steels in solutions with activity range 0. 067 – 4. 3. Values of activity of chloride ions as well as pH values for those solutions are quite different from the values of the same parameters in solutions modeling wastewater treatment of flue gas desulfurization plants. In those waters the soluble components, mainly calcium chloride (which must be treated by evaporation and crystallization) can give solutions with pH values below 4 and activities of chloride ions much more higher. Thus, even small changes of CaCl 2 concentration can give an increase in chloride ions activity. In the work reported here the effect of two different activities of chloride ions was investigated using potenciostatic CPT measurements on superaustenitic stainless steels in c = 5. 685 and 5. 88 mol L– 1 CaCl 2 solutions with pH values below 4. The results demonstrated that an increase in the activity of chloride ions causes a decrease in the potentialat which, for given a temperature, the growth of stable pits is possible...|$|R
40|$|Amongst {{existing}} electrochemical measuring {{techniques for}} uniform corrosion, (e. g. LPR, EIS, etc), EFM (Electrochemical Frequency Modulation) {{has emerged as}} a promising technique with enormous untapped potential. Besides its use for determining the corrosion rate without a prior knowledge of the so-called Tafel constants, EFM offers the measurement of the corrosion rate, Tafel parameters and causality factors (CFs) in a single set of data. The experimental base for detecting localized corrosion (LC) through EFM was devised through investigating three types of LC (Pitting, Crevice, and Stress Corrosion Cracking - SCC) followed by comparative analysis between EFM and EN, and the use of EFM for the screening of corrosion inhibitors. The three types of LC were investigated through measuring the various behaviors in the so-called "causality factors", which are calculated from the ratio of the current components in the AC-response. CFs, resulting from an EFM test and in the ideal case having values of 2 and 3 respectively, are normally used for quality and data validation purposes. While investigating pitting corrosion, they showed different behavior leading to the CPT (critical <b>pitting</b> <b>temperature)</b> detection. The results showed that in most cases the CFs do change when the system goes from uniform corrosion to crevice corrosion. nrpages: 144 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} two wrought Co-Cr-W superalloys is studied under both polarization immersion tests. The corrosive media, Green Death solution, {{is used in}} both tests. Potentiodynamic polarization and cyclic polarization testes are performed to investigate general and localized corrosion resistance of these alloys. Immersion tests of the two alloys are conducted in Green Death solution to determine Critical <b>Pitting</b> <b>Temperature</b> (CPT), mass loss, thickness change and the Extreme Value (minimum thickness) using Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) model derived from the Gumbel Distribution. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum is utilized to analyze the chemical composition of the corrosion products (pits). The presence of carbides generates potential in the electrochemical reaction, causing corrosion of the alloys in the solution. The larger the carbide volume fraction, the more the pits are formed in the alloy. Carbide size also affects maximum pit depths; the larger the carbide size, the bigger and deeper the pits. The EDX analysis results of pits show large amount of oxygen in the carbide phase and {{a small amount of}} oxygen in the solid solution phase. The Cr-rich carbides react with oxygen forming Cr-rich carbonates which are easily brittle, loose and broken. 9 2013 by NACE International. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{attempts}} of engineering {{the surface of}} duplex stainless steels were made {{in order to improve}} their hardness and tribological properties, without affecting their corrosion resistance. A possibility of improving these properties is provided by a family of processes developed by Prof. B. H. Kolster in the Netherlands in the late 1980 's. These processes (the Kolsterising® treatments) consist of a low temperature carburizing, which involves the diffusion of large quantities of carbon atoms (up to 6 - 7 % weight rate) into the steel at a diffusion temperature below 450 °C. In the present paper a characterization of the surface layer of Kolsterised duplex SAF 2205 stainless steel was carried out to study the effects of this treatment on surface properties. The characterization includes optical metallographic examination, microhardness test and SEM investigation on the Kolsterised steel in the as treated condition and after annealing treatments at 200, 250, 300 350 and 400 °C for 10 hours, to evaluate the stability of Kolsterised layer???s properties with a moderate increase in temperature. Moreover, complying with ASTM G 48 - 03 Method E Standard, in order to evaluate the effect of the Kolsterising® treatment on steel pitting resistance, the critical <b>pitting</b> <b>temperature</b> was obtained for Kolsterised duplex SAF 2205 stainless steel compared with the base metal...|$|R
40|$|Laser color marking of {{stainless}} steel {{has been in the}} interests of different industries for some time. Still wide use of the process is not seen on consumer products which might be because of lack of their usability information. Laser processing {{of stainless}} steel surfaces creates an oxide layer on the surface. The thickness of this layer defines how white light is reflected from the surface. What in principle is only a thin oxide layer on the surface can be seen as different colors by the viewer. If this oxide layer is thick and solid it will have good corrosion and wear properties. Consumer products are constantly under certain corrosion and wear. In this study, the corrosion and wear properties of laser color marking on AISI Type 304 L (EN 1. 4307) austenitic stainless steel were evaluated based on laser process parameters and colors. The results show that the corrosion properties of marked surface expressed as critical <b>pitting</b> <b>temperatures</b> (CPT) depend on heat input: coarsely the lower heat input the higher CPT. Also scanning velocity has a remarkable effect on CPT. The laser color marking parameters have a significant influence on the wear behaviour of both the surface itself and that of the counter body surface. Laser color marking has high potential to become a widely used technique for product marking and decoration...|$|R

The results showed that tensile and yield strength, {{as well as the}} pitting corrosion resistance, could be degraded with annealing temperature increasing from 1000 up to 1150 °C. Meanwhile, the elongation at break reached the maximum of 52. 7 % after annealing at 1050 °C due to the effect of martensite transformation induced plasticity (TRIP). The localized pitting attack preferentially occurred at ferrite phase, indicating that the ferrite phase had inferior pitting corrosion resistance as compared to the austenite phase. With increasing annealing <b>temperature,</b> the <b>pitting</b> resistance equivalent number (PREN) of ferrite phase dropped, while that of the austenite phase rose. Additionally, it was found that ferrite possessed a lower Volta potential than austenite phase. Moreover, the Volta potential difference between ferrite and austenite increased with the annealing temperature, which was well consistent with the difference of PREN...|$|R
