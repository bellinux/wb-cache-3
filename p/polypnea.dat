50|$|The {{respiratory}} {{system is not}} only important for efficient gas exchange, but for thermoregulation and vocalization. Thermoregulation is important for flamingos as they generally live in warm habitats and their plush plumage increases body temperature. Heat loss is accomplished through thermal <b>polypnea</b> (panting), that {{is an increase in}} respiratory rate. It has been seen that the medulla, hypothalamus and mid-brain are involved in the control of panting, as well through the Hering-Breuer reflex that uses stretch receptors in the lungs, and the vagus nerve. This effect of the panting is accelerated by a process called gular fluttering; rapid flapping of membranes in the throat which is synchronized with the movements of the thorax. Both of these mechanisms promote evaporative heat loss, which allows for the bird to push out warm air and water from the body. Increases in respiratory rate would normally cause respiratory alkalosis because carbon dioxide levels are rapidly dropping in the body, but the flamingo is able to bypass this, most likely through a shunt mechanism, which allow it to still maintain a sustainable partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. Since the avian integument is not equipped with sweat glands, cutaneous cooling is minimal. Because the flamingo's {{respiratory system}} is shared with multiple functions, panting must be controlled to prevent hypoxia.|$|E

40|$|The {{action of}} aspirin, {{according}} to clinical observation and experimental work in some species of animals, tends {{to follow the}} pattern of the organism’s response to warm environments. However, for the exhibition of aspirin antipyresis the organism must be rendered febrile, although not all types of fever agents arc efficient for this purpose. Barbour (1) has shown that sensitivity to aspirin antipyresis may persist beyond the period of actual pyrexia, and employing calorimetric measurements he demonstrated that aspirin antipyresis is due essentially to an increase in heat loss, rather than a decrease in heat production. This heat loss mechanism in-cludes peripheral vasodilation, hydremia, sweating, and <b>polypnea.</b> One of us with Herrmann (2) first demonstrated that aspirin produces hydremia in fever animals, reversing the blood concentration that occurs in the onset of fever. Dontas (4) has found that the threshold for heat <b>polypnea</b> in normal dogs is lowered by large doses of aspirin.

The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the features of six patients with malignant {{lactic acidosis}} and to discuss how its initial presentation can be differentiated from that of severe sepsis. Methods: We prospectively collected data of all consecutive patients with haematological malignancies, admitted to the Ghent University Hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) between 2000 and 2007. Results: Of 3 / 2 patients with haematological malignancies admitted to the ICU for life- threatening complications, 58 presented with lactic acid levels >= 5 mmol/L. Six were diagnosed with malignant lactic acidosis. All patients with malignant lactic acidosis had high-grade lymphoblastic malignancies and were referred with a tentative diagnosis of severe sepsis a septic shock: lactic acid levels exceeded 9. 45 mmol/L and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were at least 1785 U/L. Two patients had hypoglycaemia. All had a pronounced <b>polypnea.</b> In all patients hepatic malignant involvement was suspected. Two of the six patients survived their episode thanks to the early recognition of malignant lactic acidosis and the prompt administration of chemotherapy. 01 le patient was still alive 6 months after initiating chemotherapy.

Erdosteine inhibits bacterial adhesiveness and has antioxidant properties. A synergistic effect of erdosteine with various antibiotics has been demonstrated in pharmacological and clinical studies. The present study was multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. The aims {{of the study were}} to compare a combination of erdosteine with amoxicillin against an amoxicillin-placebo combination in pediatric patients with acute lower respiratory tract disease. A total of 158 patients (78 in the erdosteine group and 80 in the placebo group) were treated for 7 2 days. The efficacy parameters were cough (primary), <b>polypnea,</b> rhonchi, rales and body temperature (all measured at baseline, on Day 3 {{and at the end of}} treatment). Safety was assessed by strictly monitoring the occurrence of adverse events and using standard laboratory parameters. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis showed that the severity of cough was decreased by 47 % at Day 3 in the erdosteine group with a statistically significant difference compared to placebo, the difference was still significant at the final visit. The decrease in the severity of rales was significantly greater at Day 3 in the erdosteine group than in the placebo group. The incidence of <b>polypnea</b> and rhonchi in the two groups showed similar decreases, an improvement mainly due to the antibiotic. No adverse events occurred and no adverse changes in laboratory parameters were observed.

40|$|Bovine {{ehrlichiosis}} is a tick-borne rickettsial disease {{caused by}} Anaplasma phagocytophilum. The disease {{can also be}} transmitted to humans. Outbreaks in cattle have been described in many European countries. In Belgium, infections caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum {{have been reported in}} humans and dogs; however this paper details the first report of ehrlichiosis in cattle herds in Belgium. The first case described was in a dairy herd located in east Belgium. Clinical signs included hyperthermia, <b>polypnea</b> and swelling of the limbs. The other case was diagnosed in a second, mixed purpose, herd in west Belgium. Within the second herd all of the affected animals came from the same pasture. All animals in that pasture showed recurrent hyperthermia and some also showed signs of mastitis and late-term abortions. Blood smears and serology revealed the presence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in the majority of animals with pyrexia. Furthermore, the presence of leptospirosis, Neospora caninum and Q fever antibodies was tested by serological analysis but all results were negative. Paired serology for Adenovirus, BHV- 4, BHV- 1, BVD, PI 3 and RSV-B did not show any significant seroconversion. Milk samples from cows affected by mastitis revealed minor pathogens. Fecal testing for the presence of Dictyocaulus viviparus in the first herd was negative. Recurrent pyrexia in pastured cattle is a non-specific sign, and can be related to several different pathogens.

40|$|Background Pregnancy {{toxaemia}} (PT) is {{a disease}} that affects pregnant goats during their last month of gestation and {{is characterized by a}} high case fatality rate. This study involved 32 does maintained on a commercial dairy goat farm that were diagnosed with PT. A physical examination was performed on and haematology parameters obtained from each doe, at the time of diagnosis. The data from the 24 PT goats that died was compared with the corresponding data from the 8 PT goats that survived. Results <b>Polypnea,</b> swollen limbs, anorexia with absence of ruminal motility, recumbency, nervous signs and drooping ears were the most frequently observed clinical manifestations. Nineteen out of 21 recumbent goats died. Sixteen out of 17 goats with anorexia and absence of ruminal motility died. Mean beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) values in the goats that died were not significantly different from those in goats that survived. The blood values for pH and pCO 2 (p[*]<[*] 0. 005) as well as for HCO 3 −, BE and K+ (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) were significantly lower in the goats that died than in those that survived. Conclusions The clinical signs most indicative of a poor prognosis are anorexia with absence of ruminal motility and recumbency. Among the blood parameters to be considered, hypokalaemia and metabolic acidosis are the most relevant. Goats with PT have a high mortality and their condition can deteriorate very fast. Based on the authors’s experience, a good strategy to minimize the economic losses caused by PT is to focus on the offspring survival rate since an early decision (induction of kidding or caesarian surgery) can increase the number of alive kids.

This paper reports on pulmonary infestation caused by Troglostrongylus brevior and Troglostrongylus subcrenatus in two kittens and describes, for the first time, associated clinical presentations and pathological features. Morphometrical, molecular and phylogenetic analyses have also been conducted to differentiate here the examined Troglostrongylus species from A. abstrusus, towards a clearer delineation of metastrongyloids affecting cats. Methods Two kittens were referred for respiratory distress and hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe aelurostrongylosis, based {{on the presence of}} metastrongyloid larvae in the faeces. Despite prompt treatment, kittens died within 48 hours. Both kittens were submitted to necropsy to determine the cause of death. Results At necropsy, nematode species were found in the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles and were associated with respiratory signs (i. e., dyspnoea, <b>polypnea,</b> severe coughing and nasal discharge). Morphology and measurements of adult parasites found allowed the unequivocal identification of T. brevior and T. subcrenatus, even if first stage larvae were rather similar to those of A. abstrusus. Briefly, T. brevior and T. subcrenatus larvae were shorter in length and lacking the typical knob-like terminal end of A. abstrusus. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses corroborated morphological identification and provided data on mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA genes of T. brevior. Conclusions Data presented here indicate that T. brevior and T. subcrenatus cause major respiratory distress in domestic cats. Consequently, these two species should be included, along with A. abstrusus, in the differential diagnosis of cat bronchopulmonary affections and, treatment protocols need to be evaluated.

Morphology and measurements of adult parasites found allowed the unequivocal identification of T. brevior and T. subcrenatus, even if first stage larvae were rather similar to those of A. abstrusus. Briefly, T. brevior and T. subcrenatus larvae were shorter in length and lacking the typical knob-like terminal end of A. abstrusus. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses corroborated morphological identification and provided data on mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA genes of T. brevior. Conclusions Data presented here indicate that T. brevior and T. subcrenatus may cause major respiratory distress in domestic cats. Consequently, these two species should be included, along with A. abstrusus, in the differential diagnosis of cat bronchopulmonary affections and treatment protocols need to be evaluated. Through research on the biology, epidemiology and control of Troglostrongylus spp. infestations in domestic cats are advisable to implement current knowledge on these neglected metastrongyloids. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nursing home-acquired {{pneumonia}} (NHAP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common infections arising amongst nursing home residents, and its incidence is expected to increase as population ages. The NHAP recommendation for empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, arising from the concept of healthcare-associated pneumonia, has been challenged by recent studies reporting low rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. This single center study analyzes the results of NHAP patients admitted through the Emergency Department (ED) at a tertiary center during the year 2010. There were 116 cases, male gender corresponded to 34. 5  % of patients and median age was 84  years old (IQR 77 - 90). Comorbidities were present in 69. 8  % of cases and 48. 3  % of patients had used healthcare services during the previous 90  days. In-hospital mortality rate was 46. 6  % and median length-of-stay was 9  days. Severity assessment at the Emergency Department provided CURB 65 index score and respective mortality (%) results: zero: n =  0; one: n =  7 (0  %); two: n =  18 (38. 9  %); three: n =  26 (38. 5  %); four: n =  30 (53. 3  %); and five; n =  22 (68. 2  %); and sepsis n =  50 (34. 0  %), severe sepsis n =  43 (48. 8  %) and septic shock n =  22 (72. 7  %). Significant risk factors for in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis were <b>polypnea</b> (p =  0. 001), age ≥  75  years (p =  0. 02), and severe sepsis or shock (p =  0. 03) at the ED. Microbiological testing in 78. 4  % of cases was positive in 15. 4  % (n =  15) : methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26. 7  %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20. 0  %), S. pneumoniae (13. 3  %), Escherichia coli (13. 3  %), others (26. 7  %); the rate of MDR bacteria was 53. 3  %. This study reveals high rates of mortality and MDR bacteria among NHAP hospital admissions supporting the use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in these patients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To isolate and {{characterize}} the newly discovered human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in Chongqing, China and elucidate the clinical manifestations of hMPV infection. METHODS: Eighty-six patients hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infection in Children's Hospital, Chongqing University of Medical Sciences from December 2004 to July 2005 {{were enrolled in}} the present study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected for screening for common respiratory viruses by direct immunofluorescence assay, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3 and adenovirus, and for inoculating onto Vero-E 6 and LLC-MK 2 cells for hMPV isolation. Cultures were maintained in the presence of trypsin and observed for development of cytopathic effect (CPE) for 3 weeks. Presence of hMPV was first indicated by positive CPE and subsequently confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting N and F genes. Sequence of amplified F fragments were analyzed and submitted to NCBI GenBank. The clinical findings of hMPV infection were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the collected 86 NPAs, six showed CPE characterized by clustering of infected cells, increased granules and eventuall detachment from cell monolayer and obvious syncytium formation. Successful isolation of hMPVs was confirmed with RT-PCR targeting hMPV F and N genes. Of the six hMPV-positive specimens, two were collected in winter (December, January), two in spring (May) and the other two in autumn (June, July). All the six patients were younger than 2 years of age with disease spectrum of bronchiolitis (2 / 6), bronchopneumonia (2 / 6), infantile asthma (1 / 6) and upper respiratory tract infection (1 / 6). Clinical findings included fever, cough, wheezing, <b>polypnea,</b> cyanosis and rales. Parainfluenza 3 and adenovirus seemed to beviral pathogens of co-infection. CONCLUSION: Six hMPVs were successfully isolated in the mainland of China for the first time. HMPV appears to be one important viral pathogen for acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children with a detection rate of 7 % (6 / 86) by viral isolation. The virus causes respiratory diseases similar to those caused by respiratory syncytial virus. These findings highlight the need for future investigations to define disease burden of hMPV infection and molecular epidemiology among children in China. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Primary lung cancer {{is one of}} the most common malignant tumors. It causes great pain and mood disorders to patients, and significantly reduces their quality of life. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of Feiji Decoction for soothing the liver combined with psychotherapy on quality of life (QoL) and physical status of patients with primary lung cancer. Methods A total of 118 patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer were randomly divided into two groups. The 57 patients in the combined therapy group were treated with Feiji Decoction for soothing the liver and psychotherapy combined with chemotherapy, whereas the 61 patients in the control group were treated with chemotherapy only. Both groups were observed for the two treatment courses. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire LC- 43 (EORTC QLQ-LC 43) was used to assess the QoL of every patient in both groups before and after treatment scales. At the same time, physical status was assessed using the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and East Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG). Results The scores of physiology function, role function, emotion function, cognize function, society function, and general health in the therapy group were higher than that of the control group. The therapy group also showed better QoL results than the contol group. Significant differences were observed between the two groups (P< 0. 01). Meanwhile, the scores of fatigue, vomit, pain, <b>polypnea,</b> insomnia, anorexia, constipation, and specific manifestation of lung cancer in the therapy group were obviously lower than that of the control group; more patients were observed to be relieved. Significant differences between the two groups were observed (P< 0. 01). The KPS and ECOG scores of the patients were observed to have improved and stabilized in the therapy group than that of the control group; the differences were statistically significant (P< 0. 01). Conclusion Feiji Decoction for soothing the liver combined with psychotherapy can alleviate the clinical symptoms, elevate the physical status, and improve the QOL of patients with primary lung cancer. Thus, this therapy has a good clinical therapeutic effect...|$|E
40|$|A {{descriptive}} {{study of a}} series of cases was carried out, where 109 patients with the presumptive diagnosis of severe clinical pictures of Influenza were included, the total of them admitted in one of our Intensive Care Units (ICU), prepared for that purpose during the recent pandemic, during the period comprised between October 1 and December 31, 2009. There were 62 women (56, 9 %), of which 19 were pregnant or postpartum women (17, 4 %). The mean age of the sick persons of this serie was of 52, 53 ± 22, 54 years. The beginning of symptoms before the time of admission revealed an average of 4, 90 ± 4, 37 days. The predominant symptoms were: cough in 93 patients (85, 3 %), dyspnea in 86 (78, 9 %), fever in 76 (68, 8 %) and general symptoms of asthenia and anorexia in 76 (68, 8 %). In the physical exam, the most frequent signs were: <b>polypnea</b> in 86 (78, 9 %) and wet rales in 65 (59, 6 %). Personal antecedents were informed by patients suffering arterial hypertension in 31 (28, 4 %), bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease in 26 (23, 9 %), diabetes in 19 (17, 4 %), ischemic heart disease in 19 (17, 4 %), alcoholism in 5 (4, 6 %) and valvulopathies in 4 (3, 7 %). Among the signs found in the thorax´s radiographies at the moment of admission, it prevailed the pattern of radiopacity diffuse hilar and bilateral parahilar in 31 patients (28, 4 %), followed by bilateral diffuse opacities toward medial and inferiors lobes in 16 (14, 7 %), unilateral diffuse radiopacity in 12 (11, 0 %), increment in the broncovascular network in 13 (11, 9 %), lobar consolidation in 7 (6, 4 %) and pleural esfusion in 5 (4, 6 %). In 25 cases the initial X-ray films were normal.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Extragonadal teratomas {{are rare}} tumors in {{neonates}} and infants and can sometimes show unusual, distinctive feature {{such as an}} unusual location, a clinical sometimes acute, presentation and a "fetiform" histotype of the lesion. We have extrapolated, from our entire experience of teratomas, 4 unusual cases, mostly operated as emergencies; 2 of them were treated just after birth. Aim {{of this paper is}} to report the clinical and pathological findings, to evaluate the surgical approach and the long-term biological behaviour in these cases, in the light of survival and current insights reported in the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Authors reviewed the most significant (Tables I and II) clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and pathologic findings, surgical procedures, early and long-term results in 4 children, 1 male and 3 females (M/F ratio: 1 / 3), suffering from extragonadal teratomas, located in the temporo-zygomatic region of the head (Case n. 1, Fig. 1), retroperitoneal space (Case n. 2, Fig. 2),liver (Case n. 3, Figg. 3 - 5), kidney (Case n. 4, Fig. 6, 7), respectively. Of the 4 patients, 2 were treated neonatally (1 T. of the head, 1 retroperitoneal T.) A prenatal diagnosis had already been made in 2 of the 4 patients, between the 2 nd and 3 rd trimester of pregnancy, All the infants were born by scheduled caesarean section in a tertiary care hospital and were the immediately referred to thew N. I. C. Us. Because of a mostly acute clinical presentation, the 4 patients were then referred to the surgical unit at different ages: 7 days, 28 days, 7 months, and 4 years respectively. The initial clinical presentation (Table II) was consistent with the site of the mass and/or its side effects. The 2 newborns (Case 1 and 2) both with a prenatally diagnosed mass located at the temporozygomatic region and in the abdominal cavite respectively, already displayed, at birth a mass with a tendency to further growth. The symptoms and signs described to the primary care physician by the parents of the 2 patients suffering from intra-abdominal tumours (Cases n. 3, 4) were: swelling of the epigastrium and left hypochondrium due to a progressively growing hard mass, without impairment of the general, conditions in case n. 3 (teratoma of the liver),while recurrent abdominal pain lasting for the 5 months was described in case n. 4 (retroperitoneal teratoma), followed by the development of an evident hard mass occupying the entire abdomen. In this case the symptoms suddenly worsened, with acute pain extending to the entire abdomen, high fever (> 39 ° C), <b>polypnea,</b> anemia, deterioration of the general conditions and a rapid further enlargement of the mass. Antibiotic therapy was ansuccessful. The young child underwent a radiologic investigation (Fig. 6) that showed a large calcified mass in the left retroperitoneal space, associated with pleural effusion, In all the patients except for the Case n. 3, emergency surgical management was required and, in accordance with recommended practice, the procedure was complete exeresis. RESULTS (TABLE I) : All the 4 patients had an uneventful postoperative course. Clinical surveillance and tests of AFP and other markers were scheduled every 6 months for the first years and annually thereafter. At the current date they are alive, disease-free and have not suffered any recurrence with a follow-up as reported in Table I, of 7 years in case n. 2; 23 years in case n. 1; 42 years in case n. 3 and 36 years in case n. 4. CONCLUSIONS: Some extragonadal teratomas of childhood of may rarely arise in the solid organs (liver, kidney), in the retroperitoneal space or the cranio-facial region, and also show unique histotype childhood characteristics ("fetiform") which distinguish them from more common cases. Being congenital tumours, prenatal diagnosis by US scan is extremely important in order to organize proper perinatal care in appropriate facilities where it is possible to define the diagnosis and carry out emergency surgery. An emergency procedure is frequently dictated both by complications related to the mass eddect and by the need to define the histology of the whole mass rather than just small biopsy specimens, Some teratomatas can hide more or less extensive islands of immaturity signs of malignant transformation that are clinically evident. It should be remembered that high serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein and calcficationof the imaging study, that are usually pathognomonic elements for fiagnosis, nay be lacking in abdominal lesions. Moreover, some additional specific diagnostic problems can be faced by either the radiologist (differential diagnosis from acquired or congenital cystic lesions, identification of the primary site of origin in the liver kidney or retroperitoneal space). Or the histopathologist (exclusion of renal metastasis of a primary gonadal teratomas of a glomerular and tubular differentiation a Wilm's tumour). The prognosis is generally benign, although the AIEOP guideline pointed out that high levels of circulating markers, including AFP, in children affected by mature or immature teratomas, could indicate rhe presence of micro-foci of YST, marking them out as at high risk. The UKCCSG II and the SFOP indicates AFP values exceeding 10, 000 ng/ml as the threshold identifying a group of patients with a severe prognosis. The treatment indicated is early, complete exeresis, followed by a careful, exstensive, microscopic examination, associated, if necessary, with adjuvant chemotherapy. Finally, to improve the prognosis, close, long-term clinical, laboratory and imaging surveillance is necessary, at shorter intervals during the first 5 years after the exeresis and annually thereafter...|$|E
