5|$|Music with a fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was {{reinforced}} by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, 7 billion small <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> were dropped from a Westland helicopter, each piece representing one person on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese paper-folding art of origami {{has been}} {{reworked}} mathematically by Tomoko Fusé using modules, congruent <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> such as squares, {{and making them}} into polyhedra or tilings. Paper-folding was used in 1893 by T. Sundara Rao in his Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding to demonstrate geometrical proofs. The mathematics of paper folding has been explored in Maekawa's theorem, Kawasaki's theorem, and the Huzita–Hatori axioms.|$|E
5|$|On his person, {{they find}} a note in his wallet that {{eventually}} leads Scully and Mulder to conclude that it was Tessa, not Ruby, who was pregnant. Under interrogation, Tessa confesses to killing Greg but denies Ruby was at Lake Okobogee that night. Mulder and Scully return to the Morris' house, and, finding it deserted, discover the binary-covered <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> laid out {{across the living room}} floor, forming an image of Ruby's face. The agents return to Lake Okobogee, where they find Darlene and Kevin in the nearby woods. A motorcycle gang appears, and as Mulder hurries to rescue Kevin from their wake, Scully discovers Ruby nearby.|$|E
5000|$|... #77 [...] "No <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> can be {{folded in}} half more than 7 times." [...] This myth was proven wrong by Britney Gallivan in 2002 when she managed 12 folds. In 2005, drawing on Gallivan's accomplishment, MythBusters folded a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> 11 times. The <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> used in Mythbusters was an {{oversized}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> that was thinner than a standard 8.5"x11" [...] (21.59 x 27.94 cm) <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|R

50|$|Former Secret Intelligence Service officer Richard Tomlinson {{alleges that}} Pentel Rolling Writer rollerball pens were {{extensively}} used by agents to produce secret writing (invisible messages) while on missions. An agent would write the secret message on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> then place a blank <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> over the message, pressing the two pages {{together for a}} moment. When they are separated, the second page looks completely blank but in fact, contains a latent (invisible) copy of the message. The agent then destroys the first <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> Simply rubbing the blank-looking second <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with an ink pen reveals the latent message.|$|R
5|$|Since {{fractional}} {{currency in}} three-cent denominations {{did not appear}} until late 1864, the cent was the only means then circulating of making change from the five-cent note, and came, in 1862 and 1863, to command a premium when sold in lots, of about 4%. The Philadelphia Mint tried {{to keep up with}} demand, limiting public purchases of cents to five dollars, and sending shipments to major cities. Despite these attempts, Mint Director James Pollock noted in his annual reports that cents were almost unobtainable, hoarded despite the fact that their metallic value remained less than one cent each. Numismatist Neil Carothers theorized that they were put aside by the public as the only circulating federal coinage, made of metal {{at a time when the}} public was forced to accept flimsy <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> instead of silver and gold.|$|E

25|$|The Dadaists imitated the {{techniques}} {{developed during the}} cubist movement through the pasting of cut <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> items, but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets, maps, plastic wrappers, etc. to portray aspects of life, rather than representing objects viewed as still life.|$|E
50|$|An {{adhesive}} label {{is a small}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> designed to be affixed to another larger <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> or other object, typically {{by the action of}} a layer of adhesive {{on the back of the}} label.|$|R
5000|$|Detchōsō (粘葉装), or [...] "glued books": To {{create these}} books, binders took a double-wide <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and folded it {{vertically}} {{to create a}} single, connected <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with four printable sides. A number of these folded pages would then be stacked and bound together by applying glue to the creased edges, the front page, and the back page, then mounting the glued surfaces with a cover made from a continuous <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> This binding method was used primarily for hand-copied manuscripts.|$|R

25|$|An {{example is}} Enrico Fermi's {{estimate}} {{of the strength of}} the atomic bomb that detonated at the Trinity test, based on the distance traveled by <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> he dropped from his hand during the blast. Fermi's estimate of 10 kilotons of TNT was remarkably close to the now-accepted value of around 20 kilotons.|$|E
50|$|Each {{person in}} a {{circular}} group writes down one idea, and then passes the <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> to the next person, who adds some thoughts. This continues until everybody gets his or her original <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> back. By this time, {{it is likely that}} the group will have extensively elaborated on each idea.|$|R

25|$|Faraday is {{best known}} for his work {{regarding}} electricity and magnetism. His first recorded experiment was the construction of a voltaic pile with seven ha'penny coins, stacked together with seven disks of sheet zinc, and six <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> moistened with salt water. With this pile he decomposed sulfate of magnesia (first letter to Abbott, 12 July 1812).|$|E

Such practices have been strongly criticized by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.|$|E

25|$|Many more {{mathematical}} formulas describe {{shapes that}} are unfamiliar, {{or do not}} necessarily correspond to objects in the real world. For example, the Klein bottle is a one-sided, sealed surface with no inside or outside (in other words, it is the three-dimensional equivalent of the Möbius strip). Such objects can be represented by twisting and cutting or taping <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> together, {{as well as by}} computer simulations. To hold them in the imagination, abstractions such as extra or fewer dimensions are necessary.|$|E

For each event the names of all selected crews are placed on <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> which are then drawn at random from the Grand Challenge Cup. These crews are then placed on pre-determined positions on the draw chart, as far apart as possible. The remaining qualifying crews are then drawn from the cup, filling in {{from the top of the}} draw chart downwards, until all places have been filled.|$|E
25|$|To achieve proper {{intonation}} {{and sound}} quality, each string of a hurdy-gurdy must be wrapped with cotton or similar fibers. The cotton on melody strings {{tends to be}} quite light, while drone strings have heavier cotton. Improper cottoning results in a raspy tone, especially at higher pitches. In addition, individual strings (in particular the melody strings) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> placed between the strings and the bridge, a process called shimming. Shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument's strings.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the 1955 {{election}} {{have been attributed to}} fraud and intimidation. Voters were intimidated by a voting system involving colored <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> that had to be put into a box in full view of Sihanouk's political figures, soldiers and local police. In many cases, voting results were simply falsified as in the case where a district that had been a Viet Minh stronghold for years did not return a single vote for the far left. Writer Philip Short points to a 1957 statement by Sihanouk admitting that thirty six electoral districts had voted Pracheachon or Democrat majority whereas the official results said that they had won none.|$|E
