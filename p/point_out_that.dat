5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused {{the battle to}} begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement {{in the remainder of}} the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Harlan {{claimed that}} his script was less antisemitic than the Metzger/Möller script. He even {{claimed that the}} Mendes' script was more antisemitic than his. However, in rebuttal, Haggith and Newman <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Harlan added an {{important}} sequence in which Süß {{is responsible for the}} execution of a blacksmith, a sequence which served to increase the audience's hatred for Süß.|$|E

5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theorists grossly overestimate {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> political repression at home and imperialism abroad {{have a long history}} in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-bathhouse activists {{argue that}} these {{measures}} are not enough, especially given that {{it is virtually impossible}} to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, they <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sexboth of which put participants at risk for contracting STDsin such situations.|$|E
25|$|Greece and Rome were {{looked to}} as model republics {{throughout}} this debate, and authors {{on both sides}} took Roman pseudonyms.

5|$|Tyrannosaur teeth could crush bone, and {{therefore}} could extract as much food (bone marrow) {{as possible from}} carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts.

5|$|Warren and her {{daughter}} Amelia Tyagi wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. Warren and Tyagi <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is that even with two income earners, families are {{no longer able to}} save and have incurred greater and greater debt.|$|E

5|$|Barbara Ketcham Wheaton and Stephen Mennell {{provided}} the definitive arguments against these claims. They <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Catherine’s father-in-law, King Francis I, and the flower of the French aristocracy had dined {{at some of}} Italy’s most élite tables during the king’s Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during King Charles VIII’s invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de’ Medici’s father to her French-born mother; {{and that she had}} little influence at court until her husband’s death because he was so besotted by his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning Renaissance. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a mirror in creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E
5|$|Gimsa et al. (2015) {{suggest that}} the dorsal sail of Spinosaurus was {{homologous}} to the dorsal fins of sailfish and served a hydrodynamic purpose.

They therefore argue that Spinosaurus used its dorsal neural sail {{in the same manner}} as sailfish, and that it also employed its long narrow tail to stun prey like a modern thresher shark.|$|E
