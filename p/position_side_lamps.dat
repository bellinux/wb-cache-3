50|$|LEDs {{were first}} applied to {{automotive}} lighting in centre high mount stop lamps (CHMSL), {{beginning in the}} late 1980s. Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals. The 2007 Audi R8 sports car uses two strips of optically focused high-intensity LEDs for its daytime running lamps. Optional on the R8 outside North America was the world's first LED headlamp made by AL-Automotive Lighting. The low and high beams along with the position (parking) lamp and front turn signal are all realised with LEDs. The Lexus LS 600h features LED low beam, <b>position</b> and <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> in North America, and the 2009 Cadillac Escalade Platinum uses LEDs for the low and high beams, {{as well as for the}} <b>position</b> and <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> The Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) has no non-LED lamps at all, not even in the most basic trim level.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles are {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} lights and reflectors to mark their presence, position, width, length, and direction of travel as well as to convey the driver's intent and actions to other drivers. These include the vehicle's headlamps, front and rear <b>position</b> <b>lamps,</b> <b>side</b> marker lights and reflectors, turn signals, stop (brake) lamps, and reversing lamps. School buses and Semi-trailer trucks in North America are required to bear retroreflective strips outlining their side and rear perimeters for greater conspicuity at night.|$|R
50|$|A later job of {{the guard}} was the {{provision}} of <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> on brake vans, see picture where all three <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> are visible. The white lamp is the tail lamp, whilst the grey <b>lamps</b> are the <b>side</b> <b>lamps,</b> along with the standard tail lamp (showing red to the rear and sides) required on the rear of every train. The <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> showed a white light towards the front and a red light to the side/rear. The front-facing lamps were an indication to the locomotive crew that the train was still complete, whilst the provision of extra red lights to the rear was an additional safety measure. Due to the very low chance of all three lights being out at once, it was stipulated that a freight train passing without any lamps on the rear had split and that the rear portion was potentially running away. These <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> were used on passenger trains before the adoption of continuous brakes on such trains.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The present {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effect of small amber lamps mounted near {{the front and rear}} on each side of a passenger car-so called side marker lamps-on visual detection and recognition of passenger cars in complex nighttime environments. It was determined whether cars equipped with <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> are detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than cars without <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> Subjects were presented with slides of natural nighttime scenes in which a car, either with or without <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps,</b> viewed from its side, approaching from a side street, was either present or not. Subjects determined as fast as possible whether a car was present or not. Reaction time measures (speed and accuracy) indicated that both under clear and fog visibility conditions, a car equipped with <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> was detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than a car without <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> The results indicate that <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> increase both lateral conspicuity and recognizability suggesting that <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> may be effective i...|$|R

As for Hodder, he was not only {{undergoing}} a certain shock through the sudden contact, at such a moment, with Alison's brother: there was an additional shock that this was Alison's brother and Eldon Parr's son. Not that his appearance was shocking, although the well-clad, athletic figure was growing a trifle heavy, and the light from the <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> of the car revealed dissipation in a still handsome face. The effect was a subtler one, not to be analyzed, and due to a multitude of preconceptions.|$|R

The apertures within a particular amplifier bundle are arranged in a four- high by two-wide configuration and utilize two <b>side</b> <b>lamp</b> arrays and a central flashlamp array for pumping.

50|$|The massive {{headlamp}} and <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> {{were added}} when night trains began running in 1879, while the sandbox was relocated from the running boards {{to the top}} of the boiler, ahead of the steam dome. At one stage, the vacuum brake ejector exhaust pipe was run along the top of the boiler on the right side and then up the rear side of the chimney, but it was altered again later to eject into the side of the smokebox. In addition, the axle-driven boiler feed-water pumps were replaced with injectors and the Salter safety valves were replaced with Ramsbottom safety valves. The modifications are illustrated in the following pictures.|$|R
