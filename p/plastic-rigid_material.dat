40|$|The {{state of}} stress {{in the core of}} a notched bar is {{analysed}} at the moment when pronounced plastic yielding begins. The theory is two-dimensional and an ideal <b>plastic-rigid</b> <b>material</b> is assumed. Following a general analysis of the problem, the magnitude of the constraint factor is calculated for a deep notch with a semi-circular root. The correct approach to problems of plane plastic strain is discussed, and is further illustrated by a re-examination of the classical work of Frandtl on indentation (which is closely related in principle with the notched bar problem). 1. General considerations THE paper is concerned with the {{state of stress}} in the core of a notched bar under an applied load sufficient to cause plastic flow. It is known that the fairly well-defined bend in the load-extension relation for a notched bar corresponds to a mean stress in the core that is greater than the yield stress in a tensile test of an unnotched specimen. The " investiga-tion will be directed particularly to a calculation of the magnitude of this effect in relation to the shape of the notch. The problem will be treated as one of plane strain, so that the specimen is a wide rectangular block, symmetrically notched through the thickness on two sides. The notch is shown in Fig. 1, the plane of the paper representing a plane of flow. Let it be supposed that the applied load at the ends of the specimen is statically equivalent to a tension along the central longitudinal axis. It is also supposed that a distribution of stress, suitable to ensure plane strain, is applied to the two lateral surfaces of the block which are parallel to the planes of flow. The specimen is assumed so long that the state of stress in the neighbourhood of the notch is, to any desired approximation, independent of the precise distribution of the end load. It is further assumed that the notch is of sufficient depth to ensure that the plastic region is localized in and around the core (this will be discussed more carefully later). If the curvature of the notch is greatest at the root, the yield limit is first attained at that point. As the applied end-load is further increased, the plastic region can be expected to spread in thn manner shown i...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} an {{analytical}} solution of a one-dimensional boundary value problem, describing behaviour of a ductile porous cylindrical rod, both {{during and after}} Taylor direct impact experiment (Taylor DIDIE). The solution provides a simple theoretical basis for dynamical investigations of ductile porous material. The solution {{was based on a}} <b>plastic-rigid</b> rate-independent <b>material</b> with strain hardening. For ductile low porous materials with strain hardening, all parameters are presented by means of the closed analytical formulae. The paper presents also a new experimental method of determining distributions of density and longitudinal engineering compressive strain (LECS) in a porous ductile rod, plastically deformed by Taylor DIDIE.
