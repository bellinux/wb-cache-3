Also investigated was the effect of accelerated storage conditions on a number of these honey parameters. The introduction embodies a general review on the supply and source of honey with a brief discussion of the aim of the investigation in order to give perspective to the literature review that follows. This literature review considers previously published work on the chemical composition and properties of honey and also changes in honey parameters occurring as a result of storage with some reference to deterioration in quality. Methods available for the determination of these various parameters are also discussed. Analytical definition of the six honeys embodies determination of colour, moisture content, ash, total nitrogen, pH, acidity, and qualitative and quantitative assessment of metals, sugars, free amino acids, organic acids and volatile components. During the course of this investigation ion exchange chromatography supplemented by automated analytical techniques enabled separation and identification of 17 amino acids and 6 sugars along with detection of another unidentified sugar. Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to detect and estimate 15 elements. Eighteen organic acids, of which 10 were identified, were detected using gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) while procedures involving GLC, infrared and mass spectrometry enabled the identification of 16 honey volatiles of which 12 have not been reported previously. The influence of accelerated storage conditions on colour and the above constituents, apart from ash and metals, was also investigated. Attempts were made to relate both original colour and changes in colour during storage with other honey parameters. The darkening during storage at 50 °C of six Australian honeys was accompanied by no significant change in total nitrogen content and comparatively small changes in total acidity. Two honeys, Lucerne and Coolabah, showed significant decreases in pH with the others showing comparatively small changes in pH during storage. In all honeys studied, sucrose, melizitose and apparent total sugars decreased whereas turanose increased. Changes in levels of other sugars present, namely maltose, fructose and glucose, varied with honey type. While the total free amino acid content decreased during the storage of all honeys with one exception (Tea Tree), the levels of some individual amino acids actually increased in some honeys. In addition changes in organic acids and volatile components as a result of accelerated storage were studied and mechanisms of such changes are discussed. The examination of flavour and colour of the honeys after storage at 50 °C showed a serious alteration in honey colour and flavour. This was shown by high <b>Pfund</b> <b>grader</b> readings, large increases in HMF and the destruction of many honey-like aroma compounds as well as production of some artifactual components. These changes along with complex and significant changes to the organic acids and free amino acids, which probably influence changes in flavour and quality of honey, indicate that honey processors should avoid high temperatures in honey processing for local and, especially, for overseas markets where HMF, colour, flavour and diastase are of great importance. A more rapid procedure for the determination of diastase in honey, based on the use of a chromogenic substrate, was also developed during the investigation...|$|E
