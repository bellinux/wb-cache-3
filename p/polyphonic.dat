5|$|But Dostoyevsky's work, <b>polyphonic</b> in nature, also {{states that}} the love Christ showed to all people and for all people, which is Alyosha's final stance in the novel, is the only good, and {{in the face of}} evil, the beauty that will save the world.|$|E

5|$|From this {{changing}} society emerged a common, unifying musical language, {{in particular}} the <b>polyphonic</b> style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased {{with the emergence of}} a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of <b>polyphonic</b> practice into the fluid style that culminated {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and William Byrd.|$|E
5|$|In writing <b>polyphonic</b> {{settings}} of psalms, Josquin was a pioneer, and psalm settings form {{a large proportion}} of the motets of his later years. Few composers prior to Josquin had written <b>polyphonic</b> psalm settings. Some of Josquin's settings include the famous Miserere, written in Ferrara in 1503 or 1504 and most likely inspired by the recent execution of the reformist monk Girolamo Savonarola, Memor esto verbi tui, based on Psalm 119, and two {{settings of}} De profundis (Psalm 130), both of which are often considered to be among his most significant accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|Italian folk {{styles are}} very diverse, and include monophonic, <b>polyphonic,</b> and responsorial song, choral, {{instrumental}} and vocal music, and other styles. Choral singing and <b>polyphonic</b> song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo singing is more common, and groups usually use unison singing {{in two or}} three parts carried by a single performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict tempo and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a rubato tempo, and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little perception of a common Italian folk tradition, and the country's folk music never became a national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{development was}} dominated by the Occident from 1400 on, indeed, the most profound changes occurred during the Renaissance period. Instruments took on other purposes than accompanying singing or dance, and performers used them as solo instruments. Keyboards and lutes developed as <b>polyphonic</b> instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced tablature. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments. In {{the latter half of}} the sixteenth century, orchestration came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion. The <b>polyphonic</b> style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polyphonic</b> music {{written for}} the monks of Christ Church Priory (the cathedral) survives from the 13th century. The cathedral may have had an organ {{as early as the}} 12th century, though the names of organists are only {{recorded}} from the early 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Salegy is funky, {{energetic}} {{dance music}} dominated by ringing electric guitars, accordion (real or synthesized), and call-and-response <b>polyphonic</b> vocals, with heavy electric bass and a driving percussion. The percussion section might include a drum kit, djembe, and shakers.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's opera {{based on}} the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first {{performed}} in 1913, after which the composer published {{a version of the}} prelude transcribed for piano. The piece, in G minor, contrasts a gravely noble andante moderato theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The <b>polyphonic</b> writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original to the piano.|$|E
5|$|The Mellotron is an electro-mechanical, <b>polyphonic</b> tape replay {{keyboard}} {{originally developed}} and built in Birmingham, England, in 1963. It {{evolved from a}} similar instrument, the Chamberlin, but could be mass-produced more effectively. The instrument works by pulling a section of magnetic tape across a head. Different portions of the tape can be played to access different sounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the island of Sardinia {{is best known for}} the <b>polyphonic</b> {{chanting}} of the tenores. The sound of the tenores recalls the roots of Gregorian chant, and is similar to but distinctive from the Ligurian trallalero. Typical instruments include the launeddas, a Sardinian triplepipe used in a sophisticated and complex manner. Efisio Melis was a well-known master launeddas player of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The Mellotron {{became more}} popular after the Beatles used it on several tracks. It was {{subsequently}} {{adopted by the}} Moody Blues, King Crimson and Genesis, and became a notable instrument in progressive rock. Later models such as the M400, the best selling model, dispensed with the accompaniments and some sound selection controls {{in order to be}} used by touring musicians. The instrument became less popular in the 1980s due to the introduction of <b>polyphonic</b> synthesizers and samplers, despite a number of high-profile uses from Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and XTC.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect {{was that of a}} Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new <b>polyphonic</b> synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E
5|$|The Stage Synthesizer {{combines}} wavetables with analog oscillators and FM operators. Featuring {{filter and}} envelope controls, the Synth Section's timbre knob {{allows users to}} move through different sound groups. A number of programs are available to store sounds under three categories – Synth, Pad or Bass. The Synth also includes a 2-band EQ, a glide (portamento) function, and a unison function {{which is used to}} thicken the sound. The Synth Section is 16-note <b>polyphonic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Auf der Maur {{promoted}} the album with an almost-constant tour across Europe, the United Kingdom and North America during 2004. The seven-leg tour commenced on January 30, 2004 and concluded on December 4. The 151-date tour included support from A Perfect Circle, Mínus, The Living Things, The Offspring, The <b>Polyphonic</b> Spree, The Von Bondies, Matthew Good and H.I.M. amongst others. During the tour, Auf der Maur performed at various summer festivals including Curiosa in the United States, Pukkelpop in Belgium, Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands, Reading Festival, Leeds Festival in the United Kingdom, and Independents Day Festival in Italy. During the entire tour, Auf der Maur published photography from the shows on her official web site.|$|E
5|$|During {{his long}} and {{productive}} career, Arcadelt wrote music both sacred and secular, {{all of it}} vocal. He left a total of 24 motets, 125 French chansons, approximately 250 madrigals (about fifty of which are of uncertain attribution), three masses, as well as settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah and the Magnificat. There may {{be as many as}} 250 more madrigals by Arcadelt which survive anonymously in manuscript sources. Influences on his music ranged from the chanson and <b>polyphonic</b> style of his northern homeland, the native secular music of Italy such as the frottola, and the music he heard while he served in the Sistine Chapel choir. Of all the early madrigalists, he was by far the most universal in his influences as well as his appeal; and his influence on others was enormous. Arcadelt brought the madrigal form to its early maturity.|$|E
5|$|Following the European and Italian in {{particular}} musical trends, the Renaissance music was developing in Poland, {{centered around the}} royal court patronage and branching from there. Sigismund I kept from 1543 a permanent choir at the Wawel castle, while the Reformation brought large scale group Polish language church singing during the services. Jan of Lublin wrote a comprehensive tablature for the organ and other keyboard instruments. Among the composers, who often permeated their music with national and folk elements, were Wacław of Szamotuły, Mikołaj Gomółka, who wrote music to Kochanowski translated psalms, and Mikołaj Zieleński, who enriched the Polish music by adopting the Venetian School <b>polyphonic</b> style.|$|E
5|$|His music became {{immensely popular}} in Italy and France {{for more than}} a hundred years, with his first book of madrigals being reprinted fifty-eight times by 1654, and his music {{appearing}} in innumerable intabulations for instruments such as the lute, guitar, and viol. Additional hints to his popularity are the frequency with which anonymous compositions were attributed to him, and the appearance of his music in several paintings of musicians from the time. Likely his popularity was due to his gift for capturing the Italian spirit and marrying it with the technical perfection of the Franco-Flemish harmonic and <b>polyphonic</b> style; in addition he wrote catchy tunes which were easy to sing. Unlike later generations of madrigal composers, Arcadelt did not expect professional singers to be the only consumers of his work; anyone who could read notes could sing his madrigals.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrument}} {{evolved from}} Rhodes' attempt to manufacture pianos to teach recovering soldiers during World War II under a strict budget, and development continued throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Fender started marketing the Piano Bass, a cut-down {{version of the}} piano, but the full-size instrument did not appear until after the sale to CBS in 1965. CBS oversaw mass production of the Rhodes piano in the 1970s, and it was used extensively through the decade, particularly in jazz, pop, and soul music. It fell out of fashion {{for a while in}} the mid-1980s, principally due to the emergence of <b>polyphonic</b> and later digital synthesizers, especially the Yamaha DX7, and partly through inconsistent quality control in production due to cost-cutting measures. The company was eventually sold to Roland, which manufactured digital versions of the Rhodes without authorization or approval from its inventor.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, Jack {{displayed}} a continued partiality towards amps and pedals from the 1960s. Jack used {{a number of}} effects to create his sound, such as a DigiTech Whammy IV to reach pitches that would be otherwise impossible with a regular guitar. When performing live, Jack used a Randy Parsons custom guitar, a 1964 JB Hutto Montgomery Airline, a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s Crestwood Astral II, and a 1950s Kay Hollowbody. Also, while playing live, he used an MXR Micro-Amp, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi distortion/sustainer, and an Electro-Harmonix POG (a <b>polyphonic</b> octave generator). He also used a Boss TU-2 tuner pedal. He plugged this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb, and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 1485 amplifiers paired with two 6x10 Silvertone cabinets. In addition to standard guitar tuning, Jack also used several open tunings.|$|E
5|$|Early synth-pop pioneers {{included}} Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra, and British bands Ultravox, the Human League and Berlin Blondes; the Human League used monophonic synthesizers {{to produce}} {{music with a}} simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like Japan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and newcomers such as Depeche Mode and Eurythmics. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success {{opened the way for}} synth-pop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive <b>polyphonic</b> synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet) in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, Scottish kings, {{particularly}} James V, built palaces in a Renaissance style, beginning at Linlithgow. The trend soon spread {{to members of}} the aristocracy. Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish art, with works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists. While church art suffered iconoclasm and a loss of patronage {{as a result of the}} Reformation, house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy, with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early seventeenth century. Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex <b>polyphonic</b> church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms. Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources of patronage, changing the direction of artistic creation and limiting its scope. In the early seventeenth century the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Stoicism, Mannerism and the Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Josquin likely {{learned his}} craft {{in his home}} region in the North, in France, and then in Italy {{when he went to}} Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a <b>polyphonic</b> composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E
5|$|Later the Calvinism {{that came}} to {{dominate}} the Scottish Reformation was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing an emphasis on what was biblical, which meant the Psalms. The Scottish Psalter of 1564 was commissioned by the Assembly of the Church. It drew {{on the work of}} French musician Clément Marot, Calvin's contributions to the Strasbourg Psalter of 1539 and English writers, particularly the 1561 edition of the Psalter produced by William Whittingham for the English congregation in Geneva. The intention was to produce individual tunes for each psalm, but of 150 psalms, 105 had proper tunes and in the seventeenth century, common tunes, which could be used for psalms with the same metre, became more frequent. Because whole congregations would now sing these psalms, unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of <b>polyphonic</b> hymns, there was a need for simplicity and most church compositions were confined to homophonic settings.|$|E
5|$|Public {{occasions}} {{were treated}} with mistrust and from the later seventeenth century there were efforts by kirk sessions to stamp out activities such as well-dressing, bonfires, guising, penny weddings and dancing. The Reformation had a severe impact on church music. The Lutheranism that influenced the early Scottish Reformation attempted to accommodate Catholic musical traditions into worship, drawing on Latin hymns and vernacular songs. The most important product of this tradition in Scotland was The Gude and Godlie Ballatis, which were spiritual satires on popular ballads composed by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn. Never adopted by the kirk, they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the 1540s to the 1620s. Later the Calvinism that came to dominate was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing {{an emphasis on the}} Psalms. The Scottish Psalter of 1564 was commissioned by the Assembly of the Church. Whole congregations would now all sing these psalms, often using common tunes, unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of <b>polyphonic</b> hymns.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation had {{a severe}} impact on church music. The song {{schools of the}} abbeys, cathedrals and collegiate churches were closed down, choirs disbanded, music books and manuscripts {{destroyed}} and organs removed from churches.

The need for simplicity for whole congregations that would now all sing these psalms, unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of <b>polyphonic</b> hymns, necessitated simplicity and most church compositions were confined to homophonic settings. There is evidence that polyphony survived and it was incorporated into editions of the Psalter from 1625, but usually with the congregation singing the melody and trained singers the contra-tenor, treble and bass parts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} an {{improving}} system of roads in early modern Scotland, it remained a country divided by topography, particularly between the Highlands and Islands and the Lowlands. Most of the economic development was in the Lowlands, which saw the beginnings of industrialisation, agricultural improvement {{and the expansion of}} eastern burghs, particularly Glasgow, as trade routes to the Americas opened up. The local laird emerged as a key figure and the heads of names and clans in the Borders and Highlands declined in importance. There was a population expanding {{towards the end of the}} period and increasing urbanisation. Social tensions were evident in witch trials and the creation of a system of poor laws. Despite the aggrandisement of the crown and the increase in forms of taxation, revenues remained inadequate. The Privy Council and Parliament remained central to government, with changing compositions and importance before the Act of Union in 1707 saw their abolition. The growth of local government saw introduction of Justices of the Peace and Commissioners of Supply, while the law saw the increasing importance of royal authority and professionalisation. The expansion of parish schools and reform of universities heralded the beginnings of an intellectual flowering in the Enlightenment. There was also a flowering of Scottish literature before the loss of the court as a centre of patronage at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The tradition of church music was fundamentally changed by the Reformation, with the loss of complex <b>polyphonic</b> music for a new tradition of metrical psalms singing. In architecture, royal building was strongly influenced by Renaissance styles, while the houses of the great lairds adopted a hybrid form known as Scots baronial and after the Restoration was influenced by Palladian and Baroque styles. In church architecture a distinctive plain style based on a 'T'-plan emerged. The Reformation also had a major impact on art, with a loss of church patronage leading to a tradition of painted ceilings and walls and the beginnings of a tradition of portraiture and landscape painting.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, Keith McMillen of Keith McMillen Instruments, {{a founder}} of Zeta Music, {{announced}} the 'StringPort' <b>polyphonic</b> string-to-USB 2.0 converter which will connect with the Zeta <b>polyphonic</b> pickup and other modern <b>polyphonic</b> violin systems.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, the Yamaha GX-1 was manufactured. It {{was early}} <b>polyphonic</b> synthesizer, {{featuring}} eight voices. In 1974, Roland Corporation released the EP-30, the first touch-sensitive keyboard. Roland also released early <b>polyphonic</b> string synthesizers, the RS-101 in 1975 and the RS-202 in 1976.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church later allowed <b>polyphonic</b> {{arrangements}} {{to replace the}} Gregorian chant of the Ordinary of the Mass. This is why the Mass as a compositional form, as set by composers like Palestrina or Mozart, features a Kyrie but not an Introit. The Propers may also be replaced by choral settings on certain solemn occasions. Among the composers who most frequently wrote <b>polyphonic</b> settings of the Propers were William Byrd and Tomás Luis de Victoria. These <b>polyphonic</b> arrangements usually incorporate elements of the original chant.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Isaac was especially pronounced in Germany, {{due to the}} connection he maintained with the Habsburg court. He was the first significant master of the Franco-Flemish <b>polyphonic</b> style who both lived in German-speaking areas, and whose music was widely distributed there. It was through him that the <b>polyphonic</b> style of the Netherlands became widely accepted in Germany, making possible the further development of contrapuntal music there.|$|E

25|$|The Mbenga (Aka/Benzele) and Baka {{peoples in}} the west and the Mbuti (Efé) in the east are {{particularly}} known for their dense contrapuntal communal improvisation. Simha Arom says that the level of <b>polyphonic</b> complexity of Mbenga–Mbuti music was reached in Europe only in the 14th century. The <b>polyphonic</b> singing of the Aka Pygmies was relisted on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Harmonice Musices Odhecaton (One Hundred Songs of Harmonic Music, {{also known}} simply as the Odhecaton) was an {{anthology}} of <b>polyphonic</b> secular songs published by Ottaviano Petrucci in 1501 in Venice. It was the first book of <b>polyphonic</b> music ever to be printed using movable type. (Printing plainchant with movable type had been possible since the 1470s.) The Odhecaton was hugely influential both in publishing in general and in dissemination of the Franco-Flemish musical style.|$|E
