40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} which allows interpreting steady-state <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> in heterogeneous isotropic transmissivity fields. In contrast to mean uniform flow, <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> drawdowns in heterogeneous media cannot be {{described by a}} single effective or equivalent value of hydraulic transmissivity. An effective description of transmissivity is required, being {{a function of the}} radial distance to the well and including the parameters of log-transmissivity: mean, variance, and correlation length. Such a model is provided by the upscaling procedure radial coarse graining, which describes the transition of near-well to far-field transmissivity effectively. Based on this approach, an analytical solution for a steady-state <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> drawdown is deduced. The so-called effective well flow solution is derived for two cases: the ensemble mean of <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> and the drawdown within an individual heterogeneous transmissivity field. The analytical form of the solution allows inversely estimating the parameters of aquifer heterogeneity. For comparison with the effective well flow solution, virtual <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> are performed and analysed for both cases, the ensemble mean drawdown and <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> at individual transmissivity fields. Interpretation of ensemble mean drawdowns showed proof of the upscaling method. The effective well flow solution reproduces the drawdown for two-dimensional <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> in heterogeneous media in contrast to Thiem's solution for homogeneous media. Multiple <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> conducted at different locations within an individual transmissivity field are analysed, making use of the effective well flow solution to show that all statistical parameters of aquifer heterogeneity can be inferred under field conditions. Thus, the presented method is a promising tool with which to estimate parameters of aquifer heterogeneity, in particular variance and horizontal correlation length of log-transmissivity fields from steady-state <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> measurements...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the groundwater resources and potentials of the Khanewal District of Pakistan, a geophysical method in combination with <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data were used. An analytical relationship between the aquifer parameters interpreted from surface geoelectrical method and <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> was established in order to estimate aquifer parameters from surface measurements where no <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> exist. For the said purpose, 48 geoelectric investigations were carried out using Schlumberger vertical electrical sounding (VES). Seven of the soundings were conducted where <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> had been carried out at borehole sites. The vertical electrical sounding stations were interpreted, and resistivities and thickness parameters were calculated. The values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity were calculated using the Dar Zarrouk parameter. Transmissivity values obtained from <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data and the VES method range between 954 – 4263 m 2 /day and 200 – 5600 m 2 /day respectively. Hydraulic conductivity values determined from <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data and geoelectrical technique range between 15. 9 – 60. 9 m/day and 29. 76 - 72. 3 m/day respectively. The low values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity indicate clay or shale while high values are due to the presence of sand or gravel. A comparison of the transmissivity values obtained from <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data and surface geoelectrical method shows a positive correlation (R 2 = 0. 90). Similarly, the regression between hydraulic conductivity determined from the <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data and the geoelectrical method is also positively correlated (R 2 = 0. 96).

30|$|Estimating {{hydraulic}} characteristics (transmissivity {{and storage}} coefficient or specific yield) of aquifer systems {{is an essential}} part of groundwater studies. The most effective, reliable and standard way of determining these characteristics is to conduct and analyze hydraulic <b>tests</b> such as <b>pumping</b> <b>test.</b> When the <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> are performed in small-diameter wells, several methods are available for analyzing the <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data (Theis 1935; Cooper and Jacob 1946; Neuman 1974; Hantush 1964) depending upon the type of aquifer. These methods are based on one of the assumptions that <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> is performed in small-diameter well for which storage can be neglected. However, the <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> in the hard-rock subsurface formations are generally conducted in large-diameter wells where the pumped water initially comes from the well storage. The contribution of storage gradually decreases with the advancement of pumping time, and water starts to move from aquifer to well. At later stages of time, almost entire pumped water is supplied from the aquifer (Rushton 2003).|$|R
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{properties of}} the aquifers located in the coastal plain sands, Lagos, Nigeria had been investigated. A review of both the theoretical and practical applications of <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> in groundwater resource evaluation for coastal plain sands aquifer was carried out. The main activities involved collation of information related to well logs, step-drawdown and constant rate <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> from existing database on borehole drilling in seven wells to an average depth of 100 m. Graphical methods based on Rorabaugh’s Hantush-Bierschenk’s analyses {{were used to determine}} the components of drawdown due to well and aquifer losses from the step-drawdown <b>pumping</b> <b>tests.</b> Conventional analytical methods based on non-equilibrium equation were used to assess the local hydraulic regime of the groundwater system using constant rate <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> data. Data from 11 controlled <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> in Shomolu area of Lagos metropolis were analyzed. The transmissivity values of the multi-layered aquifer system range between 345. 6 and 2, 332 m 2 /day while the storage coefficient values range between 2. 8 x 10 - 4 and 4. 5 x 10 - 4. Both results indicate confined aquifers of artesian conditions. The step-drawdown <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> results indicate that well losses constituted a significant component of drawdown in the pumped wells, a phenomenon due to poor well design, well development; and non-Darcian flow in the multi-layered aquifer.

Unreviewed Safety Question Determination (USQD) TF- 96 - 0018 verified that the installation of two mixer pumps into Tank 241 -AZ- 101 was within the current Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Authorization Basis. USQDs TF- 96 - 0461, TF- 96 - 0448, and TF- 96 - 0805 verified that the installation of the in-tank video camera, thermocouples, and Ultrasonic Interface Level Analyzer (URSILLA), respectively, were within the current TWRS Authorization Basis. USQD TF- 96 - 1041 verified that the checkout testing of the installed equipment was within the current TWRS Authorization Basis. Installation of the pumps and equipment has been completed. An evaluation of safety considerations associated with operation of the mixer pumps for the mixer <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> is provided in this document. This document augments the existing AWF authorization basis as defined in the Interim Safety Basis (Stahl 1997), and as such, will use the existing Interim Operational Safety Requirements (IOSRs) of Heubach 1996 to adequately control the mixer <b>pump</b> <b>test.</b> The hazard and accident analysis is limited to the scope and impact of the mixer <b>pump</b> <b>test,</b> and therefore does not address hazards already addressed by the current AWF authorization basis. This document does not evaluate removal of the mixer pumps. Safety considerations for removal of the pumps will be addressed by separate safety documentation once that portion of the mission is defined. The mixer <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> has been evaluated to cover the use of either the existing ventilation system (241 -A- 702) or the ventilation system upgrade provided by Project W- 030.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the effect of solder wettability on the thermal performance of a thermo-electric cooler (TEC) of a 980 ?nm pump laser module. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, TEC thermal performance has been evaluated using a heat <b>pump</b> <b>test.</b> The results were compared with scanning acoustic microscopy (C-SAM) results in order to have a better understanding of the thermal behaviour of the TEC. In the C-SAM experiments, images were taken at the interfaces between the housing and TEC, as well as at the interfaces between the chip-on-carrier (CoC) and TEC. Findings – The heat <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> results indicate a strong correlation with the C-SAM test results. The C-SAM observations show good solder joint at the interface between the TEC and housing in the case of the device that yielded a good heat <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> result (11. 5 °C) and poor solder joints (gross de-lamination) at the interface between the TEC and housing in the case of the device that yielded a poor heat <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> result (24. 4 °C).

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{is used in}} {{the coal}} seam gas industry to stimulate a well to improve seam-to-well flow. This study involves a <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> investigation using Modflow (ModelMuse interface) to simulate a hydraulic fracture in coal. The investigation aimed to determine how Modflow responded to the presence of a fracture. This was achieved by comparing changes in <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> drawdown in response to changes in the dimensions and hydraulic properties of the coal and fracture using the oil industry "Fracture Conductivity" formula. The flow profile of the simulation was also compared with theoretical <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> drawdown equations to determine if, within the model, the flow around the well changed from radial to linear. The investigation found that the flow profile created in Modflow was neither linear nor radial, and instead created an ellipsoidal radial flow profile. Simulations with equal Fracture Conductivity values but different fracture dimensions produced different drawdown curves. This {{may be due to the}} model using Darcy flow within the fracture, while Fracture Conductivity assumes flow between two plates, resulting in a different head gradient-discharge relationship within a fracture.
