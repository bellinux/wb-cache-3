Reactor safety studies were directed primarily toward obtaining high-temperature physical property data for use in reactor safety analyses. Spectrographic data and an oxygen-potential model were used to calculate thermodynamic properties applicable to the equations of state of uranium-plutonium dioxide and uranium dioxide. Work was continued on the compilation of standard sets of property data on reactor fuels and materials. The viscosity of molten aluminum and the thermal diffusivity of molten uranium dioxide were measured as functions of temperature. Modeling and chemical-interaction studies related to <b>post-accident</b> <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> were conducted. The efforts in sodium technology supported the LMFBR program.

Unprotected transients are generically categorized as transient overpower accidents and transient under cooling accidents. In both cases, core meltdown may occur and {{this can lead to}} a molten fuel coolant interaction (MFCI). The understanding of MFCI phenomena is essential for study of debris coolability and characteristics during <b>post-accident</b> <b>heat</b> <b>removal.</b> Sodium is used as coolant in liquid metal fast breeder reactors. Viewing inside sodium at elevated temperature is impossible because of its opaqueness. In the present study, a methodology to depict MFCI phenomena using a flat panel detector based imaging system (i. e., real time radiography) is brought out using a woods metal-water experimental facility which simulates the UO 2 -Na interaction. The developed imaging system can capture attributes of the MFCI process like jet breakup length, jet front velocity, fragmented particle size, and a profile of the debris bed using digital image processing methods like image filtering, segmentation, and edge detection.

Functioning of these valves mainly aim at emergency reactivity control, <b>post-accident</b> residue <b>heat</b> <b>removal,</b> <b>post-accident</b> radioactivity removal and containment isolation when a design basis accident occurred. In order to maintain these valves under operable conditions, an Inservice Testing Program (IST) is defined for routine testing tasks based on the ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code section XI code requirements. Risk based Inservice Testing Programs have been studied and developed extensively in the nuclear energy industry since the 1990 s. Risk Based evaluations of IST can bring positive advantages to the licensee such as identifying the vulnerability of the system, reducing unnecessary testing burden, concentrating testing resources on the critical pass oriented valves and saving plant's personnel dose exposure. This risk evaluation is incorporated with quantitative and qualitative analyses to the Motor Operated Valves under current Inservice Testing Program for PWR nuclear power plant in Taiwan. With the outcome of the risk classifications for the safety related MOVs through numerical or deterministic analyses, a risk based testing frequency relief is suggested to demonstrate the benefits received from the risk based Inservice Testing Program.

Next, we examined the <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> ability of various cryogen delivery devices using a skin phantom and an inverse heat conduction algorithm.

Lastly, a comparative study of the droplet characteristics used to increase <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> was performed on in vivo human skin to verify results from previous studies. Results demonstrated that <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> is limited in skin by its low thermal diffusivity and <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> by evaporative cooling was negligible on skin using CSC. Next, it was determined that different cryogen delivery devices remove various amounts of heat from the skin phantom. The cause of the differing rates of <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> was determined to be by three main factors: the initial temperature differential between the impinging droplets and substrate, velocity of the droplets, and droplet diameter. The Weber number, which is proportional to the velocity 2 ·diameter, showed a correlation to <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> in the skin phantom. Using an equal temperature differential, it was confirmed that an increased Weber number provided greater epidermal protection in ex vivo human skin in response to laser irradiation. Lastly, an in vivo study of human skin also demonstrated that an increased Weber number spray was better able to reduce nonspecific thermal damage, especially with darker skin types, in response to 595 nm pulsed laser irradiation. Gross purpura after irradiation was correlated to vascular damage histologically and to apoptosis, giving the clinician a visual indication of the vascular damage occurring.

By referring to the CGCC method, several envelopes are illustrated at draw trays including the top pumparound draw, diesel draw, intermediate pumparound draw and gas oil draw, the energy and material balances are then calculated. Assuming practical near-minimum thermodynamic condition (PNMTC), the minimum liquid reflux flow is zero in the envelope for pumparound trays without product draw and the minimum liquid reflux flow is defined by Houghland diagram for pumparound trays with product draw. The PNMTC-CGCC is constructed by calculating the enthalpy-flow deficit to quantitatively define the <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> constraints in each envelope.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} requirements for Gen. IV Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is passive safety. Currently all the gas cooled version of VHTR designs use Reactor Vessel Auxiliary Cooling System (RVACS) for passive decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal.</b> The decay <b>heat</b> first is transferred to the core barrel by conduction and radiation, and then to the reactor vessel by thermal radiation and convection; finally the decay heat is transferred to natural circulated air or water systems. RVACS can be characterized as a surface based decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> system. The RVACS is especially suitable for smaller power reactors since small systems have relatively larger surface area to volume ratio. However, RVACS limits the maximum achievable power level for modular VHTRs due to the mismatch between the reactor power (proportional to volume) and decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability (proportional to surface area). When the relative decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability decreases, the peak fuel temperature increases, even close to the design limit. Annular core designs with inner graphite reflector can mitigate this effect; therefore can further increase the reactor power. Another way to increase the reactor power is to increase power density. However, the reactor power is also limited by the decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability. Besides the safety considerations, VHTRs also need to be economical in order to compete with other reactor concepts and other types of energy sources. The limit of decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability set by using RVACS has affected the economy of VHTRs. A potential alternative solution is to use a volume-based passive decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> system, called Direct Reactor Auxiliary Cooling Systems (DRACS), to remove or mitigate the limitation on decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability. DRACS composes of natural circulation loops with two sets of heat exchangers, one on the reactor side and another on the environment side. For the reactor side, cooling pipes will be inserted into holes made in the outer or inner graphite reflector blocks. There will be gaps between these cooling pipes and their corresponding surrounding graphite surfaces. Graphite has an excellent heat conduction property. By taking advantage of this feature, we can have a volume-based method to remove decay heat. The scalability can be achieved, if needed, by employing more rows of cooling pipes to accommodate higher decay heat rates. Since heat can easily conduct through the graphite regions between the holes made for the cooling pipes, those cooling pipes located further away from the active core region can still be very effective in removing decay heat. By removing the limit on the decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability due to the limited available surface area as in a RVACS, the reactor power and power density can be significantly increased, without losing the passive <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> feature. This paper will introduce the concept of using DRACS to enhance VHTR passive safety and economics. Three design options will be discussed, depending on the cooling pipe locations.

Similar concepts have been widely used in sodium cooled fast reactor (SFR) designs, advanced light water reactors like AP 1000. The RVACS is especially suitable for smaller power reactors since small systems have relatively larger surface area. RVACS tends to be less expensive. However, it limits the largest achievable power level for modular HTGRs due to the mismatch between the reactor power (proportional to volume) and decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability (proportional to surface). When the relative decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability is reduced, the peak fuel temperature increases, even close to the design limit. Annual designs with internal reflector can mitigate this effect therefore further increase the power. Another way to increase power is to increase power density. However, it is also limited by the decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability. Besides safety, HTGRs also need to be economical in order to compete with other reactor designs. The limit of decay <b>heat</b> <b>removal</b> capability set by using RVACS has affected the economy of HTGRs.
