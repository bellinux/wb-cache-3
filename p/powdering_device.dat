40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to mechanize the date palm pollination given its importance. Indeed, this work contributes to the enrichment of this topic by providing a new pollination device to date palm growers. This pollinator consists of a <b>powdering</b> <b>device</b> mounted on a telescopic pole. Field tests of this pollinator were conducted in Touggourt and Biskra (Algeria). The date yield obtained with this pollinator {{was the same as}} that of the traditional pollination method. The cost of the device was less than the cost of pollinating about 25 palm trees by the traditional method. Moreover, pollination by this device required half the time which was necessary by the traditional method of pollination. With this device, the safety of the farmer is assured since he doesn’t have to climb the palm tree anymore which is also very important. The promising research results obtained testing the developed pollination device makes this pollinator an alternative option for farmers in economic, security and time savings terms. And when the function of this pollinator is based on the dispersion of pollen, we determined that the best percentage pollen / wheat flour was 20...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of the dry powder inhalation (DPI) of ipratropium bromide (ipratropium) on the airways of health horses and the dose-response curve in horses suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by means of pulmonary function tests, five healthy horses were first studied. Ipratropium (2400 micrograms ipratropium horse- 1) was contained in gelatine capsules and administered using a dry <b>powder</b> <b>device</b> connected to an adapted face mask. Pulmonary function tests were recorded before inhalation and 15 and 60 min after inhalation. No modification of pulmonary function was observed. The airway response to ipratropium DPI was then determined in six horses suffering from COPD. To induce airway obstruction, the horses were bedded on straw and fed hay. When the maximal change in pleural pressure during tidal breathing exceeded 1. 96 kPa, pulmonary function tests were recorded before DPI, and 15 and 60 min post-inhalation. Placebo (six capsules horse- 1) or ipratropium (600, 1200 and 2400 micrograms horse- 1) was administered in a randomized order to each horse using the dry <b>powder</b> <b>device</b> and the adapted face mask. Neither ipratropium nor placebo DPI affected respiratory frequency (f) or tidal volume (VT). Inhalation of 600 micrograms ipratropium horse- 1 resulted in a delayed decrease of total pulmonary resistance (RL) whereas dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was improved (although not significantly) at both times of measurement when compared with values following placebo inhalation. Simultaneous decreased RL and increased Cdyn, was observed within 15 min after DPI of 1200 micrograms ipratropium horse- 1 and persisted for the 1 h duration of the experiment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{assess the}} {{cleaning}} potential of commonly used implant debridement methods, simulating non-surgical peri-implantitis therapy in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS One-hundred-and-eighty dental implants were ink-stained and mounted in combined soft and hard tissue models, representing peri-implantitis defects with angulations of 30, 60, and 90 ° {{covered by a}} custom-made artificial mucosa. Implants were treated by a dental school graduate and a board-certified periodontist for 120 s with following instruments: Gracey curette, ultrasonic scaler, and an air <b>powder</b> abrasive <b>device</b> with a nozzle for sub-mucosal use utilizing glycine powder. All procedures were repeated 10 times for each instrumentation and defect morphology respectively. Images of the implant surface were taken. Areas with color remnants were planimetrically determined and their cumulative surface area was calculated. Results were tested for statistical differences using two-way anova and Bonferroni correction. Micro-morphologic surface changes were analyzed on scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. RESULTS The areas of uncleaned surfaces (%, mean ± standard deviations) for curettes, ultrasonic tips, and air abrasion accounted for 74. 70 ± 4. 89 %, 66. 95 ± 8. 69 % and 33. 87 ± 12. 59 % respectively. The air <b>powder</b> abrasive <b>device</b> showed significantly better results for all defect angulations (P < 0. 0001).

50|$|Flash powders {{even within}} {{intended}} usages often release explosive force of deadly capacity. Nearly all widely used flash powder mixtures {{are sensitive to}} shock, friction and electrostatic discharge. In certain mixtures, {{it is not uncommon}} for this sensitivity to spontaneously change over time, or due to change in the environment, or to other unknowable factors in either the original manufacturing or in real-world storage. Additionally, accidental contaminants such as strong acids or sulphur compounds can sensitise them even more. Because flash powder mixtures are so easy to initiate, there is potentially a high risk of accidental explosions which can inflict severe blast/fragmentation injuries, e.g. blindness, explosive amputation, permanent maiming, or disfigurement. Fatalities have occurred. The various flash powder compositions should therefore not be handled by anyone who is unfamiliar with their properties, or the handling techniques required to maintain safety. Flash powder and flash <b>powder</b> <b>devices</b> pose exceptionally high risks to children, who typically cannot understand the danger and may be less adept with safe handling techniques. As a result, children tend to suffer more severe injuries than adults.|$|R

The second one assessed practical knowledge on inhalation technique for different devices, following Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thorax surgery recommendations. Technique was considered as incorrect if patient failed in any step. Results: 65 patients with COPD were recruited. On practical test, just 5 patients (7. 7 %) followed properly the inhalation technique. Errors, in order of frequency, were: not holding air after inhaling (apnoea), not move the device for a second inhalation (in pressurized devices), not exhaling air before inhalation, not moving the device for the first inhalation (in pressurized devices), not synchronizing device activation with air entrance, not energy inhaling air in <b>powder</b> <b>devices.</b> Conclusions: Most of the patients produced some error in the use of inhalator devices.

The very limited transmucosal transport measured in vitro suggests a low likelihood of significant systemic absorption. The topical action on bleeding could benefit from the poor absorption and from the fact that about 2 – 3 % of the thalidomide applied on the nasal mucosa was accumulated within the tissue, particularly with the β-CD nasal powder...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{management}} of asthmatic patients depends on achieving adequate delivery of inhaled drugs to the lung. This assumes particular importance for inhaled corticosteroids where the therapeutic {{goal should be}} to achieve a high ratio of airway anti-inflammatory efficacy to local and systemic side effects. The availability of user-friendly inhaler devices requires a critical appraisal of their effectiveness and an evaluation of whether improved lung deposition of anti-asthma drugs translates into improved clinical efficacy. There is evidence to suggest that the routine use of large-volume spacers for inhaled corticosteroids {{may not be the best}} first-line option, in that reduced drug delivery is associated with multiple actuations, inhalation delay and the presence of static electricity. Breath-actuated pressurized aerosol <b>devices</b> or dry <b>powder</b> inhaler <b>devices</b> may be a better option for many asthmatic patients, although the efficiency of drug delivery varies considerably between these devices. There is good evidence with a reservoir dry <b>powder</b> inhaler <b>device</b> to show that improved lung deposition translates into better therapeutic response, both in terms of beta 2 -agonist and corticosteroid delivery. For inhaled corticosteroids, such as fluticasone propionate and budesonide, there is evidence to show that systemic bioactivity is mainly determined by lung bioavailability rather than gastrointestinal bioavailability, because of the absence of first-pass metabolism of these drugs in the lung. There is also evidence to show that the greater glucocorticoid potency of fluticasone propionate translates directly into greater systemic bioactivity, but not into enhanced efficacy, at doses above 1 mg daily. The use of efficient delivery systems, such as the reservoir dry <b>powder</b> inhaler <b>device,</b> may not only improve control of asthma and compliance with therapy, but may also allow dose reduction ('step-down' therapy) and hence may possibly reduce overall prescribing costs in the long term...|$|R

40|$|A {{randomised}} double blind, two period {{cross over}} {{study was designed}} to compare the ability of 51 hospitalised asthmatics with acute exacerbations to use each of two inhalers. The inhalers compared were a new breath actuated metered dose inhaler, the Autohaler inhalation device, and a dry <b>powder</b> <b>device,</b> the Rotahaler. Preassessment data included the measurement of peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), pulse rate, and oxygen saturation.

No significant difference was found between the two inhalers as assessed by PEFR. However the Autohaler inhalation device could be actuated 99 / 100 times successfully compared with 74 for the Rotahaler. There was a consistent, but clinically insignificant, increase in pulse rate after use of the Rotahaler compared with the Autohaler. All 11 patients under 6 years of age failed to empty the Rotahaler but five of these patients received a significant benefit from using the Autohaler compared with after the Rotahaler.

Height, weight, skin-fold thickness, and lung function were measured every 3 months and bone age at entry to and exit from the study. A 24 -hour serum growth hormone concentration profile and fasting insulin-like growth factor I levels were measured halfway through the year. Seventy-four percent of boys and 62 % of girls had heights below the 50 th percentile. Growth velocity in the nonsteroid-treated control group (n = 13) was normal; 10 of 20 children taking beclomethasone grew slowly (14 / 20 used a dry <b>powder</b> <b>device),</b> and 4 of 19 children taking budesonide grew slowly (15 / 19 used a spacer).

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{in vitro}} and in vivo studies have {{emphasized}} the importance of generating a high inspiratory flow when using a dry powder inhaler. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the influence of the inspiratory flow profile on the particle size distribution contained in aerosols generated by these devices. The internal volume of a device such as the Turbuhaler is small compared with a vital capacity breath and it is possible that all the powder has been drawn from the device before peak inspiratory flow has been achieved, particularly if the time to peak inspiratory flow is prolonged. A series of experiments were performed to assess the effect of different flow profiles through the Turbuhaler, each with a peak flow of 60 1 min− 1. A 400 μg budesonide Turbuhaler was enclosed in a chamber allowing air to pass unimpeded through the dosing channels and entrainment ports. A large three-way tap was used to blow <b>powder</b> from the <b>device</b> across a Malvern Mastersizer laser particle sizer which produced a profile of the particle size distribution within the aerosol. The rate of increase in flow through the Turbuhaler was determined by the rate at which the three-way tap was turned, and recorded by means of a pneumotachograph. The rate of increase in flow was found to significantly affect the particle size distribution within the aerosol. Failure to attain a flow of 30 1 min− 1 before 150 ml of air had passed through the device resulted in the aerosol volume median diameter increasing from less than 6 · 6 μm to greater than 45 · 3 μm. These results indicate that flow during the initial part of the inspiratory effort may be important in determining the characteristics of the aerosol generated by a dry powder inhaler. With more sophisticated equipment, it might be possible to explore the relationship between flow profile and particle size distribution generated by dry <b>powder</b> <b>devices</b> in more detail...|$|R

This study investigated the effects of two inhalers with formoterol in patients visiting the ER Department for acute and severe dyspnoea, mainly exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Two doses of 12 μg formoterol were given at enrolment, either via Turbuhaler or via pressurised metered dose inhaler, connected to a spacer device (pMDI+S) in a double-blind way and parallel design. Another two doses of 12 μg formoterol were given after 30 min. Forced expiratory volume in the 1 s (FEV 1) and Borg dyspnoea score were assessed until 60 min. The study was designed to test non-inferiority in effects on FEV 1. Seventy-seven patients were enrolled {{with a mean age of}} 66 years and a FEV 1 of 1. 03 L (39 % of predicted). The effects of the two treatments were almost identical. The mean improvement in FEV 1 at 60 min after formoterol Turbuhaler was 94 % of the improvement after formoterol pMDI+S. A statistically significant non-inferiority was shown (p= 0. 037) at 60 min (primary endpoint) as well as at 5 and 30 min (secondary endpoints, p= 0. 0043 and 0. 013, respectively). Improvements in the Borg dyspnoea score and other lung-function parameters did not differ significantly between the two devices. In conclusion, formoterol Turbuhaler was equally effective as formoterol pMDI+S in the treatment of acute bronchoconstriction within the ER...|$|R
40|$|The time {{defined and}} {{continuous}} powder supply {{is one of}} the main preconditions of laser cladding, alloying and particle injection. Powder feeders available from thermal spraying technique fulfill the laser typical requirements only incomplete. Therefore the development of a new <b>powder</b> feeding <b>device</b> was necessary. The presented disc feeder system with integrated measurement and control of the powder mass flow permits the dosage of metallic, carbidic and ceramic powders bigger than 20 mym with feeding rates of 1 to 150 g/min and tolerances of less than 5 percent. The powder mass flow measurement system makes a fast and precise setting, long time constancy as well as a variable control of the feeding rate during the whole treating process possible...|$|R
40|$|Background: Inadequate {{technique}} {{reduces the}} effects of inhalation medication. Errors in inhalation technique {{have been reported to}} range up to 85 %. Not only various patients' characteristics but also the device has an effect on correct inhalation technique. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of patients' characteristics and type of inhaler device on inhalation technique in patient with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A validated scoring method was used that consisted of triple viewing of video-recorded inhalations, using device-specific checklists. The following patient characteristics were investigated: gender, age, education level, diagnosis, treatment by a pulmonary physician, previously received inhalation instruction, exacerbation frequency, knowledge, self-management competence, pulmonary function, and use of multiple inhaler devices. Chi-square statistics were used for univariate associations between potential determinants and correctness of inhalation technique. Relevant determinants were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Moreover, inhalation technique errors were examined for six inhaler devices: three prefilled dry powder inhalers, one single-dose dry powder inhaler, a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) and a pMDI with a spacer. Results: Overall, 40 % of the patients made at least one essential mistake in their inhalation technique. Patients who never received inhalation instruction and patients who used more than one inhaler device made significantly more errors (odds ratio both 2. 2). Comparison between devices showed that a correct inhalation technique most likely occurred with the use of prefilled dry <b>powder</b> <b>devices.</b> Conclusion: Incorrect inhalation technique is common among asthma and COPD patients in a pulmonary outpatient clinic. Our study suggests that the use of prefilled dry powder inhalers as well as inhalation instruction increases correct inhalation technique. Simultaneous use of different types of inhalation devices has to be discourage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAerosol {{vaccination}} via the mucosa targets an epithelium {{critical to}} host defence against inhaled pathogens, potentially avoids needle injection, and provides an exciting {{opportunity in the}} development of stable dry powder vaccine formulations. Specialised cells in the mucosa are able to take up and guide antigens directly to immune cells. In contrast to soluble antigen formulations, particles with antigen also provoke a local sIgA mediated immune response before being presented to the systemic immune system. In this study, particles containing the model antigen BSA and chitosan as stabiliser with adjuvant activity are produced by spray drying. The compatibility and uptake of these particles via the respiratory epithelium is determined in vitro on Calu- 3 cells. The in vitro deposition studies are performed in a nasal cast made from CT scan data using a novel nasal dry <b>powder</b> <b>device.</b> The deposition profile is optimised by the use of interactive mixtures with a low separation capacity. The spray drying process results in spherical particles with a size in the low micrometer range (x 50 3 μm), which are well tolerated when administered to the cells and which are readily taken up. As the particles have to be big enough to be retained in the appropriate place in the respiratory tract (e. g. the nasal cavity) to be taken up efficiently, the primary particles are too small. Deposition studies show a high fraction of almost 56 % transiting the nose and being capable of inhalation. This fraction can be reduced by utilising an interactive mixture with a carrier, where only 5 % of the antigen carrying particles leave the nasal cavity. Particulate vaccine formulations are a promising formulation approach for mucosal vaccination targeting the nasal mucosa. With small antigen carrying particles immobilised on carrier particles, the antigen is delivered exclusively to the nose...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn powder-based rapid {{prototyping}} techniques, powder compaction {{is used to}} create thin layers of fine powder that are locally bonded. By stacking these layers of locally bonded material, an object is made. The compaction of thin layers of powder mater ials is of interest {{for a wide range}} of applications, but this study solely focuses on the application for powder -based three-dimensional printing (e. g. SLS, 3 DP). This research is primarily interested in powder compaction for creating membranes with specific properties. In this paper, methods of powder deposition are discussed and experiments carried out using a specimen powder bed apparatus and a custom <b>powder</b> compaction <b>device,</b> using these methods (doctor blade, forward and backward rotating roller, double action roller) with various parameters. The model of powder compaction is verified in experiments. Insight is gathered to gain a better prediction of powder compaction...|$|R
50|$|Most DPIs rely on {{the force}} of patient {{inhalation}} to entrain <b>powder</b> from the <b>device</b> and subsequently break-up the powder into particles that are small enough to reach the lungs. For this reason, insufficient patient inhalation flow rates may lead to reduced dose delivery and incomplete deaggregation of the powder, leading to unsatisfactory device performance. Thus, most DPIs have a minimum inspiratory effort that is needed for proper use and {{it is for this}} reason that such DPIs are normally used only in older children and adults.|$|R
