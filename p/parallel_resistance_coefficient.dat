The <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> {{through which}} gas flow {{permeable}} refractory are important properties and have great {{effect on the}} gas blowing parameters and gas-liquid two phase flowing characteristics in the metallurgy furnace such as ladles, tundish.

A new method of obtaining flow <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> for perforated plates in low Reynolds number flows, such as natural air convection, was proposed. And some experimental values are obtained {{from the viewpoint of}} thermal design of electronic equipment casings where some perforations often used in the outlet and inlet vent to prevent dust from entering the casing. The proposed method is based on the two expressions written for the enthalpy balance and for the balance between aerodynamic resistance and buoyancy force in a ventilation model. By these two expressions, flow <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> values can be evaluated even when only dissipated power and temperature rise is known. As a result, the relationship of the flow <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> values for perforated plates, Reynolds number and porosity coefficient is presented in a form fitting for practical engineering use. 18 kinds of perforated plates have been used in this study and the range of Reynolds number defined by the hole diameter and the air velocity in the ventilation duct was from 0. 4 to 95.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a method to {{estimate}} the current rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of a four-wheeled electric bicycle. We derived linear regression models between the velocity of the bicycle and the vibrations at the handlebars {{to be able to}} classify the current road surface and consequently the rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient.</b> To derive the models, we performed experiments on three different surfaces typical for cycling - asphalt, fine gravel and coarse gravel. A cyclist performed five test rides on each surface on different days at varying velocities. During the experiments power output at the pedals and velocity were measured. Additionally, vibrations at the handlebars were measured using a smartphone. Then, a curve consisting of the mathematical representation of rolling and air resistance was fitted to the experimental data and the rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the surfaces and the effective frontal area of bicycle and cyclist were estimated. The magnitude of the vibrations at the handlebars was calculated for each test ride and each surface. From this data the linear regression models for each surface were derived using velocity as the predictor. Analyzing the data yielded rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 0. 01221, 0. 01468 and 0. 01832 for asphalt, fine gravel and coarse gravel, respectively, and showed significant difference. The magnitude of vibrations increases significantly with velocity and is higher for surfaces with higher rolling resistance. To validate the model the outdoor experiments were repeated with a similar prototype of a four-wheeled electric bicycle. The results can be used to classify the current surface and therefore estimate the rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient.</b> We believe that this system can help improve the estimation of the residual range of electric bicycles by providing more detailed information about the environment and consequently enhance their operating distance and the usage of the bicycle...|$|R

The few that are available are for fully opened valves based on the tacit assumption that different sized diaphragm valves are geometrically similar. In this study, the pressure drops across five straight-through diaphragm valves were measured in four aperture positions. <b>Resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> were determined by experimentally establishing pressure gradients upstream and downstream of the valves. The experiments were carried out using Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids over a wide range of Reynolds numbers with the emphasis on obtaining laminar flow data. The Hooper 2 -k correlation was corroborated and found to be valid at Reynolds numbers < 10 for straight-through diaphragm valves. At higher Reynolds numbers the <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> is shown to be dependent on the size and the opening of the valve. Three different approaches (domain separation, simple summation, and selective combination) using a two-constant model to predict the experimental <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> were explored.
