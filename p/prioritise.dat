Eliciting and Specifying correct requirements, that meet the customer’s needs contributes to the project’s Quality and Success. However, determining the “Candidate Requirements” is challenging {{for a number of}} reasons. Requirement Prioritisation helps to cope with this problem. A number of Requirement Prioritisation methods exist. This dissertation aims to investigate a better prioritisation technique by subjectively assessing the “effort” between <b>prioritising</b> requirements with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and <b>prioritising</b> “Satisfaction Arguments” (SA) with AHP and subjectively assessing the “effort” again. The results of the experiment show a similar set of priorities produced by both attempts, however, the perceived effort of <b>prioritising</b> SAs is less compared with <b>prioritising</b> requirements with AHP due to “Propagation of Priorities”. The results of the experiment show that “Propagation of Priorities” is possible with both the approaches, however “Propagation of Priorities” was found to be bidirectional when <b>prioritising</b> SA with AHP and unidirectional when <b>prioritising</b> requirements with AHP...|$|R

Moreover, a number of numerical examples and real examples are used to validate our system, and thus we further obtain some insights into our system. In addition, we explore the relationship between weight schemes and <b>prioritised</b> FCSP schemes, and reveal that the weighted FCSP schemes are the dual of <b>prioritised</b> FCSP schemes, which can, correspondingly, be called posterioritised FCSP schemes...|$|R

The London club won back-to-back league titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06 under José Mourinho, at a time when Arsenal and United underwent a period of transition. Vieira and Keane had left their respective clubs by the end of 2005, while Ferguson came under intense scrutiny over his management. Nevertheless, he guided his team to Premier League success in 2006–07, and won a further four league titles. At Arsenal, Wenger oversaw the club's relocation to the Emirates Stadium and made the decision to <b>prioritise</b> it over strengthening the squad.

After the Government refused to <b>prioritise</b> the project in the 1950s, it was self-financed by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. Construction was undertaken by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company and began in 1959. It was unofficially opened in October 1961, with a formal presentation by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in April 1962. A reconstruction of the bridge began in 1999 after it {{was found to be}} unable to support a European Union requirement for goods vehicle weights. The work involved building two new parallel decks while the original construction was completely rebuilt. The project was completed in late 2001 and formally opened by Princess Anne in April 2002.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the association between <b>prioritising</b> popularity and how important children deemed popularity generally, and actual social status. It was expected that popularity and likeability would both be associated in their own specific ways with either <b>prioritising</b> popularity or finding popularity generally important. Participants were eight to thirteen year old primary school children. 452 children (50 % girls) from eight primary schools in the Netherlands filled in several questionnaires on peer relations and <b>prioritising</b> popularity. Correlational tests and multiple regression analyses were conducted. Results indicated that both <b>prioritising</b> popularity and the general importance of popularity were positively associated with popular status, whereas likeability was only associated with <b>prioritising</b> popularity. Furthermore, the general importance of popularity was less related to popularity for well-liked children than for less- liked children. Implications of the results and suggestions for further research are discussed. The results contribute to knowledge on status motivations, and can contribute to improving simulations of human social intelligence to create interactive trainings, serious games, or intelligent agents that can obtain a high social status in a human-like fashion...|$|R

5|$|An {{extension}} to Camberwell from Elephant & Castle was planned and approved in 1931. Elephant & Castle was {{also to be}} reconstructed with a third platform to provide the additional reversing capacity, along with a new ticket hall and escalators. Due {{to the need to}} <b>prioritise</b> the extension from Baker Street to Finchley Road, to relieve congestion on the Metropolitan line, as well as financial constraints and the outbreak of the Second World War, no work was carried out on the extension. In the 1950s there was a brief revival of the plan, in which it was proposed that Elephant & Castle would not be altered and the additional turn-round capacity would be provided by making Camberwell a three-platform terminus. The project was ultimately unaffordable owing to post-war austerity, reduced demand, and the disproportionately high cost of the project with a three-platform deep-level terminus and the requirement for new trains and a depot.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and <b>prioritise</b> public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Lumpur {{had seen}} a number of civil {{disturbances}} over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair {{that began with the}} confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and <b>prioritise</b> Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s, in bottled form, Worthington {{was one of}} {{only three}} nationally {{distributed}} beer brands, alongside Bass and Guinness. Product rationalisation began after the Second World War and although Worthington occasionally overtook Bass in sales, the decision was taken to <b>prioritise</b> Bass products. Arthur Manners took the chairmanship of Bass in 1947, and was instrumental in driving the company forward. Brewing industry mergers from the late 1950s onwards damaged Worthington sales, as tied house ownership became increasingly concentrated with brewers intent on promoting their own products. At the same time, bottled beer sales suffered as drinkers in search of consistency opted for the new keg beers instead. In 1965, the original Worthington brewery was closed, although production of the Worthington beers continued, consisting of White Shield, Green Shield (a filtered version of White Shield) and the draught product, E. Worthington E became the main keg bitter offered by Bass from 1967, and it had become a leading bitter brand by the 1970s, boosted by the company's network of 11,000 public houses. Worthington E was replaced as Bass' leading keg bitter by Worthington Best Bitter in the 1980s, and by Worthington Smoothflow from the mid-1990s. In 2000, Bass was bought by the Belgian brewer Interbrew. The Competition Commission ordered Interbrew to divest itself of a number of its recently acquired brands, and Worthington was bought by the American brewer Coors, who later became Molson Coors in 2005. In 2004 Coors announced that they would no longer advertise Worthington on a large scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} freedom {{which the}} Republic of Venice afforded him, {{compared to the}} problems of court politics in Mantua, are reflected in Monteverdi's letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13 March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which Mantua still owes him. Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state. These included the balli Tirsi e Clori (1616) and Apollo (1620), an opera Andromeda (1620) and an intermedio, Le nozze di Tetide, for the marriage of Ferdinando with Caterina de' Medici (1617). Most of these compositions were extensively delayed in creation – partly, as shown by surviving correspondence, through the composer's unwillingness to <b>prioritise</b> them, and partly because of constant changes in the court's requirements. They are now lost, apart from Tirsi e Clori, which was included in the seventh book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina, for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the Duchess. A subsequent major commission, the opera La finta pazza Licori, to a libretto by Giulio Strozzi, was completed for Fernando's successor Vincenzo II, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the latter's illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now also lost.|$|E

40|$|Randomised {{algorithms}} are {{an effective}} method of attacking computationally intractable problems. A simple and fast randomised algorithm may produce results to an accuracy sufficient for many purposes, {{especially in the}} average case. In this thesis we consider average case analyses of heuristics for certain NP-hard graph optimisation problems. In particular, we consider algorithms that find dominating sets of random regular directed graphs. As well as providing an average case analysis, our results also determine new upper bounds on domination numbers of random regular directed graphs. The algorithms for random regular directed graphs considered in this thesis are known as <b>prioritised</b> algorithms. Each <b>prioritised</b> algorithm determines a discrete random process. This discrete process may be continuously approximated using differential equations. Under certain conditions, the solutions to these differential equations describe the behaviour of the <b>prioritised</b> algorithm. Applying such an analysis to <b>prioritised</b> algorithms directly is difficult. However, {{we are able to}} use <b>prioritised</b> algorithms to define new algorithms, called deprioritised algorithms, that can be analysed in this fashion. Defining a deprioritised algorithm based on a given <b>prioritised</b> algorithm, and then analysing the deprioritised algorithm, is called the deprioritised approach. The initial theory describing the deprioritised approach was developed by Wormald and has been successfully applied in many cases. However not all algorithms are covered by Wormalds theory: for example, algorithms for random regular directed graphs. The main contribution of this thesis is the extension of the deprioritised approach to a larger class of <b>prioritised</b> algorithms. We demonstrate the new theory by applying it to two algorithms which find dominating sets of random regular directed graphs...|$|R
