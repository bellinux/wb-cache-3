40|$|International audienceVector-borne {{diseases}} pose {{a special}} challenge to veterinary authorities due to complex and time-consuming surveillance programs {{taking into account}} vector habitat. Using stochastic scenario tree modelling, each possible surveillance activity of a future surveillance system can be evaluated with regard to its sensitivity and the expected cost. The overall sensitivity of various potential surveillance systems, composed of different combinations of surveillance activities, is calculated and the proposed surveillance system is optimized {{with respect to the}} considered surveillance activities, the sensitivity and the cost. The objective of this project was to use stochastic scenario tree modelling in combination with a simple cost analysis in order to develop the national surveillance system for Bluetongue in Switzerland. This surveillance system was established due to the emerging outbreak of Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV- 8) in Northern Europe in 2006. Based on the modelling results, it was decided to implement an improved <b>passive</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance</b> in cattle and sheep through campaigns in order to increase disease awareness alongside a targeted bulk milk testing strategy in 200 dairy cattle herds located in high-risk areas. The estimated median probability of detection of cases (i. e. sensitivity) of the surveillance system in this combined approach was 96. 4 %. The evaluation of the prospective national surveillance system predicted that <b>passive</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance</b> in cattle would provide the highest probability to detect BTV- 8 infected animals, followed by <b>passive</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance</b> in sheep and bulk milk testing of 200 dairy cattle farms in high-risk areas.

40|$|International audienceSurveillance {{for rare}} and {{emerging}} infectious diseases poses a special challenge to veterinary services. Most emerging infectious diseases like bovine tuberculosis (bTB) are zoonoses, affecting {{both human and}} animal populations. Despite the low prevalence of such an emerging infectious disease at time of incursion, the surveillance system {{should be able to}} detect the presence of the disease as early as possible. Because passive surveillance is a relatively cost-effective and therefore commonly used process, it is the basic tool for infectious disease surveillance. Because of under-reporting in passive surveillance, cost-intensive active surveillance is often required to increase the sensitivity of the surveillance system. Using scenario tree modelling, the sensitivity of passive and active surveillance system components (SSC) can be quantified and an optimal, cost-effective surveillance system developed considering the contributions of each SSC. We illustrate this approach with the example of bTB surveillance in Switzerland where the surveillance system for bTB consists of meat inspection at the slaughterhouse (SLI), <b>passive</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance</b> on farm (CLIN) and human surveillance (HS). While the sensitivities for CLIN and HS were both negligible ($<$ 1 %), SLI was assessed to be 55. 6 %. The scenario tree model showed that SLI is increasable up to 80. 4 % when the disease awareness of meat inspectors in Switzerland is enhanced. A hypothetical random survey (RS) was also compared with a targeted survey (TS) in high-risk strata of the cattle population, and the sensitivity of TS was 1. 17 -fold better than in RS but with 50 % of the sample size...|$|E

Since 2000, the implementation of active surveillance programmes using rapid tests, as a complementary tool targeted at dead and slaughtered cattle has shown {{that part of the}} BSE cases were not detected with the <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance.</b> In order to obtain a better knowledge of the strength of the <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance,</b> we analysed a vigilance index defined as the ratio of negative clinical suspicions to the cattle population in the region and period of interest. The temporal analysis of the vigilance index showed that it did not vary much between 1991 and 1999, increased sharply since 2000, and then decreased partly in 2001. The geographical analysis of the variations of the vigilance index was performed at the department level by comparing the observed number of negative clinical suspicions per department to the expected number, computed {{on the basis of the}} national average index and standardised on the production type of the cattle - dairy versus beef suckling cattle.

The objectives were {{to study the}} value of a syndromic surveillance system set up within the armed forces, compared to the traditional <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance</b> system during this outbreak, to highlight issues involved in comparing military and civilian surveillance systems and to discuss the interest of syndromic surveillance for public health response. Methods Military syndromic surveillance allows the surveillance of suspected dengue fever cases among the 3, 000 armed forces personnel. Within the same population, <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance</b> uses several definition criteria for dengue fever cases, depending on the epidemiological situation. Civilian laboratory surveillance allows the surveillance of biologically confirmed cases, within the 200, 000 inhabitants. Results It was shown that syndromic surveillance detected the dengue fever outbreak several weeks before <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance,</b> allowing quick and effective enhancement of vector control within the armed forces. Syndromic surveillance was also found to have detected the outbreak before civilian laboratory surveillance. Conclusion Military syndromic surveillance allowed an early warning for this outbreak to be issued, enabling a quicker public health response by the armed forces. Civilian surveillance system has since introduced syndromic surveillance as part of its surveillance strategy. This should enable quicker public health responses in the future. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} 2 {{different methods}} of surveillance and {{to estimate the}} incidence of norovirus (NoV) outbreaks in hospitals. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING All 194 hospital wards in southern Sweden during 2 winter seasons (2010 - 2012). METHODS <b>Clinical</b> <b>surveillance</b> based on outbreak reports of 2 or more clinical cases, with symptom onset within 5 days, was compared with laboratory surveillance based on positive NoV results among inpatients. At least 2 NoV positive patients sampled within 5 days at a ward defined a cluster. Outbreak reports including at least 1 NoV positive case and clusters including at least 1 NoV positive patient with 5 or more days from ward admission to sampling were defined as NoV outbreaks. RESULTS During the study periods 135 NoV outbreaks were identified; 74 were identified by both <b>clinical</b> and laboratory <b>surveillance,</b> 18 were identified only by outbreak reports, and 43 were identified only by laboratory surveillance. The outbreak incidence was 1. 0 (95 % CI, 0. 8 - 1. 2) and 0. 5 (95 % CI, 0. 3 - 0. 6) per 1, 000 admissions for the 2 different seasons, respectively. To correctly identify NoV outbreaks, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the <b>clinical</b> <b>surveillance</b> were 68 % and 88 % and of the laboratory surveillance were 86 % and 81 %, respectively.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Invasive infections {{caused by}} Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi A are {{estimated}} to account for 12 - 27 [*]million febrile illness episodes worldwide annually. Determining the true burden of typhoidal Salmonellae infections is hindered by lack of population-based studies and adequate laboratory diagnostics. The Strategic Typhoid alliance across Africa and Asia study takes a systematic approach to measuring the age-stratified burden of clinical and subclinical disease caused by typhoidal Salmonellae infections at three high-incidence urban sites in Africa and Asia. We aim to explore {{the natural history of}} Salmonella transmission in endemic settings, addressing key uncertainties relating to the epidemiology of enteric fever identified through mathematical models, and enabling optimisation of vaccine strategies. METHODS/DESIGN: Using census-defined denominator populations of ≥ 100 [*] 000 individuals at sites in Malawi, Bangladesh and Nepal, the primary outcome is to characterise the burden of enteric fever in these populations over a 24 -month period. During <b>passive</b> <b>surveillance,</b> <b>clinical</b> and household data, and laboratory samples will be collected from febrile individuals. In parallel, healthcare utilisation and water, sanitation and hygiene surveys will be performed to characterise healthcare-seeking behaviour and assess potential routes of transmission. The rates of both undiagnosed and subclinical exposure to typhoidal Salmonellae (seroincidence), identification of chronic carriage and population seroprevalence of typhoid infection will be assessed through age-stratified serosurveys performed at each site. Secondary attack rates will be estimated among household contacts of acute enteric fever cases and possible chronic carriers.
