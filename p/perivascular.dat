5|$|Types of glial cell are astrocytes (including Bergmann glia), oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells (including tanycytes), radial glial {{cells and}} microglia. Astrocytes {{are the largest}} of the glial cells. They are stellate cells with many {{processes}} radiating from their cell bodies. Some of these processes end as <b>perivascular</b> end-feet on capillary walls. The glia limitans of the cortex is made up of astrocyte foot processes that serve in part to contain the cells of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Adipose tissues also secrete {{a type of}} cytokines (cell-to-cell {{signalling}} proteins) called adipokines (adipocytokines), which {{play a role in}} obesity-associated complications. <b>Perivascular</b> {{adipose tissue}} releases adipokines such as adiponectin that affect the contractile function of the vessels that they surround.|$|E
25|$|Eph receptors {{are present}} in high degrees during vasculogenesis (angiogenesis) and other early {{development}} of the circulatory system. This development is disturbed without it. It is thought to distinguish arterial and venous endothelium, stimulating the production of capillary sprouts {{as well as in}} the differentiation of mesenchyme into <b>perivascular</b> support cells.|$|E
25|$|During the 1730s, Swedenborg {{undertook}} {{many studies}} of anatomy and physiology. He {{had the first}} known anticipation of the neuron concept. It was not until a century later that science recognized the full significance of the nerve cell. He also had prescient ideas about the cerebral cortex, the hierarchical organization of the nervous system, the localization of the cerebrospinal fluid, {{the functions of the}} pituitary gland, the <b>perivascular</b> spaces, the foramen of Magendie, the idea of somatotopic organization, and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. In some cases, his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times.|$|E
25|$|During sleep, {{metabolic}} waste products, such as immunoglobulins, protein fragments or intact proteins like beta-amyloid, may {{be cleared}} from the interstitium via a glymphatic system of lymph-like channels coursing along <b>perivascular</b> spaces and the astrocyte network of the brain. According to this model, hollow tubes between {{the blood vessels}} and astrocytes act like a spillway allowing drainage of cerebrospinal fluid carrying wastes out of the brain into systemic blood. Such mechanisms, which remain under preliminary research as of 2017, indicate potential ways in which sleep is a regulated maintenance period for brain immune functions and clearance of beta-amyloid, {{a risk factor for}} Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that latent HIV can cross the blood–brain barrier inside circulating monocytes in the bloodstream ("Trojan horse theory") within the first 14 days of infection. Once inside, these monocytes become activated and are transformed into macrophages. Activated macrophages release virions into the brain tissue proximate to brain microvessels. These viral particles likely {{attract the attention of}} sentinel brain microglia and <b>perivascular</b> macrophages initiating an inflammatory cascade that may cause a series of intracellular signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells and damage the functional and structural integrity of the BBB. This inflammation is HIV encephalitis (HIVE). Instances of HIVE probably occur throughout the course of AIDS and are a precursor for HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The premier model for studying HIV and HIVE is the simian model.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{clinical}} experience with brachial plexus block in both peacetime and wartime surgery was extensive, and {{new approaches to}} this technique began to be described. For example, In 1946, F. Paul Ansbro {{was the first to}} describe a continuous brachial plexus block technique. He secured a needle in the supraclavicular fossa and attached tubing connected to a syringe through which he could inject incremental doses of local anesthetic. The subclavian <b>perivascular</b> block was first described by Winnie and Collins in 1964. This approach became popular due to its lower risk of pneumothorax compared to the traditional Kulenkampff approach. The infraclavicular approach was first developed by Raj. In 1977, Selander described a technique for continuous brachial plexus block using an intravenous catheter secured in the axilla.|$|E
25|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) are of stromal origin and may {{differentiate}} into {{a variety of}} tissues. MSCs have been isolated from placenta, adipose tissue, lung, bone marrow and blood, Wharton's jelly from the umbilical cord, and teeth (<b>perivascular</b> niche of dental pulp and periodontal ligament). MSCs are attractive for clinical therapy due to their ability to differentiate, provide trophic support, and modulate innate immune response. These cells have the ability to differentiate into various cell types such as osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, neuroectodermal cells, and hepatocytes. Bioactive mediators that favor local cell growth are also secreted by MSCs. Anti-inflammatory effects on the local microenvironment, which promote tissue healing, are also observed. The inflammatory response can be modulated by adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) including mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory T-lymphocytes. The mesenchymal stem cells thus alter the outcome of the immune response by changing the cytokine secretion of dendritic and T-cell subsets. This results in a shift from a pro-inflammatory environment to an anti-inflammatory or tolerant cell environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} {{of blood vessels}} requires the coordination of endothelial and supportive mesenchymal cells through multiple phases to develop the intricate networks required for a fully functional circulatory system. The dynamic nature and expression patterns of the Ephs make them, therefore, ideal for roles in angiogenesis. Mouse embryonic models show expression of EphA1 in mesoderm and pre-endocardial cells, later spreading up into the dorsal aorta then primary head vein, intersomitic vessels, and limb bud vasculature, as {{would be consistent with}} a role in angiogenesis. Different class A Eph receptors have also been detected in the lining of the aorta, brachial arch arteries, umbilical vein, and endocardium. Complementary expression of EphB2/ephrin-B4 was detected in developing arterial endothelial cells and EphB4 in venous endothelial cells. Expression of EphB2 and ephrin-B2 was also detected on supportive mesenchymal cells, suggesting a role in wall development through mediation of endothelial-mesenchymal interactions. Blood vessel formation during embryogenesis consists of vasculogenesis, the formation of a primary capillary network followed by a second remodeling and restructuring into a finer tertiary network - studies utilizing ephrin-B2 deficient mice showed a disruption of the embryonic vasculature {{as a result of a}} deficiency in the restructuring of the primary network. Functional analysis of other mutant mice have led to the development of a hypothesis by which Ephs and ephrins contribute to vascular development by restricting arterial and venous endothelial mixing, thus stimulating the production of capillary sprouts as well as in the differentiation of mesenchyme into <b>perivascular</b> support cells, an ongoing area of research.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{research}} into the pathology of Devic's disease {{has focused on the}} spinal cord. [...] The damage can range from inflammatory demyelination to necrotic damage of the white and grey matters. [...] The inflammatory lesions in Devic's disease have been classified as type II lesions (complement-mediated demyelinization), but they differ from MS pattern II lesions in their prominent <b>perivascular</b> distribution. Therefore, the pattern of inflammation is often quite distinct from that seen in MS.|$|E

In 2005 they identified the aquaporin 4 protein as {{the target of}} the disease, and developed a test to aid in the diagnosis of Devic's disease by detection of an antibody, NMO-IgG, in the blood. Some patients with NMO may be seronegative for NMO-IgG, whilst some patients with NMO-IgG may still not fulfill clinical criteria for NMO thus serological testing is now an important part [...] of the diagnostic procedure and seropositive and seronegative cases are described {{in a manner similar to}} myasthenia gravis.

50|$|In {{addition}} to osteoblasts, HSCs interact with many mesenchymal cells {{as they make}} their way to the sinusoids in the <b>perivascular</b> niche. Removal of nestin-expressing MSCs has shown a significant decrease in LT-HSCs. These cells secrete high levels of CXCL12 and closely associate with sympathetic nerves that influence cytokine-induced migration of HSCs. Similar to these cells, CAR cells have correlated with reduced HSCs and LT-HSC activity when ablated. One difference between these cell types, despite the similarity in function, is that CAR cells may be found in both endosteal and <b>perivascular</b> niches, while nestin-positive MSCs are found exclusively in the <b>perivascular</b> niche.|$|E

50|$|Because dilated <b>perivascular</b> {{spaces are}} so closely {{correlated}} with cerebrovascular disease, {{there is much}} current research on their use as a diagnostic tool.

Antibody titers to EBV were measured in 14 of these patients and only five had abnormal antibody patterns consistent with chronic active EBV infection.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Perivascular</b> {{spaces are}} gaps {{containing}} interstitial fluid that span between {{blood vessels and}} the brain matter which they penetrate. Like the blood vessels around which they form, <b>perivascular</b> spaces are found in both the subarachnoid space and the subpial space.Perivascular spaces surrounding arteries in the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia are separated from the subpial space by one or two layers of leptomeninges, respectively, {{as well as the}} pia mater. By virtue of the leptomeningeal cell layer, the <b>perivascular</b> spaces belonging to the subarachnoid space are continuous with those of the subpial space. The direct communication between the <b>perivascular</b> spaces of the subarachnoid space and the subpial space is unique to the brain’s arteries, as no leptomeningeal layers surround the brain’s veins. Use of the scanning electron microscope has determined that the spaces surrounding blood vessels in the subarachnoid space are not continuous with the subarachnoid space {{because of the presence of}} pia mater cells joined by desmosomes.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the current}} {{research}} concerning Virchow-Robin spaces relates to their known tendency to dilate. Research is presently being performed {{in order to determine}} the exact cause of dilation in these <b>perivascular</b> spaces. Current theories include mechanical trauma resulting from cerebrospinal fluid pulsation, elongation of ectactic penetrating blood vessels, and abnormal vascular permeability leading to increased fluid exudation. Further research has implicated shrinkage or atrophy of surrounding brain tissue, <b>perivascular</b> demyelination, coiling of the arteries as they age, altered permeability of the arterial wall and obstruction of lymphatic drainage pathways. In addition, insufficient fluid draining and injury to ischemic <b>perivascular</b> tissue resulting in an ex vacuo effect have been suggested as possible causes for dilated VRS.|$|E
