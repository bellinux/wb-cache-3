25|$|The {{major cause}} of benzene in soft drinks is the {{decarboxylation}} of benzoic acid {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315). Benzoic acid is often added to drinks as a preservative in the form of its salts sodium benzoate (E211), <b>potassium</b> <b>benzoate</b> (E 212), or calcium benzoate (E 213). Citric acid is not thought to induce significant benzene production in combination with benzoic acid, but some evidence suggests that in the presence of ascorbic or erythorbic acid and benzoic acid, citric acid may accelerate the production of benzene.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conversion}} of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda, which pushes the beverage contents {{out of the}} container. Gasses, in general, are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures. Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure. The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened, and the pressure is released. Under these conditions, carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution, forming gas bubbles. Normally, this process is relatively slow, because the activation energy for this process is high. The activation energy for a process like bubble nucleation depends on where the bubble forms. It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself (homogeneous nucleation), and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface (heterogeneous nucleation). When the pressure is released from a soda bottle, the bubbles tend to form {{on the sides of}} the bottle. But because they are smooth and clean, the activation energy is still relatively high, and the process is slow. The addition of other nucleation sites provides an alternative pathway for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy, much like a catalyst. For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy, and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation. The physical characteristics of Mentos (surface roughness, easy dissolution into the liquid, etc.) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation, so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high. The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol−1. This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water, which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules, causes the water to foam, ultimately generating the [...] "jet"—or [...] "geyser"—or eruption-like nature of the effusion. The foaming is aided by the presence of chemicals like <b>potassium</b> <b>benzoate</b> and aspartame in Diet Coke, and gelatin and gum arabic in the Mentos candy, all which influence the nature of water's surface tension and degree to which it can foam.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of some food additives used in foods on cold tolerance of Clostridium perfringens at pH close to neutral. Maximal concentrations recommended for foods of sodium <b>benzoate,</b> <b>potassium</b> sorbate, sodium nitrite, monosodium glutamate, or mixtures of those were added to cultures and their effects on C. perfringens tolerance to 10 °C were evaluated. The effect of a previous shock at 28 °C was also determined. Growth of C. perfringens was not inhibited by the substances examined. Sodium nitrite, applied at maximal permitted concentrations, increased C. perfringens survival at 10 °C. Mixtures of GRAS compounds had either no clear effect, or increased tolerance to 10 °C. A pre-shock (28 °C) of the cultures treated with sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite or monosodium glutamate increased survival and stimulated growth of the cultures treated at 10 °C.

40|$|Background: Regarding {{the public}} health {{concerns}} {{over the use of}} food preservatives in yoghurt drink “Doogh", the aim of this study was the determination of sodium <b>benzoate,</b> <b>potassium</b> sorbate and natamycin in Doogh. Based on Iranian national standard, none of these preservatives are permitted to be used in Doogh. Methods: A total of 39 Doogh samples were analyzed through RP- HPLC in order to quantify sodium <b>benzoate,</b> <b>potassium</b> sorbate and natamaycin simultaneously. Exposure to each preservative is estimated by mean and maximum concentrations as the residue levels. The per capita Doogh consumption was calculated by the published data from official reports for Doogh annual production in Iran. Results: All samples were shown to contain sodium benzoate while natamaycin was detected in 10. 25 % of the samples and potassium sorbate was not detected in any of them. Sodium benzoate concentration extremely varied among the investigated samples ranged from 0. 94 to 9. 77 mg/l. Due to the result of the exposure estimation, no serious public health concern would exist regarding the mentioned preservatives. Conclusions: The detection of sodium benzoate in all Doogh samples could indicate the natural production of benzoic acid in yoghurt. Sodium benzoate may be formed through the interaction of the added food grade salt to the Doogh formula which contains benzoic acid. The results of exposure estimation show the lack of health risk within the usage of preservatives in spite of the national regulatory agencies does not permit the preservative use...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects of amaranth, erythrosine, tartrazine, <b>potassium</b> sorbate, sodium <b>benzoate,</b> <b>potassium</b> nitrate, saccharin, D-glucose and phosphate- 6 -glucose in healthy human lymphocytes in vitro. Materials and Methods: The effects of these food additives were evaluated through the methodology of Sister Chromatid Exchanges (SCEs). A simultaneous study of three cytogenetic indicators was used. Initially, the levels of SCEs/cell were analysed as a quantitative index of genotoxicity. Afterwards, the Proliferating Rate Index and the Mitotic Index were evaluated as qualitative indices of cytostaticity and cytotoxicity respectively. Results: The results of our experiments indicate that amaranth has genotoxic effect at all tested concentrations, cytostatic effect at 8 mM and cytotoxic effect at 8 and 4 mM. Erythrosine performed a high cytotoxicity at 8, 4, 2 and 1 mM. Tartrazine had cytotoxic effect at the highest concentrations and a simultaneous bad quality of chromosomes was observed. Additionally, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate illustrated cytostatic effects at 8 and 4 mM, whereas sodium benzoate showed signs of genotoxicity at 8 mM and potassium sorbate at 8 and 4 mM. Potassium nitrate, saccharin and D-glucose did not have cytogenetic effects at the studied concentrations. Lastly, glucose- 6 -phosphate performed cytostaticity at 8 and 4 mM and cytotoxicity at 8, 4 and 2 mM. Discussion: Our results demonstrate that the use of food additives could create severe problems to consumers’ health. Colorings are the most dangerous substances for our health. Amaranth, erythrosine and tartrazine must be avoided at high concentrations. Potassium nitrate is the safest from the preservatives. Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate should be used under some attention at high concentrations. Finally, the sweeteners are the safest for the consumers. Saccharin and D-glucose are also safe for use. Reversely, glucose- 6 -phosphate could be generating some negative effects at the highest concentrations. ...|$|R

Microbial {{spoilage}} {{has been}} reported in various food products and this has led to increased food, fruit and beverage losses, thereby threatening economic growth, food safety and security. Furthermore, statistics have shown that more than 30 % of agricultural produce in developing countries, mostly in Africa, is lost owing to microbial spoilage. Beverages, food and fruits are predominant contributors to the South African export market. In recent years, contamination of these products resulting in spoilage has been a problem, although partial spoilage control has been achieved using chemical preservatives such as dimethyl dicarbonate, sodium <b>benzoate,</b> <b>potassium</b> sorbate, and sulphur dioxide (SO 2). However, prolonged exposure to these chemical preservatives can cause human health problems such as skin and/or eyesight damage, muscle and stomach pain, cardiovascular disease and the impairment of brain function.
