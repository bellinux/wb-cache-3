40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{immune response}} {{is necessary for the}} development of protective immunity against infectious diseases. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a genetically heterogeneous and rapidly evolving RNA virus, is the most burdensome pathogen of swine health and wellbeing worldwide. Viral infection induces antigen-specific immunity that ultimately clears the infection. However, the resulting immune memory, induced by virulent or attenuated vaccine viruses, is inconsistently protective against diverse viral strains. The immunological mechanisms by which <b>primary</b> and <b>memory</b> protection are generated and used are not well understood. Here, we summarize current knowledge regarding cellular and humoral components of the {{adaptive immune response}} to PRRSV infection that mediate <b>primary</b> and <b>memory</b> immune protection against viruses...|$|R
25|$|When {{the size}} of the array to be sorted {{approaches}} or exceeds the available <b>primary</b> <b>memory,</b> so that (much slower) disk or swap space must be employed, the memory usage pattern of a sorting algorithm becomes important, and an algorithm that might have been fairly efficient when the array fit easily in RAM may become impractical. In this scenario, the total number of comparisons becomes (relatively) less important, and the number of times sections of memory must be copied or swapped to and from the disk can dominate the performance characteristics of an algorithm. Thus, the number of passes and the localization of comparisons can be more important than the raw number of comparisons, since comparisons of nearby elements to one another happen at system bus speed (or, with caching, even at CPU speed), which, compared to disk speed, is virtually instantaneous.|$|E

The exposure inhibition therapy is based on crucial parts of the be-havioral-cognitive inhibition theory (Paunović, 2010). In this treatment primary incompatible respondent memo-ries are utilized in order to 1) directly counter numbing and depressive symptoms, 2) incorporate the <b>primary</b> trauma <b>memory</b> into <b>primary</b> incompatible <b>memories,</b> and 3) inhibit <b>primary</b> respondent trauma <b>memories.</b> Twenty-nine crime victims with chronic PTSD were randomized to a group that received exposure inhibition therapy immediately (N = 14), or a wait-list control group (N = 15) that waited for 2. 5 months and then received the treatment. The group that first received treatment improved significantly on PTSD symptoms, (CAPS, IES-R, PCL) depression (BDI), anxiety (BAI), posttraumatic cognitions of self, others and guilt (PTCI), and coping self-efficacy (CES) compared to the wait-list control group. The treatment efficacy was high for PTSD symp-toms, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as on most cognitive measures. When the wait-list control group received treatment similar results were observed. Results were maintained at a 3 -months follow-up in the treat-ment group, and on some measures improvement continued. Three empirically derived cut-off criteria (44, 39, 27) were used for the CAPS, and one cut-off level for the BDI (10), in order to assess the clinical significance of the results.

However, it has yet to be determined whether T helper polarization affects the delivery of help and/or whether responding CD 8 T cells helped by Th 1 or Th 2 cells express distinct effector properties. To address these issues, we compared CD 8 T-cell responses in the context of Th 1 or Th 2 help by injecting dendritic cells copulsed with the major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted OVA peptide plus, respectively, bacterial or helminth antigens. We found that Th 2 cells, like Th 1 cells, can help <b>primary</b> and long-lived <b>memory</b> CD 8 T-cell responses.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} genesis {{and maintenance of}} T cell memory remain unclear. In this study, we examined {{the evolution of a}} complex, antigen-specific T cell population during the transition from <b>primary</b> effector to <b>memory</b> T cells after Listeria monocytogenes infection. T cell populations specific for listeriolysin O (LLO) 91 – 99, the immunodominant epitope recognized by H 2 -Kd –restricted T lymphocytes, were directly identified in immune spleens using tetrameric H 2 -Kd –epitope complexes. The T cell receptor (TCR) V � repertoire of specific T cells was determined by direct, ex vivo staining with a panel of mAbs. We demonstrate that LLO 91 – 99 -specific, primary effector T cell populations have a diverse TCR V � repertoire. Analyses of memory T cell populations demonstrated similar TCR diversity. Furthermore, experiments with individual mice demonstrated that <b>primary</b> effector and <b>memory</b> T cells have indistinguishable TCR repertoires. Remarkably, after reinfection with L. monocytogenes, LLO 91 – 99 -specific T cells have a narrower TCR repertoire than do <b>primary</b> effector or <b>memory</b> T cells. Thus, our studies show that the TCR repertoire of primary effector T lymphocytes is uniformly transmitted to memory T cells, whereas expansion of memory T cells is selective.
