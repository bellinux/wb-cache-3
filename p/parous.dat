5000|$|A {{number of}} {{adaptive}} functions {{have been proposed}} {{to account for the}} widespread incidences of allomaternal care in mammalian and avian species. Jane Lancaster noted the reproductive benefits for primates as k-strategists in learning to be better mothers, or acquiring mothering skills. Her learning-to-mother hypothesis postulates that primate females with no children of their own participate in allomothering, and evidence from studies by Sarah Hrdy and Lynn Fairbanks shows that females without offspring [...] "tried to allomother more frequently than what you'd expected based on their proportion of the group's population, while <b>parous</b> females tried it much less than expected from their population in the group." [...] The hypothesis is supported by evidence of the success of allomothering as a learning technique. [...] "Lynn Fairbanks studied vervets and found that first-time mothers with high alloparenting experience raised 100% of their first offspring to maturity, but mothers with low experience had less than a 50% survival rate of their first infant." [...] Other hypothesis include [...] "alliance-formation", where subordinate allomothers endeavour to form social alliances with dominant mothers by interacting with their infants. Under kin-selection theory, related allomothers may improve their inclusive fitness if the allomothering behaviour contributes to the survival or faster reproductive rate of the mother. Finally, allomaternal care has been suggested to be a by-product of maternal care. However, this hypothesis would not explain the high levels of care seen by juvenile, subadult or unrelated adult males in many primate species.|$|E

Gene expression profiling was used to investigate the mechanisms that alter apoptotic responses to DNA damage in the mammary gland. Radiation-induced responses in BALB/c-Trp 53 +/+ and BALB/c-Trp 53 -/- mice identified 121 genes that were altered by radiation and p 53 status (p 53 -IR). To determine the effect of parity, mice were mated, force-weaned and mammary glands were allowed to involute for 21 days (<b>parous)</b> and compared with age-matched nulliparous mice. Gene expression profiles were determined in mammary tissues from nulliparous (N), <b>parous</b> (P), irradiated nulliparous (N-IR) and irradiated <b>parous</b> (P-IR) mice. The p 53 -IR gene signature did not differ among the N-IR and P-IR groups indicating that transcriptional activity of p 53 was not altered by parity. However, expression profiles of apoptosis-related genes differed significantly in the <b>parous</b> group.

40|$|Background: To {{examine the}} {{episiotomy}} incidence and determinants and outcomes associated with {{its use in}} primary care midwifery practices. Methods: Secondary analysis of two prospective cohort studies (n = 3, 404). Results: The episiotomy incidence was 10. 8 percent (20. 9 % for nulliparous and 6. 3 % for <b>parous</b> women). Episiotomy was associated with prolonged second stage of labor (adj. OR 12. 09 [95 % CI 6. 0 - 24. 2] for nulliparous and adj. OR 2. 79 [1. 7 - 4. 6] for <b>parous</b> women) and hospital birth (adj. OR 1. 75 [1. 2 - 2. 5] for <b>parous</b> women). Compared with episiotomy, perineal tears were associated with a lower rate of postpartum hemorrhage in <b>parous</b> women (adj. OR 0. 58 [0. 4 - 0. 9]). Fewer women with perineal tears reported perineal discomfort (adj. OR 0. 35 [0. 2 - 0. 6] for nulliparous and adj. OR 0. 22 [0. 1 - 0. 3] for <b>parous</b> women). Among nulliparous women episiotomy was performed most frequently for prolonged second stage of labor (38. 8 %) and among <b>parous</b> women for history of episiotomy or prevention of major perineal trauma (21. 1 %).

40|$|ABSTRACT-The hormone {{profiles}} of nulliparous and <b>parous</b> women on day 11 of their menstrual cycle {{have been studied}} {{in an attempt to}} seek evidence for the hormonal basis of the protective effect of first birth on breast cancer risk.

The present study shows, however, that <b>parous</b> women had significantly shorter cycle lengths than nulli-parous women of the same age, and the data were reevaluated with this difference being taken into account. After adjustment for cycle length (within the range of 24 - 32 days) and age, estrogen levels were significantly lower (22 %) in <b>parous</b> women compared to those in nulliparous women.

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} the compliance {{and degree of}} satisfaction of nulligravida (has not given birth) and <b>parous</b> (had already given birth) women who are using intrauterine devices (IUDs). Methods A cross-sectional cohort study was conducted comparing nulligravida and <b>parous</b> women who had had an IUD inserted between July 2009 and November 2011. A total of 84 nulligravida women and 73 <b>parous</b> women were included. Interviews were conducted with women who agreed to participate through telephone contact. Statistical analysis was performed with Student s t-test and Mann-Whitney test for numeric variables; Pearson s chi-square test to test associations; and, whenever pertinent, Fisher s exact test for categorical variables. A survival curve was constructed to estimate the likelihood of each woman continuing {{the use of the}} IUD. A significance level of 5 % was established. Results When compared with <b>parous</b> women, nulligravida women had a higher education level (median: 12 vs. 10 years). No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the nulligravida and <b>parous</b> women with respect to information on the use of the IUD, prior use of other contraceptive methods, the reason for having chosen the IUD as the current contraceptive method, reasons for discontinuing the use and adverse effects, compliance, and degree of satisfaction. The two groups did not show any difference in terms of continued use of the IUD (p = 0. 4). Conclusion There was no difference in compliance or the degree of satisfaction or continued use of IUDs between nulligravida and <b>parous</b> women, suggesting that IUD use may be recommended for women who have never been pregnant...|$|E
40|$|Early {{studies of}} breast cancer raised {{substantial}} concern regarding risk associated with induced abortion and miscarriage. Literature reviews suggest that study findings depend heavily on the comparison group and {{that the use of}} <b>parous</b> women as a reference group for nulliparous women may artificially inflate risk. To examine the individual effects of induced abortion and miscarriage on breast cancer risk of <b>parous</b> and nulliparous women, 744 patients < 40 years of age and diagnosed from 1983 – 1988 were matched by parity, age, and race with controls living in the same neighborhood in Los Angeles County. In-person interviews were conducted to obtain a detailed reproductive history. Risk estimates were obtained by conditional logistic regression using nulligravid women as the reference group for nulliparous women with a history of incomplete pregnancy and <b>parous</b> women with no incomplete pregnancies as the reference group for <b>parous</b> women with a history of incomplete pregnancy. Breast cancer risk of <b>parous</b> women was unrelated to a history of miscarriage or induced abortion. Breast cancer risk was reduced among nulliparous women with a history of induced abortion relative to nulligravid women, although the risk estimate was imprecise. Risk declined as the number of induced abortions increased (P 0. 04). Our results do not support the hypothesis that induced abortion or miscarriage increase the breast cancer risk of young women...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in anatomical traits {{has been}} widely studied in animals. Although pelvis dimorphism was mostly studied in humans, it occurs also in many other mammalian species. Here, we investigated sexual dimorphism in the pelvis of the bank vole Myodes glareolus using individuals with known sex and reproductive status of females (<b>parous</b> vs nulliparous). The analyses revealed that {{the size and shape}} of pelvis differed significantly between sexes, as well as between nulliparous and <b>parous</b> females. In comparison with males, females had a significantly longer pelvis and pubis bones and a longer obturator foramen length, but a smaller pubis width. Interestingly, the difference between <b>parous</b> and nulliparous females resembles that between females and males: <b>parous</b> females had bigger pelvis, which probably resulted from changes during pregnancy and after birth. Left bones were on average larger than right ones, but the magnitude of directional asymmetry was not different between sex and reproduction group. Moreover, we noticed that fluctuating asymmetry of pelvis and pubis length was higher in females than in males and higher in <b>parous</b> than in nulliparous females, what is presumably associated with locomotor performance. A discriminant function analysis performed for the four bone size traits showed that the traits can be effectively used for a nearly perfect recognition of sexes and also a quite reliable recognition of the reproductive status of females...|$|E

30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{finding of}} our study was that TNBCs occur more frequently in PABCs than in nulliparous cancers. In fact we only had one TNBC sample in the nulliparous group, which prevented us from including a nulliparous TNBC subgroup for gene comparison purposes. We found that the <b>parous</b> TNBC group differentially expressed a subset of 14 genes, five of which also showed differential expression between the <b>parous</b> cases and their nulliparous counterpart. Therefore we conclude that the major factor in gene expression differences associated with pregnancy is attributable to the TNBC subgroup of the PABCs. Most interesting is the finding that five of these genes (TGFB 3, ESR 1, PGR, TIMP 2, ERBB 2) are common to the gene set that distinguishes the normal <b>parous</b> breast from the normal nulliparous breast and six of these genes (CXCL 1, CXCL 12, ERBB 2, IL 1 A, MMP 12, TIMP 2) are common to the inflammatory signature we previously reported (Asztalos et al. 2010). The expression of five genes (TGFB 3, ESR 1, PGR, TIMP 2, ERBB 2) {{is in the same}} direction in the <b>parous</b> normal breast and the pregnancy-associated TNBC with the exception of TIMP 2. Three of these genes, ESR 1, PGR and ERBB 2, are associated with the protective effects of pregnancy in the normal breast whereas lack of expression of these genes defines the TNBC subtype. Nonetheless, the consistency of expression of a subset of genes found in both the normal <b>parous</b> breast and in <b>parous</b> TNBCs is a significant finding that may have implications for potential biomarkers of breast cancer risk. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that pregnancy creates a tissue microenvironment favorable for the development of TNBCs.|$|E
