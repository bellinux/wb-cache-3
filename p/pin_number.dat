25|$|Ireland's fifth {{victim was}} Maltese chef Emanuel Spiteri, aged 41, {{whom he had}} met at the Coleherne pub. Spiteri was persuaded to be cuffed and bound on his bed.

After {{carrying}} out his post-murder ritual of cleaning and clearing the scene, Ireland {{set fire to the}} flat and left.

25|$|The two men {{returned}} to Bradley's flat, where Ireland {{suggested that he}} tie Bradley up; Bradley expressed his displeasure at the idea. In order to get Bradley to comply, Ireland {{told him that he}} was unable to perform sexually without elements of bondage. Bradley hesitantly cooperated and was soon trussed up on his own bed, face down, with a noose around his neck. After Ireland had secured Bradley, he demanded money and a <b>PIN</b> <b>number</b> under the threat of torture. Ireland assured Bradley that he was merely a thief and would leave after stealing Bradley's money. After Bradley gave Ireland his PIN, which Ireland later used to steal £200, along with £100 in cash stolen from Bradley's flat, Ireland told him that he should go to sleep, as he wouldn't be leaving his flat for hours. Bradley eventually did fall asleep and Ireland momentarily thought of leaving Bradley unharmed. Ireland then realised that Bradley could identify him and used the noose, which he had earlier attached around Bradley's neck, to strangle him. Before leaving Bradley's flat, he placed a doll on top of the dead man's body.|$|E

50|$|For multi-row pin headers, the <b>pin</b> <b>number</b> is more complex, because {{knowing the}} {{location}} of pin 1 doesn't automatically ensure how the remaining pins are numbered. Typically for headers attached to ribbon cables, the pins are numbered so they go linearly across the cable.
