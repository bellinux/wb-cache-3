40|$|To {{compare the}} {{analgesic}} efficacy and tolerance of <b>propacetamol</b> and morphine, 80 patients in good clinical condition {{were included in}} a prospective, parallel, randomized double blind trial after elective surgery expected to elicit light to moderate postoperative pain. At the end of general anesthesia, 40 patients received 30 mg/kg <b>propacetamol</b> and 40 0. 2 mg/kg morphine, as a 15 -min intravenous infusion. The groups were similar for age, weight and duration of anesthesia. Supplemental analgesia had to be given in 7 cases from the <b>propacetamol</b> group vs. 2 cases from the morphine group. The postoperative pain, evaluated 7 times during 4 h {{from the end of}} infusion with a visual analog scale, revealed a modest advantage for morphine at 0. 5 and 4 h (p = 0. 05). The respiratory rate was slightly lower after morphine (p = 0. 02).

Methods: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority study, patients received {{one of four}} IV treatments after surgery: parecoxib 40 mg bid (n = 72); <b>propacetamol</b> 2 g qid (n = 71); parecoxib 40 mg bid plus <b>propacetamol</b> 2 g qid (n = 72); or placebo (n = 38) with supplemental IV patient-controlled analgesia (morphine). Patients and investigators were blinded to treatment. Pain intensity at rest and with movement was assessed regularly, together with functional recovery (modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form) and opioid-related side effects (Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale) questionnaires up to 48 h. Results: After 24 h, cumulative morphine consumption was reduced by 59. 8 % (P < 0. 001), 38. 9 % (P < 0. 001), and 26. 8 % (P = 0. 005) in the parecoxib+propacetamol, parecoxib, and <b>propacetamol</b> groups, respectively, compared with placebo. Parecoxib did not meet criteria for non-inferiority to parecoxib+propacetamol. Parecoxib+propacetamol and parecoxib significantly reduced least-squares mean pain intensity scores at rest and with movement compared with <b>propacetamol</b> (P < 0. 05). One day after surgery, parecoxib+propacetamol significantly reduced opioid-related symptom distress and decreased pain interference with function compared with <b>propacetamol</b> or placebo. Conclusion: Parecoxib and parecoxib+propacetamol provided significant opioid-sparing efficacy compared with placebo; non-inferiority of parecoxib to parecoxib+propacetamol was not demonstrated. Opioid-sparing efficacy was accompanied by significant reductions in pain intensity on movement, improved functional outcome, and less opioid-related symptom distress.

40|$|Abstract Background Postoperative {{administration}} of paracetamol or its prodrug <b>propacetamol</b> {{has been shown}} to decrease pain with a morphine sparing effect. However, the effect of <b>propacetamol</b> administered intra-operatively on post-operative pain and early postoperative morphine consumption has not been clearly evaluated. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} analgesic protocols in the management of post-operative pain, a standardized anesthesia protocol without long-acting opioids is crucial. Thus, for ethical reasons, the surgical procedure under general anesthesia with remifentanil as the only intraoperative analgesic must be associated with a moderate predictable postoperative pain. Methods We were interested in determining the postoperative effect of <b>propacetamol</b> administered intraoperatively after intraoperative remifentanil. Thirty-six adult women undergoing mammoplasty with remifentanil-based anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive <b>propacetamol</b> 2 g or placebo one hour before the end of surgery. After remifentanil interruption and tracheal extubation in recovery room, pain was assessed and intravenous titrated morphine was given. The primary end-point was the cumulative dose of morphine administered in the recovery room. The secondary end-points were the pain score after tracheal extubation and one hour after, the delay for obtaining a Simplified Numerical Pain Scale (SNPS) less than 4, and the incidence of morphine side effects in the recovery room. For intergroup comparisons, categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test and continuous variables were compared using the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. A p value less than 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results In recovery room, morphine consumption was lower in the <b>propacetamol</b> group than in the placebo group (p = 0. 01). Pain scores were similar in both groups after tracheal extubation and lower in the <b>propacetamol</b> group (p = 0. 003) one hour after tracheal extubation.

40|$|AbstractBackground and Purpose: IV Acetaminophen (<b>Propacetamol)</b> is one {{the drugs}} which has {{recently}} been discussed in pain management. The purpose of this study, is the comparison of analgesic effect of <b>Propacetamol</b> and Tramadol in pain relief of renal colic patients. Materials and Methods: This double blinded randomized clinical trial was preformed on 80 patients who came to ED of Hazrat Rasool Akram Hospital (HRAH) due to renal colic. Demographic data and pain scores were evaluated prior to injection (through numeric rating scale). Then, patients received one of the drugs, drug A (1 gr <b>Propacetamol)</b> or B (100 mg Tramadol) randomly. Pain relief and adverse effects of the drugs were evaluated 30 minutes after injection. After 1 hour, satisfaction {{and the need to}} administer a narcotic were evaluated. Data was gathered and analyzed by T-test via SPSS software. The Pvalue less than 0 / 05 was dertermined to be significant. Results: The mean age in group A, was 33 ± 8. 6 yrs and in group B, was 34. 2 ± 8. 2 yrs. Mean of pain score in group A, was 7. 6 ± 1. 6 and in group B, was 7. 5 ± 1. 5. Pain relief in group A, was 4. 4 ± 1. 6 and in group B, was 2. 6 ± 1. 2. Differences between the groups were significant. 12 cases (% 30) in group A, and in 25 cases (% 62 / 5) in group B, recieced additional analgesic for pain relief, thus, difference between groups was significant. Conclusion: According this study, IV <b>Propacetamol</b> is a safe and effective drug for pain relief in renal colic patients, without any significant adverse effects. Our survey showed that IV <b>Propacetamol</b> is more efficient and has less side effects in comparison with Tramadol in the pain relief of renal colic patients...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} <b>propacetamol</b> pharmacokinetics in children in order to predict concentrations after a standard dosing regimen of <b>propacetamol</b> 30 mg x kg(- 1) (15 mg x kg(- 1) paracetamol) 6 h. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic analysis of paracetamol time-concentration profiles (846 observations) from 144 children [postconception age (PCA) 27 weeks- 14 years] was undertaken using nonlinear mixed effects models (NONMEM). These data were taken from seven separate studies involving children given intravenous <b>propacetamol.</b> Time-concentration profiles (503 observations) from a further 86 children (PCA: 37 weeks- 14 years) given paracetamol elixir orally were included in the analysis to assess relative bioavailability of intravenous <b>propacetamol.</b> RESULTS: A three-compartment (depot, central and peripheral) linear disposition model fitted data better than a two-compartment (depot and central) model. Population parameter estimates (between subject variability, %) were central volume (V 2 /F(oral)) 24 (55 %) l x 70 kg(- 1), peripheral volume of distribution (V 3 /F(oral)) 30 (32 %) l x 70 kg(- 1), clearance (CL/F(oral)) 16 (40 %) l x h(- 1) x 70 kg(- 1) and intercompartment clearance (Q/F(oral)) 55 (116 %) l x h(- 1) x 70 kg(- 1). Clearance increased from 27 weeks PCA (1. 87 l x h(- 1) 70 kg(- 1)) to reach 84 % of the mature value by 1 year of age (standardized to a 70 kg person using allometric ' 1 / 4 power' models). Peripheral volume of distribution decreased from 27 weeks PCA (45. 0 l x 70 kg(- 1)) to reach 110 % of its mature value by 6 months of age. Central volume of distribution and intercompartment clearance did not change with age. Between occasions variability for the peripheral volume of distribution (V 3 /F(oral)) and clearance (CL/F(oral)) were 18. 5 and 19. 3 %, respectively. A rate constant representing hydrolysis of <b>propacetamol</b> to paracetamol (K(a) 96 h(- 1)) was size related, but not age related. The relative bioavailability of intravenous <b>propacetamol</b> compared with an oral elixir was 0. 5. CONCLUSIONS: A mean paracetamol serum concentration of 10 mg x l(- 1) is achieved in children 2 - 15 years given a standard dose of <b>propacetamol</b> 30 mg x kg(- 1) 6 h. This concentration in the effect compartment is associated with a pain reduction of 2. 6 / 10 after tonsillectomy and provides satisfactory analgesia for mild to moderate pain. Clearance is reduced in children less than 1 year of age and the target concentration of 10 mg x l(- 1) may be achieved by scaling this standard dose regimen using predicted clearance in this younger age group. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{enhances the}} {{analgesic}} effect of non-steroidal anti-in¯ammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Acetaminophen is a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX), and its combination with an NSAID may augment COX inhibition-related side effects. Methods. Ten healthy male volunteers (21 ± 30 yr) were given diclofenac 1. 1 mg kg± 1 alone, {{a combination of}} <b>propacetamol</b> 30 mg kg± 1 (which is hydrolysed to 50 % acetaminophen) and diclofenac 1. 1 mg kg± 1 or placebo intravenously in a double blind, crossover study. Platelet function was assessed at 5 min, 90 min and 22 ± 24 h by photometric aggregometry, platelet function analyser (PFA- 100 Ô) and by measuring the release of thromboxane B 2 (TxB 2). Analgesia was assessed with the cold pressor test. Results. Platelet aggregation induced with arachidonic acid was fully inhibited by both diclofe-nac alone and the combination {{at the end of}} the 30 -min drug infusion. <b>Propacetamol</b> aug-mented the inhibition by diclofenac at 90 min (P= 0. 014). At 22 ± 24 h, platelet function had fully recovered. TxB 2 release was inhibited by the combination of <b>propacetamol</b> and diclofenac at 90 min in comparison with diclofenac alone (P= 0. 027).

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single dose <b>propacetamol</b> in preterm and term infants {{on the first}} day of life. Methods: Neonates were stratified by gestational age. Preterm (, 37 weeks) and term (37 – 41 weeks) infants received a single dose of <b>propacetamol</b> in the first 24 hours of life when they had minor, painful procedures or as additional treatment in infants receiving opioids. Blood samples were taken from an arterial line, and pain was evaluated by a multidimensional pain scale. Results were reported as mean (SD). Student’s t and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare the groups. Results: Thirty neonates were included, 10 of which were term infants. Serum half life was 277 (143) minutes in the preterm infants and 172 (59) minutes in the term infants (p, 0. 05). Clearance was 0. 116 (0. 08) litre/kg/h in the preterm infants and 0. 170 (0. 06) litre/kg/h in the term infants (p, 0. 05). Gestational age correlated with serum half life (r = 20. 46). No effect of sex or administration of prenatal steroids was found on the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Major {{changes in}} drug {{clearance}} and metabolism are observed during infancy, in part based on ontogenic regulation of various metabolic pathways. Since paracetamol {{provides a good}} substrate to study UGT (1 A 6) activity, urinary metabolites of <b>propacetamol</b> were determined in neonates in whom <b>propacetamol</b> was repeatedly administered. METHODS: Paracetamol glucuronide (APAP-G), paracetamol sulphate (APAP-S) and free paracetamol were determined in urine samples of neonates during repeated administration of <b>propacetamol.</b> Spearman rank and linear multiple regression (MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium) were used to study the effect of postnatal age, of postconceptional age and of repeated administration on the relative contribution of APAP-G to overall urine paracetamol (APAP-G+APAP-S+free paracetamol) elimination (G/T ratio). RESULTS: 147 samples were collected in 23 neonates. Molar median G/T ratio was 14 % (range 1 - 53). Besides increasing G/T ratio with increasing postnatal (p< 0. 0001) and postconceptional age (p< 0. 01), repeated administration (p< 0. 01) also correlated with an increasing G/T ratio, and repeated administration remained significant (p< 0. 01) after correction of postnatal and postconceptional age in a multiple regression model. CONCLUSION: Major variability in the ontogeny of UGT activity to overall elimination of paracetamol was documented in neonates. Besides postnatal and postconceptional age, a significant effect of repeated administration on UGT activity was documented. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{pharmacokinetics}} and analgesic {{effects of}} intravenous and rectal paracetamol were compared in nonventilated infants after craniofacial surgery in a double-blind placebo controlled study. Methods: During surgery all infants (6 months- 2 years) received a rectal loading dose of 40 mg. kg(- 1) paracetamol 2 h before anticipated extubation. On admittance to the pediatric surgical ICU, {{the children were}} randomized to receive either a 15 min intravenous infusion of 40 mg. kg(- 1) <b>propacetamol,</b> a prodrug of paracetamol, or 20 mg. kg(- 1) paracetamol rectally every 6 h. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of the paracetamol plasma concentration time-profiles was undertaken using nonlinear mixed effects models. The visual analogue scale (VAS) (score 0 - 10 cm) and COMFORT Behavior scale (score 6 - 30) were used to monitor analgesia in the 24 -h period following surgery. Results: Twelve infants received intravenous <b>propacetamol</b> and 14 paracetamol suppositories. Paracetamol pharmacokinetics were described according to a two-compartmental model with linear disposition. Pharmacokinetic parameters were standardized to a 70 kg person using allometric ' 1 / 4 power' models. Parameter estimates were: absorption half-life from the rectum 4. 6 h, <b>propacetamol</b> hydrolysis half-life 0. 028 h, clearance 12 l. h(- 1). 70 kg(- 1), intercompartmental clearance 116 l. h(- 1). 70 kg(- 1), central and peripheral volume of distribution 7. 9 and 44 l. 70 kg(- 1), respectively.

Residual pain was treated with i. v. PCA morphine. Pain and patient satisfaction were assessed with Visual Analog Scales. Demographic and peroperative data were comparable in both groups. Although the morphine consumption was comparable (p = 0. 71), the decrease in VAS pain scores was significantly higher following tramadol (p = 0. 03).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} <b>propacetamol</b> pharmacokinetics in term and preterm neonates to suggest dosing regimens. METHODS. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of paracetamol (acetaminophen) time-concentration profiles in 48 neonates was undertaken using non-linear mixed-effects models. Neonates were given either single (n= 30) or multiple doses (n= 18) of <b>propacetamol</b> infusion over 15 min. Neonates had a median postnatal age of 1 day (range, 1 - 76 days). Median post-conceptual age (PCA) was 35 weeks (range, 27 - 42 weeks), and median weight was 2. 4 kg (range, 0. 51 - 4 kg). RESULTS: The population volume of distribution estimate and between-subject variability (%) for a one-compartment model with zero-order input and first-order elimination was 70. 4 l (30. 7 %) / 70 kg. Clearance increased from 2. 85 l/ 70 kg, CV 40. 7 % at 27 weeks PCA to reach 7. 05 l/h per 70 kg by 42 weeks PCA (standardised to a 70 -kg person using allometric " 1 / 4 -power" models). Between-occasion variability for volume of distribution and clearance were 17. 4 % and 26 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A mean paracetamol steady-state target concentration above 10 mg/l at trough can be achieved using a loading dose of 40 mg/kg and maintenance doses of 20 mg/kg 6 h in 28 -week PCA neonates, 25 mg/kg 6 h at 32 weeks, 30 mg/kg 6 h at 36 weeks and 20 mg/kg 4 h at term (<b>propacetamol</b> doses). Since the role of the oxidative enzyme CYP 2 E 1 and production of the hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine still is unknown in premature neonates, lower doses scaled by age-related clearance and centred on a daily dose of 60 mg/kg per day in a child of 6 - 8 years with a clearance of 0. 25 l/h per kg (12. 5 l/h per 70 kg) may be more appropriate. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of post-caesarean analgesia comparing three techniques most frequently used. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For three months all pregnant women submitted to elective or urgent caesarean section, under general or regional anaesthesia, were evaluate with a total of 129 parturient. These parturient were divided into three groups with different techniques of postoperative analgesia: Group 1 (n = 26) received intravenous pethidine and paracetamol per os, group 2 (n = 58) received epidural morphine and group 3 (n = 45) epidural morphine and intravenous <b>propacetamol.</b> Pain was assessed at rest and during mobilisation using a scale of 0 -without pain, 1 -mild pain, 2 -moderate pain and 3 -severe pain. Overall satisfaction was assessed with a verbal qualitative scale of very good, good, sufficient and bad. Side effects were analysed. RESULTS: The records of pain at rest and during mobilisation were significantly lower with epidural analgesia compared with intravenous pethidine. There were no significant differences between groups 2 and 3. Similar results were observed in the degree of satisfaction. For 50 % of parturient of epidural analgesia (groups 2 and 3) and only 4 % of intravenous pethidine (group 1) the analgesic technique was very good. <b>Propacetamol</b> and epidural morphine (group 3) had better pain scores (very good and good) when compared with morphine alone (group 2) but there were no significant differences. Epidural morphine was associated with more pruritus. CONCLUSION: From this study we are able to conclude that epidural morphine offers a good quality of analgesia with better satisfaction and minimal side effects...|$|E
40|$|Intravenous (IV) Paracetamol is an {{excellent}} post operative analgesic and antipyretic in children. Efficacy and tolerability of IV <b>Propacetamol</b> have been established in pediatric practice. It is believed that paracetamol works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) enzymes. Studies bring to light that therapeutic doses of IV acetaminophen are effective and tolerable in children with least chances of hepatotoxicity. However, overdose toxicity {{has been reported in}} children and drug induced hypotension in febrile critically ill patients. Therapeutic doses according to body weight of neonates and children can be administered in hospital settings.

40|$|Since the {{antipyretic}} {{and probably}} the analgesic effects of paracetamol are, at least in part, centrally mediated, its plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations were measured in 43 patients with nerve-root compression pain. Each subject was given a short i. v. infusion of 2 g <b>propacetamol,</b> a prodrug which is hydrolysed to paracetamol within 7 min. Single blood and CSF samples were drawn concomitantly in each patient at intervals between 20 min and 12 h. Maximum CSF drug concentrations were observed at the 4 th hour, subsequent concentrations exceeding those in plasma. The elimination half-life of paracetamol calculated from pooled data was shorter in plasma (2. 4 h) than in CSF (3. 2 h). The time-course of paracetamol in CSF may parallel that of analgesic effect...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Optimum pain {{management}} immediately after surgeries can lower {{the possibility of}} pain syndrome and its following consequences. Opioids are amongst the analgesics used for postoperative pain control; however, their application can bring about several adverse effects. In this study, all the published articles regarding efficacy of Paracetamol   in post-cardiac surgery {{pain management}} were systematically reviewed. Materials and Methods: Pubmed and Scopus were searched for relevant articles. The employed search strategy was as follows: (Paracetamol   OR Acetaminophen OR <b>Propacetamol)</b> AND (pain OR analgesia) AND coronary. All the English-language articles (with no time restriction), investigating the effectiveness of Acetaminophen in comparison with other analgesics or placebo, {{were included in the}} study. All the articles examining the efficacy of Paracetamol   in combination with other analgesics were excluded from the search results. Results: On the whole, our electronic search retrieved 192 articles from PubMed and 365 articles from Scopus. After screening the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the search results, only 5 English-language articles met our inclusion criteria. Conclusion: Although Paracetamol   demonstrated considerable efficacy in minimizing application of post-operative opioids, its strength in soothing post-operative pain is not significantly different from opioids. Further, conducting randomized-controlled-trials with large sample size are necessary to accurately reveal the efficacy of Paracetamol   in curtailing application of opioids in post cardiac surgeries...|$|E
40|$|Postoperative pain {{management}} {{is one of}} the most challenging jobs in orthopedic surgical population as it comprises of patients from extremes of ages and with multiple comorbidities. Though effective, opioids may contribute to serious adverse effects particularly in old age patients. Intravenous paracetamol is widely used in the postoperative period with the hope that it may reduce opioid consumption and produce better pain relief. A brief review of human clinical trials where intravenous paracetamol was compared with placebo or no treatment in postoperative period in orthopedic surgical population has been done here. We found that four clinical trials reported that there is a significant reduction in postoperative opioid consumption. When patients received an IV injection of 2 [*]g <b>propacetamol,</b> reduction of morphine consumption up to 46 % has been reported. However, one study did not find any reduction of opioid requirement after spinal surgery in children and adolescent. Four clinical trials reported better pain scores when paracetamol has been used, but other three trials denied. We conclude that postoperative intravenous paracetamol is a safe and effective adjunct to opioid after orthopedic surgery, but at present there is no data to decide whether paracetamol reduces opioid related adverse effects or not...|$|E
40|$|Background. Perispinal {{anaesthesia}} for Caesarean section allows {{injection of}} epidural (ED) or intrathecal (i. t.) morphine to provide long-lasting postoperative analgesia. To compare these two routes, a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study of 53 patients undergoing elective Caesarean section was performed. Methods. Combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia with 6 mg of i. t. hyperbaric bupivacaine plus sufentanil 5 mg, and additional ED lidocaine was used. Additionally, each patient received either 2 mg (2 ml) of ED morphine plus 1 ml of i. t. normal saline (ED group, n= 28), or 0. 075 mg (1 ml) of i. t. morphine plus 2 ml of ED normal saline (i. t. group, n= 25). Additional postoperative analgesia {{was given in}} the form of <b>propacetamol</b> and ketoprofen, plus self-administered i. v. morphine. Results. No major respiratory depression occurred. Time to ®rst demand of morphine was similar in the ED (307. 5 min) and i. t. (310 min) groups, as was the incidence of side-effects such as sedation, pruritis, nausea, and vomiting. During the ®rst 24 postoperative hours, VAS pain scores were greater in the i. t. group (P= 0. 032), as was additional morphine consumption (4 vs 1. 5 mg) (P= 0. 03). Conclusions. The ED protocol was more effective than the i. t. protocol, whilst side-effects were similar...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{awakening}} without residual analgesic effect {{seen with}} the new "fast-in-fast-out" anesthetic agents forces us to anticipate post-operative pain management. More then ever, "balanced analgesia" appears the key for successful transition between anesthesia and post-operative analgesia. This review focuses on practical aspects seeking {{to answer the following}} questions: which analgesics should be used?; how should they be given?; at what stage of the anesthetic time should they be injected? In the absence of a loco-regional technique, analgesics must be given before the end of surgery to obtain a quiet awakening. The transition in this delicate period may be facilitated by the intra-operative use of various adjuvant therapies such as ketamine, lidocaine infusion, clonidine, and magnesium, that reduce the needs for opioid and/or post-operative pain severity. All non-opioid analgesics (<b>propacetamol,</b> NSAIDs, tramadol) must be given according to their pharmacokinetic characteristics, indications and contraindications to ensure the required analgesic effect is effective at the time of awakening. If tramadol is not used, an initial dose of a long-acting opioid should be given 20 - 30 minutes before the end of surgery. Insufficient analgesia must be corrected by titrating an opioid intravenously before allowing the patient to control his/her analgesia using a PCA pump. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} approach of neonatal analgesia {{starts with the}} systematic evaluation of pain and should be followed by effective interventions, mainly based on the appropriate (i. e. safe and effective) administration of analgesics. In contrast to the more potent opioids, data on the pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of non-opioid analgesics in this specific population are still rare or even lacking. We therefore evaluated various aspects of developmental pharmacology of non-opioid analgesics (paracetamol, ibuprofen, acetylsalicyl acid) in neonates. We first performed a single dose <b>propacetamol</b> study in preterm and term neonates. Based on these preliminary findings, a repeated dose administration scheme was developed and tested and maturational aspects from preterm till teenage were documented. Although non-selective COX-inhibitors might be effective {{in the treatment of}} postoperative or inflammatory pain syndromes in neonates, potential efficacy should be balanced against the drugs' safety profile. Neonatal renal clearance strongly depends on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and GFR itself strongly depends on the vaso-dilatative of prostaglandins on the afferent arterioli. We therefore evaluated the impact of the administration of ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid on renal clearance in preterm infants and hereby used amikacin clearance as a surrogate marker. We hereby documented the negative effect of ibuprofen on glomerular filtration rate in preterm infants up to 34 weeks {{and we were able to}} show that ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid had an equal impact on the glomerular filtration rate. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{describes}} an original technique of continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block (CPSB) (Group A, 60 patients) and compares its analgesic efficacy after foot surgery with intramuscular (IM) opioids (Group B, 15 patients) and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) with morphine (Group C, 45 patients). CPSB was performed using Singelyn's landmarks. The sciatic nerve was localized with a short-beveled needle {{connected to a}} peripheral nerve stimulator. A 20 -gauge catheter was placed at the same depth as the needle with a Seldinger technique. Thirty milliliters of 1 % mepivacaine with epinephrine 1 / 200, 000 was injected and followed by a continuous infusion of 0. 125 % bupivacaine with sufentanil 0. 1 microgram/mL and clonidine 1 microgram/mL at 7 mL/h for 48 h. Postoperative analgesia (intravenous [IV] <b>propacetamol</b> [PRO] and/or IM piritramide [DIPI]) was standardized. Postoperative pain score (PPS), supplemental analgesia, and side effects were noted. CPSB was easy to perform in 55 patients (92 %). In Group A, highest and mean PPS were significantly lower, and the mean dose of PRO was reduced by 62 % and 36 % when compared with Group B and C, respectively. Only 8 % of patients required postoperative opioid in Group A compared with 91 % and 100 % in Groups B and C, respectively. No immediate or delayed complications other than postoperative technical problems (kinked or broken catheter 25 %) were noted in Group A. In conclusion, CPSB is easy to perform, safe, and a more efficient technique than parenteral opioid for providing postoperative analgesia after foot surgery...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Based on {{recovered}} metabolite ratios in urine, it {{has been}} concluded that paracetamol glucuronidation may be up-regulated upon multiple dosing. This study investigates paracetamol clearance in neonates and infants after single and multiple dosing using a population modelling approach. Methods: A population pharmacokinetic model was developed in NONMEM VI, based on paracetamol plasma concentrations from 54 preterm and term neonates and infants, and on paracetamol, paracetamol-glucuronide and paracetamol-sulphate amounts in urine from 22 of these patients. Patients received either a single intravenous <b>propacetamol</b> dose or up to 12 repeated doses. Results: Paracetamol and metabolite disposition was best described with one-compartment models. The formation clearance of paracetamol-sulphate was 1. 46 mL/min/kg 1. 4, which was about 5. 5 {{times higher than the}} formation clearance of the glucuronide of 0. 266 mL/min/kg. The renal excretion rate constants of both metabolites was estimated to be 11. 4 times higher than the excretion rate constant of unchanged paracetamol, yielding values of 0. 580 mL/min/kg. Developmental changes were best described by bodyweight in linear relationships on the distribution volumes, the formation of paracetamol-glucuronide and the unchanged excretion of paracetamol, and in an exponential relationship on the formation of paracetamol-sulphate. There was no evidence for up-regulation or other time-varying changes in any of the model parameters. Simulations with this model illustrate how paracetamol-glucuronide recovery in urine increases over time due to the slower formation of this metabolite {{and in the absence of}} up-regulation. Conclusions: Developmental changes, described by bodyweight-based functions, rather than up-regulation, explain developmental changes in paracetamol disposition in neonates and infants...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{paracetamol}} to induce structural chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo was evaluated in volunteers {{who had been}} administered a single oral dose of 3 g paracetamol, in patients who had received 2 g of <b>propacetamol</b> by intravenous infusion every 6 h for at least 7 days, and in self-poisoned patients who, for suicidal reasons, had ingested more than 15 g paracetamol. In addition to the in vivo observations, the effectiveness of paracetamol to interfere with fusorial microtubule polymerisation was assayed in vitro in order to detect a possible effect of paracetamol {{on the distribution of}} chromosomes during cell division. The negative results obtained in all those assays strongly suggest that paracetamol has no mutagenic properties in human. There was, indeed, {{no significant difference in the}} percentage of abnormal cells before and after application of paracetamol in volunteers (0. 2 % before ingestion of 3 g paracetamol, 0. 12 % after 24 h, 0. 04 % after 72 h and 0. 04 % after 168 h) and in patients (0. 5 % of abnormal cells before treatment versus 0. 44 % after intravenous infusion of a total of 28 g paracetamol). Moreover, the yield of abnormal cells was not modified in self-poisoned persons (0. 24 %), in spite of an important decrease in the mitotic index of the PHA stimulated lymphocytes. In the in vitro assay, no inhibition of microtubule polymerisation was detected with concentrations of 2. 5, 5 and 10 mM paracetamol...|$|E
