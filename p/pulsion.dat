6000|$|I {{hardly know}} what is best there: the strange and {{impressive}} little collegial church, with its romanesque atrium or narthex, its doorways covered with primitive sculpture of the richest kind, its treasure of a so-called pagan altar, embossed with fighting warriors, its three pyramidal domes, so unexpected, so sinister, which I have not met elsewhere, in church architecture; or the huge square keep, of the eleventh century, - the most cliff-like tower I remember, whose immeasurable thick- ness I did not penetrate; or the subterranean mysteries of two other less striking but not less historic dungeons, into which a terribly imperative little cicerone intro- duced us, {{with the aid of}} downward ladders, ropes, torches, warnings, extended hands; and, many, fearful anecdotes, - all in impervious darkness. These horrible prisons of Loches, at an incredible distance below the daylight, were a favorite resource of Louis XI., and were for the most part, I believe, constructed by him. One of the towers of the castle is garnished with the hooks or supports of the celebrated iron cage in which he confined the Cardinal La Balue, who survived so much longer than might have been expected this extra- ordinary mixture of seclusion and exposure. All these things form part of the castle of Loches, whose enorm- ous enceinte covers the whole of the top of the hill, and abounds in dismantled gateways, in crooked passages, in winding lanes that lead to postern doors, in long facades that look upon terraces interdicted to the visitor, who perceives with irritation that they com- mand magnificent views. These views are the property of the sub-prefect of the department, who resides at the Chateau de Loches, and who has also the enjoy- ment of a garden - a garden compressed and curtailed, as those of old castles that perch on hill-tops are apt to be - containing a horse-chestnut tree of fabulous size, a tree of a circumference so vast and so perfect that the whole population of Loches might sit in con- centric rows beneath its boughs. The gem of the place, however, is neither the big marronier, nor the collegial church, nor the mighty dungeon, nor the hideous prisons of Louis XI.; it is simply the tomb of Agnes Sorel, la belle des belles, so many years the mistress of Charles VII. She was buried, in 1450, in the collegial church, whence, {{in the beginning of the}} present century, her remains, with the monument that marks them, were transferred to one of the towers of the castle. She has always, I know not with what justice, enjoyed a fairer fame than most ladies who have occupied her position, and this fairness is expressed in the delicate statue that surmounts her tomb. It represents her lying there in lovely demureness, her hands folded with the best modesty, a little kneeling angel at either side of her head, and her feet, hidden in the folds of her decent robe, resting upon a pair of couchant lambs, innocent reminders of her name. Agnes, however, was not lamb-like, inasmuch as, according to popular tradition at least, she exerted herself sharply in favor of the ex- <b>pulsion</b> of the English from France. It is one of the suggestions of Loches that the young Charles VII., hard put to it as he was for a treasury and a capital, - [...] "le roi de Bourges," [...] he was called at Paris, - was yet a rather privileged mortal, to stand up as he does before posterity between the noble Joan and the gentille Agnes; deriving, however much more honor from one of these companions than from the other. Almost as delicate a relic of antiquity as this fascinating tomb is the exquisite oratory of Anne of Brittany, among the apartments of the castle the only chamber worthy of note. This small room, hardly larger than a closet, and forming part of the addition made to the edifice by Charles VIII., is embroidered over with the curious and remarkably decorative device of the ermine and festooned cord. The objects in themselves are not especially graceful; but the constant repetition of the figure on the walls and ceiling produces an effect of richness, in spite of the modern whitewash with which, if I remember rightly, they have been endued. The little streets of Loches wander crookedly down the hill, and are full of charming pictorial [...] "bits:" [...] an old town- gate, passing under a mediaeval tower, which is orna- mented by Gothic windows and the empty niches of statues; a meagre but delicate hotel de ville, of the Renaissance, nestling close beside it; a curious chancel- lerie of the middle of the sixteenth century, with mythological figures and a Latin inscription on the front, - both of these latter buildings being rather un- expected features of the huddled and precipitous little town. Loches has a suburb on the other side of the Indre, which we had contented ourselves with looking down at from the heights, while we wondered whether, even if it had not been getting late and our train were more accommodating, we should care to take our way across the bridge and look up that bust, in terra-cotta, of Francis I., which is the principal ornament of the Chateau de Sansac and the faubourg of Beaulieu. I think we decided that we should not; that we were already quite well enough acquainted with the nasal profile of that monarch.|$|E

Belief in the efficacy of force, in competence and in self interest, common to the majority of specialists, explains this blindness.

So our main purpose in this article will focus on the study of Bernard, the main male character of Bialot’s novel, Babel-ville, which should be considered as a good sample of what literary criticism is inclined to call black novel.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} study of Hélène Cixous' theory of écriture féminine as applied to two novels, Plus jamais l'amour éternel by Marcelle Brisson and Ana Historic by Daphne Marlatt. It also aims to {{identify}} and elaborate Cixous' concept of a 'voice-cry', developed in her theoretical essay entitled La jeune née. Essential to Cixous' theory of an écriture féminine is a feminine libidinal economy which manifests itself in both genders {{as a form of}} 'dépense', a giving or 'life-giving' force within the text. It consists of drives and <b>pulsions</b> which challenge traditional grammatical and narrative structures and disrupt the linear trajectory and univocal authority of conventional discourses. Cixous' theory of a libidinal economy is often misinterpreted {{as an example of a}} biological essentialism because it recognises the feminine body as site and source of a potent energy which feeds the Imaginary. The Imaginary, banished from the dominant masculine Symbolic, and long repressed, is deprived of space in which to express its depth and diversity. It is within écriture féminine that the difference of the other is given free range to articulate and communicate its presence, and thus the body acknowledged as a prime factor in the elaboration of difference.

40|$|The murine {{antibody}} {{response to}} Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (GZ) was analyzed in vivo and in vitro {{by focusing on}} two families of antibodies that exert distinct conformational/functional activity on the antigen. Activating antibodies [...] defined by their capacity to increase the enzymatic activity of defective GZ produced by mutant strains of E. coli [...] are detected early after secondary challenge. Inhibiting antibodies, which interfere with antibody-mediated enzyme activation, appear later and cause the abrupt fall of activating titer, a scenario suggesting either idiotype/anti-idiotype interaction or opposite <b>pulsions</b> exerted on the antigen molecule. Supporting the latter mechanism, the confrontation of mAbs of the two families produced classical competitive inhibition curves when the readout was enzyme activation, although they recognize two different epitopes of the same molecule: the activating mAb a quaternary conformation-dependent site of wild-type GZ, the inhibiting mAb a sequential determinant exposed only in denatured or in defective enzyme. The different timing of generation of these antibodies during the response may depend on a processing step necessary for unfolding of native antigen and consequent display of certain cryptic epitopes before they can trigger specific B cells. A picture emerges where {{the response to the}} various epitopes of a complex antigen is sequentially connected and where the uptake by antigen-presenting cells of antigen complexed with antibodies specific for the exposed epitopes may favor revelation of the cryptic one...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an extended}} {{study of how}} representations of violence inhabit operatic works, on a literary as well as musical level. Employing recent critical and theoretical developments in philosophy, psychoanalysis, linguistics and feminist theory, this study probes into issues surrounding gender/alterity and subject formation, {{as well as the}} aesthetics of violence within fin-de-siecle culture. The main goals of the dissertation are (1) to analyze from a philosophical and psychoanalytical point of view the notion of the feminine and its persistent conjunction with death, eroticism and music; (2) to explore various theoretical interpretations of violence within aesthetic production and the potential such violence holds for a negativity that is not only destructive but may also be considered affirmative; and (3) to offer a new interpretive approach to reading violence in opera, one that is modeled after the poststructuralist theories of the "semiotic" as developed by Julia Kristeva. The first section of the dissertation establishes the theoretical groundwork, exploring the writings of Nietzsche, Derrida, Lacan, Bronfen and Kristeva (chapters 1 and 2). An examination of expressionist poetics of negation (chapter 3) leads into the second section which comprises three case studies. Each of the operas under consideration engage issues concerning violence, representation and the feminine, and reveal three very different paths toward semiotic destabilization and negativity. "Morder, Hoffnung der Frauen, or, Overcoming the m/Other" (chapter 4) explores semiotic <b>pulsions</b> as "structural disjunction" both within Kokoschka's radical text and Hindemith's score, and critiques the appropriation of woman in the name of creative innovation.
