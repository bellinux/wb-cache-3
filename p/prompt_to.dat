5|$|He {{was handed}} his Ligue 1 debut by Bielsa {{on the opening}} day of the 2014–15 season in a 3–3 draw with Bastia. Sparagna started the match before being {{substituted}} at half-time for Brazilian Lucas Mendes with Marseille leading 2–1. He went on to make three further appearances for the senior side during the campaign, amassing a total of 73 minutes of playing time as Marseille ended the season in fourth place. At {{the end of the season}} Sparagna signed his first professional contract with l'OM, ending months of speculation linking him with a Bosman move to Premier League club Arsenal. Having lost Mathieu Flamini to Arsenal on a Bosman deal in 2008, Marseille were <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> conclude a new deal with Sparagna in order to avoid a repeat occurrence.|$|E
25|$|Pepper {{also learned}} from his days trying many cases for the Union Traction Company (Philadelphia's {{streetcar}} purveyor) that perjury is plentiful but Philadelphia's jurists, while disposed to favor plaintiffs, were nonetheless quick to detect fraud and <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> condemn it. He also found jurors sympathetic {{to anyone who has}} acted under provocation, and apt to resent the conduct of the provocateur, and proudly recounted a cross-examination he had made before Judge Mayer Sulzberger.|$|E

While the workaround is indeed possible, Microsoft has cautioned that users who perform a full installation of the operating system through this method without a genuine license for a previous version would be in violation of the Windows Vista end-user license agreement.|$|E
25|$|The Ganga Action Plan, {{which was}} taken on {{priority}} and with much enthusiasm, was delayed for two years. The expenditure was almost doubled. But {{the result was}} not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.|$|E
500|$|When routes are completed, {{documents}} are unlocked that provide {{insights into the}} game's overarching storyline. These documents can be viewed {{at any time in}} the game's archive feature, which is accessed from the title screen. After obtaining the four specific endings required to trigger it, the player is given a new <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> either [...] "fulfill the promise" [...] or live [...] "a normal life" [...] upon starting a new game. Choosing to live a normal life will result in a normal playthrough, while choosing to fulfill the promise locks the player into the true route or scenario Bad Boys Love, or BBL (also known as Hurtful Boyfriend), which explores the full extent of the underlying plot alluded to by the documents and various points of foreshadowing in the dating simulation portion of the game. If the player chooses to fulfill the promise, aside from several dream sequences, gameplay at first appears to continue normally until the in-game date is 2 September. The player's perspective then switches from the protagonist to the protagonist's best friend, and the events of the scenario begin regardless of any other choices made by the player up to that point. If the player obtains all other possible endings prior to starting Bad Boys Love, an extended epilogue plays after the game's credits upon completion of the scenario. In a departure from the generally lighthearted romantic routes, Bad Boys Love is presented as a murder mystery psychological thriller, and is significantly longer than any other route in Hatoful Boyfriend, making up most of the game's actual length.|$|E

2500|$|A prompt is a cue {{that is used}} to {{encourage}} a desired response from an individual. Prompts are often categorized into a prompt hierarchy from most intrusive to least intrusive, although there is some controversy about what is considered most intrusive, those that are physically intrusive or those that are hardest <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> fade (e.g.,verbal). In order to minimize errors and ensure a high level of success during learning, prompts are given in a most-to-least sequence and faded systematically. During this process, prompts are faded quickly as possible so that the learner does not come to depend on them and eventually behaves appropriately without prompting.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} {{theological}} controversies, Richey's great {{devotion to the}} priesthood and to ministry was acclaimed by many. William Francis Brand said [...] "Your clergy will tell you that, while <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> spare them, he never spared himself. I myself have seen him later than two o'clock taking his first morsel of food after constant labour from six in the morning,—a labour so wearying to the body through the spirit; and this {{at a time when}} the disease which cut short his days gave him little rest in sleep. And yet his complaint was that he neglected duties." [...] Elsewhere he wrote of Richey as a man of [...] "a lovely spirit, holy, self-sacrificing, full of labors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similar to its predecessors, {{the player}} can {{interact}} with characters in Mass Effect: Andromeda using a radial command menu where the player's dialogue options depend on wheel direction. Around the wheel are {{four types of}} responses that shape each conversation: emotional, logical, professional, and casual. In general, conversations are based on agreeing or disagreeing with participants. During some conversations, the player is prompted with an [...] "Impulse Action" [...] that offers an additional choice to what {{is available on the}} dialogue wheel. For example, an on-screen <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> [...] "shoot" [...] might appear and be momentarily selectable. By conversing with non-player characters, Ryder can develop friendships and, in some cases, romantic relationships with them over time. During both dialogue and quest sequences, the player is sometimes tasked with making moral decisions that do not have a clear good/bad distinction but are intended to be more nuanced, marking a departure from the Paragon/Renegade morality system of prior titles in the series.|$|E

2500|$|Men {{may live}} {{together}} in society with some tolerable degree of security, {{though there is no}} civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to {{examine the effect of}} prompting self-regulation, an intervention designed to improve learning from technology-delivered instruction. In Study 1, trainees who were <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> self-regulate gradually improved their declarative and procedural knowledge over time, relative to the other conditions, whereas test scores declined over time for trainees who were not <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> self-regulate. In Study 2, basic performance remained stable over time and strategic performance improved over time for trainees who were <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> self-regulate, relative to the other conditions, whereas performance declined over time for trainees who were not <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> self-regulate. Trainees’ cognitive ability moderated the effect of the prompts on basic performance and task specific self-efficacy moderated the effect of the prompts on strategic performance. Prompting self-regulation resulted in stronger performance gains over time for trainees with higher ability or higher self-efficacy. These results demonstrate prompting self-regulation improved performance over time, relative to the other conditions, in both online, work-related training and laboratory settings. The results are consistent with theory suggesting self-regulation is a dynamic process that has a gradual effect on performance and highlight the importance of using a within-subjects design in self-regulation research...|$|R
