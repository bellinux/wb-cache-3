40|$|In {{line with}} the global trend of urbanisation, large {{population}} are staying in urban areas as compared to rural. However, urban area /region is always related to higher air pollution level as compared to less developed area/region. The major contributors of air pollution are mobile sources (transportation) and stationary sources (e. g. industry and power plant). Thus, the issue of air pollution is potentially caused by human choices and activities, and potentially affecting the human health. Therefore, {{the relationship between the}} urban activities (land use coverage/distribution) and air quality level should be well understood. It helps the urban managers, planners and all parties in constructing healthier urban policies. A study of air quality and the relationship with urban land uses was carried out in Malaysia�s urban growth region of Klang-Shah Alam-Petaling Jaya. Air quality data was analysed in Air Pollution Index (API) with the classification of good, moderate, unhealthy, very unhealthy and hazardous levels. The urban land uses were mainly divided into two categories, i. e. <b>pollution-prone</b> land uses (transportation, industrial, and infrastructure), and green land uses. This study found that urban area with higher coverage of transportation, industrial and infrastructure land uses are potentially unhealthier in term of the air quality than the area with less coverage of these land uses. Strategic proposal was discussed in {{line with the}} findings. ...|$|E
40|$|The morphology, mixing {{state and}} {{hematite}} content of polluted mineral dust {{are not well}} accounted in the optical models and this leads to uncertainty in the radiative forcing estimation. In the present study, based on the morphological and mineralogical characterisation of polluted dust, the three-sphere, two-sphere and two-spheroid model shapes are considered. The optical properties of the above model shapes are computed using Discrete Dipole Approximation code. The single scattering albedo, &#x 03 C 9; 0, was found to vary depending on hematite content (0 &#x 2013; 6 %) and model shape. For the two-sphere BC-mineral dust system, hematite {{was found to be}} a dominating absorber compared to that of black carbon as the RBC/R dust decreases. The &#x 03 C 9; 0 of the polluted dust system is larger if polluted dust is considered as pure dust spheroid (with 4 % hematite) while smaller value is observed for Q ext. Among all the systems, the &#x 03 C 9; 0 of BCBCD (two BC spheres attached to one dust sphere) system showed the maximum departure (40 and 35 % for polluted dust with 0 and 6 % hematite, respectively) from that of pure dust spheroid with 0 and 6 % hematite. For the Asian region (<b>pollution-prone</b> zone), the modelled polluted dust optics will help to trace the optical and radiative properties of dust...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{industrialisation}} {{and recent}} haze conditions caused by forest fires in Indonesia have heightened awareness among Singaporeans {{of the need}} to maintain a cleaner and safer environment. Yet the discretion of Singapore companies to make environmental disclosures in the annual reports results in significant variations in the extent and types of disclosures. Previous Singapore studies, already quite limited, addressed corporate social responsibility and social disclosures in general. This study therefore investigates the relationship between environmental disclosures and financial performance using a sample of potentially polluting publicly-listed companies in Singapore. The issue is examined from several perspectives: (a) if there is any difference in financial performance between disclosing and non-disclosing companies of environmental information, (b) whether extent of environmental disclosure can be linked to financial performance, and (c) if there is any impact of prior financial performance on subsequent environmental disclosures, and vice versa. Results showed that a positive link existed although the evidence was less strong for the impact of environmental disclosures on subsequent financial performance. All null hypotheses were rejected. This finding should encourage Singapore companies to increase the content of their environmental reporting in annual reports. This is important in order to expose <b>pollution-prone</b> companies to a wider spectrum of stakeholders on their role to achieve a cleaner and greener environment. The annual report is the most easily accessible source in Singapore to convey corporate activities and intentions, {{in the absence of any}} non-profit organisations like in the United States which regularly publish information on the social performance of companies...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{technology}} {{is of great}} industrial interest, as in many cases it has successfully replaced traditional, <b>pollution-prone</b> and energy consuming separation processes. Furthermore, a hybrid process combining chemical reactions and membrane separation, conventionally termed as "membrane reactor", has attracted more and more attention due to the potential improvements achieved by overcoming chemical equilibrium limitations, by enhancing the reaction kinetics, or by in-situ purification, etc. To design membrane reactors, one needs methods to analyse the feasibility of membranes for a considered reaction system; despite its increasing importance, however, the systematic analysis of membrane reactors has been addressed only to a small extent. Therefore, our research aims at evaluating membrane diffusion effects on the feasible products. In this work, the model equations for a batch membrane reactor (as Fig. 1) has been developed to {{study the effects of}} membrane diffusion. With a certain heating policy, the kinetic effect of chemical reaction can be characterized by a single parameter, the Damköhler number Da. An isobaric gas permeation process is considered here so that direct comparison with reactive distillation [1, 2] can explicitly show the effects of incorporating membranes. An example of technical relevance, the effect of a Knudsen membrane on the cyclisation reaction of 1, 4 -Butanediol, is adopted to illustrate the utility of the model. The diagrams (in the poster) show that both chemical reaction and membrane diffusion could result in the appearance or elimination of singular points. This implies: for a considered reaction, different feasible products are attainable by utilizing suitable membranes. For the singularity analysis of reactive membrane separation processes, we propose a new set of transformed composition variables in analogy to the transformation first introduced by Barbosa et al [3]. This new set of transformed composition variables can be applied to equilibrium-controlled processes, as well as to flux-controlled processes. According to the proposed transformation, a hypothesis concerning singular points in membrane reactors is consequently inferred. The hypothesis can give the potential singular point curves [4], which provide more insight into the effects of membrane diffusion (cf. Fig. 2, extracted from the poster). Furthermore, the singular points in membrane processes can be denoted as "arheotrope", because they are flux-controlled, while the well-known "azeotropes" are fully equilibrium-controlled ones. Finally, it is worth while notifying that the proposed model and hypothesis are generally valid not only for membranes of veritable bodies, but also for reactive stripping, where an inert gas acts {{in the same way as}} a membrane [6]; or for reactive distillation affected by interfacial mass transfer.
