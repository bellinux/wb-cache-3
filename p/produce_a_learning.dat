40|$|Rats with {{complete}} spinal transections {{are capable of}} acquiring a simple instrumentally trained response. If rats receive shock to one hindlimb when the limb is extended (controllable shock), the spinal cord will learn to hold the leg in a flexed position that minimizes shock exposure. If shock is delivered irrespective of leg position, subjects do not exhibit an increase in flexion duration and subsequently fail to learn when tested with controllable shock (learning deficit). Just 6 min of variable intermittent shock <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> deficit that lasts 24 hrs. Evidence suggests that the neural mechanisms underlying the learning deficit {{may be related to}} those involved in other instances of spinal plasticity (e. g., wind-up, long-term potentiation).

40|$|Prior {{work has}} shown that spinal neurons are capable of discriminating between {{temporally}} regular and temporally irregular stimulation. These effects have been observed using an in vivo assay of spinal plasticity based on <b>an</b> instrumental <b>learning</b> task, in which response-contingent leg shock <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> increase in flexion duration. Exposure to temporally regular stimulation (fixed spaced stimulation; FT) promotes learning, and temporally irregular stimulation <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> deficit. The experiments in this dissertation were designed to test other properties of fixed spaced shock that promote spinal plasticity and the structure responsible for the FT effect. Experiment 1 focused on the minimum number of stimulations necessary to re-establish the capacity to <b>learn</b> (<b>a</b> component of the ?FT effect?), finding that 180 - 360 shocks <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> deficit and that additional training (540 - 900 shocks) allowed learning. Experiment 2 found that shock number, not duration of exposure determined whether the FT effect emerged. Experiment 3 investigated if the FT effect emerges after shock was presented in two sessions separated by 24 hrs, and showed that two bouts of 360 shocks yielded the FT effect. Further, the initial bout of fixed spaced shock had a long-term benefit (Experiment 4). The results of Experiment 5 suggested that omitting shocks from a train of FT stimulation has {{little effect on the}} benefit of fixed spaced shock treatment. Experiment 6 replicated this observation, showing that randomly deleting half of the shocks (from a 720 FT shock series) had no effect on learning. Further, this schedule also induces a lasting protective effect, blocking the learning deficit produced by variable spaced shock (Experiment 7). To explore whether a central system or a peripheral filter mediates the FT effect, Experiment 8 challenged spinal neurons by phase shifting the relation between fixed spaced stimulation applied to two dermatomes. The FT effect only emerged when stimuli occurred in an alternating pattern across dermatomes, implying regularity is abstracted by a central system. Experiment 9 surgically isolated central pattern generator (L 1 -L 2) from the portion of the spinal cord that mediates instrumental learning (L 4 -S 2), finding that disrupting the connections between these two regions eliminated the FT effect...|$|R
