25|$|Several {{bird species}} thrive on Niʻihau. The largest lakes {{on the island}} are Hālaliʻi Lake, Halulu Lake and Nonopapa Lake.

Consequently, a real understanding of health sector change will require a recognition that different theoretical approaches will be more (or less) appropriate in some circumstances than in others...|$|R
