40|$|In {{addition}} to their direct effects on crop production through competition and allelopathy, weeds can serve as reservoirs of other pests including <b>plant-parasitic</b> <b>nematodes,</b> resulting indirectly in yield loss.

Two organic farms and two conventional farming systems were visited.

50|$|So far, {{two large}} {{families}} of expansin genes {{have been discovered}} in plants, named alpha-expansins (given the gene symbol EXPA) and beta-expansins (EXPB). Both families of expansins {{have been identified in}} a wide range of land plants, from angiosperms and gymnosperms to ferns and mosses. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains around 26 different α-expansin genes and 6 β-expansin genes. A subset of β-expansins has evolved a special role in grass pollen, where they are known as group 1 grass pollen allergens. Plants also have a small set of expansin-like genes (named EXLA and EXLB) whose function has not been established. Some proteins in bacteria and fungi are known to have distant sequence similarity to plant expansins. Strong evidence that at least some of these sequences are indeed expansins came in 2008 when the crystal structure of the YOAJ protein from a bacterium (Bacillus subtilis) was shown to be very similar to the structure of plant expansins, despite the low sequence similarity. This study also noted that proteins related to YOAJ were found in diverse species of plant pathogenic bacteria, but not in related bacteria that did not attack or colonize plants, thus suggesting that these bacterial expansins have a role in plant-microbe interactions.Some animals, such as Globodera rostochiensis, a <b>plant-parasitic</b> <b>nematode,</b> can produce a functional expansin which uses it to loosen cell walls when invading its host plant.|$|E
