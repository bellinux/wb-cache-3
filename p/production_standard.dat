5|$|Announcing {{plans for}} the future of the British {{military}} on 21 July 2004, the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 aircraft, and suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice. PA02, the second development MRA4, achieved its first flight in December 2004 and was used to test elements of the mission system and the air vehicle. BAE Systems received a contract worth £1.1 billion for 12 MRA4s on 18 July 2006; three were to be development aircraft and nine more converted to <b>production</b> <b>standard.</b> The Nimrod MRA4 successfully released the Sting Ray torpedo for the first time on 30 July 2007.|$|E
5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, the issuing of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) did not {{prove to be}} the {{opportunity}} as envisioned by Hawker, as NBMR-3 sought performance characteristics of which the P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to be developed to meet in its current form either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 <b>production</b> <b>standard</b> P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, the Romanian Air Force {{decided to}} enhance the combat {{capabilities}} of the IAR 330L, making it a universal anti-tank and support helicopter. At that time, Romania started to cooperate with Israel on some military programs. The Israeli company Elbit Systems was chosen, and in September 1995 the Romanian Air Force signed a contract to upgrade 24 helicopters with the SOCAT system (Sistem Optronic de Cercetare și Anti-Tanc). The first IAR 330L SOCAT was flown on 26 May 1998, from IAR's airfield in Ghimbav, near Brașov. On 23 October 1999, the second prototype flew. The first IAR 330L SOCAT was delivered to a combat unit in 2001. In all, 25 SOCATs were made, including the prototype, rebuilt to <b>production</b> <b>standard</b> in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Under such {{demands for}} the aircraft, {{in order that}} {{production}} shortcomings could be better addressed, along with the parallel pressure that Hawker was facing {{on the development of}} another aircraft, the newer Hunter, it was decided that production would be transferred to a new assembly line ran by Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft, which were a part of the Hawker group, at Coventry. Prior to the transfer, a total of 35 Sea Hawk F1, the initial <b>production</b> <b>standard,</b> were completed at Kingston. On 14 November 1951, the first production Sea Hawk F1, WF143, conducted its maiden flight. It possessed a 39ft (12m) wingspan and a tailplane of increased area. The first Coventry-built Sea Hawk F1 made its first flight prior to the end of 1953; a total of 60 would be produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} engine nacelles incorporated {{thrust reversers}} {{taken from the}} 727 outboard nacelles. They proved to be relatively ineffective and tended to lift the aircraft up off the runway when deployed. This reduced the downforce on the main wheels thereby reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} wheel brakes. In 1968, an improvement to the thrust reversal system was introduced. A 48-inch tailpipe extension was added and new, target-style, thrust reversers were incorporated. The thrust reverser doors were set 35 degrees away from the vertical to allow the exhaust to be deflected inboard and over the wings and outboard and under the wings. The improvement became standard on all aircraft after March 1969, and a retrofit was provided for active aircraft. Boeing fixed the drag issue by introducing new longer nacelle/wing fairings, and improved the airflow over the flaps and slats. The production line also introduced an improvement to the flap system, allowing increased use during takeoff and landing. All these changes gave the aircraft a boost to payload and range, and improved short-field performance. In May 1971, after aircraft #135, all improvements, including more powerful engines and a greater fuel capacity, were incorporated into the 737-200, giving it a 15% increase in payload and range over the original -200s. This became known as the 737-200 Advanced, which became the <b>production</b> <b>standard</b> in June 1971.|$|E

500|$|In August 1974, {{the first}} RB.199 powered flight of a {{prototype}} Tornado occurred; the engine completed its qualification tests in late 1978. The final <b>production</b> <b>standard</b> engine met both reliability and performance standards, though the development cost had been higher than predicted, {{in part due}} to the ambitious performance requirements. At the time of the Tornado's introduction to service, the turbine blades of the engine suffered from a shorter life span than desired, which was rectified by the implementation of design revisions upon early-production engines. Several uprated engines were developed and used on both the majority of Tornado ADVs and Germany's Tornado ECRs. The DECU (Digital Engine Control Unit) is the current engine control unit for RB 199 engines superseding the analogue MECU (Main Engine Control Unit) also known as CUE.|$|E
