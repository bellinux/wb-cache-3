Comparison of the physical properties of NH3 with those of water shows NH3 has the lower melting point, boiling <b>point,</b> <b>density,</b> viscosity, dielectric constant and electrical conductivity; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH3 and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH3 molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each H2O molecule.

40|$|Finding {{the optimal}} number of realizations to {{represent}} the model uncertainty when applying stochastic approaches is still a relevant question in geostatistics. The essence of the method is to visualize the realizations in a suitably constructed attribute space. To construct this space, the static connectivity metrics of the realizations were used. Within this framework, {{the creation of new}} realizations can be regarded as a sampling process, in which each new stochastic image is the equivalent of a new sampling point in the attribute space. The sampling process begins with the first few realizations appearing in a dispersed manner in random parts of the attribute space. The addition of more realizations causes the gradual emergence of higher <b>point</b> <b>densities,</b> which in the end, results in a point structure where most of the points are located in areas of high <b>point</b> <b>densities</b> with areas of low <b>point</b> <b>densities</b> surrounding them. High <b>point</b> <b>densities</b> represent typical realizations showing very similar connectivity characteristics, whereas low <b>point</b> <b>densities</b> correspond to atypical realizations with stronger deviations from the bulk. In this sense, reaching the optimal number of realizations is the equivalent of reaching a state in the sampling process where high- and low <b>point</b> <b>densities</b> are present at the same time, yet high <b>point</b> <b>densities</b> do not dominate the overall structure of the attribute space, as they also reflect the redundancy of the information content. This desired structure is strongly analogous to the complete spatial randomness of spatial point processes, where the points are neither dispersed nor aggregated in space. Based on this analogy, the normalized version of Ripley’s K-function and the L-function for the spatial inhomogeneous Poisson point process was applied to find the optimal number of realizations. The method is illustrated on a computed tomography slice and on the real-life data of the Tisza- 2 reservoir...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Micro aerial {{vehicles}} (MAVs) pose specific {{constraints on}} on-board sensing, mainly limited payload and limited processing power. For accurate 3 D mapping even in GPS denied environments, we have de-signed a light-weight 3 D laser scanner {{specifically for the}} application on MAVs. Similar to other custom-built 3 D laser scanners composed of a rotating 2 D laser range finder, it exhibits different <b>point</b> <b>densities</b> within and between individual scan lines. When rotated fast, such non-uniform <b>point</b> <b>densities</b> influence neighborhood searches which in turn may neg-atively affect local feature estimation and scan registration. We present a complete pipeline for 3 D mapping including pair-wise registration and global alignment of 3 D scans acquired in-flight. For registration, we ex-tend a state-of-the-art registration algorithm to include topological infor-mation from approximate surface reconstructions. For global alignment, we use a graph-based approach making use of the same error metric and iteratively refine the complete vehicle trajectory. In experiments, we show that our approach can compensate for the effects caused by dif-ferent <b>point</b> <b>densities</b> up to very low angular resolutions {{and that we can}} build accurate and consistent 3 D maps in-flight with a micro aerial vehicle. ...|$|R

50|$|With this information, the {{percentage}} of access to water in an area is estimated, and first indicator of access {{can be defined as}} Improved Community Water <b>Point</b> <b>Density</b> (ICWPD), which is equal to the number of ICWP per 1,000 inhabitants. A certain area would have access if its density of water points per 1,000 inhabitants is above the national threshold, and percentage of people not served in an area would be proportional to the lack of water points available compared to that threshold. However, to further improve ICWP indicator is simple since information on functionality for each water point is also collected during the survey. Non-functionality is an important obstacle to access to rural water supply, and in sub-Saharan Africa averages around 35%. Consequently, Functional Community Water <b>Point</b> <b>Density</b> (FCWPD) can be used as more accurate access indicator.

50|$|In {{population}} ecology and economics, {{maximum sustainable yield}} or MSY is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) {{that can be taken}} from a species' stock over an indefinite period. Fundamental to the notion of sustainable harvest, the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely. Under the assumption of logistic growth, resource limitation does not constrain individuals’ reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small. At intermediate population densities, also represented by half the carrying capacity, individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate. At this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals. Above this <b>point,</b> <b>density</b> dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity. At this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield.|$|E

The objectives of this thesis are to calculate <b>point</b> <b>density,</b> to assess MMS laser scanner configuration and hardware settings and to benchmark a selection of MMSs in terms of their <b>point</b> <b>density.</b> The calculation methods involve a combination of algorithms applying 3 D surface normals and 2 D geometric formulae and outputs profile angle, profile spacing, point spacing and <b>point</b> <b>density.</b> Each of these elements are a major factor in calculating <b>point</b> <b>density</b> on arbitrary objects, such as road signs, poles or buildings - all important features in asset management surveys.
