5|$|As {{a public}} intellectual, Said was a {{controversial}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council, because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples. Said advocated {{the establishment of a}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, including the right of return to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the status quo as the remit of the public intellectual who has “to sift, to judge, to criticize, to choose, so that choice and agency return to the individual” man and woman.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{from among}} the Palestinian {{refugees}} who fled or were expelled from their villages {{as a result of}} the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in the mid-1950s the fedayeen began mounting cross-border operations into Israel from Syria, Egypt and Jordan. The earliest infiltrations were often to access the lands agricultural products they had lost {{as a result of the}} war, or to attack Israeli military, and sometimes civilian targets. The Gaza Strip, the sole territory of the All-Palestine Protectorate—an <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> declared in October 1948, became the focal point of the Palestinian fedayeen activity. Fedayeen attacks were directed on Gaza and Sinai borders with Israel, and as a result Israel undertook retaliatory actions, targeting the fedayeen that also often targeted the citizens of their host countries, which in turn provoked more attacks.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
5000|$|Roberts was {{for many}} years a {{supporter}} of Israel but he has increasingly criticized Israeli policies and expressed sympathy for the plight of <b>Palestinians,</b> <b>stating</b> that he now views them as [...] "more sinned against than sinning".|$|R
5000|$|The PSM has {{not taken}} any policy stances for {{adoption}} by the Palestinian people, and therefore refuses to denounce terrorism by <b>Palestinians,</b> <b>stating</b> that [...] "as a solidarity movement, {{it is not our}} place to dictate the strategies or tactics adopted by the Palestinian people in their struggle for liberation." ...|$|R
2500|$|... : Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu {{defended the}} {{military}} actions {{that resulted in}} the deaths, maintaining that Hamas was using the area to launch attacks against Israel. He blamed the <b>Palestinians,</b> <b>stating,</b> [...] "We asked in every way for the civilian population to leave, Hamas told them not to so they could be used as human shields".|$|R
5|$|Arafat {{was born}} to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where {{he spent most of}} his youth and studied at the University of King Fuad I. While a student, he embraced Arab {{nationalist}} and anti-Zionist ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Returning to Cairo, he served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956. In the latter part of the 1950s he co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organisation seeking the disestablishment of Israel and its replacement with a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state.</b> Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. In the latter part of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the PLO and in 1969 was elected chair of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon. There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions.|$|E

25|$|Based on the Israeli {{definition}} of the West Bank, Barak offered to form a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> initially on 73% of the West Bank (that is, 27% less than the Green Line borders) and 100% of the Gaza Strip. In 10–25 years, the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> would expand {{to a maximum of}} 92% of the West Bank (91 percent of the West Bank and 1 percent from a land swap). From the Palestinian perspective this equated to an offer of a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> on a maximum of 86% of the West Bank.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, the Palestinian Authority {{applied for}} {{admission}} as a United Nations non-member state, which requires only a {{vote by the}} United Nations General Assembly. Hamas also backed the motion. The draft resolution was passed on November 29, 2012 {{by a vote of}} 138 to 9, with 41 abstentions. Regardless of the UN recognition, as of this writing, no <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> exists except on a symbolic level. Israel indicated that an actual, real-world <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> can only come into existence if Palestinians succeed in negotiating peace with Israel.|$|E
50|$|The Security Council {{affirmed the}} vision of Israeli and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>states</b> {{existing}} {{side by side with}} secure and recognised borders. It expressed concern at events that had taken place since September 2000 in the region and the need for all {{to ensure the safety of}} civilians and respect for international humanitarian law. The Council welcomed efforts by the United States, Russia, European Union, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and others to bring about a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.|$|R
5000|$|Chávez {{broke off}} {{diplomatic}} ties and expelled the Israeli ambassador {{and his staff}} after the 2008-09 Gaza War which left around 1,200 Palestinians dead and over 5000 wounded. The Israeli government retaliated by expelling Venezuelan diplomats from the country. In April 2009 Venezuela officially recognised {{the existence of the}} State of Palestine and in September repeated an accusation that Israel was guilty of committing genocide against the <b>Palestinians</b> <b>stating</b> that [...] "The question is not whether the Israelis want to exterminate the Palestinians. They're doing it openly".|$|R

25|$|On May 6, 2009, Al-Quds al-Arabi, the London-based Arabic {{language}} daily, {{reported that}} as per {{a request from}} U.S. President Barack Obama the Arab League is currently {{in the process of}} revising the initiative in an effort to encourage Israel to agree to it. The new revisions include a demilitarization of the future <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> as well as a forfeiture of the Palestinian right of return to Israel proper. According to the revisions, a portion of the refugees would be relocated to the future <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state,</b> and the rest would be naturalized in other Arab countries.|$|E
25|$|Proposed in the Fall of 2000 {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the Camp David talks, The Clinton Parameters included a plan on which the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>State</b> was to include 94-96% of the West Bank, and around 80% of the settlers were to become under Israeli sovereignty, and in exchange for that, Israel would concede some territory (so called 'Territory Exchange' or 'Land Swap') within the Green Line (1967 borders). The swap would consist of 1–3% of Israeli territory, such that the final borders of the West Bank part of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> would include 97% of the land of the original borders.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues surrounding this peace process is whether the Palestinian Authority in fact met its obligations to promote tolerance. There is specific evidence that the Palestinian Authority actively funded and supported many terrorist activities and groups. <b>Palestinians</b> <b>stated</b> that any terrorist acts stemmed from Israel not having conceded enough land and political power to win support among ordinary <b>Palestinians.</b> Israelis <b>stated</b> that these acts of terrorism were because the Palestinian Authority openly encouraged and supported incitement against Israel, and terrorism. There was increasing disagreement and debate among Israelis {{about the amount of}} positive results and benefits produced by the Oslo process. Supporters said it was producing advances leading to a viable Palestinian society which would promote genuine acceptance of Israel. Opponents said that concessions were merely emboldening extremist elements to commit more violence in order to win further concessions, without providing any real acceptance, benefits, goodwill, or reconciliation for Israel in return.|$|R
50|$|Metzad was {{established}} in 1984 by immigrants from the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa and France. The settlement {{was built on the}} site of a Nahal paramilitary outpost called Nahal Asfar established in 1983, and which <b>Palestinians</b> <b>state</b> was confiscated from the village of Ash-Shuyukh. The first structures on Metzad were erected by the Israel Defense Forces's civil corps of engineers. They were handed over for civilian use {{at the time of the}} creation of Metzad in 1984. Initially, the road up to the settlement was unpaved, water was brought by truck, and electricity was sporadically provided by a generator.|$|R

25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether or not McCain {{supports}} the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, although McCain has courted the support of individuals and groups that {{are opposed to the}} creation of a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2002, former {{representative}} of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Sari Nusseibeh proposed a settlement between Israel and Palestine which would grant Palestinians a right of return to a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state,</b> but not to Israel. The proposal failed.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Sharon {{left the}} Likud {{and formed a}} new party called Kadima, which {{accepted}} that the peace process would lead to creation of a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state.</b> He was joined by many leading figures from both Likud and Labour.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in 1993 {{with the}} Oslo peace process, Israel recognizes [...] "the PLO as the {{representative}} of the Palestinian people", though Israel does not recognize the State of Palestine. In return, it was agreed that Palestinians would promote peaceful co-existence, renounce violence and promote recognition of Israel among their own people. Despite Yasser Arafat's official renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel, some Palestinian groups continue to practice and advocate violence against civilians and do not recognize Israel as a legitimate political entity. <b>Palestinians</b> <b>state</b> that their ability to spread acceptance of Israel was greatly hampered by Israeli restrictions on Palestinian political freedoms, economic freedoms, civil liberties, and quality of life.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2010, Biden {{served as}} the keynote speaker at the General Assembly (GA) of Jewish Federations of North America, where he stated that “This {{government}} will stand with Israel. It’s in our own self-interest, beyond it being an absolute moral necessity.” He also renewed his support for peace talks with the <b>Palestinians,</b> <b>stating</b> that “There {{is no substitute for}} direct face-to-face negotiations leading eventually to states for two people secured - the Jewish State of Israel and the viable independent state of Palestine. That is the only path to the Israeli people’s decades-long quest for security, and the only path to the Palestinian people’s legitimate aspirations for nationhood.” ...|$|R

25|$|European Union {{foreign ministers}} welcomed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's {{conditional}} endorsement {{of a future}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> in June 2009, but {{said it was not}} enough to raise EU-Israel ties to a higher level and questioned the conditions set for backing a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> and Netanyahu's defense of Jewish settlements. In December 2010, a group of 26 former EU statesmen, including former Foreign Affairs Chief Javier Solana, submitted a written petition calling for the EU to ban imports of settlement products, force Israel to pay the majority of aid required by the Palestinians, link an upgrade in diplomatic relations to a settlement freeze, and send a high-level delegation to east Jerusalem to support Palestinian claims to sovereignty. The request was rebuffed by Foreign Affairs Chief Catherine Ashton.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Palestinian</b> Authority <b>stated</b> that it [...] "absolutely condemns the attack", but {{laid the}} blame {{at the feet}} of Israeli prime {{minister}} Ariel Sharon, for continuing what it called Israel's policy [...] "of destruction, killing and collective punishment".|$|R

5|$|In March 2008, a {{coalition}} of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the <b>Palestinians</b> <b>stated</b> that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|R
