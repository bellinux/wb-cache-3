It {{originates}} in the Krkonoše Mountains of northwestern Czech Republic before traversing Bohemia (Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, 110 km northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is 1, 094 km. The Elbe’s major tributaries are the Vltava (German: Moldau), Saale, Havel, Mulde, SchwarzeElster, and Ohre rivers. The Elbe River basin, comprising the Elbe and its tributaries, has a catchment area of 148, 268 km 2, the fourth largest in Europe. The basin spans four countries, with its largest parts in Germany (65. 5 %) and the Czech Republic (33. 7 %). Much smaller parts lie in Austria (0. 6 %) and Poland (0. 2 %). The basin is inhabited by 24. 5 million people (1). Organochlorine pesticides are man-made organics chemicals.

40|$|The {{qualitative}} and quantitative characteristics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and related humic acids (HAs) extracted from the soils of field plots were investigated after 8 years of annual paddy (Oryza sativa L.) and upland maize (Zea mays L.) rotation with various fertilizations. Seven fertilization treatments were selected: Ck (no inputs); Chem (chemical fertilizer of NPK); Comp (swine compost); Comp + 33 % of Chem N rate; Comp + 67 % of Chem N rate; GM (legume green manure) + 33 % of Chem N rate; and peat + 33 % of Chem N rate. Organic and inorganic nitrogen inputs of six treatments were equivalent with respect of nitrogen content, but Comp, GM, and peat treatments were complemented with various amounts of inorganic N. After harvest of the eighth paddy crop, surface soil samples collected from the plots were subjected to soil characterizations and extraction of humic substances, which were used for chemical, spectroscopic (FTIR, C- 13 NMR, ESR, X-ray diffractometry), delta C- 13, and C- 14 dating analyses. The yields of HAs extracted from the seven treatments were significantly different. Treatment containing <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> such as the peat + 33 % N treatment increased the humification process in topsoils and produced higher yield of HA. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that fertilization treatments changed the functional groups, alkyl C, crystalline characteristics, and delta C- 13 ratios of HAs and turnover rate of SOC considerably. The SOC of the peat + 33 % N treatment had the highest mean residence time of 3100 years. Various fertilizer treatments are correlated with turnover rate of SOC and related HAs, which are associated with concerned carbon sequestration as well as mitigation of CO 2 emission in the soil environment...|$|E

The treatment efficiency of constructed mangrove wetland was comparable to, or higher than, the conventional constructed wetland. An immobilized microalgal system was developed to remove toxic persistent pollutants from industrial wastewater. Pollutant-resistant microalgal species were selected for culture in domestic wastewater. The harvested biomass was immobilized in alginate beads.

Heavy {{metal and}} {{organochlorine}} (OC) concentrations, including organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs), were determined in arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryi) from three {{sites in the}} Brooks Range of northern Alaska in 1991 – 93. Heavy metals were present in most squirrel livers collected, with concentrations of trace elements (As, Cd, Hg, Ni, and Pb) averaging below 1 µg/g wet weight. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), p,p'-DDE, gamma hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH), trans-nonachlor, and PCBs 138, 153, and 170 were the most frequently detected OCs in fat and liver. Average concentrations of individual OC analytes were below 20 ng/g wet weight in liver and below 15 ng/g wet weight in fat. Rank correlations indicate that concentrations of heavy metals and of OCs accumulate in concert with one another (As, Cd, Cu, and Zn; PCBs 138, 170, and 180).

40|$|We have {{developed}} a model which successfully reconstructs the lifetime polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) - 101 burden of the UK population for individuals born between 1920 and 1980. It not only follows burdens and clearance of <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> contaminants throughout a human lifetime — taking changes in age and body composition into account — but also, importantly, incorporates changing environmental concentrations of the compound of interest. Predicted results agree well with available measured lipid concentrations in human tissues. Its unique construction takes into account both changing environmental concentrations of PCBs in principal food groups and changing dietary habits during the time period. Because environmental burdens of <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> contaminants have changed over the last 60 years, residues in food will also have mirrored this change. Critically in this respect, {{the year in which}} an individual was born determines the shape and magnitude of their exposure profile for a given compound.
