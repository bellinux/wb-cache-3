The {{purpose is to}} {{develop an understanding of}} what <b>project</b> <b>maturity</b> is and to investigate the level of <b>project</b> <b>maturity</b> in organisations today. The hypothesis is that <b>project</b> <b>maturity</b> develops through a maturity ladder where the ladder steps are proposed to be project management, program management, and portfolio management. Maturity itself is measured along three dimensions. They are knowledge (capability to carry out different tasks), attitudes (willingness to carry them out), and actions (actually doing them). The different dimensions of maturity are further divided into sub-concepts, which should provide a good understanding of the <b>project</b> <b>maturity</b> of an organisation. A questionnaire is developed based on a preliminary understanding of <b>project</b> <b>maturity,</b> and an initial survey has been conducted. The survey gives some support to the ladder construct, and shows that attitudes and knowledge are stronger than the actions taken. Further work on the questionnaire and surveys are proposed...|$|E

The investigation has been narrowed to the author’s own division of work within the banking organisation {{in order to help}} with devising means to assist with the project management office. This project management office was setup in late 2009 and is thus a relatively new addition to the division. This banking sector project office has never been reviewed in terms of its <b>project</b> management <b>maturity.</b> An understanding of the operational aspects of the banking sector project management office is required in order to ascertain the level of <b>project</b> management <b>maturity.</b> A brief description is given, within this document, of the banking sector project office team, as well as the associated roles and responsibilities. An overview is also given with regards to the project sizes, project lifecycles, as well as the required documentation. There are various methods available to determine the <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> level, such as: Capability Maturity Model Integration, Portfolio, Programme and <b>Project</b> Management <b>Maturity</b> Model, and Kerzner <b>Project</b> Management <b>Maturity</b> Model. The mentioned <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> models will be investigated and discussed. The PRINCE 2 method is chosen as the method to determine the <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> level of the project management office.

40|$|The {{level of}} project {{management}} awareness {{and recognition of}} the standards and knowledge sharing among professionals is on the rise. Despite this many projects continue to fail. Ameliorating project failure requires <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> among practitioners. <b>Project</b> management <b>maturity</b> is the progressive development of an enterprise-wide project management approach, methodology, strategy, and decision-making process. To ascertain the level of <b>maturity</b> among <b>project</b> oriented organisations in Ghana the following research questions were raised: Is the concept of PM maturity understood in Ghana? What are <b>Project</b> Management <b>Maturity</b> levels in Ghana? What maturity models are in use? Are there differences in <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> levels in industries in Ghana? The study was exploratory in nature and utilized a questionnaire survey method {{to collect data on}} <b>project</b> management <b>Maturity</b> in Ghanaian organizations. Purposive sampling was used to select a sample of 200 managers from different economic sectors. The findings showed that differences exist in the current <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> levels across each phase of the project life cycle for all organisations. The study also showed that most of the practitioners expect their respective organisations to attain higher levels of <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> (PMM) albeit at various levels. Organisations operating in the non-profit (NGO) category exhibited relatively higher levels of maturity compared to the other categories of organisations in all the five phases of the project management life cycle. Firms in the public sector of Ghana recorded low levels of maturity in most of the phases of the project management life cycle. This may be attributed to the low level of project management expertise in the sector, with possible dire consequence to the country’s development since the public sector accounts for a large percentage of projects executed in Ghana. Overall, the findings seem to indicate that <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> occurs in phases; PM maturity does not occur as an event but is an ongoing process that is interlinked. The implication therefore is that organisations cannot claim to be mature in one area and neglect the other; it becomes imperative for project implementing organisations in Ghana to strive to attain maturity in all the five phase of the project management life cycle in order to attain the full benefits of the projects they implement...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{contracts}} are essentially carried out as projects. In project situation, improvement of work practices {{can take place}} in two ways: within a project and from one project to another. As repetitive work is very much less in construction contracts compared to manufacturing environment, most significant improvements of quality usually take place on project-to-project basis. Documentation and documented procedures can playa major role in such a situation. Documented procedures establish the current practices or the baseline for continual improvement; documentation enables recording lessons from projects that are success as well as failures. The improvement of work practices in this manner is known to increase the <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> of a contractor organization. The level of <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> usually assesses an organization's current project management practices and processes {{and its ability to}} achieve project objectives in terms of quality, cost and time. This report presents a comparative study on the usage of project management practices in construction contracts and the relationship between documented procedures and the <b>project</b> management <b>maturity.</b> The objectives of the study were (a) to identify the areas which have a greater need for documented procedures; (b) to assess the usage of project management practices in construction contracts; (c) to assess the level of <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> of construction organizations; and (d) to establish the relationship between documented procedures and <b>project</b> management <b>maturity.</b> Questionnaire surveys were used to collect necessary data from the construction professionals and different construction organizations. The results of the first survey suggest that construction companies can benefit significantly by implementing documented procedures in the areas of all quality elements of ISO 9000, health and safety and risk management. The second survey was carried out to assess the level of <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> achieved by implementing a set of documented procedures and project management tools and techniques and practices. The results of this survey show that <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> is significantly high for construction companies in certain knowledge areas such as time management, cost management and procurement management; whereas it is comparatively low with respect to the management of risk, communication and quality of projects. Further, the results suggest that there is a positive relationship between the implementation of documented procedures and the level of <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> among contractor organizations. Also the implementation of documented procedures could improve their <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> and ability to achieve customer satisfaction. Further, personal interviews were conducted to verify the findings of the questionnaire. survey. Findings & conclusions from this study could be useful for the contractor organizations to identify strategies to increase their PM maturity and thereby to improve their potential to meet stakeholder requirements and successful completion of projects undertaken by them.

This enables bank to sharpen managerial incentives in the corporate loan market. Yet, conditional on the threat of termination being effective, credit protection can also dilute the continuation surplus of the bank and the borrower, thereby distorting their joint incentive to maximize value. While well– capitalized banks can fully mitigate the dilution cost by taking temporary credit protection that expires before <b>project</b> <b>maturity,</b> poorly capitalized banks ’ hedging need may entail a value distortion.

40|$|Project Management (PM) and Strategic Management (SM) are two {{subjects}} of growing {{importance in the}} corporate environment which are normally considered in isolation. One way of integrating these two concepts might be via the concept of <b>project</b> management <b>maturity</b> (Westphal et al., 2008). Rabechini and Pessoa (2005) state that to obtain <b>project</b> management <b>maturity,</b> {{it is necessary to}} achieve success in a number of critical factors which include organizational culture and structure, as well as sponsorship at both tactical and strategic levels (Silva et al., 2008). Another way of achieving this connection is by using Balanced Scorecard (BSC) as an auxiliary tool to integrate between projects and organizational strategy (Brock et al., 2003). The original developers of the BSC, Kaplan e Norton, subsequently developed the concept of strategy mapping, which they affirm "represents the missing link between the formulation and the execution of the strategy" (Kaplan e Norton, 2004). This paper proposes a strategy map identifying critical factors for attaining <b>project</b> management <b>maturity.</b> To formulate the map, we used a qualitative, exploratory approach oriented by Project Management theory and strategy mapping.
