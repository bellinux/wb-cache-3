40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a method for}} automatic synthesis of asynchronous digital systems from high-level data flow specifications. We <b>present</b> an <b>extended</b> <b>data</b> flow model that accurately reflects {{the behavior of the}} asynchronous components so that the data flow specification can be directly mapped into a hardware realization. In addition, we develop a timing model for the basic asynchronous building blocks and show how to derive the timing parameters of a composed system. This timing model can also be used at the data flow level, allowing designers to explore various design alternatives. We then describe a number of applications of the data flow specification for high-level synthesis such as schemes for resource sharing, local transformations for data flow description optimization, and allocation and sequencing of operations for given resources. Finally, we present two examples, a 16 -bit multiplier and a 16 -point FIR digital filter, where the number of modules have been altered at the data [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{etiology}} of {{dissociative identity disorder}} (DID) remains a topic of debate. Proponents of the fantasy model and the trauma model of DID have both called for more empirical research. To this end, the current study <b>presents</b> new and <b>extended</b> <b>data</b> analyses of a previously published (H 2 O) -O- 15 positron emission tomography imaging study. This study included 29 subjects: 11 patients with DID and 10 high- and 8 low-fantasy-prone DID-simulating mentally healthy control subjects. All subjects underwent an autobiographical memory script-driven (neutral and trauma related) imagery paradigm in 2 (simulated) dissociative personality states (neutral and trauma related). Psychobiological and psychophysiological data were obtained. Results of the new post-hoc tests on the psychophysiological responses support the trauma model. New results of the brain imaging data {{did not support the}} fantasy model. This study extends previously published results by offering important new supporting data for the trauma model of DID...|$|R

In particular, we derive a circuit model based on ANA measurements. We also demonstrate the first terahertz detection (up to 2. 54 THz) in bundles of CNTs that were deposited through dielectrophoresis across the smallest gap in log-periodic antennas. Data are given {{that support the}} hypothesis that the detection process is bolometric at THz frequencies. Future extensions are planned that will employ suspended CNTs and explore heterodyne detection. Finally, we have performed unique ab initio simulations with the aim of comparing these with the experimental data. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince WWII {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made in understanding the basis for the activity and the selectivity of molybdenum and tungsten based hydrotreating catalysts. Recently, the focus of investigation has turned to the structure of the catalytically stabilized active catalyst. The surface of the catalytically stabilized MoS 2 has been shown to be carbided with the formula MoSxCy under hydrotreating conditions. In this paper we review the basis for this finding and <b>present</b> new <b>data</b> <b>extending</b> the concept to the promoted TMS (transition metal sulfides) systems CoMoC and NiMoC. Freshly sulfided CoMoS and NiMoS catalyst have a strong tendency to form the carbided surface phases from any available carbon source...|$|R

Specifically, we have defined reference maps of the major protein components in cerebrospinal fluid and urine. Compartment-specific isoforms were recognized for transferrin and transthyretin. Mass spectrometric data established the cleavage site of the signal peptide and identified the N-terminal blocking group of prostaglandin D synthase from rat cerebrospinal fluid.

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} about age-specific structural and functional properties of human heart valves, while {{this information is}} key to the development and evaluation of living valve replacements for pediatric and adolescent patients. Here, we <b>present</b> an <b>extended</b> <b>data</b> set of structure-function properties of cryopreserved human pulmonary and aortic heart valves, providing age-specific information for living valve replacements. Tissue composition, morphology, mechanical properties, and maturation of leaflets from 16 pairs of structurally unaffected aortic and pulmonary valves of human donors (fetal- 53 years) were analyzed. Interestingly, no major differences were observed between the aortic and pulmonary valves. Valve annulus and leaflet dimensions increase throughout life. The typical three-layered leaflet structure is present before birth, but becomes more distinct with age. After birth, cell numbers decrease rapidly, while remaining cells obtain a quiescent phenotype and reside in the ventricularis and spongiosa. With age and maturation-but more pronounced in aortic valves-the matrix shows an increasing amount of collagen and collagen cross-links and a reduction in glycosaminoglycans. These matrix changes correlate with increasing leaflet stiffness with age. Our data provide a new and comprehensive overview of the changes of structure-function properties of fetal to adult human semilunar heart valves {{that can be used to}} evaluate and optimize future therapies, such as tissue engineering of heart valves. Changing hemodynamic conditions with age can explain initial changes in matrix composition and consequent mechanical properties, but cannot explain the ongoing changes in valve dimensions and matrix composition at older age...|$|R
40|$|This paper <b>presents</b> an <b>extended</b> {{two-stage}} <b>data</b> envelopment analysis (DEA) {{method for}} analyzing water resource use efficiency (WRUE) and related WRUE issues, which {{was developed by}} introducing regional water resource metabolic theory into the two-stage DEA method. It has the following advantages: (1) it {{has the ability to}} reflect the inner difference and connection of the regional water resource consumption process, which developed the corresponding physical model instead of making it a “black box”; (2) the built physical model for WRUE divided the main body of water resource consumption into social and economic subsystems, which can thus elaborate WRUE; (3) it can analyze not only WRUE but also related WRUE issues. The proposed method was applied to a real-case study in Gansu Province, China. Results show that decision makers can determine the comprehensive and accurate WRUE and negative factors of WRUE in Gansu Province. Moreover, the results offer recommendations for decision makers to plan for efficient use of water resources in different cities...|$|R
40|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} {{measurements on}} C 6 D 12 {{over a wide}} temperature range, covering liquid crystal, plastic crystal and brittle crystal phases, are <b>presented.</b> The <b>data</b> <b>extend</b> work conducted previously over a restricted temperature range and show that the structural features are dependent on the thermal history of the sample. The results demonstrate the relative contributions from lattice symmetry (ordered) and diffuse scattering (disordered) at varying temperatures. The spatial distribution function undergoes a complex change in which orientational correlations between adjacent molecules appear to be coupled to translational displacements of the molecular centres. Previous assumptions that cyclohexane is an 'almost-unhindered' rotator {{are found to be}} erroneous and the spatial correlations exhibit a complex relationship which is sensitive to temperature variation. Further methods for the analysis of the order-disorder features are considered...|$|R
40|$|Monocyte {{exposure}} to mitochondrial Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), induces a transient {{state in which}} these cells are refractory to further endotoxin stimulation. In this context, IRAK-M up-regulation and impaired p 65 activity were observed. This phenomenon, termed endotoxin tolerance (ET), is characterized by decreased production of cytokines {{in response to the}} pro-inflammatory stimulus. We also show that monocytes isolated from patients with myocardial infarction (MI) exhibited high levels of circulating mtDNA, which correlated with ET status. Moreover, a significant incidence of infection was observed in those patients with a strong tolerant phenotype. The <b>present</b> <b>data</b> <b>extend</b> our current understanding of the implications of endotoxin tolerance. Furthermore, our data suggest that the levels of mitochondrial antigens in plasma, such as plasma mtDNA, should be useful as a marker of increased risk of susceptibility to nosocomial infections in MI and in other pathologies involving tissue damage...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{a group of}} {{patients}} with left-sided neglect performed a number comparison task that co-occurred either with coherent motion in different directions or with random motion. Their performance was {{compared to that of}} a healthy control group and to a group of patients with right hemisphere damage (RHD) but no signs of neglect. The presence of leftward motion alleviated the difficulties that neglect patients typically show for a number smaller than the reference number 5 (i. e., number 4). Moreover, the standard distance effect was only present when the task co-occurred with leftward motion. These effects were not present in a group of participants with RHD without neglect or in a control group. The <b>present</b> <b>data</b> <b>extend</b> the effects of optokinetic stimulation (OKS) to representational neglect, suggesting that an external redirection of attention by the perception of motion may restore the altered access to the representation of the mental number line in neglect...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to {{gain insight into}} the functional properties of the expanded suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes characteristically found in actinic reticuloid. Peripheral blood cells, either whole mononuclear cell populations or selectively enriched populations, were obtained from a patient with well-established actinic reticuloid. The patient had an expansion of circulating T lymphocytes expressing the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype, i. e., CD 3 +, CD 4 -, CD 8 +. A proportion of these cells also expressed the Fc receptor for IgG. Functional studies, including pokeweed mitogen-driven immunoglobulin synthesis, mitogen and alloantigen response, natural killer and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity were within normal ranges and suggested a polyclonal rather than monoclonal expansion.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the influence of acoustical characteristics on the implicit learning of statistical regularities (transition probabilities) in sequences of musical timbres. The sequences were constructed {{in such a way}} that the acoustical dissimilarities between timbres potentially created seg-mentations that either supported (S 1) or contradicted (S 2) the statistical regularities or were neutral (S 3). In the learning group, participants first listened to the continuous timbre sequence and then had to distinguish statistical units from new units. In comparison to a control group without the exposition phase, no interaction between sequence type and amount of learning was observed: Performance increased by the same amount for the three sequences. In addition, performance reflected an overall preference for acoustically similar timbre units. The <b>present</b> outcome <b>extends</b> previous <b>data</b> from the domain of implicit learning to complex nonverbal auditory material. It further suggests that listeners become sensitive to statistical regularities despite acoustical characteristics in the material that potentially affect grouping. One fundamental characteristic of the cognitive system is to become sensitive to regularities in the environment via mere exposure to its structure. These implicit learning processes enabl...|$|R

40|$|The metabotropic {{glutamate}} (mGlu) receptor 1 (GRM 1) {{has been}} shown {{to play an important role}} in neuronal cells by triggering, through calcium release from intracellular stores, various signaling pathways that finally modulate neuron excitability, synaptic plasticity, and mechanisms of feedback regulation of neurotransmitter release. Herein, we show that Grm 1 is expressed in glomerular podocytes and that a glomerular phenotype is exhibited by Grm 1 (crv 4) mice carrying a spontaneous recessive inactivating mutation of the gene. Homozygous Grm 1 (crv 4 /crv 4) and, to a lesser extent, heterozygous mice show albuminuria, podocyte foot process effacement, and reduced levels of nephrin and other proteins known to contribute to the maintenance of podocyte cell structure. Overall, the <b>present</b> <b>data</b> <b>extend</b> the role of mGlu 1 receptor to the glomerular filtration barrier.

40|$|Carbon {{dioxide in}} the middle {{atmosphere}} shows an increasing enrichment in the heavy oxygen isotopes with altitude which preferential enrichment for 17 O according to d 17 O = 1. 7 d 18 O. This is contrary to tropospheric CO 2 where d 17 O ~ 0. 5 d 18 O. These isotope enrichments are transferred from O 3 into CO 2, but details of the mechanism are not understood yet. A systematic study was carried out using O 2 and CO 2 gases of different isotopic composition. Results show {{the existence of a}} photochemical isotope equilibrium between O 2 and CO 2, which is independent of the initial isotopic composition and shows equal enrichments for 17 O and 18 O. Additional experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of temperature, pressure and O 2 /CO 2 ratio. Data revealed that the magnitude of enrichment at photochemical equilibrium depends on pressure and on O 2 /CO 2 ratios with a decrease in enrichment at higher pressures. Also, the enrichment in CO 2 showed a positive temperature dependence. The measurement of asymmetric O 3 in one experiment yields additional insight into the isotope exchange mechanism and shows the absence of anomalous fractionation steps in the CO 3 * intermediate. The experimental data were modeled with the chemical kinetics software Facsimile.
