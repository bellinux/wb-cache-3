5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of <b>pilled</b> vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and <b>pilled.</b> Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is painful}} {{to have to}} remark, however, that, self-evident as this {{proposition}} might appear, it was vehemently contradicted {{by some of the}} initiated. There were rumours concerning the major which seriously compromised his private character. Indeed, such a pitch had they reached that when that gallant officer put himself forward as a candidate for a certain select club, he had, although proposed by a lord and seconded by a baronet, been most ignominiously <b>pilled.</b> In public the major affected to laugh over this social failure, and to regard it as somewhat in the nature of a practical joke, but privately he was deeply incensed. One day he momentarily dropped his veil of unconcern while playing billiards with the Honourable Fungus Brown, who was generally credited with having had some hand in the major's exclusion. [...] "Be Ged! sir," [...] the veteran suddenly exclaimed, inflating his chest and turning his apoplectic face upon his companion, [...] "in the old days I would have called the lot of you out, sir, every demned one, beginning with the committee and working down; I would, be George!" [...] At which savage attack the Honourable Fungus's face grew as white as the major's was red, and he began to wish that he had been more reserved in his confidences to some of his acquaintances respecting the exclusiveness of the club in question, or at least refrained from holding up the major's pilling as a proof thereof.|$|E

50|$|Celtic's {{qualification}} for {{the group}} stages of the 2013-14 Champions League meant that their youth team would play in the UEFA Youth League, in groups that mirrored those of the senior team.

He felt that the competition had improved {{his understanding of the}} game, and that, having been an unused substitute for Celtic's first-team, he though himself ready for first-team football, or perhaps a loan. Writing in his Scottish Sun column, Des McKeown suggested that Celtic's determination to win every competition they enter, at whatever level, hindered the progression of youngsters out of the youth teams. By the end of the season, Johnstone had made no senior appearances, and he rejected the offer of a new contract. He was attracted by a move to Dundee United, but the clubs were unable to agree a compensation figure and Dundee United <b>pilled</b> out of any deal because of the uncertainty involved with a fee set by tribunal.|$|E

40|$|A <b>pilled</b> fabric image {{consists}} of sub-images of different frequency components, and the fabric texture and the pilling information are in different frequency bands.

The CWT method can effectively decompose the <b>pilled</b> fabric image with six orientations at different scales and reconstruct fabric background texture and pilling sub-images. This study used an energy analysis method to search for an optimum image decomposition scale and dynamically discriminate pilling image from noise, fabric texture, fabric surface unevenness, and illuminative variation in the <b>pilled</b> fabric image. For pilling objective rating, six parameters were extracted from the pilling image to describe pill properties. A Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural rule was used as a classifier to classify the pilling grade. The proposed method was evaluated using knitted, woven, and nonwoven <b>pilled</b> fabric images photographed with a digital camera. <br /...|$|E

The surface fuzz and pills are identified from the high-frequency noise, fabric textures, fabric surface unevenness, and illuminative variation of a <b>pilled</b> fabric image by the two-dimensional dual-tree complex wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. The energies of the reconstructed subimages in six spatial orientations (± 15 º, ± 45 º, ± 75 º) are calculated as {{the elements of the}} pilling feature vector, whose dimension is reduced by principal component analysis. A linear discriminant function of Bayes 2 ̆ 7 Rule was used as a classifier to establish classification rules among the five pilling grades. A new <b>pilled</b> sample with the same physical construction can then be automatically assigned to one of the five pilling grades by the classification rules. A general evaluation of the proposed method was conducted using the SM 50 woven, non-woven, and SM 54 knitted standard pilling test image sets. The results suggest that the new method can successfully establish classification rules among the five pilling grade groups {{for each of the three}} standard pilling test image sets and should be applicable to practical objective pilling evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{method for}} {{locating}} the pills in woven fabric based on Gabor filter is proposed in this paper.

In the enhanced fabric image, threshold method is used to segment and locate the fabric pills. The location of fabric pills lays the foundation for constructing the whole system of evaluating the fabric pilling grade...|$|E
