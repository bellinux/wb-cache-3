40|$|During {{the recent}} decades {{the concept of}} place has been treated with {{intensity}} and frequency in architectural discourse. Much {{has been said about}} such issues as the sense of place, place versus placelessness, the loss of place and so on. This study surveys the concept of <b>place</b> <b>as</b> a theoretical issue of architecture in terms of two themes: <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance and <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context. In light of these two themes, three further themes, called 'the immediate contextualism', 'towards an urban architecture' and 'spirits of place', are examined. The survey of "the immediate contextualism" starts from a shift from <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance to <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context in the changing ideals of architecture {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. With the survey of the themes of 'towards an urban architecture' and 'the spirits of place', however, a re-shift from the <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context to <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance becomes necessary, since what it is about with the first shift from <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance to <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context on an architectural plane is, in the last analysis, not so much an issue of <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context as an issue of <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance on an urban plane, namely, our cities. In regard to the changing nature of our cities, the study ends with an argument for open-minded concepts of place to rise to the challenge of new places...|$|R

In order to show how the experience of mobility is grounded within <b>place</b> <b>as</b> a socially significant con- struct, we concentrate on three analytical themes: <b>place</b> <b>as</b> an essential component of social/collaborative work, <b>place</b> <b>as</b> expressive of organizational needs and characteristics, and <b>place</b> <b>as</b> facilitating a blending of work/life strategies and relationships...|$|R
