40|$|An {{advanced}} SiO 2 –lignin hybrid {{material was}} obtained and tested as a novel poly(vinyl chloride) (<b>PVC)</b> <b>filler.</b> The processing of compounds of poly(vinyl chloride) {{in the form}} of a dry blend with silica–lignin hybrid material and, separately, with the two components from which that material was prepared, was performed in a Brabender mixing chamber. An analysis was made of processing (mass melt flow rate, MFR), thermal (thermogravimetric analysis, Congo red and Vicat softening temperature test) and tensile properties of the final PVC composites with fillers in a range of concentrations between 2. 5 wt % and 10 wt %. Additionally, the effects of filler content on the fusion characteristics of PVC composites were investigated. The homogeneity of dispersion of the silica–lignin hybrid material in the PVC matrix was determined by optical microscopy and SEM. Finally, it should be noted that it is possible to obtain a PVC composite containing up to 10 wt % of silica–lignin filler using a melt processing method. The introduction of hybrid filler into the PVC matrix results in a homogeneous structure of the composites and positive processing and functional properties, especially thermal stability and Vicat softening temperature...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the present study, the impact {{behavior}} of CFRP sandwich structures with <b>PVC</b> foam <b>filler</b> were investigated. The impact tests were conducted in the instrumented drop bolt test facility Fractovis varying the parameters: impact energy, mass, drop height (or velocity), and temperature. During an analysis of the tests, these parameters were investigated with regard to the energy absorbed by the sandwich structure. The material behavior of the sandwich structure investigated was described by an impact number by means of which the absorbed energy can be determined as a function of impact energy. (orig.)

40|$|Polymer {{composite}} material {{has been widely}} used as an outdoor insulation material due to its advantages such as low surface energy, light weight, good pollution performance (hydrophobicity properties) and shorter processing time. Nevertheless, most researchers are concerned about polymeric long-term performance. By optimizing the material formulation and design, long-term performance of polymeric insulation can be improved. Thus, to develop better insulation, {{it is important to}} determine the ageing performance, electrical characteristics and also physical characteristics of the polymeric material. In this research, new filler called Boehmite, AlO(OH) is added to the existing Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) as a new polymer insulation material. The PVC is used as the base matrix. The effects of Silane Coupling Agent (SCA) were also studied. The polymer material was exposed to ageing process by conducting surface tracking and erosion resistance tests in accordance with BS EN 60587 : 2007. Surface flashover tests were conducted before and after the ageing test according to BS EN 60243 - 1 : 1998. Then, the material was further tested through permittivity and capacitance test before and after ageing tests. Water absorption test was also conducted in order to observe the hydrophobicity characteristics of the insulation material. The water absorption test is based on ASTM D 570 - 98. A comparison was then made between the <b>PVC</b> with <b>filler</b> and <b>PVC</b> without <b>filler</b> based on the result obtained from the experiment. Results reveal that the formulations of 65 % PVC and 35 % filler and SCA 5 g give the most promising results. It is a proof that the proposed material {{has the potential to be}} used as insulation material for high voltage application...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated {{ultraviolet}} weathering of unplasticized poly (vinyl chloride) (UPVC) filled composites {{with different}} filler contents of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) was studied. The unfilled and filled composites samples were manufactured by dry-blending <b>PVC,</b> EFB <b>fillers</b> and other additives in a heavy-duty laboratory mixer. The dry-blended compounds were then two-roll milled and hot pressed into samples. The composites samples {{were exposed to}} cyclic ultraviolet fluorescent lamps/condensation for 504 h of accelerated weathering. Each assessment consisted of SEM analysis, impact and flexural testing, visual inspection and FTIR analysis. The experimental results indicated that EFB fillers accelerated photo-oxidative degradation of the UPVC matrix. Although filled composites exhibited greater discolouration than unfilled composites, their impact and flexural properties changed only slightly after accelerated weathering...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to study and compare the thermal rigidity, thermal stability, and processability of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) composites filled with single fillers of talc and uncoated ground CaCO 3 (SM 90) or a hybrid filler consisting of talc/SM 90. To produce the composites, the <b>PVC</b> resin, <b>fillers,</b> and other additives were dry-blended in a laboratory mixer before being milled into sheets by using a tworoll mill. Test specimens were prepared by compression molding, after which the thermal properties and processability of the composites were determined. Single and hybrid filler loadings used were fixed at 30 phr (parts per hundred parts of resin). Talc-filled PVC composite showed slightly better thermal stability and rigidity than the composite filled with SM 90, and its thermal stability and rigidity slightly decreased with SM 90 content increasing from 5 to 25 phr in order to replace talc filler in the hybrid composites. The fusion time of talc-filled PVC composite was shorter than that of SM 90 -filled PVC composite; thus, the fusion time of hybrid composites increased with increasing SM 90...|$|R
40|$|A {{composite}} membrane {{was prepared}} by mixing {{epoxidized natural rubber}} (ENR) and polyvinyl chloride (<b>PVC).</b> An inorganic <b>filler,</b> MgO, was introduced into the polymer matrix by certain percentages to form a mixed matrix membrane (MMM). The resulting membranes were characterized using FTIR, TGA, SEM and gas permeability test. FTIR results showed the incorporation of MgO inside the membrane matrix {{with the appearance of}} an absorption peak at 3700 cm- 1 which represents the formation of Mg(OH) 2. Thermogram from TGA analysis showed two degradation stages at 250 - 350 °C and 370 - 500 °C, which correspond to the decomposition of PVC and ENR and the residue of fillers at 600 °C. SEM images of the membranes showed that pores were developed as fillers were introduced to the membrane. The size of the pores also increased with the increase of filler percentage. As for gas permeation test, the permeability values of CO 2 and N 2 for ENR/PVC membrane were the lowest. The permeability values increased with the addition of MgO to the membrane. The permeability of CO 2 was also the highest for all membranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} adding poly(vinyl chloride) (<b>PVC)</b> and coke <b>filler</b> on the {{rheological}} behavior and thermal properties of a {{coal tar pitch}} was investigated {{with a view to}} developing an appropriate viscoelastic binder for the injection molding of graphite components. Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed that the pitch formed compatible blends with PVC featuring a single glass transition temperature (Tg) intermediate to the two parent Tg’s. Adding PVC to the pitch increased melt viscosity substantially and resulted in strong shear thinning behavior at high PVC addition levels. Adding coke powder as filler increased the melt viscosity even further and enhanced shear thinning trends. Pyrolysis conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere revealed interactions between the PVC and pitch degradation pathways: the blends underwent significant thermal decomposition at lower temperatures but showed enhanced carbon yields at high temperatures. Pyrolytic carbon yield at 1000 C was further improved by a heat treatment (temperature scanned to 400 C) in air or oxygen. However, carbon yield decreased with addition of PVC. In addition, the degree of ordering attained following a 1 h heat treatment at 2400 C also decreased with increasing PVC content.

40|$|Summary. Obtained {{hydrophobic}} filler compositions {{based on}} PVC from calcium carbonate, {{which is a}} byproduct {{in the preparation of}} mineral nitrogen fertilizers. The methods for pretreatment of the chalk used as a <b>filler</b> in <b>PVC</b> compositions. Conducted modifying the properties of chalk with hydrophobic additives: stearic acid, zinc stearate, calcium stearate. When stearic acid treated chalk heating leads to an interaction with the surface layers of calcium carbonate, a thin film of calcium stearate. Therefore, more cost-effective to create compositions with PVC content of one percent of calcium stearate as its hydrophobic surface is easily wetted by the polymer matrix, which provides rapid mixing of PVC compounds. As a result, the excipient serves as an additional stabilizer, providing higher thermal stability of PVC products, compared with its values for the composition of the compared with the other ingredients. Extrusion processes that are central to the processing of PVC compounds filled by acting them filler, fractional increase heat and accelerate melting and increase output. The rheological properties of polymeric compositions created PVC. A significant reduction in viscosity observed for water repellent based on stearic acid. Study viscosity characteristics for hydrophobic additives showed that their activity increased in the series: zinc stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid. It was established that modifying additives used in the preparation of hydrophobic carbonate <b>filler</b> <b>PVC</b> compositions exhibit both plasticizers and stabilizing properties...|$|R
40|$|For {{flooring}} applications, calcium carbonate-filled poly(vinyl chloride), PVC, {{has long}} been the material of choice for both flexible sheeting and tile products. However, PVC-based formulations must be processed with plasticizers, which have recently raised some concerns from a sustainability point of view. In the research work reported here, calcium carbonate-filled formulations based on polyolefin plastomers, POP, are prepared in a laboratory-scale mixer, and their mechanical properties are studied for flooring applications. Plastomers are olefin copolymers synthesized using new metallocene catalyst technologies. The POP plastomer used in this research is Affinity 1140 a copolymer of ethylene and octene, and does not require any plasticizers for processing. The key mechanical properties of the calcium carbonate-filled POP, which include tensile strength, elongation and impact strength, are found to compare very favourably to those of <b>PVC</b> formulations at <b>filler</b> loadings of 200 phr. In addition, the filled POP formulations are able to incorporate a significant amount of post-consumer polyethylene(PC-PE) while maintaining adequate physical properties. Two types of PC-PE are tested in this research work: the first one is a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and the second is a high density polyethylene (HDPE). The DSC analysis technique is used to study the difference in behavior between the two recycled resins. Dimensional stability tests are also reported, indicating that POP composites contract slightly more than the PVC-based ones. Overall, this study shows that calcium carbonate-filled POP should be studied further as a more sustainable alternative to filled PVC for flooring applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{mechanical}} properties of PVC mixtures (<b>PVC,</b> stabilizer, lubricant, <b>filler)</b> such as tensile strength, tensile elongation, breaking strength, and breaking elongation were investigated. Unmodified calcite, {{as well as}} calcite modified by stearic acid, were used as fillers in wet and dry processes. The PVC mixtures containing the calcite modified by wet procedure have better mechanical properties compared to those with the calcite modified by the dry process. Tensile and breaking strength of the PVC mixture containing the calcite modified with 1. 5 % stearic acid using wet process, are higher for 2. 8 % and 5. 2 %, respectively, compared to the PVC mixture containing the calcite modified with {{the same amount of}} acid used in the dry process. The tensile strength difference between the mixtures increases with the increase of the concentration of used stearic acid up to 3 %. The strength of PVC mixture with the calcite modified by wet process is 3. 1 % higher compared to the mixture containing calcite modified by dry process. The results showed that the bonding strength between calcite and the adsorbed organic component affected tensile strength, tensile elongation and breaking strength of the PVC mixtures. The best filler was obtained by wet modification using 1. 5 % stearic acid solution that provided the formation of a stearate monolayer chemisorbed on calcite. The PVC mixtures containing the calcite modified by wet process using 1. 5 % stearic acid solution exhibited the best mechanical properties. This calcite was completely hydrophobic with dominant chemically adsorbed surfactant, which means that stearate chemisorbed on calcite provided stronger interaction in the calcite-stearic acid-PVC system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the mechanical, thermal and characterization of chitosan, nano precipitated calcium carbonate single and hybrid filler/ poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) composites. Graft copolymerization of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) onto chitosan (CS) was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere by free radical initiation in aqueous medium. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and ferrous ions were used as a redox initiator/co-catalyst system. The PMMA homopolymer formed during the reaction was removed from the graft copolymer by extraction using acetone. The presence of PMMA functional groups in Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectra of grafted CS at peak 1731 cm- 1 proved that the grafting process was successfully done. The single fillers (grafted CS, CS and nano-precipitated calcium carbonate (NPCC)) and hybrid fillers ((CS (2 phr) /NPCC (4 phr) and CS (4 phr) /NPCC (2 phr)) were pre-mixed with PVC using a high speed mixer. The dried blend formulations were milled into sheets using a two roll mill at temperature of 170 oC and then hot pressed at temperature of 175 oC. The tensile, flexural, impact strength and elongation at break of hybrid composites were increased compared to single fillers. Differences in surface morphology between the single composites and hybrid composites were observed. The hybrid PVC composites had better thermal stability than single composites. The increased of water resistance of the hybrid composites proved good filler-matrix interaction.

Soxhlet extraction was used to remove the PMMA homopolymer from the grafted copolymer. The presence of PMMA functional groups in Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectra of grafted OPEFB at peak around 1730 cm- 1 proved that grafting process was successfully done. The single fillers (grafted OPEFB, ungrafted OPEFB and talc) and hybrid fillers (grafted OPEFB/talc and ungrafted OPEFB/talc) loadings from 0 to 20 phr were pre-mixed with PVC using a high speed mixer. Methyl butadiene styrene (MBS) impact modifier was also added at 10 phr for the impact strength study. The dried blend formulations were milled into sheets using a two roll mill at 170 ?C and then hot pressed at 190 ?C. The tensile, flexural, impact strength and elongation at break of hybrid composites decreased as the filler content increased. Both, the tensile and flexural modulus of the hybrid composites are increased tremendously compared to the single composites. Adding MBS increased the impact strength of the single and hybrid composites. Differences in surface morphology between the grafted and ungrafted OPEFB were observed. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the hybrid composites shifted to higher temperature compared to single composites. The storage modulus of talc filled PVC showed the highest storage modulus compared to other composites. Hybrid PVC composites had better thermal stability than single composites.
