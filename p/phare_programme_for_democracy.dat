40|$|Since 1991, the European Commission {{has been}} {{supporting}} the transition in Eastern countries through the TACIS <b>Programme</b> (<b>for</b> the New Independent States) and <b>PHARE</b> <b>Programme</b> (<b>for</b> the Central Eastern European Countries). One priority for Tacis or Phare funding is nuclear safety. In Nuclear Safety, the countries mainly concerned are Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Kazakhstan for TACIS, and Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia for the <b>PHARE.</b> In these <b>programmes,</b> the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) is providing its Technical & Scientific Expertise in Design Safety, On-Site Assistance and Dissemination of project results for: ¿EC Directorate General External Relations, {{responsible for the}} programming of TACIS projects. ¿EC-EuropeAid, in charge of identification and implementation of all TACIS projects. ¿EC Directorate General Enlargement, responsible for PHARE projects. Several TACIS and PHARE projects (performed in the past or going on) are related to thermalhydraulics applied to accident analyses/severe accident analyses and accident management in VVER and RBMK reactor types. These projects included the development and application of Eastern codes but also the transfer and use of Western codes together with Western technologies, analysis experience, know-how and training Eastern experts {{on the use of}} the codes. This paper gives an overview of these projects carried so far during more than a decade.

40|$|Hungary {{has been}} in a {{transition}} process since the fall of the Iron Curtain. This process has resulted in important developments in regional policy. The introduction of a western style policy system seems, however, not to have affected regional inequality to any noticeable extent as measured by income per captia. There are still large disparities between the richest counties and the remaining counties in terms of this indicator. However, single indicator approaches to regional inequality have been criticised. Therefore in this paper we adopt a multidimensional approach to analyse regional inequality. For the counties of Hungary the multidimensionality of inequality is taken into account by using a multiple of social and economic indicators that are combined into a composite index. Theil's second measure of multidimensional inequality and principal component analysis are used to construct the composite index. The results thus obtained are used to identify the least-favoured and the most-favoured regions. We find that there are substantial differences between the single indicator approach based on per capita income and the multidimensional approach. Moreover, we argue that the EU <b>Phare</b> <b>Programmes</b> <b>for</b> Hungary have helped the economic development in developed regions situated on the EU border {{but at the same time}} have stimulated disparities within Hungary...|$|R

40|$|Technical systems tend {{to undergo}} changes and thus will {{sooner or later}} require {{adjustments}} to new requirements or conditions. Currently, major changes in Air Traffic Management (ATM) are on the way, as ATM modernizations programmes like SESAR or NextGEN are getting momentum. ATM systems are rather complex and pose high demands on safety. Besides safety, other performance parameters like efficiency or environmental and climate impact {{have to be taken}} into account. Here, simulations can help to evaluate advantages of new developments or ideas, without jeopardizing the safety of others. The DLR’s Institute of Flight Guidance operate an Air Traffic Simulation software called TrafficSim, which in detail is capable to simulate realistic aircraft movements and handle scenarios with high traffic. Core of this software is a generic Flight Management System (FMS) which was developed at the DLR within the project <b>PHARE</b> (<b>Programme</b> <b>for</b> Harmonised ATM Research in EUROCONTROL). The purpose of this FMS is to create a 4 D trajectory for each aircraft in the scenario. Data link communication could be used to negotiate trajectories with the ground part of simulation. The TrafficSim is in continuous development and generates configurable as well as realistic 4 D trajectories, or even entire traffic scenarios (e. g. Europe-wide) for various research projects. Since the FMS is capable of most modern FMS-functions like full 4 D, self separation, interval management and low Required Navigation Performance (RNP), all aircraft of a scenario can be individually equipped with a subset of modern airborne capabilities. This paper describes the steps to generate a 4 D trajectory based scenario and shows the scope of the TrafficSim and how projects benefit from this simulation...|$|R

40|$|The article {{shows how}} and why, after having agreed upon a <b>programme</b> <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> {{assistance}} {{under the name}} of European Initiative <b>for</b> <b>Democracy</b> and Human Rights (EIDHR), the EU fell short of its original objectives in programme implementation. This is demonstrated by close analysis of microprojects in Mediterranean countries. The scope of EU action shrank as priorities for action were defined and projects approved. As a consequence, the EU has promoted democracy less than human rights, in relatively less demanding countries, and without spending all the budgeted money. This article shows how {{these findings are consistent with}} important themes in Policy analysis and implementation research, and thus supplements other explanations of EU shortcomings. EU democracy assistance, as represented by the EIDHR, is an ambiguous and contested policy, which also suffers from an institutional setting characterized by a long chain of command. This means that there are opportunities for small decisions to gradually shift the focus and downsize the relevance of the policy initiative. The EU is thus unintentionally undermining its own policy goals, as the large number of actors interpret the EU's best interest (and their own position in relation to it) in various and divergent way...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear Safety in Europe {{is one of}} the EU's primary concerns, {{therefore}} the EU decided to take a prominent role to help the New Independent States and countries of Central and Eastern Europe {{to ensure the safety of}} their nuclear reactors. The EU TACIS and <b>PHARE</b> <b>programmes</b> in nuclear safety have been undertaken since 1991. The European Commission's Directorate General External Relations (EC DG RELEX) and Directorate General EuropeAid Co-operation Office (EC DG AIDCO), are responsible for programming and management of implementation of TACIS projects. DG Enlargement (EC DG ELARG) is responsible <b>for</b> programming <b>PHARE</b> <b>programmes,</b> but implementation of most projects has been deconcentrated and decentralised to the Beneficiary Countries. In these activities the TSSTP Unit at the JRC/IE in Petten, The Netherlands, is the technical and scientific adviser of above mentioned EC Directorates General. Several PHARE projects aiming at improving nuclear safety have been successfully implemented for a number of plants from Central and Eastern Europe. In some cases major safety issues have been addressed by means of multi-country projects and results have been disseminated to the rest of the nuclear community. Although a lot of information has been exchanged at a bilateral level, further effort is needed to collect the project results in a systematic way and make them available by means of the internet. At present the TSSTP Unit is implementing two projects for dissemination of PHARE project results. This activity will take a better advantage of today's communication technologies and ensure the management of the acquired knowledge through preservation and user-friendly access and retrieval of the project results.
