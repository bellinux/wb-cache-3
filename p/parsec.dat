5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at a speed of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 <b>parsec</b> wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one <b>parsec</b> that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E

25|$|In {{physical}} cosmology, {{volumes of}} cubic gigaparsecs (Gpc3) are selected {{to determine the}} distribution of matter in the visible universe and {{to determine the number}} of galaxies and quasars.

50|$|The {{cluster is}} about 14 light-years (4.2 <b>parsecs)</b> wide, but the cluster's other {{parameters}} remain poorly known.

50|$|In stellar and galactic astronomy, the {{standard}} distance is 10 <b>parsecs</b> (about 32.616 light years, 308.57 petameters or 308.57 trillion kilometres). A star at 10 <b>parsecs</b> has a parallax of 0.1″ (100 milliarcseconds). Galaxies (and other extended objects) are {{much larger than}} 10 <b>parsecs,</b> their light is radiated over an extended patch of sky, and their overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances, but the same convention is used. A galaxy's magnitude is defined by measuring all the light radiated over the entire object, treating that integrated brightness as the brightness of a single point-like or star-like source, and computing the magnitude of that point-like source as it would appear if observed at {{the standard}} 10 <b>parsecs</b> distance.

25|$|The <b>parsec</b> {{is defined}} as being equal {{to the length of}} the longer leg of an {{extremely}} elongated imaginary right triangle in space. The two dimensions on which this triangle is based are its shorter leg, of length one astronomical unit (the average Earth-Sun distance), and the subtended angle of the vertex opposite that leg, measuring one arcsecond. Applying the rules of trigonometry to these two values, the unit length of the other leg of the triangle (the <b>parsec)</b> can be derived.|$|E

25|$|A {{corollary}} {{states that}} a <b>parsec</b> {{is also the}} distance from which a disc one astronomical unit in diameter must be viewed for it to have an angular diameter of one arcsecond (by placing the observer at D and a diameter of the disc on ES).|$|E

500|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387L is an M-type {{red dwarf}} in the Sagittarius constellation. It is {{estimated}} to be 5700 <b>parsecs</b> (18,591 light years) away, although uncertainty has led the discovering team to place the confidence intervals at ± 2200 <b>parsecs</b> (7,176 light years); in other words, although the distance of MOA-2009-BLG-387L from Earth is best placed at 5700 <b>parsecs,</b> astronomers can only be 90% certain that it is somewhere between 3,500 and 7,900 <b>parsecs</b> away. Likewise, although MOA-2009-BLG-387L's mass has been estimated at 0.19 times that of the Sun, the confidence intervals remain large (...) , as uncertainty in the mass of the planet places its true mass between 0.07 and 0.49 times the mass of the Sun.

Estimates that {{the brightness of the}} central region would require as many as 100 hot O class stars within half a <b>parsec</b> at the centre of the cluster led to speculation that a star 3,000 times the mass of the Sun was the more likely explanation.|$|E

The results presented here were obtained with low-resolution optical spectroscopic follow-up of candidate nearby-stars as a preliminary test of our methodology.

25|$|The {{use of the}} <b>parsec</b> as a unit of {{distance}} follows naturally from Bessel's method, because the distance in parsecs can be computed simply as the reciprocal of the parallax angle in arcseconds (i.e. if the parallax angle is 1 arcsecond, the object is 1pc from the Sun; if the parallax angle is 0.5 arcseconds, the object is 2pc away; etc.). No trigonometric functions are required in this relationship because the very small angles involved mean that the approximate solution of the skinny triangle can be applied.|$|E

Arcturus would appear as roughly magnitude -5.2 (about 120 times brighter than it appears from Earth, or close to twice the brightness of Venus) {{in the night sky}} of a hypothetical planet orbiting Eta Boötis, while Eta Boötis would appear at about magnitude 2.4 (absolute magnitude 2.41 at 0.99 <b>parsec)</b> in the sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Arcturus, or over twice the brightness of Sirius in the night sky.|$|E
