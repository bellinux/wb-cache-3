The phenomena of weathering are of considerable significance in relation to geochemistry, sediment formation, and soil chemistry. These phenomena can be studied in various ways [...] for example~ examination of weathering profiles can lead to deductions about the process, or attempts can be made in the laboratory to reproduce the weathering processes of nature. In this paper a report will be given on some such attempts at experimental weathering. In connection with laboratory experiments one can again dis-tinguish between two types [...] namely, those {{carried out in}} an open...|$|E
40|$|Geology and {{structure}} of 1, 000 square miles of granulite-upper amphibolite facies gneisses cut by syn- and late-kinematic intrusions are described. The circular post-kinematic Mutton Bay alkaline syenite (631 m. y.) {{is divided into three}} main intrusive groups on the basis of chemistry, mineralogy, and field relations. Differentiation includes gravity settling and flow differentiation, while intrusion involved early stoping and assimilation with late faulting. Depth of the present level below the roof of the intrusion is estimated at 6 - 8 miles and temperature of crystallization of felspars in the early magmas at greater than 1015 Â°C at less than 500 bars water pressure. Orthoclase inverted to microcline in foliated rocks that intruded as crystal mushes. A giant gabbro dyke with syenite differentiate (470 m. y.) is intruded by diabase and trachyte dykes. Carbonate enrichment in the trachytes is accompanied by high <b>potash</b> <b>felspar</b> content. Sandstone dykes are the only Paleozoic sediments...|$|E

Three of these sections show an irregular alternation of kaolinite rich sandy and silty-clay beds. The fourth section which contains calcareous layers, is very important from a geological point of view, because it is located where the structures of two ranges, the Iberian and the Betics, converge. The clays of about 80 samples from these sections always consist of illite, kaolinite and interstratified clay minerals. The sandy layers also Contain quartz, as well as <b>potash</b> and calcic-sodic <b>felspars.</b> The fine fraction (< 2 #m) is composed of kaolinte, between pM and T types, swelling illite and randomly interstratified clay minerals of the t~) pe (10 r 14 ~), richer in 10 A layers. From the mineralogical and crystalchemical data and field observations, it is deduced that these sediments are mainly detrital. This and the layer alternation suggest, for the Upper Jurasic and Lower Cretaceous (Wealdian facies), a clim te alternating from biostatic torhexistatic. Alternating laterization and erosion might supply the materials to the Wealdian sedimentary basin. INTRODUCI'ION The Spanish Wealdian, first discussed by Gonzale...|$|R
