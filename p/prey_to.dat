40|$|We {{propose a}} new theory of {{predation}} based on "signal-jamming. " In our model the predator's characteristics are common knowledge, while the entrant is uncertain of his own future profitability. The entrant uses his current profit {{to decide whether to}} remain in the market, and the predator <b>preys</b> <b>to</b> "jam" or interfere with this inference problem. Thus, our model differs from those based on "reputation effects," in which the predator <b>preys</b> <b>to</b> signal information about himself. ...|$|R

5|$|Painted turtles {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to predators when young. Nests are frequently ransacked and the eggs eaten by garter snakes, crows, chipmunks, thirteen-lined ground and gray squirrels, skunks, groundhogs, raccoons, badgers, gray and red fox, and humans. The small and sometimes bite-size, numerous hatchlings fall <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> water bugs, bass, catfish, bullfrogs, snapping turtles, three types of snakes (copperheads, racers and water snakes), herons, rice rats, weasels, muskrats, minks, and raccoons. As adults, the turtles' armored shells protect them from many potential predators, but they still occasionally fall <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> alligators, ospreys, crows, red-shouldered hawks, bald eagles, and especially raccoons.|$|E
5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, the predator {{to catch the}} prey more effectively, the <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that exposure to elevated carbon dioxide (CO 2) affects how fishes perceive their environment, affecting behavioral and cognitive processes leading <b>to</b> increased <b>prey</b> mortality. However, it is unclear if increased mortality results from changes in the dynamics of predator-prey interactions or due <b>to</b> <b>prey</b> increasing activity levels. Here we demonstrate that ocean pCO 2 projected to occur by 2100 significantly effects the interactions of a predator-prey pair of common reef fish: the planktivorous damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis and the piscivorous dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus. <b>Prey</b> exposed <b>to</b> elevated CO 2 (880 µatm) or a present-day control (440 µatm) interacted with similarly exposed predators in a cross-factored design. Predators had the lowest capture success when exposed to elevated CO 2 and interacting with <b>prey</b> exposed <b>to</b> present-day CO 2. <b>Prey</b> exposed <b>to</b> elevated CO 2 had reduced escape distances and longer reaction distances compared <b>to</b> <b>prey</b> exposed <b>to</b> present-day CO 2 conditions, but this was dependent on whether the prey was paired with a CO 2 exposed predator or not. This suggests that the dynamics of predator-prey interactions under future CO 2 environments will depend {{on the extent to which}} the interacting species are affected and can adapt to the adverse effects of elevated CO 2...|$|R
5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E

5|$|Fast and active, {{the copper}} shark may be {{encountered}} alone, in pairs, or in loosely organized schools containing up {{to hundreds of}} individuals. Some aggregations seem to form for reproductive purposes, while others form in response to concentrations of food. This species may fall <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> larger sharks and killer whales. Known parasites of the copper shark include the tapeworms Cathetocephalus australis, Dasyrhynchus pacificus and D. talismani, Floriceps minacanthus, Phoreiobothrium robertsoni, and Pseudogrillotia spratti, the leech Stibarobdella macrothela, and the fluke Otodistomum veliporum.|$|E
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain.

5|$|Larvae hatch {{from their}} egg casing {{in two to}} six weeks. They are born carnivores, feeding instinctively on small {{invertebrates}} that move in their field of vision. Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles.

50|$|Harpy eagles {{routinely}} take prey weighing {{more than}} 7 kg. They possess the largest talons of any living eagle. They {{have been recorded}} as lifting <b>prey</b> up <b>to</b> equal their own body weight. That allows the birds to snatch a live sloth from tree branches, {{as well as other}} huge prey items. Males usually take relatively smaller prey, with a typical range of 0.5 to 2.5 kg or about half their own weight. The larger females take larger prey, with a minimum recorded prey weight of around 2.7 kg. Adult female harpies regularly grab large male howler or spider monkeys or mature sloths weighing 6 to 9 kg in flight and fly off without landing, an enormous feat of strength. <b>Prey</b> items taken <b>to</b> the nest by the parents are normally medium-sized, having been recorded from 1 to 4 kg. The <b>prey</b> brought <b>to</b> the nest by males averaged 1.5 kg, while the <b>prey</b> brought <b>to</b> the nest by females averaged 3.2 kg.|$|R
5|$|Mantises are generalist predators of arthropods. The {{majority}} of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within their reach.
