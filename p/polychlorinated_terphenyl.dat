40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{have been}} {{administered}} to rats and to quail {{to discover the}} nature of the biological effects which these environmental pollutants produce in mammals and birds. Biological effects evaluated were: (1) estrogenic activity of the PCBs in rats, (2) alterations of pentobarbital metabolism induced by the PCBs as judged by sleeping time of Japanese quail, (3) alterations of liver vitamin A, liver lipids and liver weight induced by Aroclor 1242 in rats and quail, and (4) egg production of Japanese quail. Estrogenic Activity Estrogenic activity was assessed by determining the stimulation of the uterine glycogen response of the immature rat uterus 18 hours after administration of the test compound(1). The potency of active compounds is reported in terms of the minimal subcutaneous dose which will increase glycogen to a level significantly different from control. In a series of 11 polychlorinated biphenyls and terphenyls, the compounds containing up to 48 % chlorine were estrogenically active (Table 1). A <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyl</b> containing 42 % chlorine was found to be 8 times more active. This is a low level of estrogenic activity and probably arises from hydroxylated metabolites during in vivo metabolism...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls</b> (PCTs) are a {{group of}} {{chlorine}} derivatives of terphenyls. They are chemically related to polychlorinated biphenyls and have similar chemical properties.

50|$|Terphenyls are a {{group of}} closely related {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons. Also known as diphenylbenzenes or triphenyls, they consist of a central benzene ring substituted with two phenyl groups. The three isomers are ortho-terphenyl, meta-terphenyl, and para-terphenyl. Commercial grade terphenyl is generally a mixture of the three isomers. This mixture {{is used in the}} production of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls,</b> which were formerly used as heat storage and transfer agents.|$|R

Pollutants associated with San Diego Bay shipyard activities include: copper and tributyltin from antifouling paints; and petroleum and PAHs from bilge waste. Other paint wastes may contain zinc, chromium and lead.

40|$|<b>Polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls</b> (PCTs) {{have been}} {{determined}} in aquatic biota and sediments by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using negative chemical ionization. The use of various methods of calculation is discussed. Total PCT concentrations expressed as A (Aroclor) 5442 equivalents ranged from 0. 28 to 7400 μg/kg of wet weight in biota, with hexachloroterphenyls (hexa-CTs) {{as the major}} group of CTs present. In sediments, total PCT concentrations expressed as A 5442 equivalents ranged from 22 to 100 μg/kg of wet weight, with hepta-CTs as the dominant group of congeners. Total PCT concentrations in biota were approximately 1 - 10 % of total polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) concentrations and in sediments 1025 % of total PCB concentrations. The rather unexpectedly high concentrations of PCTs, especially in the sediment samples, should stimulate further research on their general environmental distribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{screening}} of sewage-sludge for organic pollutants {{was carried out}} in the state of Brandenburg, Germany. Samples were taken both in summer and winter. The waste water treatment plants were classified in three groups depending on the types of sewage treated (domestic, municipal and industrial waste water). The content of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls,</b> naphthalenes, chloropesticides, halogenated hydrocarbon solvents, aromatic hydrocarbon solvents (BTEX), chlorobenzenes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, chlorophenols, phthalates, petroleum hydrocarbons, surfactants, organotin compounds and 2, 4 -dichloroaniline was estimated. Data from terrestrial ecotoxicology were used to estimate tolerable levels of soil contamination. This yields the so-called "standard values" for concentrations of organic pollutants in sewage sludge. The concentrations of most pollutants in sewage sludge were found to be below the standard value. However, surfactant and toluene concentrations exceeded the standard value...|$|R
40|$|This publication, {{based on}} {{contributions}} from an international group of experts, provides a concise {{review of the}} available evidence {{on the characteristics of}} 13 groups of POPs (pentachlorophenol, DDT, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexachlorobenzene, heptachlor, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls,</b> polybrominated diphenylethers, polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, short-chain chlorinated paraffins and ugilec). It reviews pathways of human exposure related to the long-range transport of the POPs through the atmosphere, and the potential hazards associated with them. The review concludes with an expert assessment of the risks to health associated with exposure due to the long-range transport of each of the pollutants. It is intended that the assessment will serve to strengthen the commitment of the parties to the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution to improve air quality in Europe and to prevent adverse effects of air pollution on human health...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of a routine {{investigation}} concerned with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination of dust collected in classrooms of a junior high school, a group of electron capture detector (ECD) -sensitive compounds with high boiling points were found in addition to PCBs. Using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric techniques, these compounds were identified as <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls</b> (PCTs). Additional measurements indicated that the PCTs were present only in particulate matter collected from the tops of fluorescent light frames but not in air samples obtained concomitantly in the classrooms. Attempts to identify the PCT emission source were unsuccessful. A survey of the literature revealed that PCTs are ubiquitously distributed environmental contaminants, although no data on their indoor occurrence have been reported to date. In view of the toxic effects of PCTs, which seem to be as important as those of PCBs, further attention should be given to the possible presence of PCTs in indoor environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{procedure}} used {{to determine}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls</b> (PCTs), chlorinated dibenzodioxins, and chlorinated dibenzofurans is outlined in Table 1. It {{is based on the}} cleanup-chromatography of Holden and Marsden (1), modified as described (2). Most PCBs are eluted in fraction I. Fraction II contains some PCBs, p, p'-DDE, and PCTs, whereas heptachlor exposide, dieldrin, endrin, p,p'-DDD, and p, p'-DDT are eluted in fraction III. Fractions I and II are further chromatographed on alumina, essentially according to Porter and Burke (3), to determine chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans. PCTs, hexa- and octachlorodibenzodioxin, and octachlorodibenzofuran were quantified by gas chromatography on 3 % OV- 210 on Chromosorb WAW 60 / 80 in a 6 ft X 4 mm column at 200 °C. A 4 % SE- 30 column was used to quantify PCBs, chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, di-, tri-, and tetrachlorodibenzofuran. Recovery of PCBs and chlorinated hydrocarbo...|$|R
40|$|Capillary gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{is a very}} useful technique for the determination of complex mixtures of halogenated contaminants. Initially, this technique has shown its merits for the determination of polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides. In addition, it has also broken new grounds towards the identification and quantification of relatively unknown halogenated compounds, often complex mixtures, such as toxaphene, polychlorinated naphthalenes and paraffins and brominated flame retardants. Capillary GC is, however, not the final solution for the determination of all these mixtures. For some of them, with a relatively simple constitution or {{with only a few}} major components, such as chlordanes and brominated diphenylethers, a reliable congener-specific analysis may be carried out by single-column capillary GC. For others more advanced techniques will be required. Multi-dimensional (MD) GC techniques, such as heart-cut MDGC or comprehensive MDGC, are still under development or have only been applied for non-routine analyses. Given the importance of some of these complex mixtures, such as several brominated flame retardants, which are still produced and used daily and world-wide, it may be expected that next to the use of GC-MS, these more advanced GC techniques will be used more frequently in the near future. The current state-of-the-art of capillary GC with regard to the different compounds classes indicated below is described. Also, attention is given to the sample preparation. The following groups of contaminants are being discussed: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, chlorinated bornanes (toxaphene), chlordane, <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls,</b> <b>polychlorinated</b> diphenylethers, polychlorinated naphthalenes, polychlorinated alkanes, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenylethers.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} and to quantify <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls</b> (PCT) in environmental matrices, the chro- matographic behavior of coplanar and non-coplanar congeners was evaluated. A mixture of 16 single PCT congeners was used for method development. Four of these compounds were synthesized for the ﬁrst time by SUZUKI-coupling reaction. These were p-PCT (2, 200, 6, 600 -tetrachloro-, 20, 3, 300, 4, 400, 50,-hexachloro-, 20, 3, 300, 5, 50, 500 -hexachloro-) and m-PCT (2, 200, 3, 300, 5, 500 -hexachloro-). They were characterized by NMR (1 H, 13 C) spectroscopy. By means of the new column chromatographic clean-up reported here, a good matrix removal and {{the separation of the}} coplanar PCT congeners from the non-coplanar ones was obtained. The recovery rates for all congeners were good for the PCT in different test matrices like fat, charcoal, and soil. The quality of the clean-up, the separation and the recovery rates were determined by GC/MS analysis. The method was applied for the ﬁrst time to a real sample from a ﬁre accident, where different PCT, obviously formed during the combustion process, were found. The conclusion is drawn that this method is suitable for the analysis of PCT in different environmental samples...|$|R

In addition, but with less frequency, waste oils may contain high-harmful polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls</b> (PCT) or polybrominated biphenyls (PBB). Waste oil can {{have a number of}} significant, short-term and long-term impacts on the environment if they are treated or managed in an uncontrolled manner.

40|$|During the 1980 {{expedition}} to the Arctic with the icebreaker Ymer, a number of vertebrate species were sampled for determination of persistent organic pollutants. Samples of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus, n= 34), glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus, n= 8), common eider (Somateria mollissima, n= 10), Brünnich’s guillemot (Uria lomvia, n= 9), ringed seal (Pusa hispida, n= 2) and polar bear (Ursus maritimus, n= 2) were collected. With the exception of Brünnich’s guillemot, there was a marked contamination difference of birds from western as compared to eastern/northern Svalbard. Samples in the west contained {{a larger number of}} polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and also <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>terphenyls,</b> indicating local sources. Brünnich’s guillemots had similar pollutant concentrations in the west and east/north; possibly younger birds were sampled in the west. In Arctic char, pollutant profiles from lake Linnévatn (n= 5), the lake closest to the main economic activities in Svalbard, were similar to profiles in Arctic char from the Shetland Islands (n= 5), but differed from lakes to the north and east in Svalbard (n= 30). Arctic char samples had higher concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) than the marine species of birds and mammals, possibly due to accumulation via snowmelt. Compared to the Baltic Sea, comparable species collected in Svalbard had lower concentrations of PCB and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), but similar concentrations indicating long-range transport of hexachlorobenzene, HCHs and cyclodiene pesticides. In samples collected in Svalbard in 1971, the concentrations of PCB and DDT in Brünnich’s guillemot (n= 7), glaucous gull (n= 2) and polar bear (n= 2) were similar to the concentrations found in 1980.
