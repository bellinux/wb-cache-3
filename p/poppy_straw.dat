25|$|The {{poppy seed}} harvest {{can be a}} {{by-product}} of opium poppy cultivation for opium, <b>poppy</b> <b>straw,</b> or both opium and <b>poppy</b> <b>straw.</b> Conversely, <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> can be a by-product of cultivation of poppy seeds. Compared to the seed pod and straw, the seeds contain very low levels of opiates. The seeds may be washed to obtain poppy tea but a large amount is needed, around 300-400g depending on the levels of opiates.|$|E
25|$|Seed {{capsules}} can be {{dried and}} used for decorations, but they also contain morphine, codeine, and other alkaloids. These pods can be boiled in water to produce a bitter tea that induces a long-lasting intoxication (See Poppy tea). If allowed to mature, poppy pods (<b>poppy</b> <b>straw)</b> can be crushed and used to produce lower quantities of morphinans. In poppies subjected to mutagenesis and selection on a mass scale, researchers {{have been able to}} use <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> to obtain large quantities of oripavine, a precursor to opioids and antagonists such as naltrexone. Although millennia older, the production of poppy head decoctions {{can be seen as a}} quick and dirty variant of the Kábáy <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> process, which since its publication in 1930 has become the major method of obtaining licit opium alkaloids worldwide, as discussed under the Wikipedia Morphine article.|$|E
25|$|Most {{morphine}} {{produced for}} pharmaceutical use {{around the world}} is actually converted into codeine as the concentration of the latter in both raw opium and <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> is much lower than that of morphine; in most countries, the usage of codeine (both as end-product and precursor) is at least equal or greater than that of morphine on a weight basis.|$|E
50|$|Raw opium, opium <b>poppy</b> and <b>straw,</b> {{as well as}} its {{derivatives}} morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone and codeine are Schedule 2 on the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act.|$|R

25|$|The <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> methods predominate in Continental Europe and the British Commonwealth, {{with the}} latex method in most common use in India. The latex method can involve either {{vertical}} or horizontal slicing of the unripe pods with a two-to five-bladed knife with a guard developed specifically {{for this purpose}} to the depth of {{a fraction of a}} millimetre and scoring of the pods can be done up to five times. An alternative latex method sometimes used in China in the past is to cut off the poppy heads, run a large needle through them, and collect the dried latex 24 to 48 hours later.|$|E
25|$|By 1972, {{the effects}} of the War On Drugs had caused {{widespread}} shortages of illicit and licit opiates because of a scarcity of natural opium, <b>poppy</b> <b>straw,</b> and other sources of opium alkaloids, and the geopolitical situation was growing difficult for the United States. After much of the opium and morphine in the US National Stockpile of Strategic & Critical Materials was tapped in order to ease severe shortages of medicinal opiates — the codeine-based antitussives in particular — in late 1973, researchers were tasked with finding a way to synthesize codeine and its derivatives. They quickly succeeded using petroleum or coal tar and a process developed at the United States' National Institutes of Health.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary source}} of {{morphine}} is isolation from <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> of the opium poppy. In 2013, an estimated 523000kg of morphine were produced. About 45000kg were used directly for pain, a four-time increase over the last twenty years. Most use for this purpose was in the developed world. About 70% of morphine is used to make other opioids such as hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and heroin. It is a Schedule II drug in the United States, Class A in the United Kingdom, and Schedule I in Canada. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Morphine is sold under many trade names.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} formula of morphine {{was determined by}} 1925 by Robert Robinson. At least three methods of total synthesis of morphine from starting materials such as coal tar and petroleum distillates have been patented, {{the first of which}} was announced in 1952, by Dr. Marshall D. Gates, Jr. at the University of Rochester. Still, the vast majority of morphine is derived from the opium poppy by either the traditional method of gathering latex from the scored, unripe pods of the poppy, or processes using <b>poppy</b> <b>straw,</b> the dried pods and stems of the plant, the most widespread of which was invented in Hungary in 1925 and announced in 1930 by the chemist János Kabay.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is also {{available}} in a paste that {{is used in the}} production of heroin, which can be smoked by itself or turned to a soluble salt and injected; the same goes for the penultimate products of the Kompot (Polish Heroin) and black tar processes. <b>Poppy</b> <b>straw</b> as well as opium can yield morphine of purity levels ranging from poppy tea to near-pharmaceutical-grade morphine by itself or with all of the more than 50 other alkaloids. It also is the active narcotic ingredient in opium and all of its forms, derivatives, and analogues as well as forming from breakdown of heroin and otherwise present in many batches of illicit heroin as the result of incomplete acetylation.|$|E
25|$|Opium poppy {{contains}} {{at least}} 50 different alkaloids, {{but most of}} them are of very low concentration. Morphine is the principal alkaloid in raw opium and constitutes roughly 8–19% of opium by dry weight (depending on growing conditions). Some purpose-developed strains of poppy now produce opium that is up to 26% morphine by weight. A rough rule of thumb to determine the morphine content of pulverised dried <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> is to divide the percentage expected for the strain or crop via the latex method by eight or an empirically determined factor, which is often in the range of 5 to 15. The Norman strain of P. Somniferum, also developed in Tasmania, produces down to 0.04% morphine but with much higher amounts of thebaine and oripavine, which can be used to synthesise semi-synthetic opioids as well as other drugs like stimulants, emetics, opioid antagonists, anticholinergics, and smooth-muscle agents.|$|E
25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E
2500|$|Codeine {{is found}} in {{concentrations}} of 1% to 3% in opium prepared by the latex method from unripe pods of Papaver somniferum. The name codeine {{is derived from the}} Greek word kodeia (κώδεια) for [...] "poppy head". The relative proportion of codeine to morphine, the most common opium alkaloid at 4% to 23%, tends to be somewhat higher in the <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> method of preparing opium alkaloids.|$|E
2500|$|The {{region was}} a major {{producer}} of raw opium (hence the name Afyon) until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the USA in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased. [...] Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime. [...] They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> method of extraction.|$|E
2500|$|In India, opium {{harvested}} by licensed poppy farmers is dehydrated to uniform {{levels of}} hydration at government processing centers, and then sold to pharmaceutical companies that extract morphine from the opium. However, in Turkey and Tasmania, morphine is obtained by harvesting and processing the fully mature dry seed pods with attached stalks, called <b>poppy</b> <b>straw.</b> [...] In Turkey, a water extraction process is used, while in Tasmania, a {{solvent extraction process}} is used.|$|E
5000|$|Annual world {{production}} of opium and <b>poppy</b> <b>straw,</b> both legal and illegal, is tabulated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and reported in its annual World Drug Report. The quantity of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> produced is typically given as [...] "opium equivalents". The 2002 World Drug Report {{estimate of the}} total world opium production, including opium equivalents of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw,</b> was [...] in 1906/07 and [...] in 2007. The 2007 production consisted of [...] of illegal opium, [...] of opium equivalent from legal <b>poppy</b> <b>straw,</b> and [...] of legal opium. [...] Thus, over 90% of the world {{production of}} legal opiates, including medical morphine, now is produced from <b>poppy</b> <b>straw.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Poppy</b> <b>straw</b> {{is first}} pulverized, then washed {{as many as}} six to ten or more times in water and/or various acids and other chemicals, to produce <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> {{concentrate}} (PSC, also known as concentrate of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw,</b> CPS). Dried, the concentrate is a beige to brown powder. It contains salts of various alkaloids, and can range from nine to 30 times the morphine concentration of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw.</b> Opium concentrates using solvents other than acidifed or plain water are often but not necessarily called PSC.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of illegal opium from <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> is limited. It is reported primarily in clandestine laboratories in Moldova, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, using domestic <b>poppy</b> <b>straw.</b>|$|E

50|$|Harvesting of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> is an alternative, largely {{mechanized}} method. The {{plants are}} allowed to mature fully, then a machine is used to harvest the entire field. The ripe poppy seeds are separated out by threshing and winnowing, and the remainder is <b>poppy</b> <b>straw.</b> <b>Poppy</b> <b>straw</b> usually consists of only the above ground parts of the plant, but the roots may be harvested as well. Some producers mow the plants high, so that the harvest consists almost entirely of the fruits (seed pods), omitting the stalks, leaves, and roots. <b>Poppy</b> <b>straw</b> is then processed {{in a manner similar}} to opium to extract opiates and other alkaloids (see Morphine).|$|E
50|$|The {{poppy seed}} harvest {{can be a}} {{by-product}} of opium poppy cultivation for opium, <b>poppy</b> <b>straw,</b> or both opium and <b>poppy</b> <b>straw.</b> Conversely, <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> can be a by-product of cultivation of poppy seeds. Compared to the seed pod and straw, the seeds contain very low levels of opiates. The seeds may be washed to obtain poppy tea but a large amount is needed, around 300-400g depending on the levels of opiates.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Poppy</b> <b>straw</b> is a raw {{material}} from which illegal heroin may be produced. The alkaloid profiles of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> and opium are similar, but preliminary research suggests {{they can be}} distinguished by relative quantities of alkaloids. [...] Based {{on the presence of}} the alkaloid oripavine in some opium poppies, {{it has been suggested that}} illegal heroin seized in Australia was produced from a legal <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> crop stolen in Tasmania a few years earlier.|$|E

50|$|In 2012 146,000 {{kilograms}} of thebaine were produced. In 2013, Australia {{was the main}} producer of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> rich in thebaine, followed by Spain and then France.

50|$|<b>Poppy</b> <b>straw</b> (also mowed opium straw, crushed poppy capsule, poppy chaff, poppy husk) {{is derived}} from opium poppies (Papaver somniferum) that is {{harvested}} when fully mature and dried by mechanical means, minus the ripe poppy seeds. Opium <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> today {{can be one of}} several different things. It is what remains after the poppy seed harvest, that is, the dried stalks, stem and leaves of poppies grown for their seeds. The dried leaves and stalk harvested after the seed pod have been used for traditional opium extraction. The field dried leaves, stalk and seed pod are used in commercial manufacture of morphine or other poppy alkaloid derived drugs, by first processing the material to make <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> separating the seeds then making concentrate of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw,</b> where no extraction using traditional methods of latex extraction has been made. The straw was originally considered an agricultural by-product of the mechanised poppy seed harvest, which was primarily grown for its edible and oil-producing seed. This changed in 1927 when János Kabay developed a chemical process to extract morphine from the crushed capsule. Concentrated <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> consisting mainly of the crushed capsule without the seeds soon became a valuable source of morphine. Today, concentrate of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> is a major source of many opiates and other alkaloids It is the source of 90% of the world supply of legal morphine (for medical and scientific use) and in some countries it also is a source of illegal morphine, which could be processed into illegal heroin.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{establishment}} of <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> {{as the source of}} the majority of natural morphine and other opiates, much of the world production of opium is destined for illicit uses. In 1981 dried capsules were found being sold for decoration in Sweden, that had been lanced 2 to 5 times with a tool having 3 to 4 blades and the opium scraped off. The morphine content of these capsules was 0.15 - 0.34%, comparable to domestic Swedish capsules not lanced. In India, <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> from lanced capsules had a morphine content of at least 0.2%. These levels of morphine obtained from [...] "exhausted" [...] plants suggests that for producers of licit opium, <b>poppy</b> <b>straw</b> may be a profitable second crop.|$|E
