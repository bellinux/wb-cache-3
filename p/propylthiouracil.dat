5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as <b>propylthiouracil,</b> carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
5|$|Thyroxine is {{critical}} to the regulation of metabolism and growth throughout the animal kingdom. For example, Iodine and T4 trigger the change from a plant-eating water-dwelling tadpole into a meat-eating land-dwelling frog, with better neurological, visuospatial, smell and cognitive abilities for hunting, as seen in other predatory animals. A similar phenomenon happens in the neotenic amphibian salamanders, which, without introducing iodine, don't transform into land-dwelling adults, and live and reproduce in the larval form of aquatic axolotl. Among amphibians, administering a thyroid-blocking agent such as <b>propylthiouracil</b> (PTU) can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs; in contrast, administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis. In amphibian metamorphosis, thyroxine and iodine also exert a well-studied experimental model of apoptosis on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles. Iodine, via iodolipids, has favored the evolution of terrestrial animal species and has likely {{played a crucial role in}} the evolution of the human brain.|$|E
5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as <b>propylthiouracil,</b> which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} antiâ€“tumor {{necrosis}} factor medications such as infliximab and etanercept are unclear and possibly harmful. Evidence is unclear for pentoxifylline. <b>Propylthiouracil</b> {{may result in}} harm.|$|E
25|$|A {{randomized}} control trial testing single-dose {{treatment for}} Graves' found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthyouracil (77.1% on methimazole 15mg vs 19.4% in the <b>propylthiouracil</b> 150mg groups).|$|E
25|$|Many {{drugs can}} cause mouth ulcers {{as a side}} effect. Common {{examples}} are alendronate (a bisphosphonate, commonly prescribed for osteoporosis), cytotoxic drugs (e.g. methotrexate, i.e. chemotherapy), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nicorandil (may be prescribed for angina) and <b>propylthiouracil</b> (e.g. used for hyperthyroidism). Some recreational drugs can cause ulceration, e.g. cocaine.|$|E
2500|$|... {{have been}} {{associated}} with agranulocytosis, including antiepileptics (such as carbamazepine and valproate), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, methimazole, and <b>propylthiouracil),</b> antibiotics (penicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole), ACE inhibitors (benazepril), cytotoxic drugs, gold, NSAIDs (indomethacin, naproxen, phenylbutazone, metamizole), mebendazole, allopurinol the antidepressants mianserin and mirtazapine, and some antipsychotics (the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in particular). Clozapine users in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK must be nationally registered for monitoring of low WBC and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC).|$|E
5000|$|Sulfadimethoxine, <b>propylthiouracil,</b> {{potassium}} perchlorate, and iopanoic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylthiouracil</b> can be {{prepared}} from ethyl 3-oxohexanoate and thiourea.|$|E
50|$|Methylthiouracil is an antithyroid preparation. It is a thioamide, {{closely related}} to <b>propylthiouracil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Members of the thioamide group include methimazole, {{carbimazole}} (converted in vivo to methimazole), and <b>propylthiouracil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Toxic multinodular goiter can {{be treated}} with antithyroid {{medications}} such as <b>propylthiouracil</b> or methimazole, radioactive iodine, or with surgery.|$|E
5000|$|TPO is {{inhibited}} by the thioamide drugs, such as <b>propylthiouracil</b> and methimazole. [...] In laboratory rats with insufficient iodine intake, genistein {{has demonstrated}} inhibition of TPO.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} anti-tumor {{necrosis}} factor medications such as infliximab and etanercept are unclear and possibly harmful. Evidence is unclear for pentoxifylline. <b>Propylthiouracil</b> {{may result in}} harm.|$|E
50|$|Thiamazole (INN) or methimazole (USAN) is an antithyroid drug, {{and part}} of the thioamide group. Like its {{counterpart}} <b>propylthiouracil,</b> possible major side effects of treatment include agranulocytosis and liver inflammation.|$|E
50|$|PDE activation: Other bitter compounds, such as {{thioacetamide}} and <b>propylthiouracil,</b> {{have been}} shown to have stimulatory effects on PDEs. This mechanism has been recognized in bovine tongue epithelium contains fungiform papillae.|$|E
50|$|A {{randomized}} control trial testing single-dose {{treatment for}} Graves' found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthyouracil (77.1% on methimazole 15 mg vs 19.4% in the <b>propylthiouracil</b> 150 mg groups).|$|E
50|$|Thyrostatics (antithyroid drugs) are {{drugs that}} inhibit the {{production}} of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole (used in the UK) and methimazole (used in the US), and <b>propylthiouracil.</b> Thyrostatics are believed to work by inhibiting the iodination of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and, thus, the formation of tetraiodothyronine (T4). <b>Propylthiouracil</b> also works outside the thyroid gland, preventing the conversion of (mostly inactive) T4 to the active form T3. Because thyroid tissue usually contains a substantial reserve of thyroid hormone, thyrostatics can take weeks to become effective and the dose often needs to be carefully titrated {{over a period of}} months, with regular doctor visits and blood tests to monitor results.|$|E
50|$|Whilst rashes and {{pruritus}} are common, {{these can}} often be treated with antihistamines without stopping the carbimazole. For those patients where sensitivity reactions can not be controlled, <b>propylthiouracil</b> {{may be used as}} an alternative; cross-sensitivity between these drugs is rare.|$|E
50|$|A {{randomized}} control trial testing {{single dose}} treatment for Graves' found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthyouracil (77.1% on methimazole 15 mg vs 19.4% in the <b>propylthiouracil</b> 150 mg groups). But generally both drugs are considered equivalent.|$|E
50|$|Accurate {{interpretation}} takes {{a variety}} of factors into account, such as the thyroid hormones i.e. thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), current medical status (such as pregnancy), certain medications like <b>propylthiouracil,</b> temporal effects including circadian rhythm and hysteresis, and other past medical history.|$|E
50|$|Iodine uptake {{against a}} {{concentration}} gradient is mediated by a sodium-iodine symporter and {{is linked to}} a sodium-potassium ATPase. Perchlorate and thiocyanate are drugs that can compete with iodine at this point. Compounds such as goitrin, carbimazole, methimazole, <b>propylthiouracil</b> can reduce thyroid hormone production by interfering with iodine oxidation.|$|E
50|$|Many {{drugs can}} cause mouth ulcers {{as a side}} effect. Common {{examples}} are alendronate (a bisphosphonate, commonly prescribed for osteoporosis), cytotoxic drugs (e.g. methotrexate, i.e. chemotherapy), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nicorandil (may be prescribed for angina) and <b>propylthiouracil</b> (e.g. used for hyperthyroidism). Some recreational drugs can cause ulceration, e.g. cocaine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylthiouracil</b> (PTU) is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} hyperthyroidism. This includes hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter. In a thyrotoxic crisis it is generally more effective than methimazole. Otherwise it is typically only used when methimazole, surgery, and radioactive iodine is not possible. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Other {{life-threatening}} {{side effect}} is sudden, severe, fulminant liver failure resulting in death or liver transplantation, which occurs {{in up to}} 1 in 10,000 people taking <b>propylthiouracil.</b> Unlike agranulocytosis which most commonly occurs {{in the first three}} months of therapy, this side effect may occur at any time during treatment.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolic}} rate {{can be affected}} by some drugs, such as antithyroid agents, drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism, such as <b>propylthiouracil</b> and methimazole, bring the {{metabolic rate}} down to normal and restore euthyroidism. Some {{research has focused on}} developing antiobesity drugs to raise the metabolic rate, such as drugs to stimulate thermogenesis in skeletal muscle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylthiouracil</b> is {{generally}} well tolerated, with side effects occurring {{in one of}} every 100 patients. The most common side effects {{are related to the}} skin, and include rash, itching, hives, abnormal hair loss, and skin pigmentation. Other common side effects are swelling, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, loss of taste, joint or muscle aches, numbness and headache, allergic reactions, and hair whitening.|$|E
5000|$|Its notable {{side effects}} include {{a risk of}} {{agranulocytosis}} and aplastic anemia. On 3 June 2009, the FDA published an alert [...] "notifying healthcare professionals {{of the risk of}} serious liver injury, including liver failure and death, with the use of propylthiouracil." [...] As a result, <b>propylthiouracil</b> is no longer recommended in non-pregnant adults and in children as the front line antithyroid medication.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of action {{are not completely}} understood. Some scientists believe that anti-thyroids inhibit iodination of tyrosyl residues in thyroglobulin. It is thought that they inhibit the thyroperoxidase catalyzed oxidation reactions by acting as substrates for the postulated peroxidase-iodine complex, thus competitively inhibiting the interaction with the amino acid tyrosine. <b>Propylthiouracil</b> additionally may reduce the de-iodination of T4 into T3 in peripheral tissues.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include itchiness, hair loss, swelling, vomiting, muscle pains, numbness, and headache. Other severe side effects include liver {{problems}} and low blood cell counts. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. <b>Propylthiouracil</b> {{is in the}} antithyroid family of medications. It works by decreasing the amount of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland and blocking the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3).|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylthiouracil</b> {{came into}} medical {{use in the}} 1940s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 3.62 USD a month. In the United Kingdom a month costs the NHS about 52.51 pounds. In the United States the wholesale price is 38.34 USD per month.|$|E
50|$|The most {{dangerous}} side-effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU); {{this is an}} idiosyncratic reaction which generally resolves on cessation of drug. It occurs in about 0.2 to 0.3% of cases treated with antithyroid drugs. Others include granulocytopenia (dose dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia, and for <b>propylthiouracil</b> severe, fulminant liver failure. Patients on these medications should see a doctor if they develop sore throat or fever.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first choice}} {{involves}} using medications {{to alleviate the}} symptoms and reverse the damage by blocking the production of thyroxine from the thyroid gland. Beta-blockers are used to alleviate the symptoms associated with TM. But beta-blockers do not reduce {{the damage done by}} excess thyroxine. Medications such as <b>propylthiouracil</b> and methimazole are administered to block the release of thyroxine from the thyroid and to block the damage thyroxine inflicts on muscle fiber tissue.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of drugshave been {{associated}} with agranulocytosis, including antiepileptics (such as carbamazepine and valproate), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, methimazole, and <b>propylthiouracil),</b> antibiotics (penicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole), ACE inhibitors (benazepril), cytotoxic drugs, gold, NSAIDs (indomethacin, naproxen, phenylbutazone, metamizole), mebendazole, allopurinol the antidepressants mianserin and mirtazapine, and some antipsychotics (the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in particular). Clozapine users in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK must be nationally registered for monitoring of low WBC and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC).|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, Roland Fischer was {{the first}} to link the ability to taste PTC, and the related {{compound}} <b>propylthiouracil</b> (PROP), to food preference and body type. Today, PROP has replaced PTC in taste research because of a faint sulfurous odor and safety concerns with PTC. As described above, Bartoshuk and colleagues discovered that the taster group could be further divided into medium tasters and supertasters. Most estimates suggest 25% of the population are nontasters, 50% are medium tasters, and 25% are supertasters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylthiouracil</b> is {{classified}} as Drug Class D in pregnancy. Class D signifies there is positive evidence of human fetal risk. Maternal benefit may outweigh fetal risk in life-threatening situations. PTU is preferred over methimazole (which is also a class D) only in the first trimester of pregnancy and in woman who may become pregnant because of the increased risk of teratogenicity of methimazole during critical organogenesis. In {{the second and third}} trimester, this risk is diminished and methimazole is preferred to avoid the risk of liver complications from PTU in the mother.|$|E
