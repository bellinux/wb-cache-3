The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, had received 60 requests for public assistance throughout the area. Monetary value for the assistance was estimated at $3million and growing. Twenty-five departments and agencies were approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works. Several non-profit organizations also received support from FEMA, while those that did not meet the criteria were referred to the Small Business Administrationâ€™s low-interest loan program.|$|E
5|$|The {{private sector}} has {{also played a}} large role in revitalizing the area, even without <b>public</b> <b>aid</b> and incentives. Developers have been {{attracted}} to the historic buildings and their surrounding neighborhoods, calling it the city's strongest asset, although they have complained about past stalemates in city government. One initiative has often led to others. River Street's development into a center for antique stores came about without any public effort or intent, and the restoration of the music hall at the Savings Bank led to many new restaurants opening in the neighborhood. The blocks of River Street north of Monument Square have a dozen woman-owned businesses.|$|E

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>aids</b> towards {{renewable}} energy sources in Spain have had the consequence of a great increase in their use. This is particularly true for the case of wind generation. For the year 2007, we show that the savings in social costs due to carbon emissions account for a figure between 25 % and 78 % of total aids. Since some of the <b>public</b> <b>aids</b> are just a money transfer with no effect on total social welfare the justification of the net costs of the aids is higher. For the particular case of wind generation, we find that in the worst case scenario 45 % of the social cost implied by the <b>public</b> <b>aids</b> is justified by the reduction in carbon emissions, and {{that the benefits of}} CO 2 reductions are 135 % higher than the costs in the best case scenario. ...|$|R

2500|$|Mutual aid was a {{foundation}} of social welfare in the United States until the early 20th Century. Early societies not only shared material resources, but often advanced social values related to self-reliance and moral character. Many fraternal organizations were first organized as mutual aid societies when government {{at the state and}} local level supplemented private aid societies more than the converse of this being true. In 1890, 112,000 American residents lived in private charitable institutions, while only 73,000 resided in public almshouses. Towards the latter part of the nineteenth century, <b>public</b> <b>aid</b> was reduced as it was seen as contributing to sloth and dependency while private aid was judiciously provided with greater checks for reform and recovery.

2500|$|Twenty-two {{percent of}} Parisians earned {{less than three}} francs a day, and for them, daily life was a struggle.

[...] Many came to the city early in the Empire for the unskilled work demolishing buildings and moving earth for the new boulevards. [...] When the work ended, few of the new immigrants left.

[...] The assistance ended when the recipients recovered; the average payment was 50 francs per family per year. Those who were old or had incurable illnesses were sent to a hospice.

60|$|We must trust {{infinitely}} to the beneficent necessity which shines {{through all}} laws. Human nature expresses itself in them as characteristically as in statues, or songs, or railroads; and an abstract of the codes of nations {{would be a}} transcript of the common conscience. Governments {{have their origin in}} the moral identity of men. Reason for one is seen to be reason for another, and for every other. There is a middle measure which satisfies all parties, be they never so many or so resolute for their own. Every man finds a sanction for his simplest claims and deeds in decisions of his own mind, which he calls Truth and Holiness. In these decisions all the citizens find a perfect agreement, and only in these; not in what is good to eat, good to wear, good use of time, or what amount of land or of <b>public</b> <b>aid,</b> each is entitled to claim. This truth and justice men presently endeavor to make application of to the measuring of land, the apportionment of service, the protection of life and property. Their first endeavors, no doubt, are very awkward. Yet absolute right is the first governor; or, every government is an impure theocracy. The idea after which each community is aiming to make and mend its law, is the will of the wise man. The wise man it cannot find in nature, and it makes awkward but earnest efforts to secure his government by contrivance; as by causing the entire people to give their voices on every measure; or by a double choice to get the representation of the whole; or, by a selection of the best citizens; or to secure the advantages of efficiency and internal peace by confiding the government to one, who may himself select his agents. All forms of government symbolize an immortal government, common to all dynasties and independent of numbers, perfect where two men exist, perfect where there is only one man.|$|E
