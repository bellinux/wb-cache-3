25|$|For <b>physical</b> <b>storage</b> of a table, its rows {{are divided}} {{into a series of}} {{partitions}} (numbered 1 to n). The partition size is user defined; by default all rows are in a single partition. A table is split into multiple partitions in order to spread a database over a computer cluster. Rows in each partition are stored in either B-tree or heap structure. If the table has an associated, clustered index to allow fast retrieval of rows, the rows are stored in-order according to their index values, with a B-tree providing the index. The data is in the leaf node of the leaves, and other nodes storing the index values for the leaf data reachable from the respective nodes. If the index is non-clustered, the rows are not sorted according to the index keys. An indexed view has the same storage structure as an indexed table. A table without a clustered index is stored in an unordered heap structure. However, the table may have non-clustered indices to allow fast retrieval of rows. In some situations the heap structure has performance advantages over the clustered structure. Both heaps and B-trees can span multiple allocation units.|$|E
500|$|A digital {{forensic}} investigation commonly {{consists of}} 3 stages: acquisition or imaging of exhibits, analysis, and reporting. Ideally acquisition involves capturing {{an image of}} the computer's volatile memory (RAM) and creating an exact sector level duplicate (or [...] "forensic duplicate") of the media, often using a write blocking device to prevent modification of the original. However, the growth in size of storage media and developments such as cloud computing [...] have led to more use of 'live' acquisitions whereby a 'logical' copy of the data is acquired rather than a complete image of the <b>physical</b> <b>storage</b> device. Both acquired image (or logical copy) and original media/data are hashed (using an algorithm such as SHA-1 or MD5) and the values compared to verify the copy is accurate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physical}} devices used by ZFS (such as {{hard drives}} (HDDs) and SSDs) are organized into vdevs ("virtual devices") before {{being used to}} store data. [...] The vdev {{is an essential part}} of ZFS resilience, since it provides redundancy against physical device failure within ZFS. Therefore, it is easiest to describe ZFS <b>physical</b> <b>storage</b> by first looking at vdevs.|$|E

30|$|A McRAIT {{controller}} has {{two major}} functions: multiplexing/demultiplexing (MUX/DEMUX) and {{communication with the}} markers and the sender/receiver main program. Additional functions can also be embedded in the McRAIT controller. For example, the McRAIT controller can have authentication, data encryption, and special operation commands such as batch deletion. A McRAIT controller should {{also be able to}} perform all functions autonomously. Each read and write operation in the RFID tags has to be atomic in the controller so that it can provide, later, multiple <b>physical</b> <b>storages</b> as one logical mapping without requiring preprocessing for the main program. The McRAIT controller is also capable of reporting communication failure(s) to the main program when it reissues the commands over certain number of times.|$|R
5000|$|Block {{virtualization}} used in {{this context}} refers to the abstraction (separation) of logical storage (partition) from <b>physical</b> <b>storage</b> so {{that it may be}} accessed without regard to <b>physical</b> <b>storage</b> or heterogeneous structure.
