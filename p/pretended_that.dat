5|$|Anchored in Manila Bay, Cooke <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> his {{ships were}} French vessels and {{successfully}} lured successive boatloads of Spanish officials aboard, taking them prisoner in turn. Once he had determined from his captives {{the state of}} defences in Manila, that the treasure ship had been unloaded at Cavite and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations, he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats {{in the mouth of}} the Pasig River. Capturing the gunboats in a bloodless attack, Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards, unsuccessfully assaulting Zamboanga before returning to Macau.|$|E
5|$|From {{that point}} onwards, Kouao <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> Climbié was her daughter. Kouao had {{originally}} {{planned to take}} another young girl called Anna Kouao, but Anna's parents changed their minds. Climbié travelled on a French passport {{in the name of}} Anna Kouao and was known as Anna throughout her life in the United Kingdom. It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbié. Climbié's parents received three messages about her from when she left them until her death, all saying she was in good health.|$|E
5|$|By March 1806, the French {{squadron}} under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois {{had been}} operating against British {{trade in the}} Indian Ocean and elsewhere {{since the start of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1803. Despatched to India before war was declared, Linois left Brest in March 1803, sailing to the South China Sea in an effort to intercept the China Fleet, a huge merchant convoy from Canton to Britain via Madras that carried goods worth in excess of £8 million. On 15 February 1804, Linois encountered the China Fleet, which due to delays with the squadron in India had sailed without its Royal Navy escort. The loss of this undefended convoy could have devastated the British economy and been the highlight of Linois's career, but instead the French admiral was fooled by a ruse of the convoy commander, Commodore Nathaniel Dance. Dance <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> some of his East Indiaman merchant ships were disguised ships of the line and engaged Linois at long range, dissuading the French commander from pressing the attack. Dance's merchant ships even pursued the fleeing French squadron for some distance, before resuming their original course. This affair, known as the Battle of Pulo Aura, was a humiliation for Linois and provoked Napoleon's fury when the Emperor was informed of it by the governor of Île de France, Charles Decaen.|$|E

5|$|The {{first public}} {{announcement}} of the cancellation of the Paramount Television Service and Phase II came {{at the hands of}} the gossip columnist Rona Barrett at the start of December. In response, Paramount released a statement that said the new network had been pushed back to the fall of 1978, and that Phase II had its episode order increased from 13 to between 15 and 22. Despite this, behind the scenes, production continued on Star Trek as a film, not as a series. One of the changes around the same time as Barrett's reports was the realization that all the model work completed thus far had to be restarted from scratch, as it was not detailed enough to be blown up on a motion picture-sized screen. Two further changes took place in December: Collins was dropped as director, for Paramount wanted a motion picture director and not one with experience only in television; and Livingston allowed his contract to run out and left the production, owing to the poor relationship he had with Roddenberry. By January, Paramount no longer <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> Star Trek was to be anything other than a feature film. Livingston was brought back, but only in a writing capacity, and Robert Wise was hired as director on the film to replace Collins.|$|E
25|$|Although it was <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> the {{decision}} had been Geddes’ alone, he let slip in the Naval Estimates debate (6 March 1918) {{that he had been}} conveying “{{the decision}} of the Government”, i.e. of Lloyd George, who had never put the matter to the War Cabinet. MPs picked up on his slip immediately, and Bonar Law (Conservative Leader) admitted in the same debate that he too had had prior knowledge.|$|E
25|$|In {{a meeting}} with the British Ambassador Goschen, Bethmann Hollweg made the flagrantly false {{statement}} that Germany was trying to pressure Austria to abandon the war against Serbia. As Prince Henry of Prussia <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> King George V had promised him that Britain would remain neutral, the Kaiser rejected Bethmann Hollweg's offer of a naval agreement with Britain, stating that Germany did not have to offer Britain anything now that King George had apparently promised his country's neutrality.|$|E

Her illegitimate son, Alexis Louis de Wenden, was born in Nice on 23 December 1902. The name de Wenden was granted by King Christian IX of Denmark after Anastasia's villa. She did bring up her illegitimate son herself. When later he was sent to study in a boarding school in Normandy, she wrote to him every day.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the Transylvanian noblemen who had fled to the Ottoman Empire, Gabriel Bethlen, {{sent a letter to}} Bocskai urging him to rise up against Rudolph, but Bocskai refused. To award Bocskai for his loyalty, Rudolph {{restored}} to him almost all his estates in Transylvania proper on 2July 1604. Bocskai visited Transylvania and realized that the towns and villages had almost completely been destroyed during the previous years. On his way back from Transylvania, on 20September he learnt that Hajdús had seized a letter about his alleged correspondence with the Grand Vizier, Lala Mehmed Pasha, from Gabriel Bethlen. Fearing reprisals, Bocskai hurried to Sólyomkő and <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> gout had paralysed him. Actually, he ordered his castellans to make preparations for resistance, but one of them revealed Bocskai's plans to Cipriano Concini, the deputy captain of Várad.|$|E
25|$|In 248, Ezhesai (蛾遮塞) and the Qiang rebels {{occupied}} fortresses in Heguan (河關; in {{the vicinity}} of present-day Dingxi, Gansu) and Baitu (白土; in present-day Minhe County, Qinghai) counties and used them as defences against Wei forces across the Tao River. Guo Huai <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> he was going to attack from upstream, but actually secretly ordered his troops to cross the river downstream to attack Baitu. The assault was successful and the rebels were defeated. Zhiwudai (治無戴) led his tribal forces to attack Wuwei Commandery but left his family in Xihai Commandery (西海郡; near the Juyan Lake Basin, Inner Mongolia). When Guo Huai learnt about it, he led his troops to attack Xihai Commandery, but encountered Zhiwudai and his forces, who were on their way back from Wuwei Commandery. The two armies clashed at the north of Longyi County (龍夷縣), with the Wei forces emerging victorious and Zhiwudai's forces retreating.|$|E

25|$|After {{eighteen}} months a scandal arose, {{which led to}} Nephon's removal. Specifically, the previous Patriarch Symeon I died without making his will. İşkender Bey, one of the sons of Symeon's main sponsor, George Amiroutzes, had converted to Islam and {{was at the time}} the treasurer of the Sultan. He requested that all the inheritance of Symeon, which included also ecclesiastic items, should pass to the Sultan's treasury. To avoid this, Nephon <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> a nephew of the deceased patriarch was the legitimate heir, finding three monks that bore false witness. After discovering the truth, the Sultan Bayezid II confiscated the property of Symeon, punished the clergy involved in the scandal, and exiled Nephon. Nephon was exiled to some island in the Black Sea off Sozopol and was deposed in the first months of 1488. According to scholar Steven Runciman, Nephon was a foolish and unsatisfactory Patriarch.|$|E
25|$|In 399, three {{laws were}} enacted in the west, under the {{influence}} of Stilicho, which were relatively favorable to the pagans. Due to the riots caused by Christians in their attempts to destroy the temples, the first of these laws protected the pagan temples from the destruction of zealous Christians who <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> they had been authorized by the government to destroy them. The second of these laws acknowledged {{the right of the people}} to continue to participate in traditional banquets, shows, gatherings and amusements once associated with the old pagan ways; it did, however, forbid the public performance of any pagan religious rites or sacrifice, an intrinsic part of a religion supported by custom rather than by argument. The third law forbade the destruction of pagan temples that had been cleared of forbidden things and ordered that they were to be kept in good repair even though the purpose for which they were first built was now prohibited.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the main}} Byzantine forces {{were engaged in}} the east against the Arabs, Leo VI turned to the well-tried methods of Byzantine {{diplomacy}} and sent envoys with rich gifts to the Magyars, who in that time inhabited the steppes to the north-east of Bulgaria. When Simeon I refused to conclude peace and imprisoned the Byzantine envoy Konstantinakios, {{at the end of}} 894 the Byzantine navy was used to ferry the Magyars across the Danube, {{despite the fact that the}} Bulgarians had barred the river with chains and ropes. Simeon I, who was at the Byzantine-Bulgarian border facing the general Nikephoros Phokas, had to march northwards to confront them. His army was defeated by the Magyars somewhere in Dobruja and Simeon himself had to flee to the strong fortress Drastar. The Magyars looted and pillaged unopposed, reaching the outskirts of the capital Preslav, and after they sold the captives to the Byzantines they retreated to the north of the Danube. Then Simeon <b>pretended</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to negotiate and put forward the issue of prisoner exchange. The Byzantines sent Leo Choirosphaktes in Preslav to negotiate the terms. As Simeon needed time to address the Magyar threat, he deliberately prolonged the negotiations and Choirosphaktes was repeatedly refused an audience. In the meantime Simeon allied with the Pechenegs, while the people even appealed to his father Boris I, who had become a monk, to assume the command of the army. In the decisive battle the Magyars suffered a devastating defeat, but the victorious Bulgarians were themselves said to have lost 20,000 riders. That was the only victory in the battlefield Boris I ever achieved. As a result of this defeat, the Magyars had to move westwards and settle in Pannonia, where they later established the Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E
