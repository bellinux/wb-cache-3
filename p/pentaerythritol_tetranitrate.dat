50|$|Detonating cord (also called {{detonation}} cord, detacord, det. cord, detcord, primer cord or sun cord) is a thin, flexible {{plastic tube}} usually filled with <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN, pentrite).

The velocity of detonation is sufficient to use it for synchronising multiple charges to detonate almost simultaneously even if the charges are placed at different distances from the point of initiation.

50|$|In the 1980s the {{discovery}} of zinc peroxide’s ability to complement pyrotechnical mixtures was discovered. It was noted that ZnO2 was preferable to the usage of barium compounds, as it was deemed to be less toxic. The zinc compound proves an effective component in explosives because of its oxidizing properties. Many chemical explosives rely on rapid oxidation reactions, for this reason ZnO2 is an ideal candidate for use in pyrotechnics. Another advantage of ZnO2 was, {{as compared to the}} barium and strontium pyroingredients, it effects less corrosion in the metallic materials which contain the compounds in the pyrotechnic instrument. In one modality it is necessary for zinc peroxide to act in conjunction with a reducer like calcium silicide, to create the necessary red/ox reaction. In another modality, a ‘secondary’ explosive is mixed with zinc peroxide. Secondary explosives include nitrocellulose, <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN), as well as a variety of compounds, like trinitrobenzene, which provide powerful negative charge balance.These secondary explosives are relatively insensitive to stimuli such as physical impact, heat or charge. The explosive mixture would be comprised, in bulk, of the secondary explosive with a much smaller fraction of zinc peroxide, present to initiate the reaction.|$|E

This test was undertaken at ground level, with zero pressure differential between the cabin and the surrounding environment. This was claimed to have no effect on the overall result of the test, which aimed to simulate the explosion at 10000 ft. It was not demonstrated what would happen at a typical cruising altitude of between 31000 ft and 39000 ft, where the pressure differential would have caused the fuselage to be under a far greater stress than at ground level.|$|E
50|$|Scientists around Daniel Rugar and John Mamin at the IBM {{research}} laboratories in Almaden {{have been}} the pioneers in using heated AFM (atomic force microscope) probes for the modification of surfaces. In 1992, they used microsecond laser pulses to heat AFM tips to write indents as small as 150 nm into the polymer PMMA at rates of 100 kHz. In the following years, they developed cantilevers with resonance frequencies above 4 MHz and integrated resistive heaters and piezoresistive sensors for writing and reading of data. This thermo-mechanical data storage concept {{formed the basis of}} the Millipede project which was initialized by Peter Vettiger and Gerd Binnig at the IBM Research laboratories Zurich in 1995. It was an example of a memory storage device with a large array of parallel probes, which was however never commercialized due to growing competition from non-volatile memory such as flash memory. The storage medium of the Millipede memory consisted of polymers with shape memory functionality, like e.g. cross-linked polystyrene, in order to allow to write data indents by plastic deformation and erasing of the data again by heating. However, evaporation instead of plastic deformation was necessary for nanolithography applications to be able to create any pattern in the resist. Such local evaporation of resist induced by a heated tip could achieved for several materials like <b>Pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate,</b> cross-linked polycarbonates, and Diels-Alder polymers. Significant progress in the choice of resist material was made in 2010 at IBM Research in Zurich, leading to high resolution and precise 3D-relief patterning {{with the use of the}} self-amplified depolymerization polymer polyphthalaldehyde (PPA) and molecular glasses as resist, where the polymer decomposes into volatile monomers upon heating with the tip without the application of mechanical force and without pile-up or residues of the resist.|$|E
