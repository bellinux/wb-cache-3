Specifically, given an unlabeled DNA sequence S, we want {{to determine whether or not}} S is an <b>E.</b> <b>Coli</b> promoter. We use an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to locate the- 35 and- 10 binding sites in an <b>E.</b> <b>Coli</b> promoter sequence. The EM algorithm differs from previously published EM algorithms in that, instead of assuming a uniform distribution for the lengths of the spacer between the- 35 binding site and the- 10 binding site as well as the spacer between the- 10 binding site and the transcriptional start site, our algorithm deduces the probability distribution for these lengths. Based on the located binding sites, we select features in each <b>E.</b> <b>Coli</b> promoter sequence according to their information contents and represent the features using an orthogonal encoding method. We then feed the features to a neural network for promoter recognition. Empirical studies show that the proposed approach achieves good performance on different datasets...|$|R

However, AMA-positivity {{can be found}} in non-PBC sera when lower dilutions are used, thus raising issues about the specificity and sensitivity of the test. AMA reacts primarily with the lipoylated domains of pyruvate dehydrogenase-E 2 (PDC-E 2) which is highly conserved across species, including bacteria. We studied 77 serum samples, including 24 from patients with anti-PDC-E 2 -positive PBC and 53 controls (16 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), 10 with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and 27 healthy individuals) for their reactivities at serial dilutions (1 : 10, 1 : 20 and 1 : 40) against Escherichia coli DH 5 alpha lysate overexpressing human PDC-E 2 using immunoblotting (IB). A murine anti-human PDC-E 2 monoclonal antibody (mAB) was used as control. We further studied positive sera using adsorption with a synthetic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> peptide sharing similarity with human PDC-E 2. Finally, we verified whether a unique buffer for <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> preparation could reduce non-specific serum reactivity. Results demonstrated that 100 % of anti-PDC-E 2 -positive PBC and up to 38 % of control sera at 1 : 10 dilution <b>recognized</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> PDC-E 2 at IB while dilution tests indicated that the overall potency of PBC reactivity was 100 -fold higher compared to controls. In fact, a subgroup (20 - 38 %) of non-PBC sera were positive at low titers but lost the reactivity when absorbed with the synthetic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> peptide. Finally, our unique buffer reduced the reactivity of non-PBC sera as measured by ELISA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that weak cross-reactivity with <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> PDC-E 2 occurs in non-PBC sera at lower dilutions and that such reactivity is not due to AMA-positivity.

40|$|In gram-negative organisms, high-affinity {{transport}} of iron substrates requires energy transduction to specific outer membrane receptors by the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex. Vibrio cholerae encodes two TonB proteins, one of which, TonB 1, recognizes only {{a subset of}} V. cholerae TonB-dependent receptors and does not facilitate transport through Escherichia coli receptors. To investigate the receptor specificity exhibited by V. cholerae TonB 1, chimeras were created between V. cholerae TonB 1 and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> TonB. The activities of the chimeric TonB proteins in iron utilization assays demonstrated that the C-terminal one-third of either TonB confers the receptor specificities associated with the full-length TonB. Single-amino-acid substitutions near the C terminus of V. cholerae TonB 1 were identified that allowed TonB 1 to <b>recognize</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> receptors {{and at least one}} V. cholerae TonB 2 -dependent receptor. This indicates that the very C-terminal end of V. cholerae TonB 1 determines receptor specificity. The regions of the TonB-dependent receptors involved in specificity for a particular TonB protein were investigated in experiments involving domain switching between V. cholerae and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> receptors exhibiting different TonB specificities. Switching the conserved TonB box heptapeptides at the N termini of these receptors did not alter their TonB specificities. However, replacing the amino acid immediately preceding the TonB box in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> receptors with an aromatic residue allowed these receptors to use V. cholerae TonB 1. Further, site-directed mutagenesis of the TonB box − 1 residue in a V. cholerae TonB 2 -dependent receptor demonstrated that a large hydrophobic amino acid in this position promotes recognition of V. cholerae TonB 1.

In vitro, cycA P 1 was recognized by an RNA polymerase holoenzyme fraction that transcribes several well-characterized Escherichia coli heat shock (ς 32) promoters. The in vivo effects of mutations flanking the transcription initiation site (+ 1) also suggested that cycA P 1 was recognized by an RNA polymerase similar to <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Eς 32. Function of cycA P 1 was not altered by mutations more than 35 bp upstream of position + 1 or by alterations downstream of − 7. A point mutation at position − 34 that is towards the <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Eς 32 − 35 consensus sequence (G 34 T) increased cycA P 1 activity ∼ 20 -fold, while several mutations that reduced or abolished promoter function changed highly conserved bases in presumed − 10 or − 35 elements. In addition, cycA P 1 function was retained in mutant promoters with a spacer region as short as 14 nucleotides. When either wild-type or G 34 T promoters were incubated with reconstituted RNA polymerase holoenzymes, cycA P 1 transcription was observed only with samples containing either a 37 -kDa subunit that {{is a member of}} the heat shock sigma factor family (Eς 37) or a 38 -kDa subunit that also allows core RNA polymerase to <b>recognize</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> heat shock promoters (Eς 38) (R.

However, the N-terminal signal peptide had identical cleavage sites as in native Bacillus strains, indicating that N-terminal signal peptide processing is very accurate. This result indicates that both <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> OmpA and native Bacillus Csn signal peptides direct the export of proteins via similar Sec-dependent secretion machinery. In addition, our data suggests that Bacillus and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> signal peptidases are functionally similar, even though their cell wall structures are very different.

We have also adapted this system to allow for separation of specific bacteria in more complex (real) samples using phage-coated magnetic beads and a simple magnetic manipulation system. The bacteriophages were attached to electrochemically functionalized screen-printed carbon electrode (SPE) microarrays using two different methods. In the first method, T 4 phage which specifically <b>recognizes</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> K 12, was immobilized onto SPE networks that were electrochemically functionalized using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -carbodiimide (EDC) in acidic media. In the second method, Gamma phage that specifically recognizes B. anthracis Sterne was immobilized onto SPE networks that were functionalized in two steps: by electrochemically generating phenyl-amino groups at the SPE surface, followed by reaction with glutaraldehyde to act as a linker. SPE surface functionalization and phage immobilization were confirmed using XPS and TOF-SIMS analysis. The phage-modified SPEs were then used to specifically detect target bacteria. Impedance measurements in the form of Nyquist plots (imaginary impedance (Z i) versus real impedance (Z r)) show shifts due to binding of the bacteria to the phage. No significant change in impedance was observed due to binding of non-target bacteria strains. The presence of surface bound bacteria was verified by scanning electron and fluorescence microscopies. Based on these results, the feasibility of using these microarrays for the direct and specific impedimetric detection of bacteria has been demonstrated...|$|R

The gene is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA species of about 960 nucleotides flanked by regulatory elements for initiation and termination of transcription that are efficiently <b>recognized</b> in an <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> host...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} safety causes in {{drinking}} water is from the bacteria contamination, especially in developing countries and resource-limited settings. Although many of these Escherichia <b>coli</b> (<b>E.</b> <b>coli)</b> strains in drinking water are nonpathogenic, they sever as the indicator for bacterial contamination. And, the more widely used method to detect <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in drinking water {{is to determine the}} activity of β-galactosidase (β-gal), which is released by <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> Rapid, sensitive and inexpensive detection of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in drinking water can reduce the risk of food-borne bacteria infection and stop the disease widely spreading. In this degree research, phage-based colorimetric methods were developed to detect viable Escherichia <b>coli</b> (<b>E.</b> <b>coli)</b> concentration in drinking water. During the phage infection cycle, phages can specifically <b>recognize</b> target <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> cells and release intracellular β-gal enzyme. Using our proposed novel biosensor strategies, the β-gal enzymatic activity as the indictor for the presence of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in drinking water was measured. Firstly, T 7 phage covalently conjugated to magnetic beads were used to capture, separate, and purity <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> cells from drinking water. The released β-gal was determined using commercial colorimetric substrates. Due to the specific chemical and physical properties of nanomaterials, T 7 phage were immobilized on magnetic nanoparticle to improve the capture efficiency of bacteria separation. Next, a novel enzyme-induced metallization multi-colorimetric assay was developed to monitor and measure β-gal activity, which was further employed for high-resolution colorimetric phage-enabled detection of <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> In order to improve the limit of detection and decrease the effect of the β-gal vary of in different <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains, engineered phage (T 7 lacZ) carrying lacZ gene was furthermore built to force overexpression of β-gal in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> cells during phage infection. The uses of T 7 lacZ phage have been demonstrated to become a rapid, sensitive, and reliable colorimetric detection of viable <b>E.</b> <b>coli...</b>|$|R
40|$|The coding {{sequence}} of the Haemophilus influenzae ORF I gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into different Escherichia coli expression vectors. The ORF I-encoded protein was approximately 90 kDa and bound 3 H-benzyl-penicillin and 125 I-cephradine. This high-molecular-weight penicillin-binding protein (PBP) was also shown to possess transglycosylase activity, indicating that the ORF I product is a bifunctional PBP. The ORF I protein was capable of maintaining the viability of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> delta ponA ponB::spcr cells in transcomplementation experiments, establishing the functional relevance of the significant amino acid homology seen between <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> PBP 1 A and 1 B and the H. influenzae ORF I product. In addition, the physiological functioning of the H. influenzae ORF I (PBP 1 A) product in a heterologous species established {{the ability of the}} enzyme not only to <b>recognize</b> the <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> substrate but also to interact with heterologous cell division proteins. The affinity of the ORF I product for 3 H-benzylpenicillin and 125 I-cephradine, the MIC of beta-lactams for <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> delta ponA ponB::spcr expressing the ORF I gene, and the amino acid alignment of the PBP 1 family of high-molecular-weight PBPs group the ORF I protein into the PBP 1 A family of high-molecular-weight PBPs...|$|R
40|$|Acetogenic {{bacteria}} fix CO or CO 2 by {{a pathway}} of autotrophic growth called the acetyl-CoA (or Wood) pathway. Key enzymes in the pathway are a methyltransferase, a corrinoid/Fe-S protein, a disulfide reductase, and a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. This manuscript describes {{the isolation of}} the genes that code for the methyltransferase, the two subunits of the corrinoid/Fe-S protein, and the two subunits of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. These five genes were found to be clustered within an approximately 10 -kilobase segment on the Clostridium thermoaceticum genome. The proteins were expressed at up to 5 - 10 % of Escherichia coli cell protein, and isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside had no effect on the levels of expression, implying that the C. thermoaceticum inserts contained transcriptional and translational signals that were <b>recognized</b> by <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> The methyltransferase is expressed in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in a fully active dimeric form with a specific activity and heat stability similar to the enzyme expressed in C. thermoaceticum. However, both the corrinoid/Fe-S protein and carbon dioxide dehydrogenase, although expressed in high amounts and with identical subunit molecular weights in <b>E.</b> <b>coli,</b> are inactive and less heat stable than are the native enzymes from C. thermoaceticum...|$|R
40|$|The RNA {{polymerase}} (RNAP) holoenzyme of Staphylococcus aureus was purified by DNA affinity, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography. This RNAP contained {{four major}} subunits with apparent molecular masses of 165, 130, 60, and 47 kDa. All four subunits of the RNAP were serologically {{related to the}} subunits of Escherichia <b>coli</b> <b>E</b> sigma 70 holoenzyme by Western immunoblot analysis. The 60 -kDa subunit was subsequently isolated and found to react with a monoclonal antibody specific to the <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> sigma 70 subunit. This sigma 70 -related protein allowed <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> core RNAP promoter-specific initiation and increased transcription by S. aureus RNAP that is unsaturated with sigma. We therefore suggest that this 60 -kDa protein is a sigma factor. Purified S. aureus RNAP transcribed from the promoters of several important S. aureus virulence genes (sea, sec, hla, and agr P 2) in vitro. The in vitro transcription start sites of the sea, sec, and agr P 2 promoters, mapped by primer extension, {{were similar to those}} identified in vivo. The putative promoter hexamers of these three genes showed strong sequence similarity to the <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> sigma 70 consensus promoter, and transcription by E sigma 70 from some of these promoters has been observed. Conversely, S. aureus RNAP does not transcribe from all <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> sigma 70 -dependent promoters. Taken together, our results indicate that the promoter sequences recognized by purified S. aureus RNAP are similar but not identical to those <b>recognized</b> by <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> <b>E</b> sigma 70...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase {{was isolated}} from {{a library of}} Zymomonas mobilis DNA fragments by complementing a deficient strain of Escherichia coli. It contained tandem promoters which were <b>recognized</b> by <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> but appeared to function less efficiently than the enteric lac promoter in <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> The open reading frame for this gene encoded 337 amino acids with an aggregate molecular weight of 36, 099 (including the N-terminal methionine). The primary amino acid sequence for this gene had considerable functional homology and amino acid identity with other eucaryotic and bacterial genes. Based on this comparison, the gap gene from Z. mobilis appeared to be most closely related {{to that of the}} thermophilic bacteria and to the chloroplast isozymes. Comparison of this gene with other glycolytic enzymes from Z. mobilis revealed a conserved pattern of codon bias and several common features of gene structure. A tentative transcriptional consensus sequence is proposed for Z. mobilis based on comparison of the five known promoters for three glycolytic enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{conservation}} of determinants for the identities of tRNAs between organisms. We showed previously that Escherichia coli tyrosine tRNA synthetase can charge the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial tyrosine tRNA in vivo, even though there are substantial sequence differences between the yeast mitochondrial and bacterial tRNAs. The S. cerevisiae cytoplasmic tyrosine tRNA differs in sequence from both its yeast mitochondrial and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> counterparts. To test whether the yeast cytoplasmic tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase <b>recognizes</b> the <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> tRNA, we expressed various amounts of an <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> tyrosine tRNA amber suppressor in S. cerevisiae. The bacterial tRNA did not suppress any of three yeast amber alleles, suggesting that the yeast enzymes retain high specificity in vivo for their homologous tRNAs. Moreover, the nucleotides in the sequence of the <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> suppressor that are not shared with the yeast cytoplasmic tyrosine tRNA do not create determinants which are efficiently recognized by other yeast charging enzymes. Therefore, {{at least some of the}} determinants that influence in vivo recognition of the tyrosine tRNA are specific to the cell compartment and organism. In contrast, expression of the cognate bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase together with the bacterial suppressor tRNA led to suppression of all three amber alleles. The bacterial enzyme recognized its substrate in vivo, even when the amount of bacterial tRNA was less than about 0. 05 % of that of the total cytoplasmic tRNA...|$|R

After overnight induction, most of the enzyme activities (85 – 96 %) could be harvested from the culture supernatant. Our results suggest that various signal peptides of Bacillus spp. can be <b>recognized</b> by the <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> secretion machinery. It seems possible that other enzymes with similar signal peptide could be secreted equally well in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> expression systems. Thus, our finding should be able to apply for cloning and extracellular production of other Bacillus hydrolytic enzymes as well as other proteins...|$|R
