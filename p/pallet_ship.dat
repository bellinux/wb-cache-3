The airline {{also played a}} major role in the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line, flying equipment to remote outposts in northern Canada and Alaska.Flying Tiger Line adopted the Canadair CL-44 swing-tail aircraft in 1961, becoming one of the first carriers in the world to offer aerial <b>pallet</b> <b>shipping</b> service. In 1965, Flying Tiger Line began operating jet aircraft when on September, 27, the first (as N322F) of four Boeing 707 was delivered. The Boeing 707 remained in the fleet only few years, and later sold, upon arrival of the higher-payload Douglas DC-8, the largest civilian airliner until the Boeing 747 entered service. The first Douglas DC-8-63F registered as N779FT was delivered to the airline on June 26, 1968 and the other eighteen followed until 1972.|$|R

50|$|Parcel to <b>pallet</b> sized {{insulated}} <b>shipping</b> containers {{have historically}} been single-use products due to the low-cost material composition of EPS and water-based gel packs.

50|$|Cottonwoods {{are widely}} grown for timber {{production}} along wet river banks, where their exceptional growth rate provides a large crop of wood within just 10-30 years. The wood is coarse and of fairly low value, used for <b>pallet</b> boxes, <b>shipping</b> crates, and similar purposes where a cheap but strong enough wood is suitable. They are also widely grown as screens and shelterbelts. Many of the cottonwoods grown commercially are the hybrid of eastern cottonwood and black poplar, Populus × canadensis (hybrid black poplar or Carolina poplar).|$|R

40|$|Localized {{injection}} of insecticides into termite galleries in infested wood represents {{an alternative to}} whole-structure fumigation for drywood termite control. The efficacy of this method is limited, however, {{by the use of}} repellant insecticides and the difficulty of locating drywood termite colonies. The present study addressed both issues by the use of an experimental acoustic emissions (AE) detector to assist in location of termite infestations in naturally infested <b>shipping</b> <b>pallets,</b> and application of the non-repellant insecticide spinosad (Dow AgroSciences). Chlorpyrifos 0. 5 % aerosol, 15 % aqueous disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT), resmethrin 0. 25 % aerosol, distilled water (control) and two treatments of 0. 5 % spinosad suspension concentrate (one with the injection site based on visual evidence and the other on acoustic evidence) were injected into boards in hardwood <b>shipping</b> <b>pallets</b> naturally infested with the drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis Walker.

The Woodshop is the former chapel of the seminary therefore has references to a place of prayer and worship and for my praxis became a place to re-enact the ancient trade of Joseph the Carpenter. The La Chapelle Shipyard inside the woodshop as mnemonic site became a performative site-specific platform specialized in creating small-scale sculptures with recycled and repourposed <b>shipping</b> <b>pallets</b> and a place in which to connect memory with the ancient trade of a shipwright or shipbuilder.

40|$|National audienceThis paper focusses on {{the problem}} of {{supplying}} the workstations of assembly lines with components during the production process. The components are assumed to be packed in pallets (or boxes). The <b>pallets</b> are <b>shipped</b> from a co-called supermarket and delivered to the workstations using tow trains with wagons. For each time period, depending on the production plan, a workstation has its specific component demand expressed as a fraction of pallets. The problem is to define the sequence of workstations that have to be visited by the tow train at each time period, as well as the number of pallets delivered at each stop. For that specific problem, this paper presents a Mixed Integer Linear Program that aims at minimizing the energy consumption of the supplying strategy. We particularly discuss which are the most significant energy parameters for that problem and how they can be explicitly modelled into the MILP. We also provide computational experiments and discuss the limitation of the approach...|$|R

This contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves. Most products have an 8% to 10% markup, while the Kirkland Signature brand products have a 15% markup. The company runs very lean, with overhead costs at about 10% of revenue and profit margins at 2%. It has no public relations department and does not buy outside advertising. Costco's annual membership fees accounts for 80 percent of Costco's gross margin and 70 percent of its operating income, therefore Costco collects most of its profits 12 months in advance unlike most businesses.|$|R
