40|$|Using a weak {{derivation}} {{approach to}} gradient estimation, {{we consider the}} <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> an American call option on stock paying dividends at discrete times. Similar simulation-based sensitivity estimators were introduced earlier by Fu and Hu (1995) who used smoothed perturbation analysis. We improve upon their results by presenting an estimator with a uniformly lower variance. In addition, we reduced the multidimensional optimization <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> an option with multiple ex-dividend dates to a one-dimensional one. Numerical examples indicate that this approach saves {{a considerable amount of}} computation time. Our estimator holds uniformly for a class of payoff functions, and applications to other types of options will be addressed in the article...|$|R

40|$|In the {{discussion}} on commodity {{production and the}} operation of the law of value under socialism, particularly great stress is given to the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> formation. This is easy to understand. Price formation {{is one of the most}} important levers of the planned, balanced application of the law of value to the management of the economy. During {{the discussion}}, many interesting considerations were offered and suggestions made, which have a theoretical as well as a practical meaning. Still, some economists are trying to treat the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> formation from a position of "pure theory," so to speak, neglecting the many years of practical experience in this field. These comrades are advancing certain practical proposals, based on abstract theoretical formulas, with which, in our opinion, it is impossible to agree. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> an American option {{written on}} an {{underlying}} asset with constant price volatility {{has been studied}} extensively in literature. Real-world data, however, demonstrate that volatility is not constant, and stochastic volatility models are used to account for dynamic volatility changes. Option pricing methods {{that have been developed}} in literature for pricing under stochastic volatility focus mostly on European options. We consider the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> American options under stochastic volatility, which has had relatively much less attention from literature. First, we develop a transformation procedure to compute the optimal-exercise policy and option price and provide theoretical guarantees for convergence. Second, using this computational tool, we explore a variety of questions that seek insights into the dependence <b>of</b> option <b>prices,</b> exercise policies, and implied volatilities on the market <b>price</b> <b>of</b> volatility risk and correlation between the asset and stochastic volatility. The speed and accuracy of the procedure are compared against existing methods as well...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{drawbacks}} in {{the timing}} <b>of</b> asset <b>price</b> moves in MIDAS technical analysis centering on the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> porosity and price suspension. The former {{refers to a}} shallow penetration of a MIDAS curve by asset prices. The latter refers to a premature turning <b>of</b> asset <b>prices</b> prior to reaching a MIDAS curve. Levine fully recognised the former problem. The latter issue was first identified by Coles.|$|R
