50|$|<b>Private</b> <b>call</b> allows unit's to {{directly}} talk to another unit without dispatch, or other {{users in the}} talkgroup to hear. However, this comes with the inability for dispatch to contact either unit. Page function alerts another radio that someone else is attempting to contact them.

However, only supervisors {{have the ability to}} make and answer to any number, general patrols are restricted to only a list of certified SAPOL numbers. Each LSA has two assigned 'talkgroups'.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} way that a single CTCSS tone would be used on an entire group of radios, a single five-tone {{sequence}} is used in a group of radios. All radios also have their own private callnumber stored, to be reached for an individual conversation instead of a group call. In either way the radio speaker turns on as soon as the fifth tone of a valid sequence is decoded. In case of a group call, a short announcement tone is generated on the radios speaker. In case of a <b>private</b> <b>call,</b> the receipt tone is transmitted back to the sender and then the receive path is open. The speaker stays on until the carrier squelch detects that the carrier is no longer being received. At that point, the speaker mutes and the decoder resets. The receiver speaker turns off and remains muted until another valid five-tone sequence is decoded.|$|E

On March 21, 1966, The Poughkeepsie Common Council voted to contract with Alamo and replace the ambulance contract they had with Vassar and St Francis Hospitals. The initial contact called for Alamo to bill $20 per <b>private</b> <b>call,</b> $16 for welfare calls and a $5 surcharge if oxygen was used.

This was more practical for towns and jurisdictions that didn't have enough residents to merit a separate ambulance. Often the paramedic would ride in the back of a town ambulance to provide advanced medical care to the patient en route to the hospital.|$|E
50|$|The {{system can}} be {{programmed}} to send to certain tower sites certain talkgroups even with no user affiliated on that TG. This allows users who are on another TG but scanning {{to be able to}} hear traffic on that particular TG. Large utilities, like Entergy use this on their multiZoned network. At Entergy, TG 29 is used for interZone communications (An analog solution that people in the Texas Telecom group of Entergy (Current Texas Telecom supervisor Steve Gomez, former employee Chris Boone and others) came up with using certain boards extra to the CEB or Central Electronics Bank) to feed the 2175Hz Push To Talk tone to the other Zone controllers and a Tellabs audio bridge. The digital Omnilink option from Motorola is Mother M's answer to the problem and allows <b>private</b> <b>call</b> and all other features to work across Zones but Entergy has not bought the option since the analog solution worked though none of the special features within a Zone can work..only clear communication between all users happens but it sure was cheaper!) Entergy's 4 state SmartZone system was the largest in the world when it went online in 1995-96, with 50+ sites in each Zone.|$|E

GAO found that IRS lacks a long-term telephone customer service goal that reflects the needs of taxpayers and {{the costs and benefits}} of meeting that goal. Rather, IRS annually determines the level of funding it will seek for its customer service workforce, using its judgment of how to best balance service and compliance activities. IRS then calculates the level of service that funding levels will provide. This approach is inconsistent with the Government Performance and Results Act and the practice of selected public and <b>private</b> <b>call</b> centers that field questions. IRS recognizes the shortcomings of its personnel management and will include performance measures and goals in its 2002 strategic plan.

40|$|PowerCom is a {{prototype}} {{application for a}} Personal Digital Assistant featuring an information visualisation technique called Flip Zooming. The purpose is to give both an overview and a detailed view of information presented on a small touch sensitive screen. Quick retrieval of related objects is enabled by information integration, where advanced call handling is included. The usability of PowerCom was compared to two other devices in a controlled experiment using 18 subjects that were exposed to four information handling tasks and three typical call handling tasks. Effectiveness, efficiency, mental workload and subjective satisfaction were measured. Major differences regarding effectiveness and efficiency, disfavouring PowerCom, were found for one information and one call handling task. The call handling task included both {{the creation of a}} conference call and creating a <b>private</b> <b>call</b> with one of the conference members. The problems can be explained in terms of using drag and drop and its effect on the breadth of actions available at each navigation step. Previous studies have argued that the breadth should be increased rather than the navigation depth. The results here imply {{that this is not the}} case for call handling tasks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This Master’s Thesis {{focuses on}} a {{societal}} tendency in which measuring and evaluation are becom- ing still more influencing on the relations in our knowledge society. The so-called measurement paradigm has gained its ground at today’s labour market, where we register time, measure, weigh and evaluate, as we have never done it before. Throughout the latest decade we have seen how both private companies and public institutions are being measured and evaluated on their performance. As this is taking place still more techniques are being introduced into the modern jobs. The purpose of the techniques is to secure an optimum utilization of human resources at the labour market. An increasing number of private business managers profess to the management style Performance Management, where IT-based measuring and analyses are guiding {{the way for the}} company and its employees. In this way it is becoming obvious for the employees which goals they have to reach and where the single employee as an individual has to improve. This thesis builds on a pre- understanding that a management form with a continuing and systematic measuring and evaluation of the employees’ performance will affect the employees’ approach to their own work and will con- nect to other working life dilemmas. Therefore this thesis explores how the management form Per- formance Management accompanies certain forms of cooperation, values and norms as well as management forms in a particular company and what impact this will have for the employees. The answering of the thesis’ problem formulation is reached through an analysis of our empirical data – a case study of TDC Privat Kundecenter (Eng. : TDC <b>Private</b> <b>Call</b> Center) where Performance Man- agement has been implemented for a number of years. Through our analytical work, which consists of Michel Foucault’s understanding of power and Mitchell Dean’s Foucault inspired governmen- tality analytics, we have examined what characterizes the governmental practice of TDC Privat Kundecenter in relation to Performance Management. Following the thesis’ analysis and theoretical framework we conclude that there exists a strong performance discourse at TDC Privat Kunde- center and that Performance Management seems to accompany a set of special values and norms concerning high performance, competition- and winner mentality. The concluding remarks from our analysis are that the way Performance Management is being operationalized at TDC is creating dif- ferent options for the employees. Both individually and in cooperation the employees have the op- portunity to make a job full of tough and cynical numbers into something funny and meaningful, while still striving towards performance and the reaching of common goals. The analysis also shows that a middle performer allegedly {{will not be able to}} experience that his efforts are being valued, encouraged and rewarded as much at TDC Privat Kundecenter as a high performer’s efforts...|$|E
