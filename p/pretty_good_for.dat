25|$|Morton: Oh, I'll sing {{you some}} scat songs. That was way before Louis Armstrong's time. By the way, scat is {{something}} {{that a lot of}} people don't understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found it was <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> an introduction of a song.|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} {{broadcast}} {{live in the}} United Kingdom by both the BBC and Sky Sports, with BBC One providing the free-to-air coverage and Sky Sports 2 being the pay-TV alternative. BBC One held {{the majority of the}} viewership, with an overnight peak audience of 7.4 million viewers – it received a final rating of 8.3 million. The match itself was watched by 6.3 million viewers (52% viewing share) and coverage of the final averaged at 4.1 million (44.4%). By comparison ITV's coverage of the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final averaged 6.8 million viewers, though with a lower viewing share (33.3%). The cup final ratings, a record low, were defended by the FA spokesman Paul Newman: [...] "We are very pleased because the final peaked at 7.4m which is <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> a hot Saturday {{in the middle of a}} bank holiday weekend." [...] A list compiled by the London Evening Standard showed the 2002 final came bottom in the season's top 10 viewed football matches.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} months of his administration, Corzine {{experienced}} favorable approval ratings. According to a March 2006 Fairleigh Dickinson PublicMind Poll, 47% of New Jersey voters approved of the job Corzine was doing, while 16% disapproved. Peter Woolley, director of the PublicMind, noted, [...] "the numbers are <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> a New Jersey governor heading full tilt into an unprecedented budget crisis". Much of the good will that was indicated by the March poll was quickly diminished, and in April 2006, a PublicMind poll showed that Corzine's approval rating had eroded to 39% while his disapproval rating increased to 36%. By July 2006, the Governor's ratings recovered to some extent from the April decline and in September of the same year it was clear that Corzine's approvals had not suffered from the summer conflict over the budget and the sales tax hike; 51% of New Jersey voters approved of the governor's handling of his job while 31% disapproved. His PublicMind poll ratings remained relatively stable and healthy through the rest of 2006 and 2007 with his average approvals at 54% and his average disapprovals at 29%.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed to like it, but it didn't really hit , and then when we started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E

2500|$|These Rebels were {{no longer}} the muscle car of 1957, but did offer more power than regular Rambler models. A test by Motor Trend {{concluded}} [...] "the V8 powered Rebel is now able to reach a true 60-mph from a standstill in an estimated 12.0 seconds"—significantly slower than the limited-production '57 Rebel, and this was <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> that era.|$|E

2500|$|Hubbs {{was well}} liked by his teammates. Ernie Banks remembered, [...] "Lots of young players do {{something}} special and you can't {{talk to them}} any more. Not Ken. One day, he got seven hits in a doubleheader. <b>Pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> a rookie. But he didn't talk or act any differently than when he didn't get a hit." [...] He {{was known for his}} faith. Reporters often noted that he did not smoke or drink alcohol, and that he attended church services while on the road with the team. With Hubbs's encouragement, teammate Ron Santo quit smoking.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{coverage}} of the moon landing itself, ITV used computer captions such as [...] "Armstrong taking manual control" [...] and [...] "Touchdown, The Eagle has landed". The captions were made by listening to the Houston-Lunar Module talkback, then entering in computer codes, which translated the Eagle's speed and altitude into on-screen information. Paul Haney described the moonwalk on {{the coverage}} as [...] "the greatest thing to happen since fish crawled up on the beach and survived." [...] On the landing he remarked the landing was only four miles off the point projected [...] "which is <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Government work". Reminiscing in 1999, ITN producer David Nicholson remembered it as [...] "perhaps the most exciting twelve minutes I've ever seen on television. It was a hugely thrilling moment. I remember in the ITN control room there was a gasp from the production staff." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the band}} {{returned}} stateside, the accolades continued. Alison Chriss [...] (Creative Loafing) wrote, [...] "The crowd left elated {{and ready to}} gab about the show. I heard a few guys commenting on how BSB updated their choreography, and even my husband admitted that, overall, the show was <b>pretty</b> <b>good.</b> <b>For</b> a trip down Pop music's memory lane, {{it was a great}} one, and my 14-year-old self is finally at peace after having the ultimate boy-band experience to end Memorial Day Weekend!" [...] Keegan Prosser (The News Tribune) wrote, [...] "The night proved to be a perfect flashback for the fans that have been there since the beginning, even if the nostalgia of it all left me longing for the sugary-pop of yesteryear. And {{despite the fact that the}} Boys in the Backyard are, today, a little more like Men in the Backyard (creepy), it seems to me they’ve still got a few tricks up those bedazzled sleeves." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, that's a question, Rover. The lake is {{over two}} hundred miles long, and I've heard tell that there are over twenty-five hundred islands, large and small. That's a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> place <b>for</b> a ship to hide in, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much! They {{pay about}} six dollars a week; and it's enough. Now, as a rule, an {{employer}} doesn't {{look for a}} profit on the grub; taking camps all round, the boys get <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> value <b>for</b> their money." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "When I {{was your}} age," [...] Mr. Barnes said reflectively, [...] "I was getting--let me see--forty-two shillings a week. <b>Pretty</b> <b>good</b> pay, too, <b>for</b> those days." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So I'll {{tell you}} what to do," [...] {{continued}} Dorothy. [...] "Laugh at their poor joke and tell 'em it's <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> a Horner. Then they won't dare say you have less understanding, because you understand as much as they do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her brother went on {{with his}} drawing, rapidly and skillfully; after some moments he sat down beside her and showed her his sketch.

5000|$|GameSpot {{compared}} {{the game to}} the Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance series and rated it with a score of 6.6/10 (fair).

6000|$|... "Here {{is another}} lump," [...] said Earl, presently, {{and brought out}} a thin sheet of gold, mixed with stone. [...] "I shouldn't wonder {{if there is a}} layer of quartz rock somewhere along here, {{although}} I don't see anything of it yet. I guess this lump will produce thirty or forty dollars' worth of gold more. <b>Pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> five minutes' work."
