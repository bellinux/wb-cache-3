40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. A {{wind turbine}} {{needs to be}} {{controlled}} to ensure its safe and optimal operation, especially during high wind speeds. The most common control objectives are to limit the power and rotational speed of the wind turbine by using <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> Aero Energy is a company based in Potchefstroom, South Africa, that has been developing and manufacturing wind turbine blades since 2000. Their most popular product is the AE 1 kW blades. The blades {{have a tendency to}} over-speed in high wind speeds and the cut-in wind speed must be improved. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system for wind turbines. A prototype active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system had to be developed for the AE 1 kW blades. The objectives of the control system are to protect the wind turbine from over-speeding and to improve start-up performance. An accurate model was firstly developed to predict a wind turbine’s performance with active <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> The active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> was implemented by means of a two-stage centrifugal governor. The governor uses negative or stalling <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> The first linear stage uses a soft spring to provide improved start-up performance. The second non-linear stage uses a hard spring to provide over-speed protection. The governor was manufactured and then tested with the AE 1 kW blades. The governor achieved both the control objectives of over-speed protection and improved start-up performance. The models were validated by the results. It was established that the two-stage centrifugal governor concept can be implemented on any wind turbine, provided the blades and tower are strong enough to handle the thrust forces associated with negative <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> It was recommended that an active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system be developed that uses positive pitching for the over-speed protection, which will eliminate the large thrust forces.

Helicopter blade <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system, which is removed of swashplate and integrated high-frequency <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> function for active vibration reduction, is likely the suitable solution at current technical level.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we tried}} to {{estimate}} the effect of control method on floating offshore wind turbine. The experiment in the water basin revealed that traditional blade <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> can amplify the platform pitch oscillation of floating wind turbine. In {{order to understand the}} physical phenomenon, we used aeroelastic simulation using GH Bladed. Turbine model is based on the turbine used in wind tunnel test. To simulate the pitching motion of floating platform, we used onshore wind turbine model with inflow with oscillating wind speed that simulates relative wind speed change from wind turbine's fore-aft pitching motion. Two types of control method are used; fixed <b>pitch</b> variable speed <b>control</b> which represents before rated state of large wind turbines and variable <b>pitch</b> variable speed <b>control</b> which represents over rated state of large wind turbines. Comparing the relation between wind speed change and rotor thrust force change of two control methods, we made it clear that traditional blade <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> method make thrust force change almost the inverse of wind speed increase and decrease. From thrust force inverse to wind speed change, tower pitching motion can be amplified. That is, blade <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> can induce negative damping on tower pitching motion.

As a result, {{there is a strong}} motivation to improve <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> technique to overcome the adverse effects from the unknown delays caused by the hydraulic driven units. In this study, a novel <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> approach is developed by integrating optimization, delay-perturbation estimation, and signal compensation techniques. Specifically, an optimal PI controller is designed by applying direct search optimization to ideal delay-free pitch model. A delay estimator is next designed to estimate the perturbation caused by the delay.

Furthermore, the technique is extended to PID-based <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> systems.
