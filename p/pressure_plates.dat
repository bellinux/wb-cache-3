These high temperatures are responsible for several failures such as <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> crack, <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> warpage etc. With the help of Finite element analysis, the sliding friction process of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and friction during clutch engagement is simulated to get temperature field characteristics and contact <b>pressure</b> of <b>pressure</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
50|$|The TMA-1 and TMA-1A are circular, plastic cased Yugoslavian minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mine. The mine {{consists of}} an upper plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> and the lower body containing the main charge. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has eight triangular raised sectors, and a central fuze cap. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is {{held in place by}} four plastic pins, which when suffient pressure is applied, shear allowing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> to collapse onto the mine body, triggering the UANU-1 fuze. A secondary fuze well is provided in the base of the mine, allowing the use of anti-handling devices. The mine is found in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.|$|R
50|$|The T-AB-1 is a {{rectangular}} plastic cased Brazilian anti-tank blast mine. The mine uses a T-AB-1 anti-personnel mine as a fuze. The AP mine is {{inserted into the}} body of the AT mine under a large stiff ABS plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is fastened in place by a number of shear pins, which are designed to give way under a pressure of 200 kg. The AP mine under the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is then triggered, triggering the mine's main charge.|$|R

50|$|The Model 52 mine is a Swedish {{circular}} plywood cased anti-tank blast mine. It is {{in service}} with the Swedish army. The mine can be {{fitted with a}} number of different fuzes and <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> including a three pronged plate and a pentagonal pressure spider and a tilt-rod fuze.|$|E
50|$|The {{alignment}} {{has to be}} {{very precise}} and stable to prevent shifting. This can be realized using clamps or special <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> Shifting can occur through temporarily staggered pressure, not precise vertical pressure based on misalignment of the bonding tools or the difference of thermal expansion between the bonding tools.|$|E
5000|$|The Type I mine had a {{cylindrical}} {{case with}} a domed upper <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> that is held above the main case of the mine by the spring-loaded central fuze well. A strip of canvas around the circumference seals {{the gap between the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and {{the main body of the}} mine. The Type II uses a smaller <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> that does not cover the entire top surface of the mine, giving the center of the mine a raised appearance. In every other detail, the mines are identical.|$|R
50|$|Spring type - When no {{electricity}} {{is applied to}} the brake, a spring pushes against a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> squeezing the friction disk between the inner <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and the outer cover plate. This frictional clamping force is transferred to the hub, which is mounted to a shaft.|$|R
40|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> will be cracking, erasing, and {{deformation}} as {{a result}} of reduced ability of clutch during the working process. The dynamic model of the vehicle when it started and the CFD model of <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> have been established. A new method which can be used to calculate the heat flux and the heat transfer coefficient has been proposed when after anglicizing the model. A simulation analysis of thermal stress coupling of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has been made in order to calculate temperature distribution and the stress level of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> A new improved solution has been proposed.

50|$|One raid {{targeted}} a Taliban bomb-making {{factory in}} the Khakrez and Shah Wali Khot districts of Kandahar, Afghanistan January 7-9, 2009. In the raid, conducted by helicopter and armored vehicles, the coalition troops seized six large tubs of explosives along with 38 <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> used to detonate hidden mines. Also seized were 3,000 rounds of ammunition, AK47s, anti-personnel mines and 22 rocket-propelled grenades.|$|E
50|$|Another, more {{successful}} apparatus {{was invented by}} the Scottish inventor and employee of Thomas Alva Edison, W. K. L. Dickson. His camera, called the Kinetograph, was patented in 1891 and took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated on to a transparent celluloid strip 35 mm wide. The celluloid blocks were thinly sliced, then removed with heated <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> After this, they were coated with a photosensitive gelatin emulsion.|$|E
50|$|An Elsie mine {{has a small}} raised <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> on the {{top surface}} of the mine which {{is covered with a}} small pad of flock material. The {{flocking}} material is designed to act as camouflage. Sustained downward pressure on the small <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (by the victim's foot) cocks a spring-loaded striker. When the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has been pressed down approximately 2.5 cm, a single retaining ball bearing flips side-ways into a recess. When the ball bearing flips side-ways, it frees the striker (held under tension by a coiled spring beneath it) which snaps upwards into the stab detonator, thereby detonating the explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|The NV-41 was a wooden-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine consists of a square wooden box with a filling plug on the bottom. The top of the box is covered by a thin pressure lid, which covers a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> held up by a spring. Sufficient pressure on the lid collapses it down onto the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> Downward movement of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> moves down a pressure plunger, which in turn levers up the striker retaining lever, releasing the spring-loaded striker and allowing it to impact the stab sensitive detonator, triggering the main charge.|$|R
5000|$|The T.Mi.Z.43 {{pressure}} fuze can {{be fitted}} to Tellermine 42s. The T.Mi.Z.43 fuze is notable for featuring an integral anti-handling device as standard: when the fuze is inserted and the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> screwed down into place, it shears a weak arming pin in the fuze with an audible [...] "snap". This action arms the anti-handling device. Thereafter, {{any attempt to}} disarm the mine by unscrewing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (to remove the fuze) will automatically trigger detonation. Since {{it is impossible to}} determine which fuze type has been installed, no <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> should ever be removed from a Tellermine ...|$|R
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} {{of the game is}} Monster, a giant that Quico discovers while navigating through the slums. Monster at first appears to be very kind and helpful. He can be made to hold down <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> and his belly {{can be used as a}} super-trampoline to reach rooftops. Monster has an addiction for eating frogs and if he eats one he becomes a fiery, raging beast that will damage anything around him, even Quico if he cannot get away quickly enough. The player can use a fruit to calm him.|$|E
50|$|Various {{features}} {{are incorporated into}} the design of ligatures to hold the reed securely while minimizing pressure distortion of the reed and allowing maximum vibration. Contact rails may be either parallel or transverse to the reed, on either a metal band or pressure plate type ligature. The contact rails may be either metal, wood, or plastic. <b>Pressure</b> <b>plates</b> may also have raised contact points, prongs, or a concave form to control contact with the reed. Some bands are designed for minimal contact with the mouthpiece, allowing even less absorption of the reed's vibrations.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, the {{collapse}} of the US economy and the subsequent increase in crime rates leads to the rise of privatized prisons. One such prison is Terminal Island Penitentiary, whose warden, Claire Hennessey, earns her profits by broadcasting a modern gladiator game participated in by the prisoners. In the game [...] "Death Race", the racers, along with their navigators, compete in a three-part race over three days on a closed track. The track is littered with <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> that activate either the cars' offensive weapons, defensive equipment or deadly traps.

5000|$|... #Caption: VS-50 mine {{which looks}} {{very similar to}} the TS-50. The primary visual {{difference}} is that the VS-50 usually features a black rubber <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (TS-50's <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is usually body colored, and is stamped TS-50) but the key identifier is the horizontal indexing tabs off the vertical fins visible in the left and far right side of the mine in the picture.|$|R
50|$|The Tellermine {{consists}} of a circular pressed steel main body with a large central <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is smaller than the earlier Tellermine 35, which increases the mine's resistance to blast. Two secondary fuze wells are provided for anti-handling devices, one in the side, {{and one on the}} bottom of the mine. The mine has a carrying handle.|$|R
50|$|English {{photographer}} John Carbutt {{founded the}} Keystone Dry Plate Works in 1879 {{with the intention}} of producing gelatin dry plates. The Celluloid Manufacturing Company was contracted for this work by means of thinly slicing layers out of celluloid blocks and then removing the slice marks with heated <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> After this, the celluloid strips were coated with a photosensitive gelatin emulsion. It is not certain exactly how long it took for Carbutt to standardize his process, but it occurred no later than 1888. A 15 in sheet of Carbutt's film was used by William Dickson for the early Edison motion picture experiments on a cylinder drum Kinetograph. However, the celluloid film base produced by this means was still considered too stiff for the needs of motion picture photography.|$|E
50|$|A trainer {{consists}} of a frame, a clamp to hold the bicycle securely, a roller that presses up against the rear wheel, and a mechanism that provides resistance when the pedals are turned. In a wind trainer, the roller drives fan blades that create air resistance. These are typically the least expensive and noisiest trainers. Magnetic trainers have magnets and a conducting flywheel operating as an eddy current brake. They are moderately expensive and moderately noisy. Some magnetic trainers have handlebar-mounted control boxes to change the level of resistance during a training session. Fluid trainers use liquid-filled chambers to create resistance. They are the most expensive and quietest trainers. A small number of trainers use a centrifugal pressure mechanism to create resistance, involving <b>pressure</b> <b>plates,</b> ball bearings and specially shaped grooves. These are similar to fluid trainers in price and performance.|$|E
50|$|LittleBigPlanet 3 {{introduces}} {{three new}} characters {{in addition to}} Sackboy, each with their own unique traits and abilities. OddSock is a four-legged, dog-like character who can run faster than Sackboy and can wall-jump. Swoop is a bird-like character who can fly freely around levels and can pick up other light objects. In addition to objects, Swoop can pick up other characters, {{with the exception of}} Big Toggle. Toggle is another character, who can transform between a large, heavy version and a small, light version. The larger version, called Big Toggle, is much heavier than Sackboy and can weigh down platforms or <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> His miniature version is called Little Toggle, and can walk quickly on the surface of water, is very small and can fit through tight spaces. Level creators have the ability to allow players to play as more than one character during gameplay. In addition, Sackboy has a climbing ability which works on rope-based textures like vines.|$|E
50|$|The P2 Mk2 and P3 Mk2 are Pakistani plastic cased minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mines. The P2 Mk2 has {{a square}} {{case with a}} central circular ribbed <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> the P3 is circular with a central circular <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> Both mines use anti-personnel mines as the fuse, typically the either the P4 Mk1 or P2 Mk2 anti-personnel mines. The anti-personnel mine sits in a cavity below the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> when enough <b>pressure</b> is place on the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> of the mine, it collapses onto the anti-personnel mine triggering it and the main charge which sits below it. A yellow canvas carrying strap is normally fitted {{to the side of}} the mine. The mines have a secondary fuse well on the bottom which can be used with anti-handling devices. A GLM-2 electronic booby trap can be fitted to the cavity under the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The mine is supplied with a steel disc which makes the mine more easily detectable, although this is seldom used. Since 1997 only a detectable version of the mine has been produced, and to comply with the Convention on Conventional Weapons amended protocol II, Pakistani stocks of the mine are being retrofitted with steel detection discs. The mines are found in Afghanistan, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, and Tajikistan.|$|R

The mine is detonated when the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> collapses by the action of a vehicle.|$|R
50|$|When {{the wind}} turbine nacelle is {{positioned}} on {{the tower and}} the yaw bearing assembly is completed {{it is necessary to}} adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre-tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.|$|E
50|$|The A500, later renamed 40RH and 42RH (hydraulic {{controlled}} governor pressure) and 40RE, 42RE, 44RE (electronic controlled governor pressure, 1993-up), was an A904 derivative used in {{trucks and}} vans. Introduced in the 1989 model {{year on a}} limited basis, {{it was the first}} light-duty Chrysler four-speed automatic and was placed behind the 3.9 L and 5.2 L engines for light-duty purposes. Forward direct clutch drum (same as the A998) usually has a 4 friction disc pack - an A999 forward direct clutch drum with the 5 friction disc pack does interchange. Much like the later production A904 with a wide ratio gear a double wrap low-reverse band is used. An extension housing mounted (New Process built) overdrive unit was bolted {{to the rear of the}} case to provide a total of four forward speeds; the extension housing and its internals interchange with the 46-48RH/RE (A518/618) - when overhauling the overdrive unit transmission rebuilders usually would use replacement parts from the A518/618 overdrive section since the A500 internals are light duty e.g. number of friction discs and thick <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> The overdrive housing (RWD/2WD) uses an output shaft yoke commonly shared with the A727 and its later derivatives except the A618/48RE. Electronic governor pressure was phased in during the middle of the 1993 model year where it was renamed as the A500SE - Jeep Grand Cherokees equipped with the 4.0L used the A500SE/42RE since the middle of the 1993 model year replacing the AW4. This transmission was replaced by the 42RLE in 2004.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an offset pressure plate comprising an emulsion carrier {{and a top}} coating for printing using fountain solution. The top coating can be changed by development and {{has at least one}} hydrophile and at least one hydrophobe and oliophile component. They are distributed ahead of the latent picture production and the development of the surface so that the surface of the pressure plate is hydrophile for positive <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> and hydrophobe or oliophile for negative <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> A latent, electrostatic picture can be produced in the top coating. After exposure and development, the pressure plate is hydrophobe at the exposed places on positive <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> and oliophile or hydrophile and oliophobe on negative <b>pressure</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|E
50|$|The M6, M6A1 and M6A2 are {{a series}} of metal-cased, {{circular}} anti-tank landmines produced by the United States; they were superseded in service by the larger M15 mine. The mine is normally painted olive green and has a large central <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> In the centre of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is an arming plug that has an arming lever with three settings: ARMED, DANGER and SAFE. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> rests on a concertina-like structure, which when enough force is applied is compressed. Compression results in a transfer plate under the arming plug pressing downwards onto a belleville spring which inverts, flipping the firing pin into the detonator, which triggers the adjacent explosive booster and main explosive charge.|$|R
5000|$|The MATS/2.6 is a scatterable Italian circular, plastic-cased minimum metal blast {{resistant}} anti-tank blast mine. It {{is very similar}} to the MATS/2, except that it uses a smooth <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> rather than a griddle <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> It uses a pneumatic fuse which is resistant to shock and blast similar to the fuze fitted to the TS-50. The mine's plastic case is waterproof, and the mine can be scattered from a helicopter.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that soilâ€“water {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{plays an important role in}} unsaturated soil mechanics, but the measurement of SWCC is inconvenient. In laboratory it requires days of testing time. For fine-grained clays, it may last for a couple of months using <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests. In this study, the effects of sample dimensions and shapes on the balance time of measuring SWCCs using <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and the shape of SWCCs are investigated. It can be found that the sample dimensions and shapes have apparent influence on the balance time. The testing durations for circular samples with smaller diameters and annular samples with larger contact area are significantly shortened. However, there is little effect of sample dimensions and shapes on the shape of SWCCs. Its mechanism is explored and discussed in details through analysing the principle of <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and microstructure of the sample. Based on the above findings, it is found that the circular samples with smaller dimensions can accelerate the testing duration of SWCC using the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
