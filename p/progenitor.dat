40|$|Cardiac {{development}} {{arises from}} two sources of mesoderm <b>progenitors,</b> the first heart field (FHF) {{and the second}} (SHF). Mesp 1 has been proposed to mark the most primitive multipotent cardiac <b>progenitors</b> common for both heart fields. Here, using clonal analysis of the earliest prospective cardiovascular <b>progenitors</b> in a temporally controlled manner during early gastrulation, we found that Mesp 1 <b>progenitors</b> consist of two temporally distinct pools of <b>progenitors</b> restricted to either the FHF or the SHF. FHF <b>progenitors</b> were unipotent, whereas SHF <b>progenitors</b> were either unipotent or bipotent. Microarray and single-cell PCR with reverse transcription analysis of Mesp 1 <b>progenitors</b> revealed the existence of molecularly distinct populations of Mesp 1 <b>progenitors,</b> consistent with their lineage and regional contribution. Together, these results provide evidence that heart development arises from distinct populations of unipotent and bipotent cardiac <b>progenitors</b> that independently express Mesp 1 at different time points during their specification, revealing that the regional segregation and lineage restriction of cardiac <b>progenitors</b> occur very early during gastrulation. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|Abstract Background Insm 1 is a zinc-finger {{transcription}} factor transiently expressed throughout the developing nervous system in late <b>progenitors</b> and nascent neurons. Insm 1 is also highly expressed in medulloblastomas and other neuroendocrine tumors. Results We generated mice lacking the Insm 1 gene {{and used them}} to elucidate its role in neurogenic proliferation of the embryonic olfactory epithelium. We found that deletion of Insm 1 results in more apical cells and fewer nascent and mature neurons. In the embryonic olfactory epithelium of Insm 1 mutants we detect fewer basal <b>progenitors,</b> which produce neurons, and more apical <b>progenitors,</b> which at this stage produce additional <b>progenitors.</b> Furthermore, in the mutants we detect fewer <b>progenitors</b> expressing NEUROD 1, a marker of terminally dividing, neuronogenic (neuron-producing) <b>progenitors</b> (immediate neuronal precursors), and more <b>progenitors</b> expressing ASCL 1, a marker of the transit amplifying <b>progenitors</b> that migrate from the apical to the basal edges of the epithelium while dividing to generate the terminal, neuronogenic <b>progenitors.</b> Finally, with timed administration of nucleoside analogs we demonstrate that the Insm 1 mutants contain fewer terminally dividing <b>progenitors</b> at embryonic day 12. 5. Conclusions Altogether, these results suggest a role for Insm 1 in promoting the transition of <b>progenitors</b> from apical and proliferative to basal, terminal and neuronogenic. This role appears partially conserved with that of its nematode ortholog, egl- 46. The similar effects of Insm 1 deletion on <b>progenitors</b> of embryonic olfactory epithelium and cortex point to striking parallels {{in the development of}} these neuroepithelia, and particularly between the basal <b>progenitors</b> of olfactory epithelium and the subventricular zone <b>progenitors</b> of cortex. </p...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{bone marrow}} {{cultures}} support both differentiation and conservation of primitive human hematopoietic <b>progenitors</b> {{in the absence}} of exogenous cytokines. It is believed that hematopoiesis in such cultures requires direct contact between hematopoietic <b>progenitors</b> and stroma. In the present study, we demonstrate that primitive <b>progenitors</b> physically separated from the stromal layer by a 0. 45 -microns microporous membrane continue to generate differentiated <b>progenitors</b> for at least 8 weeks. Moreover, primitive <b>progenitors</b> are conserved to a greater extent under these conditions, as when cultured in direct contact with the stroma. However, excessive production of granulocyte-macrophage <b>progenitors</b> occurs when primitive <b>progenitors</b> are not allowed to interact directly with the stroma. Thus, direct contact between hematopoietic and stromal cells is not required for either differentiation or conservation of primitive hematopoietic <b>progenitors</b> but is essential for the regulated production of mature blood elements. These findings can now be used to define the role of diffusible factors and cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix adhesion events in the regulation of conservation, proliferation, and differentiation of primitive human hematopoietic <b>progenitors</b> in vitro. status: publishe...|$|R
