40|$|BACKGROUND: Unconditional regard {{refers to}} the feeling that one is {{accepted}} and valued by others without conditions. Psychological theory suggests that experiences <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> regard lead children {{to feel that they}} are valuable despite setbacks. We hypothesized that reflecting on experiences <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> regard would buffer children's negative self-feelings (eg, shame, insecurity, powerlessness) in the face of setbacks. To test this hypothesis, we randomized children to reflect on experiences <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> regard or other experiences, and examined their response to an academic setback 3 weeks later. METHODS: Participants (11 - 15 years old) were randomly assigned to reflect for 15 minutes on experiences <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> regard (n = 91), conditional regard (n = 80), or other social experiences (n = 76). Research personnel, teachers, and classmates remained blind to condition assignment. Three weeks later, after receiving their course grades, children reported their self-feelings. Course grades were obtained from school records. Receiving low course grades represents a salient and painful real-world setback for children. RESULTS: Replicating previous research, children who received lower grades experienced more negative self-feelings (P . 17). CONCLUSIONS: Reflecting on unconditional regard buffered children's selves against the adverse impact of an academic setback over an extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. <b>Unconditional</b> regard may thus be an important psychological lever to reduce negative self-feelings in youth. <br/...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis summarizes {{already existing}} proposals of implementation and practically established concepts <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> basic income, which is a form of welfare state. Guaranteed income should provide financial security to all residents and ensure the existential needs for them. The {{author of the}} thesis tries to interpret the concept <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> basic income, give comprehensive overview of existing proposals and compare their differences. Hypothesis states, {{that there is no}} unified method <b>of</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> basic income, {{that could be used in}} any country. The used method is theoretical, particularly the method af analysis, synthesis and comparison. Conclusion is the fact, that despite topicality and frequency of literature sources, we still cannot unanimously capture definition and technique of implementation and funding <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> basic income. On the contrary, it is necessary to consider individuality of each state, its culture and customs...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> (full fiscal decentralization) versus conditional (partial fiscal decentralization) block grants on local public spending in Brazilian municipalities. Our {{results suggest that}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> and conditional transfers do not differ statistically. Their combination promotes a full crowding-in effect on aggregate public spending — i. e., for $ 1 <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> and conditional grant receipts; we find $ 1 of additional local public expenditures, greater than the corresponding effect of local income, providing further evidence for the flypaper effect. Moreover, the effect <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> transfers on education (health) spending is smaller than the effect of conditional education (health) transfers but greater than the corresponding effect of local income. We consider four strategies to identify causal effects of federal grants and the local income on fiscal responses regarding Brazilian local governments: (i) a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, (ii) Redistributive rules of education funds, (iii) Oil and Gas production, and (iv) Rainfall deviations from the historical mean...|$|R

Subsequently, a more comprehensive regression analysis, allowing insights into the evidence <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> convergence and highlighting the main determinants of growth in two main <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> recent history of China (i. e., pre-reform an post-reform) is presented. Finally a discussion and conclusion are provided...|$|R

40|$|An {{extending}} Borgonovo’s global {{sensitivity analysis}} is proposed {{to measure the}} influence of fuzzy distribution parameters on fuzzy failure probability by averaging the shift between the membership functions (MFs) <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> and conditional failure probability. The presented global sensitivity indices can reasonably reflect the influence of fuzzy-valued distribution parameters {{on the character of}} the failure probability, whereas solving the MFs <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> and conditional failure probability is time-consuming due to the involved multiple-loop sampling and optimization operators. To overcome the large computational cost, a single-loop simulation (SLS) is introduced to estimate the global sensitivity indices. By establishing a sampling probability density, only a set of samples of input variables are essential to evaluate the MFs <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> and conditional failure probability in the presented SLS method. Significance of the global sensitivity indices can be verified and demonstrated through several numerical and engineering examples...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} reduction in the percentage of cases where bail is dispensed with (unconditional release) is due to a change in the profile of cases coming before the criminal courts or a general increase in the threshold for dispensing with bail. A series of statistical (logistic regression) models of the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> release were constructed to see whether the fall in the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> release over time remained significant after adjusting for other factors associated with the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> release. Separate models were constructed for three offences: assault, property crime and property damage. The report concludes that {{the reduction in}} matters where bail is dispensed with is not accounted for by a change in the profile of cases coming before the courts. Instead, this appears to reflect an increase in the threshold for dispensing with bail...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to use laboratory experiments to test the dynamic theory of free riding among the target shareholders during a takeover attempt. We construct our experiments to reflect the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> bidding suggested by Harrington and Prokop (1993) and the dynamics of conditional bidding analyzed by Prokop (2003). The experimental results show that the observed tendering probabilities are higher than the theoretically predicted values in the case <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> bidding. Thus the actual behavior of shareholders is characterized by much less free riding than predicted by the theory <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> tender offers. In the case of conditional offers, the theoretical predictions for the tendering probabilities are confirmed by the laboratory behavior of shareholders in the case of multiple bidding. As suggested by the theory, the tendering probabilities are lower under multiple conditional bids than under unconditional offers...|$|R

The first one is providing basics about the punishment <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> imprisonment and also about the purpose of this strictest penalty. Chapter number two offers a brief historical excursion into the former legislation of the issue of the penalty <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> imprisonment and its progress and is very important for good understanding of the hole issue of the penalty <b>of</b> <b>unconditional</b> imprisonment. Third chapter provides a well arranged summary of the current legislation <b>of</b> the <b>unconditional</b> imprisonment on constitutional and also legal level.
