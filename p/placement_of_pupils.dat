40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} pupils with special needs in mainstream schools. It is concerned with how their identities and experiences are constructed at a formal level, within official documents, and informally, {{in the way the}} pupils are talked about. A Foucauldian perspective provided the framework for analysing formal and informal discourses and the power/knowledge relations these contain. Formal SEN discourses were examined by analysing the Warnock and HMI reports and earlier official documents. At an informal level, accounts were obtained from eleven pupils with a range of special educational needs and their peers. The pupils were also observed within mainstream classrooms and playgrounds. The pupils' accounts challenged the appropriateness of conventional binary divisions, for example disabled/able-bodied; integrated/segregated, for understanding the identities and experiences of pupils with SEN. The data suggest a much more continuous process of construction, characterised by oscillations, uncertainties and ambivalences and by resistance from the pupils with SEN. A number of implications for the <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> with special educational needs in mainstream schools are considered. These relate to how schools might build on mainstream pupils' existing understanding of disability and ensure that integration is a positive experience for all...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} analyse research about inclusive education. Prior reviews and the outcome of a recent search of databases are analysed with regard to (a) how inclusion is defined and (b) what empirical knowledge there is regarding factors that make schools and classrooms more inclusive. Our point of departure is that we regard inclusion as an idea about what school systems, schools and classrooms should accomplish, and as such, an expression of an educational philosophy. Four different understandings of inclusive education were found: (a) inclusion as the <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> with disabilities in mainstream classrooms, (b) inclusion as meeting the social/academic needs of pupils with disabilities, (c) inclusion as meeting the social/academic needs of all pupils and (d) inclusion as creation of communities. Under a strict definition of inclusive education, hardly any research was found which reliably identified factors that give rise to inclusive processes. The outcome of our analyses are discussed from the perspective that different understandings of inclusion should be seen, to a large extent, as expressions of different views of what schools should accomplish. We also propose that some of the adherents to inclusion as creation of communities can be placed in the grand educational tradition reaching back to Dewey that tries to establish new ideals for school systems in a society in which individualism is perhaps the main ideology. The main conclusions are that the operative meaning of inclusion in reviews and empirical research should be much more clearly defined and that new types of studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|M. A. (Applied Linguistics) The South African English Academy {{requested}} that an investigation be undertaken on {{the feasibility of}} producing a battery of English proficiency tests in the four modes (listening, speaking, reading and writing) which are free of ethnic labels. For {{the purpose of this}} study the aural and oral modes will be developed first as these are the two modes from which language arises. These tests are intended to be universal language tests which will be appropriate for both English first and second language learners. They will be undertaken with mother tongue standards as the first point of departure. It is proposed that mother tongue speakers represent the "universal" standard to which second language speakers aspire, although we are fully aware that native speakers show considerable variation in ability. First language norms will be taken as the norm of performance for this study because it assumed that this is what most second language learners would aspire to. This study will attempt to provide a valid and reliable measuring instrument to facilitate the correct <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> in schools where English is the medium of instruction. Of particular importance is the fact that these are not tests of absolute competence, but are tests of progressive competence. No pupil is a failure, the pupils performance is measured on a continuum of six levels in the senior primary phase. This will enable the teacher to assist each pupil to progress at his own pace according to his own ability. There is a very definite need for performance tests in English since tests of communicative competence in English that are "universal in nature" are not available in South Africa. A standardised test battery aimed at measuring the language proficiency (of the heterogeneous population at the senior primary level) across all four language modes, does not exist in South Africa. The problem is to. develop tests with tasks at the appropriate level for a heterogeneous population and produce evidence regarding their validity. Although subjective and objective assessment methods are commonly used, the merits of the one method as opposed to the other are still debated. The importance of investigating the relationship between the multiple-choice aural test (by means of objective and indirect assessment) and the productive oral test (by means of subjective and direct assessment) cannot be underestimated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the form <b>of</b> the <b>pupil</b> in normal human subjects. Using a modified slitlamp, photographs <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> were taken in steady illumination and 10 – 20 sec after darkness. Transparencies were projected and digitized, and the pupil margin was represented as a circular Fourier series. Best-fit ellipses were also determined. The <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pupil</b> relative to the limbus was determined in a number of subjects. Results from 23 subjects indicated that in both darkness and light, average pupil noncircularity was 0. 0166. (A value of 0. 0200 is easy to detect with the unaided eye from the photographs.) On average, the best-fit ellipse accounted for about half of the noncircularity (59. 6 % in darkness; 47. 7 % in light). Most of the contribution to shape was made by the first 4 or 5 harmonics. Shapes were usually stable within a session and could remain fairly stable for at least a year; however, shapes for different subjects were not very similar, especially in the light. (Average pairwise similarity: 0. 106 in darkness; 0. 034 in light; similarity can have values from − 1 to 1.) For a given subject, shapes in light and dark were often failry similar (average similarity 0. 260), but there were systematic differences: in eyes where the ellipse contributed > 20 % of noncircularity, ellipse major axes clustered around vertical in darkness, and horizontal in light, implying greater contraction near the vertical meridian. Even pupils with little elliptical contribution turned out to contract more near the vertical meridian. There was some tendency for left and right eyes of an individual to show mirror symmetry of shape. In the dark, pupils were located 0. 27 ± 0. 09 mm nasal and 0. 20 ± 0. 15 mm superior to the limbus center, and usually moved slightly further nasal or superior in the light. Noncircularity increased with age (0. 0015 /decade). It was concluded that <b>pupils</b> show individuality <b>of</b> shape, with significant regularities within and across subjects...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 This study {{proposed}} to evaluate current practices for ability <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> entering seventh grade English, social studies, and arithmetic classes in a selected {{junior high school}} of the Santa Monica (California) Unified School District. Hypotheses to be tested were: (1) The effectiveness of placement practices at the seventh grade level can be predicted in one junior high school. (Z) A given formula for predicting success of placement practices at the seventh grade level in one junior high school, when supplemented by substantiating evidence from recognized authorities {{in this area of}} investigation, can be used as an approach to general evaluative procedures in other junior high schools. The statistical analysis for Hypothesis (1) employed the method of multiple regression. Sixth grade test scores in I. Q., reading, language, work study, and arithmetic were correlated with the grades earned by 537 pupils in seventh grade English, social studies, and arithmetic [...] the three basic subjects required in the selected school. School years examined were 1960 - 61 and 1961 - 62. The three basic subjects were established as dependent variables; the test scores and marks in each of the basic subjects during sixth grade, as independent variables. It was found that sixth grade marks in social studies and arithmetic are most useful in predicting the three dependent variable, but that I. Q., reading comprehension, and arithmetic problem-solving also contribute significantly to an over-all predictive formula. Hypothesis (1) was accepted {{on the basis of the}} findings, al though each standard error of the above-named independent variables was greater than half a grade point indicating a substantial error for the most effective ability grouping. Hypothesis (2) was rejected for lack of further outside information to substantiate any inference drawn from the statistical findings. Certain criteria taken from the literature were, however, found to be operative in the selected junior high school: 1. The ability grouping program is grounded upon a basic philosophy of education and governed by definite policies on grading and promotions. 2. Provisions for modification of the curriculum and of in structional methods and materials, as well as for program flexibility and evaluation, are consonant with best practices. One conclusion, reached independently from observation of current practices, was that administering standardized tests at the sixth grade level for the sectioning of seventh grade pupils does not permit the correlation of seventh grade scores with seventh grade marks. Conclusions from the statistical analysis were: 1. I. Q., reading comprehension, and arithmetic problem-solving are significant for predicting successful seventh grade placement when combined in a multiple regression analysis. 2. Predicting successful placement in seventh grade English, social studies, and arithmetic groups from marks made in sixth grade social studies and arithmetic provide lower standard errors of estimate than do predictions from the I. Q., reading comprehension, and arithmetic problem-solving scores. There is therefore a positive significant relationship between marks made in sixth grade social studies and arithmetic and the English-social studies-arithmetic marks in seventh grade. It is recommended: 1. That junior high school administrators and/or counselors familiarize themselves with the curriculum and grading policies of feeder elementary schools so that there will be better vertical articulation between both levels of education. 2. That standardized tests be given at the end of the sixth grade so that scores may have greater validity in relation to seventh grade ability grouping. 3. That marks made in sixth grade social studies and arith metic be considered when grouping pupils in seventh grade English, social studies, and arithmetic classes...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHOThe {{psychological}} and guidance service is an ancillary service {{established by the}} Transvaal Education Department {{with a view to}} problems which may arise in the school and family situation. For more than sixty years this service has rendered invaluable service to the pupils of Transvaal. This investigation revealed that {{during the past five years}} this service has expanded considerably. On the 30 th June 1974 there were twenty four Child Guidance Clinics with an establishment of one hundred and sixty one posts. These clinics serve the 24 inspection circuits into which the Transvaal has been divided. They are situated at Pietersburg, Nylstroom, Pretoria (4), Rustenburg, Klerksdorp, Potchefstroom, Krugersdorp, Roodepoort, Vereeniging, South Rand, Johannesburg (3), East Rand (4), Ermelo, Nelspruit and Middelburg. Each clinic has 5 different members of staff, namely a psychologist (clinical), a psychologist (vocational guidance), a psychologist (orthodidactic), an assistant psychologist and a speech therapist. In order to render meaningful service it is imperative that the assistant psychologist should be trained and that as an educationist must know exactly what his field and function is. The minimum requirement for appointment to the post of assistant psychologist is at present classification into category "C" (three years training after the attainment of the standard ten certificate or equivalent qualification) and seven years teaching experience. Nowhere do we find an exact ad hoc description of the field and function of the assistant psychologist, As a result of this and practical experience as an assistant psychologist it was concluded that there was a very real need for this study. After lengthy discussions with the authorities of the Transvaal Education Department the need for this study was thus confirmed, The purpose of this study was to investigate the independence of the assistant psychologist as an integral member of the child guidance clinic team by clearly formulating his field, function and training. In this study we are primarily concerned with the field, function and training of the assistant psychologist, although reference will be made to the other members of the service. The information used in this investigation was mainly obtained from South African and overseas literature on this subject. Permission to undertake this study was granted by the Transvaal Education Department Education Bureau. The post of the assistant psychologist attached to the child guidance clinics of the Transvaal Education Department originated in a urgently felt need for personnel to assist pupils with educational-social problems. In the beginning relatively high training requirements were necessary to qualify for this post, e. g. a B. A. -degree with psychology, sociology and social work plus a teachers diploma. It appears however that the training requirements have been lowered considerably - category "C", i. e. three year training is now accepted. As a result of inadequately trained staff the quality of the service has deteriorated. Furthermore this study revealed that the field and function of the assistant psychologist has never been clearly outlined. This fact caused great uncertainty for the assistant psychologist. This uncertainty regarding his field and function also resulted in the various titles given to this post, e. g. visiting teacher, assistant school psychologist, assistant school psychologist (visiting), assistant psychologist (visiting) and assistant psychologist. Although services to pupils with educational social problems are rendered in the U. S. A., Holland and in England, the titles given to these personnel differ. In the U. S. A. and in Holland the person rendering these services is called the school social worker. In England the Education Welfare Officer is responsible for this task. In spite of the fact that the assistant psychologist is regarded as a member of the Child Guidance Clinic-team, the low training requirements as well as the uncertainty with regards to his exact field and function has led to the situation where he has an inferior position; his salary and status is much lower than the other school psychologists attached to the Child Guidance Clinics of the Transvaal Education Department. The independence of his discipline as such has not yet been realised. As soon as a situation of tension arises that has a negative influence on the pupil's behaviour at school and in the home the principal completes a form which is sent to the child guidance clinic for the circuit inspector. The school psychologist (social) must then identify the educational-social problem. In the U. S. A. the school social worker is a member of the school staff and teachers report pupils in need of attention directly to him. In Holland and in England the principal of the school reports pupils in need of professional help to the school social worker and the Educational Welfare Officer. After the problem has been outlined, an investigation is instituted. Except for the U. S. A. where the school social worker is a member of the school staff, the school social worker in Holland and the Educational Welfare Officer in England, visits the schools. In the Transvaal the school psychologist (social) visits the school and interviews the principal and/or the member of staff who reported the problem. All information and sources or origin is recorded and placed in a special child guidance clinic file opened for the pupil. The pupil is interviewed at the school, where all the necessary information is obtained. The parents may be invited to the school for an interview or this may be conducted at their home. The interview which is conducted at the home serves the purpose of examining the parents view of the situation involving their child. All information and observations are recorded and placed in the pupils file at the child guidance clinic. The pupils personal child guidance clinic file must give a comprehensive picture of the situation and must contain the following: (a) Details of identification (b) Purpose of interview (c) Introductory remarks (d) Sources of information (e) Family history (f) Family relationships (g) Home circumstances and environment (h) Diagnosis (i) Prognosis (j) Recommendations The school psychologist (social) is responsible for the therapeutic <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> in school hostels. This therapeutic placement concerns pupils whose behaviour and circumstances are of such a nature that they do not need placement in a clinic school. The Transvaal Education Department has three clinic schools. In co-operation with school psychologist (clinical) the school psychologist (social) places pupils whose educational-social problems warrant placement in these clinic schools. Pupils placed in these clinic schools receive treatment and must be decertified and reunited with their own parents as soon as possible, because of the importance of the home. This means that simultaneous attention must be given to parent and child. Regular home visits must be carried out by the school psychologist (social); he also visits the clinic schools and reports back to the parents. Parents are encouraged to visit their child at the clinic school. This gives the staff of the. clinic school the opportunity of getting to know the parents. Even after the pupil has been decertified, completed his schooling, been placed in a school hostel or started work, the school psychologist (social) must continue his advisory service to the pupil and his parents. It is also the task of the school psychologist (social) to advise pupils and their parents in regard to exemption from compulsory school attendance. He does this in co-operation with the school psychologist (vocational guidance). The school psychologist (social) must possess a sound knowledge of community resources and their use. He is the link between home and child and the community. He liaisons with the follow= ing: Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, Department of National Education, C. M. R., S. A. V. F., Child Welfare Society, S. A. P., schools and other religious bodies and organizations who can assist the child and his parents. As far as preventative services are concerned the school psychologist (social) has an important function. An example of these preventative services is the following: he will address parent-teacher meetings, church youth meetings etcetera. During these lectures he must choose subjects referring to child education and bring to their notice the services offered by the child guidance clinic. The school psychologist (social) must treat all information in his possession as confidential. In the expanding science and profession of educational psychology, the school psychologist (social) is at best an adolescent in his development. Like an adolescent, he grows, changes almost beyond recognition, faces new demands, fresh opportunities. And in youthful fashion he may try out many roles in the search for an identity with meaning for him. The unprecedented demand for the services of the school psychologists (social), the many contemporary pressures upon the schools, and the extension of educational psychological knowledge all suggest that the present is a crucial time for the profession. A careful reassessment of the place of psychologist serving the schools is imperative if the profession is to push forward rather than slip backward. Such a rethinking must project into the future roles that take into fullest account the use of the particular knowledge and skills educational psychology and social work has to offer, now or in coming years. Such re-examination should relate these roles to the needs and concerns of schools as they change with the times. Until such time as the roles of the helping professions are more clearly structured in the schools and child guidance clinics, there will doubtless be some overlap in functions between the school psychologists (social) and psychologists in many school settings. The chances are good, however, that there will be more than enough work for both groups. The school psychologist (social) is fortunate who has guidance teachers in his schools with whom he can share the load. With the great manpower needs in the helping professions, the chief problem is one of providing the opportunities for each profession to use its greatest potential in working to meet the needs of school children. In such mutual endeavours school social work and school psychology can become strong and effective allies. Taking the above into consideration the following recommendations are made: (1) The independence of this discipline will be realised once the status and salary of the school psychologist (social) is brought in line with that of other school psychologists in the child guidance clinics. (2) The Psychological and Guidance Service of the Transvaal Education Department must furnish the school psychologist (social) with a clear outline of his field and function. (3) The training requirements of the school psychologist (social) must be revised. Only people in possession of a B. A. degree with Psychology and Social Work as major subjects. plus a teaching diploma as well as the B. Ed. degree with specialization in Socio-Pedagogics or Guidance must be appointed to these posts. (4) Equal ability to teach in both official languages must be stated as a requirement, i. e. only people in possession of the language endorsement ("AE" or "EA") must be appointed. (5) The qualifications of more than half of the present assistant-psychologist attached to the Child Guidance Clinics of the Transvaal Education Department are too low to qualify and are therefore not equipped to render these professional services. These people however have had valuable experience and must be granted the opportunity by the Transvaal Education Department to improve their qualifications. (6) The title of the post of the assistant psychologist must be replaced by the title school psychologist (social). This title is a true reflection of this person's training, field and function. The school psychologist (social) is primarily an educationist who has also been trained in social work and psychology. (7) In co-operation with universities the Child Guidance Clinics must be prepared to accept potential school psychologists (social) for practical training. After training the school psychologist (social) must undergo an internship of at least one term at a Transvaal Education Department Child Guidance Clinic. (8) For the benefit of the Clinic School Children and their parents, a member of the Child Guidance Clinic team must be available at every Child Guidance Clinic during school holidays. (9) The appointment to every school of trained guidance teachers will assure that the quality of service rendered by the scho 9 l psychologist (social) will be more purposeful and beneficial. (10) Research in regard to the services rendered by the Transvaal Education Department's Psychological and Guidance Service should be undertaken. The Transvaal Education Department should make bursaries available to this end. (II) In conclusion it is recommended that the universities training the school psychologist (social) must give as much practical training as possible. Master...|$|E

Information given to them in the classroom is often forgotten due to over-extensive curriculum.

Such didactic preparation of the excursion would be helpful to other teachers, who would like to take their pupils for a tour of the museum.

I distributed the questionnaire among 112 <b>pupils</b> <b>of</b> eighth and ninth class of an elementary school, and among 133 <b>pupils</b> <b>of</b> first and second class of a high school. The analysis of the questionnaires demonstrated that the pupils knowledge on this topic is rather weak. The pupils experience the majority of problems with the timeline and the geographic <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> the Neanderthal, {{as well as with the}} relation between the Neanderthal and Homo sapiens. Statistical data analysis revealed differences in knowledge <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> <b>of</b> different age periods. It has also shown differences in knowledge between the two genders in solving certain questions. One of the major differences observed is that <b>pupils</b> <b>of</b> an elementary school are more inclined to visit the museum than <b>pupils</b> <b>of</b> a high school. Based on the results obtained from the questionnaires I made a learning journal that would help to strengthen the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> during their visit of the museum. I believe that with such manner of work we would bring the topics of evolution nearer to pupils and familiarise them with the Neanderthal...|$|R
