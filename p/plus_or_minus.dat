5|$|Two {{additional}} polls, {{released in}} late April and mid-May by Keystone Analytics, showed Peduto regaining {{the lead in}} the primary race. In the April poll, Peduto's lead was within the <b>plus</b> <b>or</b> <b>minus</b> 4.38 percent margin of error; he led Jack Wagner 38 to 36 percent. Jake Wheatley received 5 percent support and A. J. Richardson received less than 1 percent. A poll released in mid-May, with a <b>plus</b> <b>or</b> <b>minus</b> 4.9 percent margin of error, suggested that Peduto had expanded his lead over Wagner. Peduto was supported by 39 percent of respondents, while Wagner had 36 percent. Wheatley and Richardson garnered 8 and 1 percent, respectively. An additional poll, commissioned by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and conducted by Susquehanna Polling & Research and released in the final week before the primary, also showed Peduto leading Wagner, 42 to 33 percent. The same poll showed Wheatley with 6 percent and Richardson with 1 percent.|$|E

5|$|Early {{photovoltaic}} systems output decreased {{as much as}} 10%/year, but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5%/year, with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate, so that a system would lose only 12% of its output performance in 25 years. A system using modules which degrade 4%/year will lose 64% of its output during the same period. Many panel makers offer a performance guarantee, typically 90% in ten years and 80% over 25 years.
