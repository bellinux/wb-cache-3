40|$|Abstract. For the {{production}} of forged components, {{it is necessary to}} coordinate and optimize {{the production}} stages along the different <b>process</b> <b>chains.</b> This includes the mainstream processes as well as the associated <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> and the respective processes of die manufacturing. Until now, these <b>processes</b> and <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> are commonly planned and optimized independently due to different and often contradictory target criteria. This paper deals with an extended approach to a holistic planning and optimization of forging <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> by means of the optimization technique Genetic Algorithm (GA) in order to reduce production costs and time...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilisation}} of <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> {{is considered}} as a way forward to achieve cost effective and high throughput production of miniaturised devices. However there are no methodologies to analyse systematically <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> and thus to inform their development and design new ones for microfabrication. Thus, this research first proposes a methodology for assessing the maturity of micro and nano- manufacturing (MNM) technologies and their interfaces in <b>process</b> <b>chains.</b> The applicability and benefits of {{using it as a}} tool for assessing the maturity levels of individual <b>processes</b> and <b>chains</b> is demonstrated on existing and emerging MNM platforms. Then, to address the growing requirements for function and length scale integration (FLSI) in devices, two bulk metallic glass (BMG) enabled master-making <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> were designed and validated for serial replication of polymer components with sub-micron and micro size functional features. The empirical research proved that the use of BMG workpieces with their intrinsic atomic level homogeneity enables the integration of complementary MNM technologies for achieving FLSI in replication inserts. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that such <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> can be successfully employed for producing inserts incorporating both micro and nano- scale features that can be utilised for serial production of polymerbased FLSI devices...|$|R

5000|$|The MBS process {{often can}} be divided in 5 main activities. The first {{activity}} of the MBS <b>process</b> <b>chain</b> is the” 3D CAD master model”, in which product developers, designers and engineers are using the CAD system to generate a CAD model and its assembly structure related to given specifications. This 3D CAD master model is converted during the activity “Data transfer” to the MBS input data formats i.e. STEP. The “MBS Modeling” is the most complex activity in the <b>process</b> <b>chain.</b> Following rules and experiences, the 3D model in MBS format, multiple boundaries, kinematics, forces, moments or degrees of freedom are used as input to generate the MBS model. Engineers have to use MBS software and their knowledge and skills {{in the field of}} engineering mechanics and machine dynamics to build the MBS model including joints and links. The generated MBS model is used during the next activity “Simulation”. Simulations, which are specified by time increments and boundaries like starting conditions are run by MBS Software i.e. RecurDyn or MSC ADAMS. The last activity is the “Analysis and evaluation”. Engineers use case-dependent directives to analyze and evaluate moving paths, speeds, accelerations, forces or moments. The results are used to enable releases or to improve the MBS model, in case the results are insufficient. One of the most important benefits of the MBS <b>process</b> <b>chain</b> is the usability of the results to optimize the 3D CAD master model components. Due {{to the fact that the}} <b>process</b> <b>chain</b> enables the optimization of component design, the resulting loops can be used to achieve a high level of design and MBS model optimization in an iterative process.|$|E

40|$|Bio {{inspired}} surfaces targeting {{functional characteristics}} such as anti reflectivity, self cleaning effects or a drag reduction are of a significant interest to industry. In this research, two <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> are investigated for the mass production of so-called shark skin structured surfaces. Due to their drag reduction properties, such bio inspired surfaces are of relevance {{to a number of}} applications in which particular aqua and aerodynamic characteristics are required. The design of the shark skin structure relies on a bio-mimetic analytical model to generate the 3 D surface model necessary to achieve the targeted surface functionality. The <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> presented combine laser ablation as a method for micro structuring masters for high throughput replication employing injection moulding. In particular, two <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> that rely on respectively micro second (ms) and pico second (ps) laser ablation systems to pattern mould inserts were investigated. Then, they were integrated into a tool for micro injection moulding and the replication results obtained from the two different mould inserts were compared to study the viability of the proposed <b>process</b> <b>chains.</b> The results show that micro structures can be replicated successfully in both cases, but further work is required to optimise the replication process...|$|R

50|$|The {{event-driven}} <b>process</b> <b>chain</b> (EPC) is {{a conceptual}} modeling technique which is mainly used to systematically improve business process flows. Like most conceptual modeling techniques, the event driven <b>process</b> <b>chain</b> consists of entities/elements and functions that allow relationships {{to be developed}} and processed. More specifically, the EPC {{is made up of}} events which define what state a process is in or the rules by which it operates. In order to progress through events, a function/ active event must be executed. Depending on the process flow, the function has the ability to transform event states or link to other event driven process chains. Other elements exist within an EPC, all of which work together to define how and by what rules the system operates. The EPC technique can be applied to business practices such as resource planning, process improvement, and logistics.|$|E
