40|$|The {{analgesic}} {{efficacy of}} cholinergic agonists and anticholinesterase agents {{has been widely}} recognized. The analgesic effect obtained by activating cholinergic mechanisms, however, seems {{to depend on the}} experimental pain model utilized for its evaluation. The antinociceptive effect of intraspinal neostigmine was examined in rats submitted concurrently to the tail flick and formalin tests. Neostigmine (8. 25 and 16. 5 nmol) produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in the tail flick test (a model of <b>phasic</b> <b>pain)</b> and reduced the first phase (<b>phasic</b> <b>pain)</b> of the animal response to formalin also in a dose-dependent manner. The second phase (tonic pain) of the response to formalin, however, was slightly reduced after {{a longer period of time}} only by the higher dose of the anticholinesterase. The effect of neostigmine was not significantly different when the drug was injected into rats submitted exclusively to the tail flick test. The second phase of the animal response to formalin was slightly reduced by neostigmine (8. 25 nmol) and strongly inhibited by the higher dose of the anticholinesterase when injection was made after the first phase. We conclude that phasic and tonic pain can both be controlled by high doses of neostigmine. In addition, we show that inhibition by a lower dose of neostigmine of the formalin-induced <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> did not prevent the subsequent occurrence of tonic pain produced by the irritan...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between pain and cognitive function is of theoretical and clinical interest, exemplified by observations that attention-demanding activities reduce pain in chronically afflicted patients. Previous studies {{have concentrated on}} <b>phasic</b> <b>pain,</b> which bears little correspondence to clinical pain conditions. Indeed, <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> {{is often associated with}} differential or opposing effects to tonic pain in behavioral, lesion, and pharmacological studies. To address how cognitive engagement interacts with tonic pain, we assessed the influence of an attention-demanding cognitive task on pain-evoked neural responses in an experimental model of chronic pain, the capsaicin-induced heat hyperalgesia model. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that activity in the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices, insula, and cerebellum correlates with the intensity of tonic pain. This pain-related activity in medial prefrontal cortex and cerebellum was modulated by the demand level of the cognitive task. Our findings highlight a role for these structures in the integration of motivational and cognitive functions associated with a physiological state of injury. Within the limitations of an experimental model of pain, we suggest that the findings are relevant to understanding both the neurobiology and pathophysiology of chronic pain and its amelioration by cognitive strategies.

Methods: In this study, we used adult Wistar rats to examine gender differences in the effects of NR 2 B NMDA antagonism at the level of the anterior cingulate cortex in <b>phasic</b> <b>pain,</b> and in the first and second phases of a formalin test. Rats underwent stereotactic surgery for cannula implantation in the anterior cingulate cortex. After recovery, paw withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus was assessed. Rats were also subjected to a formalin pain test whereby 60 &micro;L of 5 % formalin was injected into the right hind paw. Results: Female and male rats that received Ro 25 - 6981, an NR 2 B antagonist, before formalin injection showed significantly reduced pain responses to the formalin test compared with saline-injected control rats (P &lt; 0. 05).

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} the blinding {{effectiveness of the}} sham needle in healthy subjects who were experiencing induced <b>phasic</b> heat <b>pain.</b> Design Twenty one healthy university students were recruited via convenience sampling. Subjects were required to differentiate between the real and sham needle administered to acupoint LI 10, while experiencing a painful heat stimulus or control visual stimulus. Outcome measures The proportion of correct judgments (P(C)) in the needle differentiation task was calculated separately {{in the presence of}} heat pain stimulus and in the presence of visual stimulus. This measured a subject’s in(ability) in differentiating between the needle types and represented the blinding effectiveness of the sham needle in each stimulus condition. Results Participants were less able to differentiate the needles in the presence of heat stimulus compared to in the presence of visual stimulus, although the decrease was not statistically significant (Z = - 1. 12, p = 0. 265, r = - 0. 17). However, subjects’ P(C) values in the presence visual stimulus (Z = - 3. 24, p = 0. 001, r = - 0. 50) or in the presence of heat stimulus (Z = - 2. 08, p = 0. 038, r = - 0. 32) were both significantly higher than P(C) = 0. 50 (chance level). Conclusion <b>Phasic</b> heat <b>pain</b> resulted in a non-significant decrease in subject’s ability to differentiate the real and sham needles administered to acupoint LI 10. However, subjects were still able to distinguish between the real and sham needle administered to acupoint LI 10, in the presence of heat pain stimulus or visual stimulus. The effectiveness of the sham needle in blinding subjects with pain is thus questionable. More studies are required to confirm these findings...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral, {{hormonal}} and neuronal {{responses to}} prolonged {{exposure to the}} volatile components of essential oil (EO) extracted from citrus lemon were investigated in male and female rats. Animals {{were exposed to the}} lemon essence for 2 weeks while in their cage. Anxiety was then determined with the elevated plus-maze apparatus while nociception was evaluated with a <b>phasic</b> thermal <b>pain</b> stimulus (plantar test) and with a chemical pain stimulus (formalin test). At the end of the experimental sessions, brain areas were dissected to measure beta-endorphin (beta-EP) concentrations in the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). Blood samples were collected to determine corticosterone plasma levels. In both sexes, prolonged EO exposure decreased the time spent in the open arms of the plus-maze apparatus. EO-exposed males and females showed higher thermal nociceptive thresholds than controls when tested with the plantar test apparatus. EO exposure induced female-specific decreases in formalin-induced pain behaviors during the formalin test. beta-EP concentrations in the hypothalamus and PAG were affected by EO. Corticosterone was lower in EO-exposed animals of both sexes than in their controls. These results suggest that long-term exposure to lemon EO can induce significant, at times sex-specific, changes in neuronal circuits involved in anxiety and pain...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the antinociceptive effects of seven imidazoline I 2 receptor ligands in a rat warm water tail withdrawal procedure (46 and 50 °C). Agmatine, 2 -BFI, phenyzoline, and diphenyzoline produced a significant antinociceptive activity at 46 °C. BU 224, S 22687, and idazoxan had no effect at 46 °C up to doses that altered the locomotor activity. None of the drugs showed antinociceptive activity at 50 °C. It is suggested that I 2 receptor agonists have antinociceptive activity for acute <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> under weak noxious stimulus, and the effects are efficacy-dependent. These data explain the findings that I 2 receptor agonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of opioids and support developing higher-efficacy I 2 receptor agonists {{for the treatment of}} pain...|$|E

40|$|This article briefly reviews {{psychological}} {{aspects of}} pain, paying {{special attention to}} chronic pain. The review considers the interruptive and interference effects of pain {{and its impact on}} a person’s identity. The importance of processes related to interruption, interference, and iden-tity will vary across people and the duration of pain. Although brief <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> such as that presented in the laboratory will have marked interruptive effects, it is unlikely to produce inter-ference or impact on a person’s identity. Acute clinical pain will have both interruptive and interference effects, albeit of a temporary nature, but it is unlikely to have any impact on a person’s identity. Chronic persistent pain or frequent recurrent episodic pain, such as head-ache, may have profound effects on a person’s life. Each of these themes is illustrated with examples drawn from the experimental and clinical literature...|$|E
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of the experimental pain studies have used acute, phasic heat stimuli to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms of pain. However, the validity of these models for understanding clinical forms of pain is questionable. We here describe the characteristics of a model of prolonged tonic heat pain stimulation and compared the responses on this test with other measures of pain. In 58 normal volunteers, we applied a 7 -min lasting contact heat stimulation of 47 degrees C to the upper leg while participants constantly rated their pain. Average pain rating during the 7 -min period was 6. 2 +/- 0. 4, females scoring higher than men (7. 4 +/- 0. 5 vs. 5. 2 +/- 0. 5; p< 0. 005). Pain ratings showed a steady increase {{during the first half of}} the stimulation period after which they stabilized. A strong interindividual variability was observed in the time profiles of the pain ratings over the course of the 7 -min stimulation period. The model showed a good test-retest reproducibility. Tonic heat pain ratings only correlated moderately with the pain threshold while stronger correlations were observed with pain tolerance and ratings of suprathreshold <b>phasic</b> heat <b>pain.</b> We conclude that the tonic heat model is a suitable model that can be applied without excessive discomfort in the majority of subjects and offers a valuable addition to the armamentarium of experimental pain models. The model can be particularly suitable for brain imaging receptor binding studies which require long stimulation periods. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Pain {{perception}} {{is closely related}} to the attentional level and the vigilance of the subject [4]. The intensity of a pain stimulus and its sensation do often not coincide. A common experimental example is the so-called pain-inhibiting-pain effect: A stressful stimulus, e. g. persistent or chronic pain, often elevates the threshold for brief pain stimuli applied during the same time. Stressful stimuli, which deflects attention from a painful event, may induce the so-called Stress Induced Analgesia [6],[8]. <b>Phasic</b> <b>pain</b> stimuli in the fingertip cause a pin-prick like sensation and lead to a typical activation sequence of the cortex. An activation of the SII region at 100 [...] 120 ms which is related to the rational, discriminating component of pain sensation is followed by an activity at 250 [...] 350 ms, originating from the cingulate gyrus (CG) which is related to the evaluative perception of pain [9] (for a review, see [1]). This study investigates the change in brain activation...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well know}} that <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> could induce {{suppression}} of alpha oscillations and enhancement of gamma oscillations. However, the cortical responses to tonic pain, especially tonic pain originating from deep tissue, which was proposed to better resemble the clinical pain, {{are not well}} understood. Here we aimed to investigate electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to tonic muscle pain. EEG signals and pain perceptions of three order-counterbalanced conditions: innocuous condition (A, infusion of isotonic saline), noxious conditions with low (B) and medium (C) intensities (infusion of hypertonic saline) were recorded from 43 subjects. We observed the enhancement of gamma oscillations in frontal-central region in condition C, as compared to either condition A or B. Positive relationship between the amplitude of gamma oscillations and pain intensity was also observed in frontal-central region. Therefore, we provide novel evidence for the encoding of frontal-central gamma oscillations in tonic pain processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimsThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether the use of {{intraperitoneal}} or intrathecal amitriptyline combined with electroacupuncture modifies the tail-flick reflex and incision pain in rats that normally do not have analgesia to electroacupuncture in the tail-flick test (non-responder rats). Main methodsChanges in the nociceptive threshold of intraperitoneal or intrathecal saline- or amitriptyline-treated non-responder rats were evaluated using the tail-flick or incision pain tests before, during and after a 20 -min period of electroacupuncture, applied at 2 Hz to the Zusanli and Sanynjiao acupoints. Amitriptyline was used at doses of 0. 8 mg/kg or 30 μg/kg by intraperitoneal or intrathecal route, respectively. At these doses, amitriptyline has no effect against thermal or incision pain in rats. Key findingsRats selected as non-responders to the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture 2 Hz in tail-flick and incision pain tests become responders after an intraperitoneal or intrathecal injection of amitriptyline. SignificanceAmitriptyline converts non-responder rats to rats that respond to electroacupuncture with analgesia in a model of thermal <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> and anti-hyperalgesia in a model of incision pain...|$|E
40|$|Pain is {{a multidimensional}} experience, which {{includes}} sensory, cognitive, and affective aspects. Converging lines of evidence indicate that dopaminergic neurotransmission {{plays an important}} role in human pain perception. However, the precise effects of dopamine on different aspects of pain perception remain to be elucidated. To address this question, we experimentally decreased dopaminergic neurotransmission in 22 healthy human subjects using Acute Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Depletion (APTD). During APTD and a control condition we applied brief painful laser stimuli to the hand, assessed different aspects of pain perception, and recorded electroencephalographic responses. APTD-induced decreases of cerebral dopaminergic activity did not influence sensory aspects of pain perception. In contrast, APTD yielded increases of pain unpleasantness. The increases of unpleasantness ratings positively correlated with effectiveness of APTD. Our finding of an influence of dopaminergic neurotransmission on affective but not sensory aspects of <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> suggests that analgesic effects of dopamine might be mediated by indirect effects on pain affect rather than by direct effects on ascending nociceptive signals. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex relationship between dopamine and pain perception, which may play a role in various clinical pain states...|$|E
40|$|A close {{relationship}} exists between calcium {{concentration in the}} central nervous system and nociceptive processing. Aminoglycoside antibiotics and magnesium interact with N- and P/Q-type voltage-operated calcium channels. In the present study we compare the antinociceptive potency of intrathecal administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and magnesium chloride in the tail-flick test and on incisional pain in rats, taken as models of phasic and persistent post-surgical pain, respectively. The order of potency in the tail-flick test was gentamicin (ED 50 = 3. 34 µg; confidence limits 2. 65 and 4. 2) > streptomycin (5. 68 µg; 3. 76 and 8. 57) = neomycin (9. 22 µg; 6. 98 and 12. 17) > magnesium (19. 49 µg; 11. 46 and 33. 13). The order of potency to reduce incisional pain was gentamicin (ED 50 = 2. 06 µg; confidence limits 1. 46 and 2. 9) > streptomycin (47. 86 µg; 26. 3 and 87. 1) = neomycin (83. 17 µg; 51. 6 and 133. 9). The dose-response curves for each test did not deviate significantly from parallelism. We conclude that neomycin and streptomycin are more potent against <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> than against persistent pain, whereas gentamicin is equipotent against both types of pain.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} that serotonin [5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) ] {{plays an important role in}} the transmission and regulation of pain. Here we used positron emission tomography (PET) to study the relationship between baseline 5 -HT(2 A) binding in the brain and responses to noxious heat stimulation in a group of young healthy volunteers. Twenty-one healthy subjects underwent PET scanning with the 5 -HT(2 A) antagonist, [(18) F]altanserin. In addition, participants underwent a battery of pain tests using noxious heat stimulation to assess pain threshold, pain tolerance and response to short-lasting phasic and long-lasting (7 -minute) tonic painful stimulation. Significant positive correlations were found between tonic pain ratings and [(18) F]altanserin binding in orbitofrontal (r= 0. 66; p= 0. 005), medial inferior frontal (r= 0. 60; p= 0. 014), primary sensory-motor (r= 0. 61; p= 0. 012) and posterior cingulate (r= 0. 63; p= 0. 009) cortices. In contrast, measures of regional [(18) F]altanserin binding did not correlate with pain threshold, pain tolerance, or suprathreshold <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> responses. These data suggest that cortical 5 -HT(2 A) receptor availability co-varies with responses to tonic pain. The correlation between [(18) F]altanserin binding in prefrontal cortex and tonic pain suggests a possible role of this brain region in the modulation and/or cognitive-evaluative appreciation of pain. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{combination}} of two analgesic agents offers advantages in pain treatment. Codeine and morphine analgesia is due to activation of opioid receptor subtypes. Methods: This study, performed in mice using isobolographic analysis, evaluated the type of interaction in intraperitoneal (ip) or in-trathecal (it) coadministration of codeine and morphine, in three nociceptive behavioral models. Results: Intrathecal morphine resulted to be 7. 5 times more potent than ip morphine in the writhing test, 55. 6 times in the tail flick test and 1. 7 times in phase II of the orofacial formalin test; however, in phase I of the same test ip was 1. 2 times more potent than it morphine. Intrathecal codeine resulted being 3. 4 times more potent than ip codeine in the writhing test, 1. 6 times in the tail flick test, 2. 5 times in phase I and 6. 7 times in phase II of the orofacial formalin test. Opioid coadministration had a synergistic effect in the acute tonic pain (acetic acid writhing test), acute <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> (tail flick test) and inflammatory pain (orofacial formalin test). The in-teraction index ranged between 0. 284 (writhing ip) and 0. 440 (orofacial formalin phase II ip). Conclusion: This synergy may relate to the different pathways of pain transmission and to the different intracellular signal transduc-tion. The present findings also raise the possibility of potential clinical advantages in combining opioids in pain management.

Therefore, identification of appropriate experimental pain models is critical for our understanding of opioid effects with the potential to improve treatment. Objectives: The aim was to explore and compare various pain models to morphine analgesia in healthy volunteers. Methods: The study was a double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study. Thirty-nine healthy participants were included and received morphine 30 mg (2 mg/mL) as oral solution or placebo. To cover both tonic and phasic stimulations, a comprehensive multi-modal, multi-tissue pain-testing program was performed. Results: Tonic experimental pain models were sensitive to morphine analgesia compared to placebo: muscle pressure (F= 4. 87, P= 0. 03), bone pressure (F= 3. 98, P= 0. 05), rectal pressure (F= 4. 25, P= 0. 04), and the cold pressor test (F= 25. 3, P 0. 05). Conclusion: Pain models with deep tonic stimulation including C fiber activation and and/or endogenous pain modulation were more sensitive to morphine analgesia. To avoid false negative results in future studies, we recommend inclusion of reproducible tonic pain models in deep tissues, mimicking clinical pain to a higher degree.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Dextromethorphan is a non-competitive NMDA {{receptor}} antagonist in the glutamatergic system with over 47 years of clinical usage {{experience as an}} over-the counter antitussive drug. We previously demonstrated that dextromethorphan modulates the pain threshold in the mouse acetic acid (0. 6 %,intraperitonealy) -induced writhing test (a tonic and chemical model for chronic pain) and naloxone-induced withdrawal signs in morphine-dependent mice. Because opioid and dopaminergic mechanisms of dextromethorphan have not been evaluated in the acute and <b>phasic</b> <b>pain</b> models, the effect of dextromethorphan on the pain response-induced by hot plate (a phasic and thermal model for acute pain) was investigated in mice. Materials and methods : The effects of dextromethorphan and other drugs on pain thershold were investigated using a hot plate apparatus (Harvard, UK). The hot plate temperature set thermostatically at 52. 5 ± 0. 5 ºC. The latency to licking or kicking of the fore or hind paws was recorded at various times after drug injection. A cut-off time of 45 s was imposed to avoid tissue damage. The integrity of motor coordination was assessed with a rota rod apparatus (Harvard, UK). Results : Dextromethorphan (30 mg/kg, i. p.) increased the pain threshold in the mouse hot plate test. This dose of dextromethorphan was ineffective in the rota rod test, thus it could {{be considered as a}} real antinociceptive effect. Dextromethorphan also potentiated the antinociceptive effect of morphine. The antinociceptive effect of dextromethorphan and the potentiation of morphine antinociception, were antagonized by the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The antinociceptive effect of dextromethorphan was also antagonized by dopamine mixed D 1 /D 2 receptor agonist, apomorphine. The inhibitory effect of apomorphine on antinociceptive response of dextromethorphan was blocked by the dopamine D 1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, but not by the dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride nor by the peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist, domperidone. Conclusion : These results suggest that, opioid and central dopamine D 1 receptor mechanisms may in part modulate dextromethorphan antinociception in the mouse hot plate test...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{considered}} {{for some time that}} the activation of the midbrain ascending dopamine (DA) systems plays a role in the suppression of tonic or persistent pain. For instance, earlier work has shown that substance P (SP), a tachykinin neuropeptide released during pain and stress, acting in the midbrain induces analgesia in the formalin test for tonic pain. The present thesis explored in more depth the role of SP-DA interactions in the suppression of tonic pain, and examined whether the activation of midbrain DA neurons by endogeneous SP might be a mechanism underlying stress-induced analgesia. A first series of experiments were designed {{to examine the effects of}} agonists with different affinities for tachykinin NK- 1 and NK- 3 receptors in the formalin test for tonic pain and, for comparison, the tail-flick test for <b>phasic</b> <b>pain,</b> following infusions into either the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain or nucleus accumbens (NAS) in the forebrain. Infusions into either the VTA or NAS of the NK- 1 agonist, GR- 73632, and the NK- 3 agonist, senktide, induced analgesia in the formalin, but not the tail-flick test, suggesting that NK- 1 and NK- 3 receptors in the VTA and NAS are involved in mediating the inhibition of tonic pain. Pretreatment with the opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone, did not attenuate the analgesic effects in the formalin test of intra-VTA or intra-NAS infusions of the SP analog, DiMe-C 7, GR- 73632, or senktide, suggesting that these effects are mediated independently from opioid mechanisms. The idea that exposure to stress inhibits tonic pain by causing, in part, the release of SP in the VTA was supported by the finding that intra-VTA pretreatment with the NK- 1 selective receptor antagonist, RP 67580, blocks stress-induced analgesia in the formalin test. Another series of studies were designed to explore the possibility that enhanced DA transmission in the NAS mediates the inhibition of tonic pain. It was found in these studies that intra-NAS pretreatment with DA receptor antagonists attenuates analgesia induced by intra-VTA DiMe-C 7, intra-VTA morphine, and intra-NAS amphetamine in the formalin test. It was also found that reduced DA release in midbrain ascending systems, induced by a low autoreceptor-specific dose of apomorphine, prevents the analgesic effect of intra-VTA morphine. The findings revealed throughout the present thesis suggest that part of a pain-suppression system that serves to inhibit tonic pain depends, at least in part, upon the activation of the DA neurons innervating the NAS, and that this pain-suppression system is naturally triggered by exposure to stress and/or pain, through the release of opioids and SP...|$|E
