NR-PANI and G-PANI were thermally stable up to 300 and 250 ºC respectively. Upon thermal treatment, both the <b>polyanilines</b> exhibited suppressed conductivity and free radical scavenging capacity.

40|$|Conducting and {{antimicrobial}} {{properties of}} chemically synthesized <b>polyanilines</b> {{was found to}} be affective by varying the dye moieties. The temperature dependence of AC conductivity was studied by two-probe method to learn about the conduction behavior of the synthesized compounds.

25|$|Polyacetylene has no {{commercial}} applications, {{although the}} discovery of polyacetylene as a conductive organic polymer led to many developments in materials science. Conducting polymers are of interest for solution-processing for film-forming conductive polymers. Therefore, attention has shifted to other conductive polymers for application purposes including polythiophene and <b>polyaniline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} uses electron-conducting polymers as pseudocapacitive material. Although mechanically weak, conductive polymers {{have high}} conductivity, {{resulting in a}} low ESR and a relatively high capacitance. Such conducting polymers include <b>polyaniline,</b> polythiophene, polypyrrole and polyacetylene. Such electrodes also employ electrochemical doping or dedoping of the polymers with anions and cations. Electrodes made from or coated with conductive polymers have costs comparable to carbon electrodes.|$|E
25|$|Attractive {{fields for}} current and {{potential}} utilization of <b>polyaniline</b> is in antistatics, charge dissipation or electrostatic dispersive (ESD) coatings and blends, electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI), anticorrosive coatings, hole injection layers, transparent conductors, {{indium tin oxide}} replacements, actuators, chemical vapor and solution based sensors, electrochromic coatings (for color change windows, mirrors etc.), PEDOT-PSS replacements, toxic metal recovery, catalysis, fuel cells and active electronic components such as for non-volatile memory.|$|E
40|$|A {{composition}} {{containing a}} polymeric matrix and a conductive filler component is provided. The conductive filler component comprises conductive particles and a polymer {{selected from the}} group consisting of substituted and unsubstituted <b>polyanilines,</b> substituted and unsubstituted polyparaphenylenevinylenes, substituted and unsubstituted polythiophenes, substituted and unsubstituted polyazines, substituted and unsubstituted polyparaphenylenes, substituted and unsubstituted polyfuranes, substituted and unsubstituted polypyrroles, substituted and unsubstituted polyselenophene, substituted and unsubstituted poly-p-phenylene sulfides and substituted and unsubstituted polyacetylenes, and mixtures thereof, and copolymers thereof.

40|$|Ring-substituted {{groups and}} doping {{not only have}} a great effect on the chain {{structure}} of <b>polyanilines,</b> but also on their aggregated state due to its electronic and steric effect. When steric hindrance increases, the crystallinity declines. Within the same molecular chain or between different molecular chains, the forming of hydrogen bond contributes to increasing crystallinity. From SEM and XRD experiments of polymer films {{it was found that}} the crystallinity of the ring-substituted <b>polyanilines</b> synthesized increases in the order of poly-o-toluidide (POT), poly- 2, 5 -dimethoxyaniline (PDMAn) and poly-m-chloroaniline (PmClAn). In comparison to their corresponding undoping polymers, it was concluded that proton doping of <b>polyanilines</b> renders their crystallinity increased. POT basically showed amorphous, while PDMAn allomorphous with low crystallinity. On the other hand, PmClAn is characterized by its molecular crystalline, being monoclinic with crystall-cell parameters of a = 0. 679 nm, b = 2. 304 nm, c = 0. 5734 nm, alpha = 90 degrees, beta = 100. 9 degrees, and gamma = 90 degrees. By using MM+ molecular mechanics methode in HyperChem program, (HNMR) -H- 1 and X-ray diffraction data were analyzed, thereby the configuration of PmClAn chain was determined and optimized, the results show that in the macromolecular chain of PmClAn the ratio of benzoid to quinoid units is 3 : 2. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{ability of}} {{electrodes}} to accomplish pseudocapacitance effects by redox reactions, intercalation or electrosorption strongly {{depends on the}} chemical affinity of electrode materials to the ions adsorbed on the electrode surface {{as well as on}} the structure and dimension of the electrode pores. Materials exhibiting redox behavior for use as electrodes in pseudocapacitors are transition-metal oxides like RuO2, IrO2, or MnO2 inserted by doping in the conductive electrode material such as active carbon, as well as conducting polymers such as <b>polyaniline</b> or derivatives of polythiophene covering the electrode material.|$|E
25|$|If the {{environment}} is controlled (especially in recirculating systems), corrosion inhibitors can often be added to it. These chemicals form an electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces, to suppress electrochemical reactions. Such methods make the system less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating, since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed. Chemicals that inhibit corrosion include some of the salts in hard water (Roman water systems are famous for their mineral deposits), chromates, phosphates, <b>polyaniline,</b> other conducting polymers and {{a wide range of}} specially-designed chemicals that resemble surfactants (i.e. long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups).|$|E

The data support the formation of variable amounts of phenazine-like structures due to ortho-coupling polymerization that competes with the para-coupling mode for the construction of the polymer backbone. The electrical conductivity and the solubility in a diversity of solvents were determined and correlated with the spectral data.

2500|$|<b>Polyaniline</b> (PANI) is a {{conducting}} polymer of the semi-flexible rod polymer family.

40|$|The redox {{behavior}} of <b>polyanilines</b> with ring-substituted groups synthesized by chemical polymerization, poly- 2, 5 -dimethoxyaniline (PDMAn), poly-m-chloroaniline (PmClAn) and poly-o-toluidine (POT), was studied and the morphology and crystal orientation of platinum particles deposited on these polymer membranes was compared. The oxidation of isopropanol on platinized polyaniline-modified electrodes {{as a model}} reaction was also investigated to examine the electrocatalytic properties of the polymers. The {{results show that the}} first oxidation potential of the polymers increases in the following sequence: PDMAn, POT and then PmClAn, which can be explained in terms of the electronic and steric effects of ring-substituted groups. The growth of Pt particles electrodeposited on doping-state POT and PDMAn polymer membranes takes place by a 'progressive nucleation mechanism', but by an 'instantaneous nucleation mechanism' on PmClAn. Platinum crystallites trend towards preferred-orientation and Pt (200) is the preferred face, but the degree of preferred orientation depends on the polymer. The oxidation potentials of isopropanol are located near 0. 3 V, and the oxidation currents increase on platinized polymer-modified electrodes, indicating that the interaction of polymer with Pt particles might improve the catalytic activity of Pt. <b>Polyanilines</b> act not only as dispersion media but also change the electronic properties of Pt crystalline grains.

The X-ray crystal structure of the model compound from anthraquinone had indicated that the ring system is not planar due to steric hindrance between the peri-hydrogen of anthraquinone and the ortho-hydrogen of the N-phenyl ring. The X-ray crystal structure of the model compound prepared from 4, 8 -dehydrobenzo-[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b']dithiophene- 4, 8 -dione reveals the quinone moiety to be planar.
