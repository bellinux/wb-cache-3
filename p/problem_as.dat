40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to identify and assess the relationship between building owners and designers {{in terms of their}} interface problems. The methodology utilized in this research consists of two phases. In the first phase, a literature review was conducted, and interviews with various building owners and designers took place in order to identify the interface problems between them. This resulted in the identification of 20 interfaced problems, which were classified into three categories, namely: inadequate contract and specifications, financial problems, and lack of proper communication. In the second phase, a survey of a randomly selected sample of 30 building owners and 30 designers from Saudi Arabia was undertaken to evaluate the severity of the 20 identified interface problems. The relative severity of the problems were determined and then ranked according to a severity index for both owners and designers. The owners evaluated four <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> "most severe," 14 <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> "severe," and two <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> "somewhat severe. " The designers evaluated three <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> "most severe," 15 <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> "severe," and two <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> "somewhat severe. " It was also found that owners and designers generally agreed on the severity of their interface problems...|$|R

5|$|After the breakout, the Austro-Hungarian navy saw {{very little}} action, {{spending}} {{much of its}} time in its base at Pola (now Pula, Croatia).

They did, however, leave Pola to bombard Ancona in May 1915. On 23 May 1915, four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola, the members of the Tegetthoff class {{and the rest of the}} fleet departed to bombard the Italian coast.

Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium. Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.|$|E
