6000|$|Preference for {{particular}} Males by the Females.—Having made these preliminary {{remarks on the}} discrimination and taste of birds, I will give all the facts known to me, which bear on the preference shewn by the female {{for particular}} males. It is certain that distinct species of birds occasionally pair {{in a state of}} nature and produce hybrids. Many instances could be given: thus Macgillivray relates how a male blackbird and female thrush “fell in love with each other,” and produced offspring.[163] Several years ago eighteen cases had been recorded of the occurrence in Great Britain of hybrids between the black grouse and pheasant;[164] but most of these cases may perhaps be accounted for by solitary birds not finding one of their own species to pair with. With other birds, as Mr. Jenner Weir has reason to believe, hybrids are sometimes the result of the casual intercourse of birds building in close proximity. But these remarks do not apply to the many recorded instances of tamed or domestic birds, belonging to distinct species, which have become absolutely fascinated with each other, although living with their own species. Thus Waterton[165] states that out of a flock of twenty-three Canada geese, a female paired with a solitary Bernicle gander, although so different in appearance and size; and they produced hybrid offspring. A male Wigeon (Mareca penelope), living with females of the same species, has been known to pair with a <b>Pintail</b> <b>duck,</b> Querquedula acuta. Lloyd describes the remarkable attachment between a shield-drake (Tadorna vulpanser) and a common duck. Many additional instances could be given; and the Rev. E. S. Dixon remarks that “Those who have kept many different species of geese together, well know what unaccountable attachments they are frequently forming, and that they are quite as likely to pair and rear young with individuals of a race (species) apparently the most alien to themselves, as with their own stock.” ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{evidence}} {{on this matter}} is very scanty, {{and in most cases}} not at all to the point. Some peahens preferred an old pied peacock; albino birds in a state of nature have never been seen paired with other birds; a Canada goose paired with a Bernicle gander; a male widgeon preferred a <b>pintail</b> <b>duck</b> to its own species; a hen canary preferred a male greenfinch to either linnet, goldfinch, siskin, or chaffinch. These cases are evidently exceptional, and are not such as generally occur in nature; and they only prove that the female does exert some choice between very different males, and some observations on birds in a state of nature prove the same thing; but {{there is no evidence that}} slight variations in the colour or plumes, in the way of increased intensity or complexity, are what determines the choice. On the other hand, Mr. Darwin gives much evidence that it is not so determined. He tells us that Messrs. Hewitt, Tegetmeier, and Brent, three of the highest authorities and best observers, [...] "do not believe that the females prefer certain males on account of the beauty of their plumage." [...] Mr. Hewitt was convinced [...] "that the female almost invariably prefers the most vigorous, defiant, and mettlesome male;" [...] and Mr. Tegetmeier, [...] "that a gamecock, though disfigured by being dubbed, and with his hackles trimmed, would be accepted as readily as a male retaining all his natural ornaments."[126] Evidence is adduced that a female pigeon will sometimes turn antipathy to a particular male without any assignable cause; or, in other cases, will take a strong fancy to some one bird, and will desert her own mate for him; but it is not stated that superiority or inferiority of plumage has anything to do with these fancies. Two instances are indeed given, of male birds being rejected, which had lost their ornamental plumage; but in both cases (a widow-finch and a silver pheasant) the long tail-plumes are the indication of sexual maturity. Such cases do not support the idea that males with the tail-feathers a trifle longer, or the colours a trifle brighter, are generally preferred, and that those which are only a little inferior are as generally rejected,--and this is what is absolutely needed to establish the theory of the development of these plumes by means of the choice of the female.|$|E

Other winter waterfowl species include mallards, blue-winged teal, wood ducks, Canada geese and white-fronted and lesser snow geese. Agricultural land, river sloughs and brakes, bottomland hardwoods and fallow fields provide a diverse habitat that nurtures wintering waterfowl. Bald eagles are common during winter months. Bird watching is popular. Hunting for ducks and geese is permitted under regulation by the refuge. White-tailed deer, rabbit, and squirrel may be hunted in the reforestation areas.
