5|$|Sold as Cialis and {{initially}} codenamed IC351, tadalafil {{is a drug}} prescribed for erectile dysfunction (ED) and approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It is a <b>phosphodiesterase</b> type5 (PDE5) inhibitor, similar in function to sildenafil. In addition to ED and PAH, tadalafil has undergone clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia and for female sexual dysfunction.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific <b>phosphodiesterase</b> type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{can bind to}} troponin C to act as troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators that bind to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has been tested in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 <b>phosphodiesterase</b> with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phosphodiesterases,</b> {{principle}} regulators of cNMP degradation, {{are often}} targets for therapeutics. Caffeine is a known PDE inhibitor, while drugs {{used for the}} treatment of erectile dysfunction like sildenafil and tadalafil also act through inhibiting the activity of <b>phosphodiesterases.</b>|$|R

It {{includes}} a diverse range of phosphoesterases, including protein phosphoserine phosphatases, nucleotidases, sphingomyelin <b>phosphodiesterases</b> and 2'-3' cAMP <b>phosphodiesterases</b> {{as well as some}} bacterial nucleases. The most conserved region is a centre on the metal chelating residues.|$|R
5|$|Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} on many {{different approaches to}} prevent Huntington's disease or slow its progression. Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing {{the level of the}} mutant huntingtin protein (including gene splicing and gene silencing); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways and mechanisms (including protein homeostasis and histone deacetylase inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include <b>phosphodiesterase</b> inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil acts by {{inhibiting}} cGMP-specific <b>phosphodiesterase</b> type 5 (<b>phosphodiesterase</b> 5, PDE5), {{an enzyme}} that promotes degradation of cGMP, which regulates blood {{flow in the}} penis.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine, {{like other}} xanthines, also {{acts as a}} <b>phosphodiesterase</b> inhibitor. As a {{competitive}} nonselective <b>phosphodiesterase</b> inhibitor, caffeine raises intracellular cAMP, activates protein kinase A, inhibits TNF-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. Caffeine also affects the cholinergic system where it inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.|$|E

50|$|Cyclic {{adenosine}} monophosphate (cAMP) causes increased activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is an enzyme that phosphorylates many {{elements of the}} contractile machinery within the heart cell. In the short term this leads to an increased force of contraction. <b>Phosphodiesterases</b> are enzymes responsible for the breakdown of cAMP. Therefore, when <b>phosphodiesterases</b> lower the level of cAMP in the cell they also lower the active fraction of PKA within the cell and reduce the force of contraction.|$|R
25|$|Newer agents {{such as the}} <b>phosphodiesterase</b> {{inhibitor}} ibudilast {{have also}} been researched for this application.|$|E
25|$|These signals {{then can}} be {{terminated}} by cAMP <b>phosphodiesterase,</b> {{which is an}} enzyme that degrades cAMP to 5'-AMP and inactivates protein kinase A.|$|E

40|$|In the ciliate Euplotes raikovi, two {{specific}} isoforms of cAMP- dependent <b>phosphodiesterases</b> were identified, {{one in the}} soluble and {{the other}} in the particulate fraction of the cell. Their activity was shown to be stimulated by Mg 2 +, insensitive to Ca 2 + and cGMP, and scarcely inhibited by theophylline and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methyl-xanthine. They appear to be related to some <b>phosphodiesterases</b> of class II of other unicellular organisms in their biochemical features, and their enzymatic activity is up-regulated by elevation of intracellular cAMP level similarly to PDE- 4 isoforms of mammals...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} {{second messenger}} cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) regulates the transition between sessility and motility. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, {{the expression of}} CsgD, the regulator of multicellular rdar morphotype behavior, is a major target of c-di-GMP signaling. CsgD expression is positively regulated by at least two diguanylate cyclases, GGDEF domain proteins, and negatively regulated by at least four <b>phosphodiesterases,</b> EAL domain proteins. Here, we show that in contrast to EAL domain proteins acting as <b>phosphodiesterases,</b> the EAL-like protein STM 1344 regulated CsgD expression positively and motility negatively. STM 1344, however, {{did not have a}} role in c-di-GMP turnover and also did not bind the nucleotide. STM 1344 acted upstream of the <b>phosphodiesterases</b> STM 1703 and STM 3611, previously identified to participate in CsgD downregulation, where it repressed their expression. Consequently, although STM 1344 has not retained a direct role in c-di-GMP metabolism, it still participates in the regulation of c-di-GMP turnover and has a role in the transition between sessility and motility...|$|R

25|$|<b>Phosphodiesterase</b> inhibitors such as {{milrinone}} {{are sometimes}} utilized in severe cardiomyopathy. The {{mechanism of action}} is through inhibiting the breakdown and thereby increasing the concentration of cAMP similar to beta adrenoreceptor agonism, resulting in inotropic effects and modest diuretic effects.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil (Viagra). Concomitant {{administration}} of isosorbide mononitrate and sildenafil (Viagra) or other <b>phosphodiesterase</b> inhibitors (Tadalafil and Udenafil) can potentiate the vasodilatory effect of isosorbide mononitrate {{with the potential}} result of serious side-effects such as syncope or myocardial infarction. Life-threatening hypotension may also occur. Therefore, sildenafil should not be given to patients already receiving isosorbide mononitrate therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosphodiesterase</b> 4 is {{a member}} of the <b>phosphodiesterase</b> family of {{proteins}} that cleave phosphodiester bonds. This is an important step in degrading cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a major intracellular signaling molecule; conversely, blocking PDE4 will increase cAMP. Increased intracellular cAMP levels in neurons has been previously shown to induce axonal growth. In 2004, Nikulina et al. showed that administration of rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor, can increase cAMP levels in neurons after spinal cord injury. This is partially possible because rolipram is sufficiently small to pass through the bloodâ€“brain barrier and immediately begin to catalyze reactions in neurons. 10 day administration of rolipram in spinal cord injured rodents resulted in considerable axonal growth associated with a reduction in glial scarring at 2 weeks post-injury. The mechanism for this reduction in glial scarring is currently unknown, but possible mechanisms include axonal extensions that physically prevent reactive astrocytes from proliferating, as well as chemical signaling events to reduce reactive astrogliosis.|$|E
2500|$|Both cAMP and cGMP are {{degraded}} by hydrolysis of the 3' phosphodiester bond, {{resulting in}} a 5'NMP. [...] Degradation is carried out primarily by a class of enzymes known as <b>phosphodiesterases</b> (PDEs). [...] In mammalian cells, there are 11 known PDE families with varying isoforms of each protein expressed based on the cell's regulatory needs. [...] Some <b>phosphodiesterases</b> are cNMP-specific, while others can hydrolyze non-specifically. However, the cAMP and cGMP degradation pathways are much more understood than those for either cCMP or cUMP. [...] The identification of specific PDEs for cCMP and cUMP {{has not been as}} thoroughly established.|$|R
50|$|Numerous cyclic {{nucleotide}} <b>phosphodiesterases</b> (PDE) can degrade cGMP by hydrolyzing cGMP into 5'-GMP. PDE 5, -6 and -9 are cGMP-specific while PDE1, -2, -3, -10 and -11 can hydrolyse both cAMP and cGMP.|$|R
50|$|Various {{cellular}} {{responses are}} {{regulated by the}} second messengers cAMP and cGMP. <b>Phosphodiesterases,</b> such as PDE10A, eliminate cAMP- and cGMP-mediated intracellular signaling by hydrolyzing the cyclic nucleotide to the corresponding nucleoside 5-prime monophosphate.|$|R
25|$|A single {{randomized}} controlled trial found that sumatriptan {{may help prevent}} altitude sickness. Despite their popularity, antioxidant treatments have not {{been found to be}} effective medications for prevention of AMS. Interest in <b>phosphodiesterase</b> inhibitors such as sildenafil has been limited by the possibility that these drugs might worsen the headache of mountain sickness. A promising possible preventive for altitude sickness is myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP), which increases the amount of oxygen released by hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil is {{a potent}} and {{selective}} inhibitor of cGMP-specific <b>phosphodiesterase</b> type 5 (PDE5), {{which is responsible for}} degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The molecular structure of sildenafil {{is similar to that of}} cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections. Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} Ca2+ are also remarkable: it cooperates with DAG in {{activating}} PKC and can activate the CaM kinase pathway, in which calcium-modulated protein calmodulin (CaM) binds Ca2+, undergoes {{a change in}} conformation, and activates CaM kinase II, which has unique ability to increase its binding affinity to CaM by autophosphorylation, making CaM unavailable for the activation of other enzymes. The kinase then phosphorylates target enzymes, regulating their activities. The two signal pathways are connected together by Ca2+-CaM, {{which is also a}} regulatory subunit of adenylyl cyclase and <b>phosphodiesterase</b> in the cAMP signal pathway.|$|E
40|$|A current {{challenge}} in cellular signaling is {{to decipher the}} complex intracellular spatiotemporal organization that any given cell type has developed to discriminate among different external stimuli acting via a common signaling pathway. This obviously applies to cAMP and cGMP signaling in the heart, where these cyclic nucleotides determine the regulation of cardiac function by many hormones and neuromediators. Recent studies have identified cyclic nucleotide <b>phosphodiesterases</b> as key actors in limiting the spread of cAMP and cGMP, and in shaping and organizing intracellular signaling microdomains. With this new role, <b>phosphodiesterases</b> have been promoted from the rank of a housekeeping attendant to that of an executive officer. PublishedN/...|$|R
