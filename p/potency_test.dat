Topics were addressed in detail by speakers and workshop participants and are reported in a series of six reports. This workshop report, the third in the series, addresses methods and strategies for human vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> that can refine animal use to lessen pain and distress, improve animal welfare, and reduce animal use. Workshop participants agreed that the following <b>potency</b> <b>tests</b> for human vaccines should have the highest priority for development of reduction and/or refinement methods: (1) <b>potency</b> <b>tests</b> for vaccines that are most commonly used, (2) <b>potency</b> <b>tests</b> that require the largest number of animals, (3) <b>potency</b> <b>tests</b> that cause severe animal pain and distress, (4) tests where the knowledge base of each antigen is advanced, and (5) <b>potency</b> <b>tests</b> for which alternative methods already exist or are in development. Based on these criteria, the highest-priority human vaccines were identified as diphtheria and tetanus vaccines, pertussis vaccines (whole cell and acellular), rabies vaccine, anthrax vaccine, and complex combination vaccines (containing diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis together with other antigens such as IPV, Hib, and HepB). For successful implementation of reduction and refinement alternatives, further research is required into the development and broader use of humane endpoints, serological potency methods, and approaches that would reduce the number of animals used in currently approved potency assays. Because the workshop focused on both human and veterinary vaccines, workshop participants also recommended that human vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> methods for rabies and tetanus be reviewed for their potential application to the corresponding veterinary vaccines. Participants agreed that achieving broader acceptance and use of alternative methods, requires that the general principles and procedures for the validation of alternative methods for vaccines be standardized/harmonized internationally. The research, development, validation, and harmonization activities recommended at this workshop are expected to lead to new reduction and/or refinement of animal use in human vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> methods and more widespread adoption of existing methods that can reduce animal use and improve animal welfare while ensuring the continued safety and efficacy of human vaccines...|$|R
40|$|<b>Potency</b> <b>testing</b> is an {{important}} part of the evaluation of cellular therapy products. Potency assays are quantitative measures of a product-specific biological activity that is linked to a relevant biological property and, ideally, a product's in vivo mechanism of action. Both in vivo and in vitro assays can be used for <b>potency</b> <b>testing.</b> Since there is often a limited period of time between the completion of production and the release from the laboratory for administration to the patient, in vitro assays such are flow cytometry, ELISA, and cytotoxicity are typically used. Better potency assays are needed to assess the complex and multiple functions of cellular therapy products, some of which are not well understood. Gene expression profiling using microarray technology has been widely and effectively used to assess changes of cells in response to stimuli and to classify cancers. Preliminary studies have shown that the expression of noncoding microRNA which play {{an important}} role in cellular development, differentiation, metabolism and signal transduction can distinguish different types of stem cells and leukocytes.

The National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM), the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), and their international partners organized an international workshop to review the availability and validation status of alternative methods that might reduce, refine, or replace the use of animals for rabies vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing,</b> and to identify priority research and development efforts necessary to further advance alternative methods. Workshop participants agreed that rabies vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> using the mouse challenge test should use general anesthesia for intracerebral virus injections, and that humane endpoints should be used routinely {{as the basis for}} euthanizing animals to minimize pain and distress. Workshop participants recommended that a near term priority should be to replace the mouse challenge with a test validated to ensure potency, such as the mouse antibody serum neutralization test (SNT) for adjuvanted veterinary rabies vaccines for which an international collaborative study was recently completed. The workshop recommended that an in vitro antigen quantification test should be a high priority for product-specific validation of non-adjuvanted human and veterinary rabies vaccines.

The aim of this study was to determine the common components of commercially available serovar Canicola vaccines to aid development of an in vitro potency test; lipopolysaccharide and protein were chosen for analysis due to their known immunogenic properties. Analysis of five serovar Canicola vaccines (A-E) using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay and silver stained sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, indicated that lipopolysaccharide was not detectable in all vaccines tested preventing it from being a suitable biomarker for an in vitro test. Therefore the protein contents of vaccines A-E were determined by two dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (22 l± 3 l, 9 ± 8, 34 ± 4, 2 l± 5 and 34 ± 17 proteins [mean ± 1 standard deviation] found respectively) to identify conserved proteins. The outer membrane protein LipL 32 was shown to be common to vaccines A-E and to be present at a significantly higher (p:S 0. 05) relative spectral abundance in a batch of vaccine which passed the in vivo <b>potency</b> <b>test,</b> compared to one which failed.

Ideally, <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> measures a biological or biochemical property of the vaccine that is related to its ability to elicit protective immunity in the target population and provide some assurance that consistent clinical benefit is derived from each lot of product.

40|$|AbstractOnly one {{anthrax vaccine}} (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed, AVA) is {{licensed}} in the US to date, although new vaccines are under development. Logistic difficulties with the potency testing of AVA, plus humane considerations, have prompted {{the development of}} an alternative test method that {{can be used as a}} <b>potency</b> <b>test</b> not only for AVA, but also for newer vaccines. A <b>potency</b> <b>test</b> is not limited to measuring the concentration and quality of the antigen in the final formulation at the time of vaccine release, but should also detect changes in these characteristics during the dating period of the product, to ensure that the vaccine has retained its potency. We have developed a mouse immunogenicity test with potential for use as a <b>potency</b> <b>test</b> for anthrax vaccines. This model is based on the measurement of antibodies induced by a fixed dose of antigen. The test consists of two stages: a) the induction of antibodies in mice with one pre-selected test dose of vaccine; and b) the measurement of the response. We have established the test dose for AVA and experimental vaccines based on the use of anthrax Protective Antigen (PA). Two types of assays, an ELISA and a toxin neutralization assay (TNA) have been employed to measure antibodies to PA. TNA may be more useful in predicting vaccine efficacy, since it measures the neutralizing activity of sera against the cytotoxic effect of the toxin formed by PA when associated with Lethal Factor. However, anti-PA ELISA is less demanding from a technical point of view. Therefore, if ELISA were capable of detecting accurately changes in antigen quantity and quality, then it could be selected as the antibody-measuring test. Studies in our laboratory suggest that even though ELISA and TNA results are correlated, they may not be strictly interchangeable for quantification of anti-PA antibodies after a single immunization of mice with a test dose of anthrax vaccine. We have also found that TNA is better suited than ELISA to detect changes in immunogenicity caused by vaccine exposure to high temperature for very short periods (two minutes). These results open the possibility that an immunogenicity test in which TNA is used to quantify the anti-PA antibody responses can be used to measure vaccine potency of anthrax vaccines at the end of the manufacturing process and periodically after the finished product has been placed in storage, instead of an active protection test that requires lethal challenge...|$|E

The framework for regulation of biological products includes Statutes (e. g. The U. S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act), regulations as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and guidance documents. Approval of a biologics license for a product, including vaccines, {{is based on a}} demonstration of safety, purity, and potency and assurance that the facility for manufacture, processing, and packaging meets standards to ensure that product released for distribution is safe, pure and potent. The regulatory definitions of safety, purity and potency are detailed in Title 21 of the Code of Federal regulations (CFR) Part 600. All manufacturing information including tests for safety, purity, and potency for a particular product must be documented in the Biologics License Application (BLA). <b>Potency</b> <b>testing</b> may be performed on the final bulk sample or final container sample and may consist of either in vivo or in vitro tests or both. To change a <b>potency</b> or safety <b>test</b> post-licensure requires a Supplement to the License and data to support a modified or alternative test. CBER encourages the development and use of appropriate alternative methods for vaccine safety and <b>potency</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R
40|$|A 10 % {{suckling}} rat brain {{rabies vaccine}} free from encephalitogenic activity was prepared and inactivated with 1 : 8, 000 beta-propiolactone (BPL), or ultraviolet light, {{or a combination}} of ultraviolet light and BPL, or 1 % phenol. Potency was excellent in all samples, {{with the exception of the}} phenolized product which was marginal. A purified suckling rat brain (SRB) vaccine prepared by zonal centrifugation and inactivated with 1 : 8, 000 BPL contained about 0. 01 the amount of protein nitrogen of the unpurified 10 % SRB vaccine. This purified product passed the National Institutes of Health <b>potency</b> <b>test</b> for rabies vaccine after administration of a quantity equivalent to a standard 10 % brain suspension...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Bacillus anthracis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{homogenous}} bacteria ever described. Some level of diversity. Bacillus anthracis 17 JB is a laboratory strain It is broadly used as a challenge strain in guinea pigs for <b>potency</b> <b>test</b> of anthrax vaccine. Material and Methods: This work describes genetic characterization of B. anthracis 17 JB strain using the SNPs and MLVA genotyping. Results and Conclusion: In SNPs typing, the originally French 17 JB strain represented the A. Br. 008 / 009 subgroup. In Levy's genotyping method, 843, 451 and 864 bp long fragments were identified at AA 03, AJ 03 and AA 07 loci, respectively. In the vaccine manufacturer perspective these findings are much valuable on their own account, but similar research is re-quired to extend molecular knowledge of B. anthracis epidemiology in Persia...|$|E

40|$|The {{use of a}} density {{gradient}} procedure for the quantification of intact, inactivated poliovirus particles in vaccine preparations is described. The procedure is both sensitive and highly reproducible and the results correlate with those of <b>potency</b> <b>tests</b> in rats and with D-antigen content as measured by ELISA. Because of the occasional ambiguity observed with D-antigen assays, {{it is suggested that}} the {{density gradient}} procedure will provide valuable additional information for the in vitro assessment of inactivated poliovirus preparations...|$|R
