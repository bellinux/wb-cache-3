50|$|In an {{n-channel}} depletion-mode device, {{a negative}} gate-to-source voltage causes a depletion region {{to expand in}} width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the active region expands to completely close the channel, {{the resistance of the}} channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned off like a switch (see right figure, when there is very small current). This is called pinch-off, and the voltage at which it occurs is called the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>voltage.</b> Conversely, a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily (see right figure, when there is a conduction channel and current is large).|$|E

40|$|In this work, a Junction Field Effect Transistor (JFET) {{based on}} {{amorphous}} silicon suitable for large area linear application is presented. The drain-source contacts {{are made on}} top of the n-layer of a glass/metal/p+-i-n structure. The channel conductivity can be modulated by a reverse bias applied to the junction, which varies the depletion region width. The depletion of the n-doped layer, hampered by the high defect density of the doped amorphous silicon material, has been studied by using a one-dimensional finite-difference simulator, which gives the free electron concentration as a function of reverse applied bias, dopant concentration and thickness of the intrinsic layer.

40|$|III-nitrides are a {{promising}} material system with unique material properties, which {{allows them to}} be utilized {{in a variety of}} semiconductor devices. III-nitrides grown by NH 3 -MOMBE are typically grown with high carbon levels (> 1021 cm- 3) {{as a result of the}} incomplete surface pyrolysis of the metal-organic sources. Recent research has involved the compensating nature of carbon in III-nitrides to produce semi-insulating films, which can provide low-leakage buffer layers in transistor devices. The aim of this work is to investigate the possibility of forming a 2 DEG, which utilizes the highly carbon-doped GaN layers grown by NH 3 -MOMBE to produce low-leakage buffer layers in the fabrication of HEMTs. These low leakage GaN buffers would provide increased HEMT performance, with better <b>pinch-off,</b> higher breakdown <b>voltages</b> and increased power densities. Additionally, methods of controlling and/or reducing the incorporation of carbon will be undertaken in an attempt to broaden the range of possible device applications for NH 3 -MOMBE.

40|$|Solution {{processed}} field-effect transistors {{based on}} single crystalline silicon nanowires (Si NWs) with metal Schottky contacts are demonstrated. The semiconducting layer was deposited from a nanowire ink formulation at room temperature. The devices with 230 nm thick SiO 2 gate insulating layers show excellent output current-voltage characteristics with early saturation voltages under 2 volts, constant saturation current and exceptionally low dependence of saturation voltage with the gate field. Operational principles {{of these devices}} are markedly different from traditional ohmic-contact field-effect transistors (FETs), and are explained using the source-gated transistor (SGT) concept in which the semiconductor under the reverse biased Schottky source barrier is depleted leading to low <b>voltage</b> <b>pinch-off</b> and saturation of drain current. Device parameters including activation energy are extracted at different temperatures and gate voltages to estimate the Schottky barrier height for different electrode materials to establish transistor performance - barrier height relationships. Numerical simulations are performed using 2 D thin-film approximation of the device structures at various Schottky barrier heights. Without any adjustable parameters and only assuming low p-doping of the transistor channel, the modelled data show exceptionally good correlation with the measured data. From both experimental and simulation results, it is concluded that source-barrier controlled nanowire transistors have excellent potential advantages compared with a standard FET including mitigation of short-channel effects, insensitivity in device operating currents to device channel length variation, higher on/off ratios, higher gain, lower power consumption and higher operational speed for solution processable and printable nanowire electronics.

40|$|ABSTRACT Design, Microfabrication, and Characterization of Polar III-Nitride HFETs Alireza Loghmany, Ph. D. Concordia University, 2016 With {{excellent}} {{performance in}} high-frequency power amplifiers, AlGaN/GaN heterojunction field-effect transistors (HFETs) as next generation power amplifiers have drawn {{a great deal}} of attention in the last decade. These HFETs, however, are still quite limited by their inherently depletion-mode (D-mode: negative <b>pinch-off</b> <b>voltage)</b> nature, relatively poor gate-leakage, and questionable long-terms reliability. In addition, since AlGaN/GaN HFETs operate at extremely high-power densities, performance of these devices has so far remained quite limited by self-heating effects. While a number of techniques have already been developed for realization of enhancement-mode (E-mode: positive <b>pinch-off</b> <b>voltage)</b> AlGaN/GaN HFETs, these techniques in addition to having a number of difficulties in achieving enhancement-/depletion-mode pairs, fall short of satisfying requirements such as low leakage-current, drain-current stability, and <b>pinch-off</b> <b>voltage</b> stability at the high operating temperatures and at elevated electric-fields. Among these techniques, fluoride-based plasma treatment is the most widely accepted. As an alternative to this mainstream technique, polarization-engineering of AlGaN/GaN HFETs through exploring the impacts of the mesa geometry is studied as a possible avenue for selective transformation of the D-mode nature of AlGaN/GaN HFETs to an E-mode character. Whereas limited experimental studies on the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>voltage</b> of HFETs realized on different isolation-feature geometries have indicated the presence of a certain correlation between the two, such observations lack the required depth to accurately identify the true culprit. This technique is expected to be ultimately capable of producing enhancement-/depletion-mode pairs without adding any extra steps to the microfabrication process. In light of this requirement, microfabrication of AlGaN/GaN HFETs using a number of alternative isolation-feature geometries is explored in this study. In addition to developing an in-house microfabrication process, transistors designed according to these novel isolation-feature geometries have been fabricated through the services offered by Canadian Microelectronics Corporation (CMC). Investigation of the variation of <b>pinch-off</b> <b>voltage</b> among the devices fabricated through this latter means has conclusively indicated that the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>voltage</b> shift, rather than exclusively being caused by the surrounding-field effect, is also correlated to the perimeter-to-area ratio of the isolation-features. In addition, through characterization and thermal modeling of these groups of devices, in this study a new approach is unveiled for reducing self-heating in AlGaN/GaN HFETs. According to finite element analysis (FEA) and electrical measurement of average channel temperature, an improved heat-dissipation was observed in HFETs enjoying a more distributed nature of the two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) channel. This is observed to be the case especially for isolation features which offered the center of the channel a smaller distance to the side walls. Observations also indicate a more distinct gain in thermal management with reduction of the gate-length and also the surface area of the isolation pattern. Results suggest that self-heating in AlGaN/GaN HFETs can be substantially nullified by reducing the island-width below a certain threshold value, while maintaining the total width of the transistor constant. In addition to exploring these alternatives on AlGaN/GaN HFET structures, in-house microfabrication of AlN/GaN MISFETs is also studied. The results of DC characterization of these novel transistors are also presented...|$|E
