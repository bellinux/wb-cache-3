5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí perfected his <b>personal</b> <b>style,</b> {{inspired}} by the organic shapes of nature, putting into practise {{a whole series of}} new structural solutions originating from his deep analysis of ruled geometry. To this he added a great creative freedom and an imaginative ornamental style. His works acquired a great structural richness, with shapes and volumes devoid of rational rigidity or any classic premise.|$|E
5|$|Having honed his <b>personal</b> <b>style</b> {{as a young}} man, and {{sticking}} broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E

30|$|With {{the shift}} from a linear {{predictive}} perspective to a complex dynamic one {{in the field of}} applied linguistics, more ecological studies on English language teachers’ behaviors and styles are needed. Thus, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to explore Iranian English language teachers’ <b>personal</b> <b>styles,</b> namely controlling parent, nurturing parent, adult, adapted child, and natural child, from an ecological perspective. The data collected with 48 semi structured interviews, 96 journals, and 24 observations with 8 English language teachers were analyzed qualitatively by utilizing nested ecosystems model as an analytical framework, which led to the identification of internal and external factors underpinning teachers’ <b>personal</b> <b>styles</b> at the micro system. Moreover, the existence of meso, exo, macrosystem and their effects on teachers’ <b>personal</b> <b>styles</b> were suggested in the data. The findings of the study indicate that the teachers’ constructed <b>personal</b> <b>styles</b> in the classroom are very dynamic and they change within the particularities of each class in terms of the variables explored in this study. More interpretation of systematic intervention of each variable regarding the teachers’ <b>personal</b> <b>styles</b> was discussed.|$|R

5|$|Regardless of his <b>personal</b> <b>style,</b> Cubitt was {{credited}} by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, with achieving the desired results. The 38th Division had mounted a successful but very costly attack in April 1918; under Major General Cubitt's command, the division mounted two further major operations, at the Battle of Albert in August and Battle of Cambrai in October. Both were successful, with the division demonstrating flexibility, improvisation, {{and a highly}} effective tactical doctrine. The division's performance at Cambrai was sufficiently good to rank {{it as one of}} the most effective British divisions during the Hundred Days Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Adam used a {{wide variety}} of sources for his designs, and created an inventive <b>personal</b> <b>style</b> of decoration. His chief {{influences}} were from English Palladianism, and several of his houses have been likened to designs reproduced in Colen Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus, but Adam mixed these with English Baroque motifs from Gibbs and Vanbrugh. He relied greatly on a range of French, Italian and English pattern books, including Gibbs' Book of Architecture, from which he borrowed freely with little regard for consistency of style. In addition, he took inspiration from earlier Scottish renaissance architecture, and from his predecessors Bruce and Smith. During his nearly 30-year career as an architect, Adam designed, extended or remodelled over 40 country houses, and undertook numerous public contracts. He also laid out landscape garden schemes, for instance at Newliston and Taymouth Castle.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, Gaudí was working on numerous projects simultaneously. They reflected his shift to a more <b>personal</b> <b>style</b> inspired by nature. In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his Casa Calvet. During {{the first decade of the}} century Gaudí dedicated himself to projects like the Casa Figueras (Figueras house, better known as Bellesguard), the Park Güell, an unsuccessful urbanisation project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed the Casa Batlló (Batlló house) and the Casa Milà (Milá house), two of his most emblematic works.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{works were}} played {{frequently}} {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, <b>personal</b> <b>style</b> of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.|$|E
5|$|Kyo is an overconfident but well-meaning person, more {{interested}} in enjoying life than taking on responsibilities. He is quick to dismiss subjects that do not interest him and will often carry out his actions with a devil-may-care attitude. He treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence and particularly dotes on his girlfriend, Yuki. His strong sense of justice and zeal to fight stronger opponents are what he believes drives him {{to carry out his}} destiny. Kyo enters most of The King of Fighters tournaments representing the Japanese team along with teammates Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon. In his fights he uses the clan's martial art style, the , attacking opponents using flames along with several hits. In later series' tournaments he would combine fire with a <b>personal</b> <b>style</b> of kenpō.|$|E

A pesquisa articulou-se a partir da percepção de que há um descompasso entre a multiplicidade de propostas que a moda atual apresenta e as normas classificatórias estipuladas pelo <b>personal</b> <b>styling.</b> Diante deste contexto, a dissertação apresenta casos de quebras de regras no vestir como uma possibilidade de ampliação de repertório para o <b>personal</b> <b>styling.</b> Tomando a bricolagem como opção metodológica, foi elaborado um conjunto de ferramentas teóricas capazes de dialogar com os dados coletados em reportagens, postagens em blogs, entrevista {{individual}} e entrevistas para TV. Mais do que coletar informações de fontes diversas, a pesquisa promove um entrecruzamento entre meus posicionamentos sobre os direcionamentos do <b>personal</b> <b>styling,</b> as pistas que evidenciam quebra de regras no vestir e o ponto de vista de autores dos campos da moda, filosofia, estudos culturais e cultura visual, construindo uma reflexão acerca do tema. Dado este panorama, procuro discutir como o personal stylist pode se posicionar atualmente, como pode expandir seu campo de ação e também como pode atuar levando em consideração o modo de vida de seus clientes. The {{purpose of}} this dissertation heads for the observation of the mechanisms that surrounds the work of <b>personal</b> <b>styling</b> in the contemporary setting. The research was articulated from the perception {{that there is a}} mismatch between the multiplicity of proposals that the current fashion displays and the qualifying standards stipulated by <b>personal</b> <b>styling.</b> Given this context, the dissertation presents the cases of breaks of rules on dressing as a possibility to expand the repertoire for the <b>personal</b> <b>styling.</b> Taking the bricolage as a methodological option, we designed a set of theoretical tools capable of dialoguing with the data collected in media reports, blog posts, individual interviews and TV interviews. Rather than gathering information from various sources, this research promotes an interaction between my positions on the directions of <b>personal</b> <b>styling,</b> the clues that reveal breaking rules on dressing and {{the point of view of}} authors from the fields of fashion, philosophy, cultural studies and visual culture, building a reflection on the theme. Given this panorama, I try to discuss how the stylists can position themselves nowadays, how they can expand their field of action and also how they can act taking into consideration their customers’ lifestyle...|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{the concept}} of teachers’ {{development}} has invited lots of attention within different domains such as teachers’ belief (Cross 2009; Kulinna et al. 2000; Tondeur et al. 2008; Türel and Johnson 2012), teachers’ motivation (Kao et al. 2011; Pelletier et al. 2002), teachers’ success (Ghaemi and Taherian 2011; Ghanizadeh and Moafian 2011) and teachers’ anxiety (Abu-Rabia* 2004; Beilock et al. 2010; Vinson 2001). However, most of these studies are more empirical and quantitative and have not covered the diversity of factors involved {{in the construction of}} these concepts of teachers’ development and one of the main ones is teachers’ <b>personal</b> <b>styles.</b> Within the current knowledge base, there still remains a lack of concern for an ecological conceptual framework to inform methodology of research on teachers’ <b>personal</b> <b>styles.</b> Thus, the need for an ecological conceptual framework underpinning research in teachers’ <b>personal</b> <b>styles</b> based on the mentioned ecological factors is felt.|$|R
5|$|The {{environment}} of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a <b>personal</b> <b>style</b> and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management. These works were a success, with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, Ages Ago, opening in 1869. Ages Ago was also {{the beginning of a}} collaboration with the composer Frederic Clay that would last seven years and produce four works. It was at a rehearsal for Ages Ago that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, Arthur Sullivan. The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|Undone {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics with many praising the album's <b>personal</b> <b>style,</b> although some critics argued the album's songwriting and sound were too similar to MercyMe's previous efforts.

In the United States, Undone debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 1 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart, selling over 55,000 copies {{in its first}} week. It spent a total of two weeks atop the Christian Albums chart and was the fifth-best selling Christian album of 2004 and the fourteenth best-selling Christian album of 2005.

5|$|Bruce and Hughes clashed in both {{style and}} ideology. Bruce found Hughes' {{management}} of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But {{he served as a}} strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable <b>personal</b> <b>style,</b> his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.|$|E

5|$|After Caracalla {{concluded}} {{his campaign}} against the Alamanni, it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with the Greek-Macedonian general and conqueror Alexander the Great. He began openly mimicking Alexander in his <b>personal</b> <b>style.</b> In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire, Caracalla decided to equip 16,000 of his men with Macedonian-style phalanxes, despite the Roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation. The historian Christopher Matthew mentions that the term Phalangarii has two possible meanings, both with military connotations. The first refers merely to the Roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes, and the second bears similarity to the 'Marian Mules' of the late Roman Republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole, which were in use until at least the 2nd century AD. As a consequence, the Phalangarii of Legio II Parthica {{may not have been}} pikemen, but rather standard battle line troops or possibly Triarii. Caracalla's mania for Alexander went so far that Caracalla visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. This was a sign of Caracalla's increasingly erratic behaviour. But this mania for Alexander, strange as it was, was overshadowed by subsequent events in Alexandria.|$|E
