50|$|In 1933, a woman {{known on}} court records as Mrs. Brown consented {{to have her}} eyelashes {{permanently}} dyed. Unfortunately, the product, Lash Lure, used para-phenylenediamine, a chemical extremely toxic to the body, as the dyeing agent. At the time, cosmetics were unregulated by the Federal Drug Administration, and the dangers of <b>paraphenylenediamine</b> were unknown. Within hours of the treatment, Mrs. Brown began experiencing severe symptoms of stinging and burning eyes. By the next morning, Mrs. Brown’s eyes had developed ulcers which oozed and had swollen shut. Use of Lash Lure resulted in blindness in Mrs. Brown and fifteen other women and also caused the death of another. It was only after the Lash Lure incident and several others like it, documented in Ruth deForest Lamb’s book entitled American Chamber of Horrors, that Congress granted the FDA the right to regulate cosmetics in 1938.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTemporary henna tattoos {{are very}} popular among {{travelers}} visiting Southeast Asia {{as they are}} cheap, safe, easy to remove, and not painful.

40|$|HAIR dyeing, a {{practice}} of great antiquity, is still widely prevalent today. A variety of materials are used {{for the purpose of}} producing variously tinted hair. These substances fall into three groups: (1) Those of vegetable origin (henna, chamomile); (2) metallic substances (silver, manganese, bismuth); (3) synthetic compounds (<b>paraphenylenediamine,</b> paratoluylenediamine, pyro-gallol). Because of the ease of application, the relative permanence, and sup-posed "naturalness " of the resulting tints, the last group has been greatly exploited in recent years. Soon after their introduction, however, as important fixtures in the cosmetic armamentarium, reports of toxic effects began to appear in medical literature. Because of these adverse comments and of restrictive legislation adopted in some European countries and in certain states in this country, 1 it has been neces-sary for the manufacturers to change the composition of their products on several occasions. <b>Paraphenylenediamine</b> {{was the first of the}} synthetic com-pounds to be used and is still, probably, widely used even today.

40|$|CONTEXT Patch test is {{the gold}} {{standard}} for detection of causative allergens in allergic contact dermatitis. Though chronic urticaria is a multifactorial condition, a sizeable number of such patients are thought to be due to various contact allergens. Hence, a hospital based prospective study of patch test positivity to various allergens was conducted in patients suffering from chronic urticaria. AIMS To evaluate the pattern of allergen positivity in chronic urticaria patients by patch test using Indian Standard Series. SETTINGS & DESIGN Prospective investigational study was conducted at Dermatology, Venereology and Leprosy department of a tertiary care hospital attached to a postgraduate training institute in Telangana state of India. METHODS & MATERIAL Thirty chronic urticaria patients, above 18 years of age were evaluated with patch test of Indian standard series. Two of these patients had prior history of contact sensitivity to rubber and <b>paraphenylenediamine.</b> Patch test was done by application of allergens of Indian standard series over upper back. Patch test site was examined after 48 hours and after 72 hours. Patch test was considered positive if erythema, erythematous papules or vesicles were found at the site of application of corresponding allergen. RESULTS Patch test was positive in 4 out of 30 patients of chronic urticaria, fragrance, black rubber mix, <b>paraphenylenediamine</b> and parthenium being the allergens in 1 patient each. Patients with positive patch test to black rubber mix and <b>paraphenylenediamine</b> had prior history of contact allergy.

30|$|The major {{ingredient}} in most hair dyes is <b>paraphenylenediamine</b> (PPD) in concentration ranging from 2 to 10 % (Senthilkumaran & Thirumalaikolundusubramania, 2015). The effects of PPD when ingested are serious and may cause cervicofacial edema, mucosal injury, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and myocardial injury, cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias {{as well as}} atrophy of the optic nerve resulting in blindness in a patient who ingested an estimated amount of 7  g <b>paraphenylenediamine</b> and cause death (Bhargava & Matthew, 2007; Chandran et al., 2012; Kondle, Pathapati, Saginela, Malliboina, & Makineedi, 2012; Nohyneka, Fautzb, Benech-Kiefferc, & Toutaina, 2004; Sanchez, Handyal, Kannan, Siddalingeshwara, Alvarez-Uria, Gavalda, & Cobella, 2016; Senthilkumaran & Thirumalaikolundusubramania, 2015). It is reported that some commercial hair dyes contain a potent nephrotoxic cocktail containing PPD, propylene glycol, and resorcinol and histological changes of acute tubular necrosis have been described in PPD poisoning (Prabhakar & Kamalakar, 2012). The characteristic chocolate brown color of urine could be confirmative evidence of hair dye poisoning in an individual with the poisoning of PPD. This later {{is thought to have}} abortive effect in rural Africa (Zaid, Al-ramahi, Abu ghoush, Jaradat, & Musmar, 2013). There is no antidote for PPD poisoning (Prabhakar & Kamalakar, 2012; Sakuntala et al., 2015). If the poisoning is not recognized early, it has a very high incidence of mortality (Garg, Tiwari, & Ahlawat, 2014). The edema of the face, neck, and laryngeal region could be severe enough to cause respiratory distress and hypoxia, and necessitate an early and emergency intubation or tracheostomy which is lifesaving in such patients (Chandran et al., 2012).|$|E

This clinical presentation could be explained by cross-sensitivity to sulfanilic acid (4 -aminobenzene sulfonic acid), a metabolite of sunset yellow (FD&C No. 6). Sunset yellow is an azo dye present in this tablet. Indeed, PPD-allergic subjects may suffer from cross-sensitivity to related compounds, especially to those that can be ingested such as azo dyes.

Paraphenyl-enediamine leads to hypersensitivity reactions, involving allergic and irritant contact dermatitis [1 – 3]. Since tattoo and hair dyes are now frequently used in younger chil-dren, complications of these applications (which are con-sidered harmless and temporary) are appearing in chil-dren. In this study, two pediatric patients who presented to our department with clinical symptoms similar to an-gioedema and allergic contact dermatitis are discussed.

40|$|This article {{gives the}} results of contact {{allergic}} reactions to cosmetics seen between 1985 and 1990 (462 patients investigated) and between 1991 and 1996 (486 patients investigated). Perfume components remain the most frequently occurring allergens in cosmetics. They are followed by preservative agents, a class within which important shifts have occurred over time (e. g. as with the isothiazolinone mixture). Excipients and certainly emulsifiers (e. g. cocamidopropylbetaine) are potentially not only irritants but also allergens. Among the "active" or category-specific ingredients, oxidative hair dyes, based on <b>paraphenylenediamine</b> and derivatives, and nail care products, based on (meth) acrylates are particularly apt to cause professional dermatoses.

Alternating 1 -lam-thick Epon sections were stained with <b>paraphenylenediamine</b> (PD) or with Po antiserum according to the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. To localize Po in Schwann cell cytoplasm and myelin membranes, the distribution of immunostaining observed in 1 -ltm sections was mapped on electron micrographs of identical areas found in adjacent thin sections. The first Po staining was observed around axons and/or in cytoplasm of Schwann cells that had established a 1 : 1 relationship with axons. In newborn nerves, staining of newly formed myelin sheaths was detected more readily with PO antiserum than with PD. Myelin sheaths with as few as three lamellae could be identified with the light microscope. Very thin sheaths often stained less intensely and part of their circumference frequently was unstained. Schmidt-Lanterman clefts found in more mature sheaths also were unstained. As myelination progressed, intensely stained myelin rings became much more numerous and, in adult nerves, all sheaths were intensely and uniformly stained.
