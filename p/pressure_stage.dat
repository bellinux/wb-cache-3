40|$|The tip {{clearance}} flow within industrial axial compressor rows {{has a significant}} impact on compressor performance. This is especially the case in the later high <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> which have a significantly shorter blade length and relatively larger {{tip clearance}} than the early <b>stages.</b> <b>Pressure</b> driven fluid leaks through the tip clearance producing losses and because of the short blading this is the largest source of loss in the high <b>pressure</b> <b>stages.</b> Most tip clearance flow work and understanding focuses on the early stages which have smaller relative tip clearances and are similar to aero engines. This work strives to understand the physics behind these large tip clearance flows and how they can be managed to reduce losses increasing the efficiency of the machine. It would be desirable to use computational techniques to solve all flow feature problems within turbomachinery reducing time and cost. However these techniques have limited accuracy and rely on the expertise of the user to obtain the best result possible. For this reason experimental result are used to calibrate and understand the differences between the computational and real machines. 2. Why? The tip clearance is required because of the relative motion of the blade to the casing {{and they need to be}} large enough to cope with thermal expansions of the blades and casing at the most extreme operating conditions. Throughout the compressor the density of the working fluid is increased from stage to stage thus the volumetric flow rate decreases for the same mass flow rate. This means that the annulus cross sectional area has to be reduced to keep a reasonable axial velocity. An industrial axial machine has one shaft thus all of the blade rows in the compressor and turbine rotate at the same rotational velocity. Therefore in order to keep the tangential blade speed up to produce blade loading the radius has to be kept large. This means that the tip clearances in the high <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> are relatively large compared to the blade radius and can typically be six percent of the annulus height. Improving the flow through the high <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> will increase the efficiency and make the compressor more robust increasing the operating range postponing stall or surge...|$|R

Double <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> allows protecting friction components against excessive thermal loads (double <b>pressure</b> <b>stage).</b> Both the systems allow preventing over-braking: according to the regulations [1] and [10], braking forces applied to wheels have to be limited, in order to prevent over-braking, defined as “brake application exceeding the available wheel/rail adhesion”.|$|E

50|$|The lowest <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> need {{relatively}} more surface area {{to achieve the}} same energy transport across the tube walls. The expense of installing this surface area limits the usefulness of using very low pressures and temperatures in the later stages. Gases dissolved in the feed water may contribute to reducing the pressure differentials if they are allowed to accumulate in the stages.|$|R
25|$|In a {{multi-stage}} compressor, at {{the high}} <b>pressure</b> <b>stages,</b> axial velocity is very small. Stalling value decreases with a small deviation from the design point causing stall near the hub and tip regions whose size increases with decreasing flow rates. They grow larger at very low flow rate and affect the entire blade height. Delivery pressure significantly drops with large stalling {{which can lead to}} flow reversal. The stage efficiency drops with higher losses.|$|R

50|$|To {{maximize}} {{turbine efficiency}} the steam is expanded, doing work, {{in a number}} of stages. These stages are characterized by how the energy is extracted from them and are known as either impulse or reaction turbines.

Typically, lower pressure sections are reaction type and higher <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> are impulse type.|$|R
50|$|There was one turbine and one {{alternator}} per unit. Each turbine had a High <b>Pressure</b> (HP) <b>stage,</b> an Intermediate <b>Pressure</b> (IP) <b>stage</b> and two Low <b>Pressure</b> (LP) <b>stages</b> {{all connected}} in tandem {{to the same}} shaft. The superheated steam entered the HP turbine at a temperature of 566 °C and a pressure of 162 bar. The exhaust steam from the HP turbine travelled back through the boiler Reheater and entered the IP turbine at the same temperature but at a lower pressure of 43.5 bar. The exhaust steam from the IP turbine then entered the LP turbines. The steam was used to drive the turbines, causing the shaft to rotate at 3,000 rpm. This speed drove the alternator and gave a frequency of 50 cycles per second (Hz) and allowed connection to the National Grid. Electricity was generated at 17 kilovolts (kV).|$|R
5000|$|Increasing {{pressure}} ratio, as Figure 1 above shows, {{increasing the}} pressure ratio increases {{the efficiency of}} the Brayton cycle. This is analogous to the increase of efficiency seen in the Otto cycle when the compression ratio is increased. However, practical limits occur when it comes to increasing the pressure ratio. First of all, increasing the pressure ratio increases the compressor discharge temperature. This can cause the temperature of the gasses leaving the combustor to exceed the metallurgical limits of the turbine. Also, the diameter of the compressor blades becomes progressively smaller in higher <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> of the compressor. Because the gap between the blades and the engine casing increases in size {{as a percentage of the}} compressor blade height as the blades get smaller in diameter, a greater percentage of the compressed air can leak back past the blades in higher <b>pressure</b> <b>stages.</b> This causes a drop in compressor efficiency, and is most likely to occur in smaller gas turbines (since blades are inherently smaller to begin with). Finally, as can be seen in Figure 1, the efficiency levels off as pressure ratio increases. Hence, little gain is expected by increasing the pressure ratio further if it is already at a high level.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} design of the {{supercharging}} system for a strongly downsized engine, to be installed on a sport car. Design is supported by cfd- 1 d engine simulations, using an experimentally calibrated model. The goal of the supercharging system is to deliver the required values of boost pressure at steady operating conditions, and to maintain or improve the full size engine response during acceleration (one of the most critical issues for downsized engines). Two options have been considered: 1) two-stage turbocharging, with two small turbochargers as a high-pressure stage, and one big turbo as low <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> (referred to as "TRITURBO"; 2) two-stage supercharging made up of one low <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> turbocharger and one electric supercharger (referred to as "E-SUPER").

TRITURBO is less expensive than E-SUPER, but also less fuel efficient and more difficult to install on the vehicle...|$|E

40|$|Clearance leakage {{losses of}} axial {{compressor}} rotors and stators {{have a major}} impact on the overall compressor performance.
