Methods: The authors investigated die fate of inhaled <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (80 parts per million) in mice and quantified the formation of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> metabolites in blood and tissues. The authors tested whether the accumulation of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> metabolites correlated with the ability of inhaled <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> to protect against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. Results: Mice absorbed <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> in a nearly linear fashion (0. 19 +/- 0. 02 mu mol/g (.) h). Breathing <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> rapidly increased {{a broad spectrum of}} <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> metabolites.

50|$|<b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> {{is known}} as an {{important}} stimulator of cell proliferation, maturation and differentiation. Thus, <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> increases fibroblast proliferation and thereby collagen production in wound healing. Also, L-arginine and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> are required for proper cross linking of collagen fibers, via proline, to minimize scarring and maximize the tensile strength of healed tissue. Endothelial cell specific <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase (EcNOS) is activated by the pulsatile flow of blood through vessels. <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> produced by EcNOS, maintains the diameter of blood vessels and proper blood flow to tissues. In addition to this, <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> also regulates angiogenesis, which {{plays a major role}} in wound healing. Thus, diabetic patients exhibit reduced ability to generate <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> from L-arginine. Reasons that have been postulated in the literature include accumulation of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase inhibitor due to high glucose associated kidney dysfunction and reduced production of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase due to ketoacidosis observed in diabetic patients and pH dependent nature of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase.|$|R
40|$|<b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> {{is a small}} {{free radical}} {{generated}} by family of enzymes, the <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthases. In a series of experiments performed over the last 15 years we showed that <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> is induced by all three isoforms of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase during tendon healing and that it plays a crucial beneficial role in restoring tendon function. In normal tendon we found very little <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase activity while in injured rat and human tendons <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase activity was expressed in healing fibroblasts in a temporal fashion. In healing rat Achilles tendon fibroblasts the first isoform to be expressed was endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase (eNOS), followed by inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase (iNOS), and then brain or neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase (bNOS).

Moreover, we studied the effect on pulmonary mechanics, surfactant activity, and pulmonary oxidative stress of the different treatments. Twenty-eight piglets with acute lung injury induced by lung lavages with saline were randomized to receive <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> plus prostacyclin, <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> plus ADM or saline, after. Dynamic compliance, tidal volume, and airway resistance were measured. Lung tissue oxidation was evaluated by measuring total hydroperoxide and advanced oxidation protein products in bronchial aspirate samples.

Inhaled <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> combined with prostacyclin or ADM was more effective than <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> alone in lowering PAP and improving oxygenation. <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> alone or combined increased lung compliance and tidal volume, and decreased airway resistance.

40|$|AbstractActivated mouse macrophages {{can produce}} {{high levels of}} <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> an {{antimicrobial}} effector molecule recently also implicated in antiviral defense. As viral infection may alter macrophage functions, <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production was investigated in murine macrophages infected with a Flavivirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. Infected macrophages produced high levels of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide without priming, while in control macrophages induction of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production by lipopolysaccharide required priming with interferon-γ. Addition of interferon-γ to infected macrophages further increased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production. In contrast, <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production upon stimulation with interferon-γ plus tumor necrosis factor-α was markedly reduced in infected macrophages. Downregulation of interferon-γ plus tumor necrosis factor-α-induced <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthesis by viral infection {{could be attributed to}} endogenous interferon-αβ produced by infected macrophages. Addition of interferon-αβ to uninfected macrophages inhibited interferon-γ plus tumor necrosis factor-α-induced <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production, and addition of interferon-αβ antibodies to infected macrophages increased identically stimulated <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production to normal levels. Thus, interferon-αβ mimicked the effect of viral infection on macrophage <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production. These findings indicate that viral infection profoundly alters requirements of mouse macrophages for induction of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthesis, depending on the activating signal applied.

Treatment of HT- 29 cells with the <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> donor Deta NONOate (50 nM) as well as induction of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase II mRNA and production of endogenous <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> by inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and IL- 1 α) increased the invasiveness of HT- 29 cells by approximately 40 % and 75 %, respectively.

By northern analysis, we detected inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase mRNA in four of 15 human melanoma cell lines cultured without inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase inducing cytokines. Induction of inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase mRNA by tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and lipopolysaccharides was seen in normal human melanocytes but not in melanoma cell lines. In accordance, inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase protein expression was clearly inducible in cultures of normal melanocytes, whereas in six melanoma cell lines investigated, inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase was found weakly expressed already before treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and lipopolysaccharides, and its expression was not inducible. The apoptotic rates both in normal melanocytes and in two melanoma cell lines (SK-Mel- 19 and O-Mel- 2) were increased by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and lipopolysaccharides; however, these effects could not be prevented by the specific <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of inhaled <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> on pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics in cardiac surgical patients. Twenty patients (age 57 ± 6 years) were studied in the operating room after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, systemic vascular resistance, and mean aortic pressure were determined at four points of data collection: before <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> with 20 ppm <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> with 40 ppm <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> and after <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide.</b> Statistical analysis was by analysis of variance; significance was accepted for p < 0. 05.

Pulmonary vascular resistance was lowered from 343 ± 30 before <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> to 233 ± 25 dynes · sec - 1 · cm - 5 with 20 ppm <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide.</b> Pulmonary vascular resistance was not further lowered by 40 ppm <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (p < 0. 05). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 29 ± 1 mm Hg before <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> and was lowered to 22 ± 1 mm Hg by 20 ppm <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> and 21 ± 1 mm Hg by 40 ppm <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (p < 0. 05).

40|$|SYNOPSIS. <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> {{serves as}} an orthograde {{synaptic}} cotransmitter between identified neurons in the cerebral ganglion of Aplysia. <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase, the enzyme that produces <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> is localized in a few specific neurons in the ganglia, including neuron C 2. Guanylyl cyclase the target enzyme of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> is found in neurons C 4 and MCC, which are synaptic followers of C 2. Stimulation of C 2 causes a vsEPSP in these neurons that is reduced to 50 % of its amplitude by <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase inhibitors and guanylyl cyclase inhibitors. The remaining portion of the vsEPSP is mediated by histamine. Thus, <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> and histamine act as orthograde cotransmitters in producing the vsEPSP. Both cotransmitters cause closure of a background potassium channel, which depolarizes the neuron and enhances its response to synaptic inputs. Exogenous <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (released by <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> donor molecules) and histamine mimic the vsEPSP’s depolarization and decreased membrane conductance. When neurons C 4 or MCC are isolated in cell culture they respond {{just as they do}} in the ganglion, i. e., the <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> response but not the histamine response is blocked by guanylyl cyclase inhibitors, and the membrane conductance is decreased by both histamine and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide.</b> Aplysia hemolymph partially suppresses the response to <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> due to <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> scavenging by hemocyanin, which contains copper and is the equivalent of hemoglobin. Neuron C 2 followers that are hyperpolarized by histamine are insen-sitive to <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide.</b> Thus, only select follower neurons respond to both transmit-ters...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} and subcellular localization of L-citrulline {{was analyzed}} {{in the adult}} rat brain and {{compared with that of}} traditional markers for the presence of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase. Light, transmission electron, and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to study tissue sections processed for immunocytochemistry employing a monoclonal antibody against L-citrulline or polyclonal anti-neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase sera, and double immunofluorescence to detect neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase and L-citrulline co-localization. The results demonstrate that the same CNS regions and cell types are labeled by neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase polyclonal antisera and L-citrulline monoclonal antibodies, using both immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence. Short-term pretreatment with a <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase inhibitor reduces L-citrulline immunostaining, but does not affect neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase immunoreactivity. In the vestibular brainstem, double immunofluorescence studies show that many, but not all, neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase-positive cells co-express L-citrulline, and that local intracellular patches of intense L-citrulline accumulation are present in some neurons. Conversely, all L-citrulline-labeled neurons co-express neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase. Cells expressing neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase alone are interpreted as neurons with the potential to produce <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> under other stimulus conditions, and the subcellular foci of enhanced L-citrulline staining are viewed as intracellular sites of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production. This interpretation is supported by ultrastructural observations of subcellular foci with enhanced L-citrulline and/or neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase staining that are located primarily at postsynaptic densities and portions of the endoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> is produced and released at focal sites within neurons that are identifiable using L-citrulline as a marker. Copyright 2002 IBRO...|$|R

40|$|<b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO) a {{free radical}} having both cytoprotective {{as well as}} tumor {{promoting}} agent is formed from l-arginine by converting it to l-citrulline via <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase enzymes. The reaction product of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> with superoxide generates potent oxidizing agent, peroxynitrite which is the main mediator of tissue and cellular injury. Peroxynitrite is reactive towards many biomolecules which includes amino acids, nucleic acid bases; metal containing compounds, etc. NO metabolites may {{play a key role}} in mediating many of the genotoxic/carcinogenic effects as DNA damage, protein or lipid modification, etc. The basic reactions of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> can be divided as direct effect of the radical where it alone plays a role in either damaging or protecting the cell milieu and an indirect effect in which the byproducts of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> formed by convergence of two independent radical generating pathways play the role in biological reactions which mainly involve oxidative and nitrosative stress. <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> is also capable of directly interacting with mitochondria through inhibition of respiration or by permeability transition.

40|$|Low nanomolar {{concentrations}} of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> activate guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, which has diverse physiological effects. Higher concentrations inhibit mitochondrial respiration at cytochrome c oxidase {{and this has}} been proposed to be important physiologically, increasing oxygen permeation into tissue (by reducing the oxygen use of cells near blood vessels), activating AMP kinase, and regulating the relationship between cerebral blood flow and oxygen use. It is unclear, however, whether <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> can accumulate physiologically to concentrations at which inhibition of respiration occurs. In rat cerebellar slices, we activated <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production from each isoform of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase. Only activation of inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase, which is expressed pathologically, caused any significant inhibition of respiration. Modelling oxygen and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> concentrations predicted that, in vivo, physiological <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> levels are too low to affect respiration. Even pathologically, the <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> concentration may only rise to 2. 5 nm, producing a 1. 5 % inhibition of respiration.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> {{can be an important}} intracellular messenger in the regulation of neurosecretion in chromaffin cells. Since standard chromaffin cell cultures are mixed populations of noradrenaline and adrenaline producing cells, it would seem important to understand the functional differences between these individual components. The use of fluorescence imaging techniques for the recording of cytosolic calcium from single chromaffn cells together with the immunoidentification of individual cells with specific antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase, N-phenyl ethanolamine methyl transferase and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase, has allowed us to measure single-cell calcium responses in identified adrenergic, noradrenergic and nitrergic chromaffin cells, thus helping us to clarify the differential role of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> in the function of these chromaffin cell types. 53 ± 2 % of chromaffin cells were able to synthesize <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (<b>nitric</b> oxidesynthase-positive cells), these cells being mainly noradrenergic (82 ± 2 %). Results indicate that <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> donors such as sodium nitroprusside, molsidomine and isosorbide dinitrate evoke [Ca 2 +]i increases in a 62 ± 4 % of chromaffin cells, the response to <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> donors being between 30 and 50 % of that of 20 [mu]M nicotine. Cells responding to <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> donors were mainly adrenergic (68 ± 5 %) although 45 ± 9 % of noradrenergic cells also gave [Ca 2 +]i increasing responses.
