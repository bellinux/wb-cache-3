50|$|John Boyd Dunlop (5 February 1840 - 23 October 1921) was a Scottish-born {{and educated}} {{inventor}} and veterinary surgeon who {{spent most of}} his career in Ireland. Familiar with making rubber devices, he re-invented <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> for his child's tricycle and developed them for use in cycle racing. He sold his rights to the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> to a company he formed {{with the president of the}} Irish Cyclists' Association, Harvey Du Cros, for a small cash sum and a small shareholding in their <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> business. Dunlop withdrew in 1896. The company that bore his name, Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company, was not incorporated until later using the name well known to the public, but it was Du Cros's creation.|$|R

50|$|Pacific Dunlop has {{its roots}} in the Irish Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company, which {{established}} the Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company of Australasia in 1893, which included a local finishing factory and office in Melbourne to supply the market with bicycle tyres. In 1899 downturn in cycling's popularity and speculation from the parent company led to the sell-off of Dunlop's Australasian and North American operations, and the Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company of Australasia was floated with 80,000 shares, costing £1 per share. The company was listed on Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide stock exchanges.|$|R

50|$|Dunlop {{developed}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> for his son's tricycle {{and soon}} had them made commercially in Scotland. A cyclist using his tyres began to win all races {{and drew the}} attention of Harvey Du Cros. Dunlop sold his rights into a new business with Du Cros for some cash and a small shareholding. With Du Cros he overcame many difficulties experienced by their business, including {{the loss of his}} patent rights. In 1892 he retired from his veterinary practice and moved to Dublin soon after Harvey Du Cros with his assistance successfully refloated Booth Bros of Dublin as the <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> and Booth's Cycle Agency. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> revolutionised the bicycle industry, which had boomed after the 1885 introduction of J K Starley's safety bicycle.|$|R
50|$|In 1888, John Boyd Dunlop, a Scottish {{veterinary}} surgeon living in Ireland discovered the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> principle. Willie Hume created publicity for J B Dunlop's discovery by winning {{seven out of}} eight races with his <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres.</b> To own the rights and exploit the discovery, the <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> and Booth's Cycle Agency Co. Ltd was incorporated in 1889 and floated by Harvey du Cros who was, amongst other things, president of the Irish Cyclists' Association. The invitation to du Cros to participate was made by William Bowden, a Dublin cycle agent. J B Dunlop who could see no prosperous future in his discovery, had informally made over his rights to Bowden. Initially J B Dunlop held a 20 {{percent stake in the}} venture.|$|R
