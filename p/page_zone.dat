30|$|Regarding the Web DUE’s {{verification}} items, Inspectors 1, 3 and 4 {{agreed that}} they were helpful when combined with the Web page zones (See quote from Inspector 4). However, Inspector 2 pointed out that some verification items {{could be used to}} evaluate the same Web <b>page</b> <b>zone</b> (See quote from Inspector 2). This could mean that some Web pages can be used to evaluate the same components, which confuses the inspectors; or that some verification items are too broad to allow the identification of specific features of the evaluated Web <b>page</b> <b>zone.</b> Furthermore, Inspector 3 stated that some items did not help him decide whether there was a usability problem or not (See quote from Inspector 3). This means that some verification items could not provide a clear description of which nonconformities must be found, or that the verification items are too subjective for the inspector to decide.|$|E
30|$|Inspectors must {{point out}} in the mockups which {{components}} within each Web <b>page</b> <b>zone</b> {{did not meet the}} usability verification items.

30|$|The main {{advantage}} {{of the use of}} Web <b>page</b> <b>zones</b> is that they can aid inspectors in evaluating only the elements that are present in the evaluated mockup.

30|$|Regarding the {{evolution}} of the Web DUE technique future work involves: (a) verifying which usability verification items can be combined within the Web <b>page</b> <b>zones</b> to reduce effort during the inspection; (b) analyzing and suggesting an alternative inspection process in order to reduce repetitive instructions; and (c) analyzing which usability verification items or examples/explanations are not clear or ambiguous {{in order to reduce the}} inspector’s effort and confusion.|$|R
40|$|The maximum {{bandwidth}} capacity of radio frequency channels {{such as the}} forward control channel (FOCC) used in the mobile switching systems is fixed.

30|$|During the {{detection}} phase, inspectors use the previously mapped mockups and perform an inspection using the Web DUE technique. In this stage, the inspector mentally divides the mockups into Web <b>page</b> <b>zones</b> (see Figure  1 stage 2). For {{each of the}} identified zones, the inspector checks the usability verification items which are grouped and shown by the Mockup DUE tool (see Figure  1 stage 3). Moreover, the inspector can also interact with the mockups to verify the interaction. If he/she identifies a usability problem, he/she can add that problem and point {{it out in the}} mockup.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a dynamic paging {{scheme based on}} the semi-realtime movement information of an individual user, which allows a more accurate predication of the user location {{at the time of}} paging. In general, a realtime location tracking scheme may require complex control schemes and incur unacceptably high computation and messaging cost. Our proposed approach, namely velocity paging scheme, relaxes the realtime constraints to semirealtime to provide a good combination of cost reduction and ease of implementation. The proposed velocity paging scheme utilizes semi-realtime velocity information, namely velocity classes, of individual mobile terminal and dynamically generates a <b>paging</b> <b>zone</b> (a list of cells to be paged) for it. Therefore, the total paging cost can be reduced due to the paging area reduction. Much consideration also has been given to reduce the complexity for the proposed scheme.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. June 2013. Major: Water Resources Science. Advisor: Bruce Vondracek. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 39 <b>pages.</b> The littoral <b>zone</b> contains {{all of the}} vegetation within a lake and {{is critical to the}} physical and biological integrity of lentic water bodies. Aquatic macrophytes stabilize the shoreline and support macroinvertebrate and fish communities by providing spawning substrate, feeding area, and refuge from predators. Riparian alterations associated with shoreline residential development have been shown to decrease aquatic vegetation and coarse woody structure (CWS). As the extent of lakeshore development increases, understanding the consequences of site- and lake-level shoreline alterations is necessary to better guide management decisions. The intensity and type of alterations may be an important factor regarding the extent of effects on littoral habitat. We investigated site-scale effects of lakeshore development on near-shore habitat across 10 northern Minnesota lakes using the Minnesota Department of Natural Resource's Score Your Shore (SYS) survey, to assess development intensity. We also examined lake-wide effects of development density. Study lakes were of similar size, class, and geology and represented a range of shoreline development. Developed sites had significantly lower macrophyte species richness than undeveloped sites. Emergent and floating-leaf macrophyte biovolume was also lower at developed sites. Coarse woody structure (CWS) density was lower at developed sites than undeveloped sites. SYS score was a significant factor in models of most macrophyte community variables, supporting the hypothesis that site-scale development intensity is related to littoral vegetation. Negative effects of lake-wide development were not detected in whole lake macrophyte and fish community metrics...|$|R
40|$|Single <b>page</b> posterMany {{subduction}} <b>zones</b> worldwide {{are known}} to host devastating large earthquakes, such as the 2011 M 9 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. In addition to fast, seismic slip many subduction zones also host slow, largely aseismic slip. These “slow earthquakes” occur on timescales of weeks to months and are often accompanied by a weak seismic signal known as “tectonic tremor,” or simply “tremor. ” Tremor behaves differently than regular earthquakes {{in that it is}} comprised of many small earthquakes that radiate low-frequency seismic energy and originate at the plate interface downdip of where large earthquakes typically occur. This behavior is thought to reflect variation in frictional properties, effective stress, or both in between the aseismic and seismic sections of the plate interface. Seismic-wave attenuation is a parameter that quantifies the decrease in amplitude of seismic waves as a function of distance from the earthquake source. Estimates of attenuation are commonly used in ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) that quantify ground motion during an earthquake. Because tremor occurs frequently when compared to regular earthquakes in Cascadia, it presents an opportunity to better define attenuation parameters used for GMPEs in earthquake engineering. Our goal is to quantify seismic wave attenuation in Cascadia and determine its spatial variations using tectonic tremor. By inverting tremor ground motion data for the attenuation parameter, we can analyze if and how the results vary spatially in Cascadia and attempt to relate these variations to lithology and/or other physical properties. Changes in seismic-wave attenuation along the Cascadia Subduction Zone could result in significantly different ground motions {{in the event of a}} very large earthquake, hence quantifying attenuation may help to better estimate the severity of shaking in densely populated metropolitan areas such as Vancouver, Seattle and Portland...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the body}} three subtypes of {{cartilage}} can be distinguished: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage and fibrocartilage. Hyaline cartilage is the predominant subtype and is mainly located in articular joints and in less extent in the nasal septum and cricoid. Elastic cartilage {{can be found}} in the outer ear and in parts of the respiratory tract. The menisci and intervertebral discs are made from the third subtype: fibrocartilage. Hyaline cartilage in joints, further refered to as articular cartilage, is a highly specialized tissue that ensures low-friction movement of articulating bones, whilst transmitting load. The only cell-type present in articular cartilage is the chondrocyte, which only composes less than 5 % of the total tissue volume. Water (up to 80 % wet weight) is the predominant molecule in cartilage, followed by different collagens (10 - 20 % wet weight) and the group of GAG (GlycosAminoGlycan, 4 - 7 % wet weight) 181. From the latter two groups, collagen type II and aggrecan are the most prominent respectively. A simplified reflection of the cartilage structure and function would be as follows. The collagen molecules form a tightly woven network in which the GAG are contained (Figure I- 1 next page). In solution, the GAG is negatively charged and creates an osmotic pressure via attraction of positive counter-ions. This osmotic pressure, together with repulsive forces of the negatively charged GAG, result in a swelling pressure within the matrix that accounts for the excellent capabilities of cartilage to absorb and transmit forces during joint movement and loading. Several smaller molecules also play a crucial role in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage: decorin, anchorin, collagen type VI, IX and XI. Articular cartilage lacks blood vessels; chondrocytes receive oxygen and nutrients through diffusion from the synovium and the underlying bone. Articular cartilage can be divided in four zones with respect to the architecture 68, 181, 213 (Figure I- 2, next <b>page).</b> The superficial <b>zone</b> comprises approximately 10 % of the cartilage and is characterized by a high cell density, flattened chondrocytes and thin collagen fibers that are oriented tangential to the articular surface. The middle zone or intermediate zone has randomly orientated collagen fibers and chondrocytes with a more spherical configuration...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of genetic polymorphism within milk protein genes, a considerable volume of research has been published relating milk protein genetic variants and milk production properties. Polymorphism of milk proteins can result in two effects: (a) changes in the biological and physico-chemical properties of systems containing the variant protein, (b) changes in the synthesis level of variant proteins. As a result several studies of milk protein variants have identified phenotypes which may be commercially advantageous for specific products. Currently employed methods to determine milk protein phenotypes are generally limited to electrophoretic techniques. The gel electrophoretic techniques commonly used are able to detect most milk protein variants that differ by their net electrical charge. However single amino acid substitutions that result in a change in net charge account for only 25 % of the possible substitutions that could occur. The remaining 75 % of potential variants {{are the result of}} a neutral residue substituted by another neutral residue - a 'silent' variant. Thus it is likely that some substitutions, and hence genetic variants have gone undetected in the past. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop new methods for determining the phenotype of milk proteins, and to determine the frequency of occurrence of silent or other novel variants in a New Zealand dairy cattle study population. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (<b>PAGE),</b> free <b>zone</b> capillary electrophoresis (CE), peptide mapping by reverse-phase HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) were used in the characterisation of milk proteins purified from 109 individual dairy cows. Three different PAGE systems were used. Alkaline-urea PAGE enabled the detection of α si-casin variants B and C, β-casein variants group A (variants A 1, A 2 and A 3) and B, and K-casein variants A and B in the study population. Beta-casein variants A 1, A 2 and A 3 were subsequently resolved in an acid-urea PAGE system. The whey proteins were very poorly resolved in PAGE systems containing urea. Alpha-lactalbumin A, and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) variants A and B were resolved in a non-denaturing 'native' PAGE system. The frequencies of the various milk protein variants corresponded closely to figures previously published. A free zone CE method that is able to resolve β-LG variants A, B and C was used to check the phenotype of purified β-LG samples. Three samples previously typed as β-LG BB were subsequently determined to be β-LG CC; one sample typed as β-LG BB was re-assigned as β-LG BC. This highlighted the limitations of PAGE systems for the detection of known variants. Tryptic hydrolysis of purified casein proteins and β-LG, followed by reverse-phase HPLC separation of the resultant peptides was used to create peptide 'maps' of the hydrolysis products. Differences in peptide maps were noted between protein variants. The differences corresponded to peptides containing a substitution site. All samples analysed in this way contained more peptide peaks than expected. Analysis revealed that some were the result of incomplete digestion; others the result of chymotryptic-like cleavages. No aberrant peptide maps, indicative of a silent mutation, were detected. Purified casein proteins and β-LG were subjected to ESI-MS for mass analysis. The mass of each protein species was determined as follows: Protein Average mass Std. dev. as 1 -CN B- 8 P 23614. 9 Da 1. 2 Da as 2 -CN A- 11 P 25228. 9 Da 1. 5 Da β-CN A 1 - 5 P 24023. 9 Da 3. 1 Da β-CN A 2 - 5 P 23983. 5 Da 1. 8 Da β-CN B- 5 P 24092. 6 Da n. d. k-CN A- 1 P 19038. 8 Da 1. 5 Da k-CN B- 1 P 19003. 8 Da n. d. β-LG A 18362. 6 Da 1. 0 Da β-LG B 18277. 0 Da 0. 9 Da β-LG C 18287. 2 Da 0. 6 Da In all cases the experimentally determined mass corresponded to the mass calculated from published primary sequences of milk protein variants. In addition to the expected β-LG variant in each mass spectrum, additional species were detected differing from the mass of the β-LG species by increments of approximately 324 Da. Although less pronounced, the + 324 Da molecular weight species were also detected in a sample of β-LG purchased from the Sigma Chemical Company. The additional species were also detected in whey prepared by ultra-centrifugation, although at a much lower level. The 324 Da molecular weight adducts observed in ESI-MS spectra of purified β-LG are consistent with an addition of a lactosyl residue to the protein. The observation that these species remain after heat denaturation, reduction and RP-HPLC treatment suggest that the linkage is covalent. Lactulosyl-lysine is known to form in milk products during some processing conditions, particularly during heating. The observation of these glycated species in gently treated, unheated milk suggests that glycation may occur to some extent in the udder of the cow. The association of the 324 Da molecule with β-LG does not alter the charge, molecular weight or hydrophobicity sufficiently to be detected by PAGE. CE or RP-HPLC...|$|R
