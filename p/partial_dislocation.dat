5|$|Hitting a {{consistent}} goalscoring form during mid-season, Villa scored against Deportivo La Coruña, {{although he was}} sent off during the match after his second yellow card, received due to a foul on Daniel Aranzubia; as a result, he missed Valencia's next match against Real Valladolid, a game Valencia lost 2–1 at home. Ready to return from suspension, Villa suffered from an inflammation in the joint in his left knee due to a <b>partial</b> <b>dislocation</b> and would be ruled out for the next 15 days, missing games against Numancia, Recreativo de Huelva and Racing de Santander. When he finally returned from injury on 5 April 2009, he had no trouble recovering form, netting a brace in a match against Getafe which Valencia won 4–1. On 12 April, Villa was set to return to El Molinón, the home ground of Sporting de Gijón where he started his career. He admitted that the encounter would be very emotional for him but went on to score the second Valencia goal in a 3–2 win and kept a pre-match promise by not celebrating the goal. His goal against Villarreal brought his tally to 26, and he then scored another two against Athletic Bilbao, finishing with 28 goals after the last game of the season, thus equalling records set by the Argentinian Mario Kempes and the Montenegrin Predrag Mijatović, who also scored 28 goals in a Valencia shirt in 1978 and 1996, respectively. Kempes reached his tally of 28 goals in 34 games while Mijatović achieved it in 40, ultimately seeing Villa beat their percentages, as he achieved the 28 goals in 33 games, recording a goal ratio of 0.84 goals per game. That season saw Villa's best goal-scoring season at Valencia.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is the most}} frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force that pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket.

40|$|Large-scale {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{are used to}} investigate the dislocation structure behind a shock front in perfect fcc crystals. Shock compression in both the (100) and (111) directions induces dislocation loop formation via a sequential emission of <b>partial</b> <b>dislocations,</b> but in the (100) case, this process is arrested after the first partial, resulting in stacking-fault loops. The large mobility of the bounding <b>partial</b> <b>dislocations</b> results in a plastic wave that is always overdriven in the (100) direction; the leading edges of the partials are traveling with the plastic front, as in the models of Smith and Hornbogen. In contrast, both partials are emitted in (111) shock compression, resulting in perfect dislocation loops bounded only by thin stacking fault ribbons due to the split <b>partial</b> <b>dislocations.</b> These loops grow more slowly than the plastic shock velocity, so new loops are periodically nucleated at the plastic front, as suggested by Meyers.

50|$|In Marfan syndrome, {{the health}} of the eye can be {{affected}} in many ways but the principal change is partial lens dislocation, where the lens is shifted out of its normal position. This occurs because of weakness in the ciliary zonules, the connective tissue strands which suspend the lens within the eye. The mutations responsible for Marfan syndrome weaken the zonules and cause them to stretch. The inferior zonules are most frequently stretched resulting in the lens shifting upwards and outwards but it can shift in other directions as well. Nearsightedness and blurred vision are common, but farsightedness can also result particularly if the lens is highly subluxated. Subluxation (<b>partial</b> <b>dislocation)</b> of the lens can be detected clinically in 80% of patients by the use of a slit-lamp biomicroscope. If the lens subluxation is subtle then imaging with high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy might be used.|$|E
