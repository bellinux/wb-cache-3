5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the <b>peppered</b> maskray is a bottom-dwelling {{predator}} consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter {{sizes of}} one to three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the <b>peppered</b> maskray is a frequent bycatch of bottom trawl fisheries, it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The <b>peppered</b> moth {{exists in}} both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the {{industrial}} revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths {{a better chance of}} surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on <b>peppered</b> moth evolution.|$|E
5|$|The <b>peppered</b> maskray lacks {{economic}} value and is discarded by fisheries. It is often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, {{and due to}} its small size does not benefit from Turtle Exclusion Devices. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total catch of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the trawl. Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negatively affected the local population because its operational area {{does not include the}} waters where this species is most abundant. The <b>peppered</b> maskray is also caught frequently in scallop trawls operated by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, because it remains common and its range includes several Marine Protected Areas.|$|E

40|$|Rentability of bushy black <b>pepper</b> and dead-pole pepperBushy black <b>pepper</b> (Piper nigrum L) is a {{cultivation}} of <b>pepper</b> without using pole. The {{objective of the}} research was to obtain the entability of bushy black <b>pepper</b> and dead-pole <b>pepper.</b> The research was conducted in Bangka distict in November 1996. The study of bushy black <b>pepper</b> was a case study, because {{there was only one}} farmer that carried out bushy black <b>pepper</b> farming. The study of dead-pole <b>pepper</b> used 25 farmers. The methods used to analyze additional value were financial analysis, sensitivity analysis, and qualitative-desciptive analysis. The result showed that the cost of bushy black <b>pepper</b> farming system (Rp 5 043 974 /ha) was lower than that of dead-pole <b>pepper</b> (Rp 9 609 71 l/ha). Net Present Value (NPV).

5|$|The <b>peppered</b> maskray {{prefers to}} pick prey {{from the surface}} of the substrate, as opposed to digging for them. Caridean shrimp are by far the most {{important}} food source. It also consumes polychaete worms and amphipods, and rarely penaeid prawns, molluscs, and small bony fishes. Compared to smaller rays, larger rays have a more varied diet that incorporates a greater proportion of polychaete worms.|$|E

Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, <b>peppered</b> moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E

5|$|The Mendelian and biometrician {{models were}} {{eventually}} reconciled {{with the development}} of population genetics. A key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change gene frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J. B. S. Haldane, applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in <b>peppered</b> moths, and showed that natural selection worked at an even faster rate than Fisher assumed.|$|E

It narrowly escaped destruction during the Second World War when a German bomb dropped during the Blitz landed a few metres away and <b>peppered</b> it with shrapnel. The pedestal and the horse's tail were damaged and Richard's sword was bent by the blast. In 2009, the Parliamentary authorities undertook a project to conserve and restore the statue.|$|E

5|$|On Sword, 21 of 25 DD {{tanks of}} the first wave were {{successful}} in getting safely ashore to provide cover for the infantry, who began disembarking at 07:30. The beach was heavily mined and <b>peppered</b> with obstacles, making {{the work of the}} beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous. In the windy conditions, the tide came in more quickly than expected, so manoeuvring the armour was difficult. The beach quickly became congested. Brigadier Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat and his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived in the second wave, piped ashore by Private Bill Millin, Lovat's personal piper. Members of No. 4 Commando moved through Ouistreham to attack from the rear a German gun battery on the shore. A concrete observation and control tower at this emplacement had to be bypassed and was not captured until several days later. French forces under Commander Philippe Kieffer (the first French soldiers to arrive in Normandy) attacked and cleared the heavily fortified strongpoint at the casino at Riva Bella, with the aid of one of the DD tanks.|$|E
