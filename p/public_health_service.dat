5|$|A {{hospital}} {{had originally been}} installed at Alcatraz during its time as a military prison in the late 19th century. During its time as a federal penitentiary, it was located above the dining hall on the second floor. Hospital staff were U.S. <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Service</b> employees assigned to the Federal Prison Service at Alcatraz. Doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at Alcatraz, because few of them could tolerate the violent inmates who would often terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs. Prisoners in ill health were often kept in the hospital, most famously, Stroud and Al Capone, who spent years in it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Only a few studies, {{mostly in}} the case of school districts, have empirically {{examined}} the factors affecting municipal consolidations. This study contributes to the literature by empirically examining the decision of Connecticut communities to consolidate the delivery of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services.</b> As theory suggests, the prospect of scale economies is found empirically to increase the likelihood that a community consolidates <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services.</b> In addition, differences across communities are found to inhibit the consolidation of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services.</b> Overall, the results imply that financial incentives may be necessary to encourage more regional districts because localities may underestimate the true minimum efficient scale for <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> and because heterogeneity among jurisdictions impedes regional cooperation...|$|R

Response rate was 26. 5 % (206). Funded <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> provided most frequently were: emergency contraception (71 %), smoking cessation (62 %), and supervised drug consumption (58 %).

Only 35 % were personally involved in deciding which services to deliver, and fewer than 20 % based decisions on local <b>public</b> <b>health</b> reports. Pharmacists had positive attitudes towards providing <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services,</b> but mixed views on support for services and their promotion.

40|$|Problem The Chinese central {{government}} launched the Health System Reform Plan in 2009 to strengthen {{disease control and}} health promotion and provide a package of basic <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services.</b> Village doctors receive a modest subsidy for providing <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> associated with the package. Their beliefs about this subsidy and providing <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> could influence the quality and effectiveness of preventive <b>health</b> <b>services</b> and disease surveillance. Approach To understand village doctors’ perspectives on the subsidy and their experiences of delivering <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services,</b> we performed 10 focus group discussions with village doctors, 12 in-depth interviews with directors of township health centres and 4 in-depth interviews with directors of county-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Local setting The {{study was conducted in}} four counties in central China, two in Hubei province and two in Jiangxi province. Relevant changes Village doctors prioritize medical services but they do their best to manage their time to include <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services.</b> The willingness of township health centre directors and village doctors to provide <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> has improved since the introduction of the package and a minimum subsidy, but village doctors do not find the subsidy to be sufficient remuneration for their efforts. Lessons learnt Improving the delivery of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> by village doctors is likely to require an increase in the subsidy, improvement in the supervisory relationship between village clinics and township health centres {{and the creation of a}} government pension for village doctors...|$|R

Concord cruised on the Asiatic Station—interrupted only by a short stint on the Alaskan sealing patrol—from 1893 until May 1896, when she began a year out of commission at San Francisco. In January 1898, Concord returned to the Asiatic Station, and joined Admiral George Dewey's fleet for 1 May 1898 Battle of Manila Bay, a decisive American victory over the Spanish Fleet in the Spanish–American War. After the battle, Concord supported United States Army operations in the Philippines in the Philippine–American War. For the rest of her active career, Concord patrolled off the Mexican and Alaskan coasts and served on the Yangtze Patrol.

40|$|Background: The <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> {{project of}} the South-eastern Europe health network has {{undertaken}} an evaluation of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> in its nine member countries. The purpose of the evaluation of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> provision in the South-eastern European (SEE) countries is to understand where these countries now stand in <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> the institutional, organisational, legislative and service delivery developments {{that are taking place}} and to identify strengths and weaknesses in their <b>public</b> <b>health</b> systems and <b>services</b> in order to inform decision making about investment and future reform. Methods: The evaluation was orientated around “essential <b>public</b> <b>health</b> operations” that are deemed to form the core of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> activities and <b>services</b> and to be indispensable to the delivery of modern <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> in any country. The evaluation analysed these activities and services within the structure of the health system functions of stewardship, resource generation, financing and service delivery, as developed by WHO. Results: The results demonstrate a mixed picture of strengths and weaknesses within the context of significant social, economic and political challenges in the region. Among the many visible and significant strengths in <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> in the region are well developed networks of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> institutes with well defined surveillance systems, highly experienced and well educated <b>public</b> <b>health</b> professionals as well as many positive examples of service delivery. But there are also many concerns and challenges, {{not the least of which}} is political focus, direction and support for modern <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services,</b> as well as funding. Collaboration and partnership among sectors is weak and information and communication systems are inadequate and not sufficiently integrated. Conclusions: Having emphasized the main weak and challengeable points in the <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> systems and <b>services</b> in the SEE countries, the evaluation is also a first step to defining a way forward in the SEE countries to ensure that the turmoil of ‘transition’ is only a prelude to the comprehensive modernisation of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Service</b> published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was opened in 1933 by the U.S. {{government as a}} United States Marine Hospital Service hospital. Replacing a facility in Port Townsend, it opened with 312 beds in 1933. The hospital originally served veterans, merchant seamen, the US Coast Guard, the US Lighthouse Service, and poor and indigent people defined as “federal compensation cases”. In 1951, it was re-designated as a US <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Service</b> facility along with all other Marine hospitals. In 1953, a three-story annex was constructed on {{the east end of}} the building to serve outpatient clinics. Two stair towers were added to the south face in 1975. The building continued to grow in 1980 as a laboratory and primary care addition were built. The federal government ceased operation of the facility and other similar hospitals in 1981. Control was shifted to Seattle, and the city chartered the Pacific Hospital Preservation and Development Authority(PHPDA). The PHPDA owns the property and uses long-term tenants with leases. Lease revenues are advance the PHPDA’s mission of providing health care services to low-income uninsured and under-insured persons in King County. The lease agreement with WRC.Com Tower LLC was signed in 1998 and was terminated in 2012.|$|E
