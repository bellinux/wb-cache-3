During {{the process}} of rapid {{prototyping}} based on robotic pulse MAG forming, the coefficient of weld reinforcement {{is crucial to the}} geometric accuracy and mechanical property of metallic parts. The orthogonal design method, as well as the range analysis and variance analysis, were applied in this article to study the effects of wire feed rate, welding speed, <b>pulse</b> <b>correction</b> and arc length correction on coefficient of weld reinforcement, finding out the factors which were significant to the coefficient of weld reinforcement and optimizing the process parameters. The experimental results show that the order of the significance of parameters is as following: the welding speed, the arc length correction, the wire feed rate, and the <b>pulse</b> <b>correction.</b> Among them, the welding speed and arc length correction have the greatest influence on the coefficient of weld reinforcement, as a is 0. 025. The optimal process parameters are: arc length correction 8 %, welding speed 14 mm/s, wire feed rate 7. 2 m/min and <b>pulse</b> <b>correction</b> 0.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{evaluation}} of homogeneous samples using the laser flash technique is presented in this work. The analytical solution integrates the finite <b>pulse</b> <b>correction</b> and the heat loss effect as a convolution of the pulse intensity function with the temperature rise under heat losses. Mathematically seen, the triangular, exponential, linear-exponential and trapeziodal pulse shapes are formulated as pulse coefficients that can be adapted to any model solution of Dirac-source type. The unknown thermal diffusivity and the Biot numbers as best fit parameters to the measurement are determined through simultaneous nonlinear parameter estimation. The fit can be checked by plotting the theoretical temperature rise. Thus, laser flash evaluation can be carried out using this generally valid function even at very short rise times or at high heat losses - without necessity of selecting the correction type. For determining the thermal contact resistance between two layers a new heat transfer model has been developed by means of the Green function. The new temperature rise function includes the heat loss and finite pulse corrections can be adapted to a laser flash measurement by nonlinear parameter estimation. (orig.) 30 refs.

30|$|The gate {{duration}} for {{the geometric}} phase gate mechanism {{is limited by}} the requirement of adiabaticity. We have also performed the hybrid optimization scheme for a gate duration of ≈ 100  ns. In this case, the simplex search yields significant non-adiabatic defects, with a loss of population of 1.2 × 10 ^- 1. The concurrence error is 2.3 × 10 ^- 3 and the total gate error, ε _avg= 1.2 × 10 ^- 1, is dominated by the population loss. Post-optimization using Krotov’s method significantly reduces the total gate error to ε _avg= 1.4 × 10 ^- 2. The post-optimization result is obtained at a numerical cost very close to that for the T= 200 ns gate, and yields <b>pulse</b> <b>corrections</b> very similar to those shown in Figure  4. This results in a correction of the non-adiabatic defects and thereby lowers the population loss to only 6.5 × 10 ^- 3. The total gate error is now dominated instead by the increased concurrence error of 1.7 × 10 ^- 2, which is insufficient for a high quality phase gate. The observation that an overall improvement in gate performance at T = 100 ns from hybrid optimization is only possible by increasing adiabaticity at the cost of reduced entanglement, indicates that a quantum speed limit has been reached for the specific gate mechanism. These results show that a hybrid optimization scheme may be used successfully even when operating close to the quantum speed limit.|$|R

However, off-beat tapping is less well investigated than on-beat tapping. The current study involves coordinating with a stimulus sequence with underlying isochrony and systematic deviations from this isochrony that increase or decrease in magnitude to look at people's capacity to error-correct when performing off-beat synchronisation with a set of sounds. Participants were instructed to 'tap between the tones' but 'try to maintain regularity'. While analysis using typical methods suggested a form of error correction was occurring, a series of more complex analyses demonstrated that participants' performance during each trial can be classified according to one of four different strategies: maintaining a regular <b>pulse,</b> error <b>correction,</b> phase resetting, and negative error correction. While maintaining a regular pulse was the preferred strategy in conditions with increasingly isochronous stimuli, the majority of trials are best explained by other strategies, suggesting that participants were generally influenced by variability in the stimuli. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|The {{enhanced}} functional sensitivity {{offered by}} ultra-high field imaging may significantly benefit simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies, but the concurrent increases in artifact contamination can strongly compromise EEG data quality. In the present study, {{we focus on}} EEG artifacts created by head motion in the static B 0 field. A novel approach for motion artifact detection is proposed, based on a simple modification of a commercial EEG cap, in which four electrodes are non-permanently adapted to record only magnetic induction effects. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI data were acquired with this setup, at 7 T, from healthy volunteers undergoing a reversing-checkerboard visual stimulation paradigm. Data analysis assisted by the motion sensors revealed that, after gradient artifact correction, EEG signal variance was largely dominated by pulse artifacts (81 - 93 %), but contributions from spontaneous motion (4 - 13 %) were still comparable to or even larger than those of actual neuronal activity (3 - 9 %). Multiple approaches were tested to determine the most effective procedure for denoising EEG data incorporating motion sensor information. Optimal results were obtained by applying an initial <b>pulse</b> artifact <b>correction</b> step (AAS-based), followed by motion artifact correction (based on the motion sensors) and ICA denoising. On average, motion artifact correction (after AAS) yielded a 61 % reduction in signal power and a 62 % increase in VEP trial-by-trial consistency.

40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of using compound semiconductors for X-ray and gamma ray spectroscopy are already well known. Radiation detectors based on high atomic number and wide band gap compound semiconductors show high detection efficiency and good spectroscopic performance even at room temperature. Despite these appealing properties, incomplete charge collection is a critical issue. Generally, incomplete charge collection, mainly due to the poor transport properties of the holes, produces energy resolution worsening and the well known hole tailing in the measured spectra. In this work, we present a digital pulse processing (DPP) system for high resolution spectroscopy with compound semiconductor radiation detectors. The DPP method, implemented on a PC platform, performs a height and shape analysis of the detector pulses (preamplifier output pulses), digitized by a 14 -bit, 100 MHz ADC. Fast and slow shaping, automatic pole-zero adjustment, baseline restoration and pile-up rejection allow precise pulse height measurements both at low and high counting rate environments. Pulse shape analysis techniques (pulse shape discrimination, linear and nonlinear <b>pulse</b> shape <b>corrections)</b> to compensate for incomplete charge collection were also implemented. The results of spectroscopic measurements on a planar CdTe detector show the high potentialities of the system, obtaining low tailing in the measured spectra and energy resolution quite close to the theoretical limit. High-rate measurements (up to 820 kcps) exhibit the excellent performance of the pulse height analysis {{and the benefits of}} pulse shape techniques for peak pile-up reduction in the measured spectra.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the vertical forest structure is highly relevant for ecological research and for better understanding forest ecosystems. Full-waveform airborne laser scanner systems providing a complete time-resolved digitization of every laser pulse echo may deliver very valuable information on the biophysical structure in forest stands. To exploit the great potential offered by full-waveform airborne laser scanning data, the development of suitable voxel based data analysis methods is straightforward. Beyond extracting additional 3 D points, it is very promising to derive voxel attributes from the digitized waveform directly. However, the ’history’ of each laser pulse echo is characterized by attenuation effects caused by reflections in higher regions of the crown. As a result, the received waveform signals within the canopy have a lower amplitude {{than it would be}} observed for an identical structure without the previous canopy structure interactions (Romanczyk et al., 2012). To achieve a radiometrically correct voxel space representation, the loss of signal strength caused by partial reflections on the path of a laser pulse through the canopy has to be compensated by applying suitable attenuation correction models. The basic idea of the correction procedure is to enhance the waveform intensity values in lower parts of the canopy for portions of the pulse intensity, which have been reflected in higher parts of the canopy. To estimate the enhancement factor an appropriate reference value has to be derived from the data itself. Based on <b>pulse</b> history <b>correction</b> schemes presented in previous publications, the paper will discuss several approaches for reference value estimation. Furthermore, the results of experiments with two different data sets (leaf-on/leaf-off) are presented...|$|R

With the use of high quality CdTe wafer, we formed a Schottky junction by evaporating indium on the Te-face and operated the detector as a diode. This allows us to apply much higher bias voltage than was possible with the previous CdTe detectors.

We found that, at a high-electric field of several kV cm- 1, the Schottky CdTe diode has very good energy resolution and stability, suitable for astronomical applications. The broad low-energy tail, often observed in CdTe detectors due to the low mobility and short lifetime of holes, was significantly reduced by the application of a higher bias voltage which improves the charge collection efficiency.

Numerical calculations are practicable for excitations to final states with the principal quantum number up to about 20 and for ionization by photons with energy up to about 2 MeV. The effect of the finite width of atomic energy levels is accounted for by convolving the calculated subshell cross section with a Lorentzian profile. The second part of this work reports unfolding strategies for correcting a radiation measurement from the effects of the detector-pulse handling circuitry system. These strategies comprise the correction from the effects of pulse pile-up (PPU) and the detector response function (DRF). A first principles balance equation for second order PPU is derived and solved for the particular case of rectangular pulse shape. A Monte Carlo (MC) strategy is then implemented in the code MCPPU (Multi-shape <b>pulse</b> pile-up <b>correction)</b> allowing handling more general cases. Regarding the DRF, computed with deterministic or MC codes, it is presented the new tool RESOLUTION which introduces in the computed DRF the effects of energy resolution and incomplete charge collection. In the end the computer program UMESTRAT (Unfolding Maximum Entropy STRATegy) is presented in an updated version which include a new constrain to the total number of photons of the spectrum, which can be easily determined by inverting the diagonal efficiency matrix...|$|R
40|$|Recently, Al/CdTe/Pt {{detectors}} {{have been}} proposed {{for the development of}} high resolution X-ray spectrometers. Due to the low leakage currents, these detectors allow high electric fields and the pixellization of anodes with the possibility to realize single charge carrier sensing detectors. In this work, we report on the results of electrical and spectroscopic investigations on CdTe diode detectors with Al/CdTe/Pt electrode configuration (4. 1 × 4. 1 × 0. 75 and 4. 1 × 4. 1 × 2 mm 3). The detectors are characterized by very low leakage currents in the reverse bias operation: 0. 3 nA at 25 °C and 2. 4 pA at - 25 °C under a bias voltage of - 1000 V. The spectroscopic performance of the detectors at both low and high photon counting rates were also investigated with a focus on the minimization of time instability, generally termed as polarization, looking for the optimum bias voltage and temperature. Good time stability, during a long-term operation of 10 h, was observed for both detectors at - 25 °C and by using an electric field of 5000 V/cm. The 2 mm thick detector exhibited good energy resolution of 6. 1 %, 2. 5 % and 2. 0 % (FWHM) at 22. 1 keV, 59. 5 and 122. 1 keV, respectively. Performance enhancements were obtained by using digital pulse processing techniques, especially at high photon counting rates (300 kcps). The 2 mm thick detector, after a digital <b>pulse</b> shape <b>correction</b> (PSC), is characterized by similar performance to the thin detector ones, opening up to the use of thick CdTe detectors without excessive performance degradations. This work was carried out in the framework of the development of portable X-ray spectrometers for both laboratory research and medical applications...|$|R
