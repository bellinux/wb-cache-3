These are {{the data for}} two published articles, “Drug patenting in India: looking back and looking forward” (Nature Reviews Drug Discovery [NRDD], 2015) and "TRIPS implementation and secondary pharmaceutical patenting in Brazil and India" (Studies in Comparative International Development [SCID], 2015). The NRDD dataset includes the new drug application number, drug approval year, drug name (where available), and patent <b>priority</b> <b>year</b> (based on first patent) for new molecular entities approved by the U. S. FDA between 1995 and 2013. The SCID datasets include the patent application number, active ingredient, category (primary or secondary patent application), and the country specific outcome for each application. There are two files, one for Indian applications (scid_indianapplications. csv) {{and one for the}} Brazilian applications (scid_brazilianapplications. csv). Project description: This project analyses developing country strategies to limit the issuance of secondary patents in pharmaceuticals. Secondary patents can extend periods of exclusivity, delay generic entry, and contribute to high drug prices and reduced access to medicines. Accordingly, several developing countries have adopted policies to restrict the grants of such patents; such measures are widely promoted by analysts and international organisations alike. However, little is known about which countries are adopting what sorts of measures, and to what effect. The project develops a typology of approaches toward secondary patenting, and maps countries according to the typology. Empirical analyses focus on five countries with specific measures to limit secondary patenting and two without. The research involves assembling novel datasets of pharmaceutical patents filed in the seven countries, coding each application as primary or secondary, and examining outcomes for each application in each country. The analysis will not only generate cross-national data on grant rates for different types of drug applications, but also improve understanding of the effectiveness of different approaches to secondary patents. Quantitative analyses are complemented with case studies to reveal the social and political factors conditioning how patent policies work in practice...|$|E

We provide evidence regarding the reasons for patenting {{and the ways in}} which patents are being utilized. A substantial share of patents is neither used internally nor for market transactions, which confirms the importance of strategic patenting and inefficiency in the management of intellectual property. We investigate different types of unused patents—unused blocking patents and sleeping patents. We also examine the association between used and unused patents and their characteristics such as family size, scope, generality and overlapping claims, technology area, type of applicant, and the competitive environment from where these patents originate. We discuss our results and derive some implications for innovation and patent policy...|$|R

40|$|In 2001, a new ruling for the {{publication}} of patent applications at the United States Patent and Trademark Office came into effect. Since then, all applications which are also filed with foreign offices have to be published 18 months after the application date, in analogy to the ruling in Europe and Japan. This new regime replaces the former system where only granted patents were published. With about 70 % of all applications the share of pre-grant publications of applications of US origin is quite high, allowing new types of statistical analysis. In particular, the investigations of time series based on <b>priority</b> <b>years</b> instead of grant years can thus be performed much more topically. On the one hand, a larger dataset for applications of US origin is available; on the other hand, the sample of applications from Asian countries is generally much larger at the US Patent Office than at the European Patent Office. Despite these new opportunities, searches at low levels of agg regation by codes of the International Patent Classification {{still have to be}} handled with care...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} if structural variables, like the industrial structure of an economy, {{are related to the}} choice of a filing route to the European Patent Office (EPO) via Euro-PCT, EPO or national first filing. Second, and maybe even more importantly, we raise the question if the choice of a filing route is correlated with the probability of a patent filing being granted, withdrawn or refused in the examination process. To analyse those questions, we constructed a dataset consisting of nearly two million patent filings at the EPO between the <b>priority</b> <b>years</b> 1985 and 2008 based on the "EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database" (PATSTAT), differentiated by filing country, technological sector and the type of applicant. Our descriptive and multivariate results show that Euro-PCT and EPO first filings have gained increased importance since 1985 and are most often used by EPC member states. However, national offices remain important, especially for MNEs who mostly claim national priority first before filing at the EPO. Furthermore, we show that the choice of a filing route is associated with the outcome of the examination process. Euro-PCT filings, for example, have a higher probability to be granted than their directly filed counterparts...|$|R

40|$|The continuations {{procedure}} {{within the}} U. S. patent {{system has been}} criticized for enabling firms to manipulate the patent review process for strategic purposes. Changes during the 1990 s in patent procedures affected the incentives of applicants to exploit the continuations process, and additional reforms in continuations currently are being considered. Nonetheless, little is known about applicants' use of the three major types of continuations [...] the Continuation Application (CAP), the Continuations-In-Part (CIP), and Divisions [...] to alter the term and scope of patents. This paper analyzes patents issued from the three types of continuations to U. S. firms during 1981 - 2004 (with <b>priority</b> <b>years</b> 1981 - 2000), and links their frequency to the characteristics of patents, assignees and industries. We find that CIPs are disproportionately filed by R&D-intensive, small firms that patent heavily, and are more common in chemical and biological technologies. Patents resulting from CIP filings contain more claims and backward citations per patent on average, and cover relatively "valuable" inventions. In contrast, CAPs cover less valuable patents from large, capital-intensive firms that patent intensively, particularly in computer and semiconductor patents. We also analyze the effects of the 1995 change in patent term on continuation applications and find that the Act reduced the use of continuations overall, while shifting the output of CAPs toward "less important" patents. ...|$|R
