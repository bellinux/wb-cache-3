In fact, the Academy was in any case a net gainer, since Liszt donated it revenue from his charity concerts.|$|E

500|$|Coolidge {{adopted the}} {{taxation}} policies of his Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, {{the idea that}} [...] "scientific taxation", lower taxes, increase rather than decrease government receipts. Congress agreed, and tax rates were reduced in Coolidge's term. In addition to federal tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring of the federal debt. Coolidge's ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people. They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt. By 1927, only the wealthiest 2% of taxpayers <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> federal income tax. Federal spending remained flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt to be retired in total. State and local governments saw considerable growth, however, surpassing the federal budget in 1927.|$|E

500|$|Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, {{commonly}} referred to as simply the Master Chief, is the main protagonist and main playable character in the Halo trilogy. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey. One of the last SPARTAN-II supersoldiers still in active service (one of the few survivors of the Fall of Reach), the Master Chief inspires awe and fear in the alien Covenant, who refer to him as (a) [...] "Demon". Assisted by the artificial intelligence Cortana, he prevents the firing of Installation 04 in Halo: Combat Evolved, an event which the player is told would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy. Bungie staff member Joseph Staten noted that until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> attention to how to make people want to play in the world. [...] "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," [...] he said, [...] "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor." [...] The character has since become a gaming icon, the mascot of the Xbox, and was rated {{as one of the greatest}} videogame characters of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E

Even prior to the game's official release, VentureBeat noted, [...] "if you've <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> attention to the early fan culture for Overwatch, you've likely noticed that Tracer seems especially popular". Kotakus Nathan Grayson described her as [...] "peppy and fun, but also courageous and badass," [...] adding that: [...] "In creating their own works involving Tracer, fans have turned those characteristics up to 11. Some depict her as childlike, naive and carefree. She can even {{be kind of a}} doof, a punchline." [...] Kotakus Kirk Hamilton asserted that she is [...] "easily the most iconic Overwatch hero," [...] in addition to calling her his favorite character. Tracer's popularity compared to the other characters has had unintended effects for Blizzard; Overwatch-related searches boosted by 817% on Pornhub after the game's open beta went live, with [...] "Overwatch Tracer" [...] being the top search term related to the game. Discontent with this fan-generated porn, Blizzard made efforts to have it removed.

[...] "Lawyers do make mistakes," [...] Daley said. [...] "That's what it was. ... It's {{embarrassing}} to them. Yes it is - the corporation counsel and the Park District counsel." [...] Chicago Park District Superintendent Tim Mitchell said the Park District also wanted to renegotiate the contract. In a February 9, 2005 letter to O'Malley and Horan, Georges warned that the concession agreement [...] "does not authorize your occupation of the Park Grill facilities" [...] because the city owns the land, and City Hall should have been party to the original agreement when it was not. On February 11, 2005, Daley asked state lawmakers to impose tougher penalties for defrauding tax payers, and was questioned by reporters about why the Park Grill had not <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> property taxes and gets free gas, water and garbage pick-up. Erma Tranter, president of the Friends of the Parks watchdog group, speaking at a Park District Board of Commissioners meeting, questioned why the Park Grill contract had yet to be renegotiated 11 months after Mayor Daley vowed to do so. The Chicago Sun-Times dubbed the Park Grill the [...] "Clout Cafe" [...] and included the contract award process in a year-end review of 2005 Daley administration scandals.|$|E
500|$|Although ensconced with ChÃ¡vez and his entourage, Bartley and Ã“Briain felt a {{disconnect}} from {{the events of}} the outside world. During a [...] "chaotic" [...] road-trip with ChÃ¡vez, they [...] "knew something was coming", and divined that ChÃ¡vez's trip was intended to bolster his support and [...] "get people used to being on the streets". ChÃ¡vez had recently [...] "upped the ante" [...] with the introduction of the Land Law. Increasing tensions further, in February 2002, ChÃ¡vez took control of PDVSA; the private media stepped up its criticism of ChÃ¡vez, which for Bartley and Ã“Briain [...] "marked the beginning of an exciting phase". By April 2002, Bartley and Ã“Briain were in Caracas and spent much of their time filming at the presidential palace, following ChÃ¡vez and his staff. As the 11April crisis unfolded, Bartley and Ã“Briain filmed outside the palace, first capturing footage of the demonstrations and subsequent violence, then events inside the palace during the afternoon, evening and early hours of 12April. Through their previous contacts at the palace, Bartley and Ã“Briain were able to continue filming without interference: [...] "no one <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> attention to usâ€”we just blended in." [...] Later that day, Bartley and Ã“Briain stayed away from the palace through fears for their safety. Unable to leave the countryâ€”the international airport was closedâ€”the filmmakers instead took to the streets, [...] "to document the repression [...] were witnessing". At the same time, a press office cameraman was in the palace, [...] "reluctant to lose his job despite the change in government". He filmed the formation of the interim government. When Bartley and Ã“Briain returned to the palace on 13April, the cameraman let them have his footage.
