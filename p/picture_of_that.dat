25|$|The Army was reconstructed {{after the}} War, based among {{others on the}} forces {{established}} in exile in Sweden and Great Britain during the War, {{as well as on}} domestic forces. The participation in the allied occupation of Germany was a very demanding task for the Army in the period of 1946–52, {{but it was also a}} part of the reconstruction. The Army was established in all parts of the country, with a significant stronghold in Troms based on the threat <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time: the fear of an invasion from the East. This picture definitely changed with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent break-up of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
500|$|Driberg's {{campaign}} slogan was [...] "A Candid Friend For Churchill", personally supportive but {{critical of}} many of the prime minister's circle. The lacklustre campaign of his right-wing Conservative opponent helped to secure Driberg a wide range of support, from moderate Conservatives, Liberals and socialists. His fame as [...] "William Hickey", and his stance as the only candidate with a home in the constituency, gave him a strong local profile. His previous Communist Party associations were not revealed. At the poll, on 25 June, he overturned a previous Conservative majority of 8,000 to finish 6,000 votes ahead of his opponent. In his war memoirs, Churchill called the result [...] "one of the by-products of Tobruk"—which had fallen to Rommel on 21 June. Waugh, in his diary, remarked that the presentation of Driberg during the by-election merely as a journalist and churchwarden gave [...] "a very imperfect <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sinister character".|$|E

However, Petito's role as [...] "Il cavalier Pizzola-to" [...] went uncredited. The film {{was nominated for}} best film at the 10th Berlin International Film Festival. Then, in 1961, Petito appeared in Vittorio de Sica's comedy The Last Judgement, (Il giudizio universale). On set Petito was around prominent actors such as Alberto Sordi, Vittorio Gassman, Nino Manfredi, Paolo Stoppa and Jack Palance. Later in 1961, Petito starred alongside Gérard Blain, Paola Borboni, Miranda Campa and Anna Maria Ferrero in Carlo Lizzani's L'oro di Roma.|$|E
2500|$|Similarities between Spinoza's {{philosophy}} and Eastern philosophical traditions {{have been discussed}} by many authorities. The 19th-century German Sanskritist Theodore Goldstücker {{was one of the}} early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the Vedanta tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was [...] "... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 March 1981 Powell gave {{a speech}} to Ashton-under-Lyne Young Conservatives where he {{attacked}} the [...] "conspiracy of silence" [...] {{between the government and}} the opposition over the prospective growth through births of the immigration population and added, [...] "'We have seen nothing yet' is a phrase that we could with advantage repeat to ourselves whenever we try to form a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> future". He also criticised those who believed it was [...] "too late to do anything" [...] and that [...] "there lies the certainty of violence on a scale which can only adequately be described as civil war". He also said that the solution was [...] "a reduction in prospective numbers as would represent re-emigration hardly less massive than the immigration which occurred in the first place". The Shadow Home Secretary, Labour MP Roy Hattersley, criticised Powell for using [...] "Munich beer-hall language". On 11 April, there was a riot in Brixton and when on 13 April an interviewer quoted to Thatcher Powell's remark that [...] "We have seen nothing yet," [...] she replied: [...] "I heard him say that and I thought it was a very very alarming remark. And I hope with all my heart that it isn't true".|$|E

2500|$|The Kewpie doll {{has been}} the mascot of the school for the last 100 years. Hickman is the only known school {{in the world with}} a Kewpie as its mascot. The name dates back to the {{basketball}} season of 1913 -1914 at what was known then as Columbia High School. Apparently, the school secretary owned a Kewpie doll, as they were popular figurines then, and she kept it on her desk. [...] At one of the first basketball games in December 1913 she placed her Kewpie doll {{in the center of the}} court, and the entire game was played around it without it being broken. [...] This was somewhat remarkable since the dolls were very fragile. [...] Because it survived the game and brought a victory, it was thereafter considered the good luck mascot. [...] You can see a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> Kewpie doll beneath Sam Church in the team photograph in the 1914 school annual. That team had a straight claim to the state championship of Missouri for 1914 as they had an undefeated season. Coincidentally Sam Church was the Captain of the 1914 Kewpie basketball team and was the first Kewpie to letter in four sports. The school annual, the Cresset of 1914 was the first annual to display a Kewpie. In addition to the doll between Sam’s feet in the team picture a drawing of a Kewpie appeared as a dedication to the team. The dedication said, “To the Basket Ball Team of 1914, whose loyalty to the school and to the Kewpie motto, ‘Keep Smiling’, has won the State Championship, this volume of the Cresset is dedicated.” The only previous known mascot for Columbia High School, which became David Henry Hickman High School in 1927, was the Trojans. [...] It is referenced in the first school annual, the Cresset of 1912. Columbia/Hickman High School has graduated over 35,000 “Kewpies” in its history and they are still proud to be called “Kewpies!” ...|$|E
