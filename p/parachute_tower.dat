5000|$|Previously Fortune Festival, {{the boardwalk}} section of Great Adventure has games {{commonly}} found on boardwalks, boardwalk restaurants, {{and many of}} the park's larger flat rides. This area of the park was also previously themed as Edwards Air Force Base, {{and many of the}} theme elements from then still exist now, including [...] "latrines", and the <b>parachute</b> <b>tower's</b> name. The section also has a slight boardwalk-influence to its rides.|$|R
50|$|The League backed in all {{possible}} ways purchases of aviation equipment, development of aircraft {{as well as}} various airforce-oriented publications. Its members helped with construction of airfields, <b>parachute</b> <b>towers,</b> and League's activities, aimed at youth, helped the nation understand and support the aircraft. It had its logo, anthem, flag, pinups, seals and medals. Its honorary director was president Ignacy Mościcki. In the summer of 1939, L.O.P.P organized mass anti-German demonstrations in several Polish cities and towns.|$|R
5000|$|The goal of {{the society}} was {{preparation}} of reserves for armed forces. It soon became a powerful militarised organisation with its own airfields, radio clubs, <b>parachuting</b> <b>towers</b> and firing ranges. It became prestigious and romantic among the youth to earn badges such as [...] "Voroshilov sharpshooter" [...] (Ворошиловский стрелок), [...] "Voroshilov horse rider" [...] (Ворошиловский всадник) and [...] "Distinguished Parachute Jumper". Gradually, OSOAVIAKhIM developed into a back-up military training organization. Its courses included advanced disciplines like tactics, topography and armament. In contrast to the usual draft, a person could join OSOAVIAKhIM as early as 14. By 1941, its membership was estimated at 13 million.|$|R

50|$|In 1936, a <b>Parachute</b> <b>tower</b> {{was built}} {{and used for}} extreme activities. However, the tower stopped {{functioning}} after a fatal accident in the 1960s, {{which led to the}} ultimate ban of parachuting from the tower. To this day, the tower {{is considered one of the}} landmarks of the boulevard.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} used for a {{parachuting}} until one jumper was tragically killed in the 1960s. After this, the <b>parachute</b> <b>tower</b> was forced to change its profile; it is now an electronic board flaring with neon lamps, which shows the time, date, temperature and strength of the wind.|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{parachute}}</b> <b>tower</b> {{was open}} for use from anyone. Jumps from parachute for military preparation of youth were also held there. There were four {{marks on the}} tower, indicating the ten, twenty, twenty-five and sixty metre points respectively. The lowest mark was the safest, but jumping from the highest point was not permissible to everyone.|$|E

5000|$|Lieutenant Colonel William C. Lee, a {{staff officer}} for the Chief of Infantry, {{recommended}} that the test platoon be moved to the Safe Parachute Company at Hightstown, NJ and train using <b>parachute</b> drop <b>towers</b> from the 1939 New York World's Fair. Eighteen days after forming, the platoon was moved to New Jersey and trained for one week on the 250-foot free towers, which proved to be particularly effective - drops from the tower added realism otherwise impossible to duplicate outside of an airplane drop, and proved to the troopers that their parachutes would function safely.|$|R
50|$|The {{land was}} sold {{and is now}} the site of restaurants, shops and predominantly, Magic Mountain Resort Apartments, named in its memory.

50|$|The <b>parachute</b> <b>tower</b> {{was built}} by Turkish and Russian {{engineers}} in 1937. The 41.10 m-high tower conforms {{to the standards of}} the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). It offers recreational parachute jumping between May and October. The jumping deck is situated on the third floor at 37.90 m, reached by stairs or elevator. Two cranes are available for holding the parachute of the jumper. Healthy people over age sixteen, weighing between 45 - 90 kg, are allowed to parachute jump under the guidance of instructors.|$|E
5000|$|Children's Railway {{named after}} Kirov was {{launched}} on November 24, 1936. The train {{consisted of two}} coupled together trams and the road line length was of about one kilometer. Due to the World War II outbreak, Kirov Children's Railway ceased to exist and was never rebuilt. The park also previously had a musical shell, a summer theater for 1000 spectators, [...] "Green" [...] summer cinema for 2,200 seats, a dance floor, a restaurant, <b>parachute</b> <b>tower</b> (existed until 1970), reading, chess and checkers pavilions. Currently 23 kinds of amusement rides are working in the park, the boat station offers boats and catamarans to hire. In 2009 Dolphinarium [...] "Nemo" [...] was open {{as a part of}} the national complex of cultural and recreational centres «Nemo». The (at the time abandoned) dolphinarium was destroyed in a fire in November 2016.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the park}} {{there are several}} {{structures}} which are worth seeing. There is a commemorative plaque funded for the patron, Tadeusz Kościuszko, {{by the people of}} Katowice in 1925. The <b>parachute</b> <b>tower</b> also dates back to that time. It is currently being rebuilt to its height of 40 m; it was erected as a training structure. Not far from it there is a monument commemorating the heroic participation of scouts in the defence of the town against the Nazi invaders in 1939. Two unique structures of wooden building in Upper Silesia, a manorial granary from 1688 (burnt in 1970) and the Church of St. Michael Archangel, a wooden church under the invocation of St. Michael from 1510 moved from Syrynia, were placed in the park. In the park there is also a permanent gallery of plein-air sculpture, collecting works of famous artists of the region: Zygmunt Brachmanski, Augustyn Dyrda, Joachim Krakowczyk, Piotr Latoska, Jacek Sarapata, Andrzej Szczepaniec.|$|E
5000|$|The Croatian polymath and {{inventor}} Faust Vrančić (1551-1617) examined da Vinci's parachute sketch, {{and set out}} {{to implement}} one of his own. He kept the square frame, but replaced the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth that he came to realize decelerates the fall more effectively. A now-famous depiction of a parachute that he dubbed Homo Volans (Flying Man), showing a man <b>parachuting</b> from a <b>tower,</b> presumably St Mark's Campanile in Venice, appeared in his book on mechanics, Machinae Novae (1615 or 1616), alongside a number of other devices and technical concepts.|$|R
5|$|In Paris it {{was planned}} that two stunt men, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would help film two takes of a {{parachute}} drop off a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a {{top edge of}} the Eiffel Tower. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, <b>parachuted</b> off the <b>tower</b> without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|R
2500|$|The Parachute Drop was {{patented}} by retired U.S. Naval Commander James H. Strong and Stanley Switlik, who {{were inspired by}} primitive <b>parachute</b> practice <b>towers</b> {{he had seen in}} the Soviet Union. [...] The Soviet Union had been using simple wooden towers to train paratroopers since the 1920s, and despite the dangers of the Soviet design, which used just a single guide cable and sometimes found the jumper colliding with the structure, the towers were employed for recreational use as well. Strong designed a safer version which included eight guide wires in a circle surrounding the parachute. In 1936, Strong secured a U.S. patent for his design, and he built several test platforms at his home in Hightstown, New Jersey in 1936 and 1937. The military platforms suspended a single rider in a harness and offered a few seconds of freefall after the release at the top, before the chutes opened to slow the fall. Civilians showed a great deal of interest in trying out the ride for themselves, and Strong was quick to turn his invention to non-military use as well, making some design changes in the process: a seat that could hold two, a larger parachute for a slower drop, the metal ring which held the parachute permanently open, and shock-absorbing springs to ease the final landing.|$|R
