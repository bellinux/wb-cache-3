50|$|The {{carburetion}} on most control-line engines is {{a simple}} fixed-size orifice (venturi) with only a mixture ratio adjustment. The engine can be run over a very wide range of mixtures and adjusting the needle valve {{can be used to}} adjust the engine speed over a small range. Once released, the engine runs at a more-or-less constant speed until the fuel runs out, or, if equipped, the fuel-shutoff is activated. Altering the size of the venturi used can be used to adjust the gross power. Two-stroke glow motors can be made to run in a 4-stroke mode where the engine mis-fires on every other stroke, and changes mode of firing based on load of the propeller. A tremendous degree of control over how the engine runs in flight is possible by altering the fuel contents, propeller size, pitch, and <b>pitch</b> <b>distribution,</b> venturi size, compression ratio of the engine, and the length of the tuned exhaust, if used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We have {{recently}} conducted a statistical survey on <b>pitch</b> angle <b>distributions</b> of energetic electrons {{trapped in the}} Earth 2 ̆ 7 s outer radiation belt, and a new empirical model was developed based upon survey results. This model - relativistic electron <b>pitch</b> angle <b>distribution</b> (REPAD) - aims to present statistical pictures of electron equatorial <b>pitch</b> angle <b>distributions,</b> instead of the absolute flux levels, {{as a function of}} energy, L shell, magnetic local time, and magnetic activity. To quantify and facilitate this statistical survey, we use Legendre polynomials to fit long-term in situ directional fluxes observed near the magnetic equator from three missions: CRRES, Polar, and LANL- 97 A. As the first of this kind of model, REPAD covers the whole outer belt region, providing not only the mean and median <b>pitch</b> angle <b>distributions</b> in the area but also error estimates of the average distributions. Preliminary verification and validation results demonstrate the reliable performance of this model. Usage of REPAD is mainly to predict the full <b>pitch</b> angle <b>distribution</b> of fluxes along a given magnetic field line, or even on a given drift shell, based upon one single unidirectional or omnidirectional flux measurement anywhere on that field line. This can be particularly useful for data assimilation, which usually has large tolerance on data errors. In addition, relatively small variations in <b>pitch</b> angle <b>distributions</b> measured at L shell between?∼? 4 and 5 justify the assumption of fixed <b>pitch</b> angle <b>distributions</b> at GPS equatorial crossings (L?∼? 4. 2) used in our previous studies...|$|R

In this paper we develop methods and tools that support researchers in finding melodies in a database that {{belong to the same}} variant group as a set of given melodies. The basic approach is to derive from the pitches of the known variants per onset a weighted <b>pitch</b> <b>distribution,</b> which quantifies pitch stability. We allow for partial matching and AND and OR queries. Technically we do so by defining a distance measure between weighted <b>pitch</b> <b>distribution</b> sequences. It is based on two applications of the Earth Mover’s Distance, which is a distribution distance. We set up a distance framework and discuss musically meaningful parameterizations for two tasks: a) Study the inner-group distances between the group as a whole and single members of the group. b) Use the group’s weighted <b>pitch</b> <b>distribution</b> sequence to query for variant melodies. The first experimental results seem very promising: a) The inner-group distances correlate to expert assigned subgroups. b) For variant retrieval our method works better than last year’s MIREX winner. ...|$|E

The geometry and motion {{parameters of the}} turbine series cover {{a wide range of}} tidal turbine operating conditions targeted to the tidal flow speed probability distribution of the Bay of Fundy, NS Canada. A generic yet novel wind/tidal turbine rotor design and optimization procedure was developed and used for the optimization process. In the process, optimum annual energy production, as a benchmark, was obtained and used for comparison by taking into account both rotor hydrodynamic power production performance characteristics and annual tidal inflow speed probability distribution. The diameter of the full-scale bi-directional HATT rotor series developed is 20 -m. Optimum values of various variables were obtained for maximum annual energy production. These optimum values include: uniform pitch-diameter-ratio (p/D) distributions, nominal pitch values with different curve forms of non-uniform p/D distributions, shaft rotational speeds under fixed rotor diameter, diameter at fixed tip-speed-ratio (TSR), a combination of optimum shaft speeds at corresponding inflow speeds and optimum uniform p/D distribution at a fixed rotor diameter, number of rotor blades at fixed chord length, rotor solidity at fixed number of blades, and the combination of number of blades and solidity for both optimum constant <b>pitch</b> <b>distribution</b> and optimum linear <b>pitch</b> <b>distribution.</b> For the 20 -m bi-directional HATT, a substantial improvement in power coefficient Cpow was obtained, from 0. 28, {{as a result of the}} primary optimization process (for both optimum uniform p/D distribution and shaft speed n), to the final maximum of 0. 43. This corresponds to a 56 % increase in annual energy production of 1230 MW h, from 2188 to 3418 MW h, an improved energy production equivalent to the energy generated from 600 tonnes of coal (at 2 kW h per 1 kg coal from a standard thermal power plant).
