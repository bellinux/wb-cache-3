40|$|Abstract: The idea {{of hybrid}} {{photovoltaic-thermal}} collectors (PV-TCs) {{is based on}} the simultaneous operation of a photovoltaic laminate and a thermal collector attached as a thermal absorber. PV-TCs have improved electrical efficiency, due to the decrease of the photovoltaic panel temperature. The thermal efficiency of PV-TCs is also remarkable. This research aims to simulate and define PV-TCs electrical and thermal efficiency. After the theoretical simulation of a PV-TC, its electrical and thermal efficiency is calculated and compared respectively to the electrical efficiency of a photovoltaic panel and to the thermal efficiency of a conventional solar collector. This comparison leads to significant conclusions concerning the PV-TC overall efficiency in relation to its surface area.

40|$|Due to European Directives (2010 / 31 /UE on {{buildings}} energy performance, 2009 / 28 /CE {{on the use}} {{of renewable}} energy, 2012 / 27 /UE on the energy efficiency) the electric and thermal energy needs of new and retrofitted buildings are faced by increasing percentages of renewable energy. Solar energy and heat pumps are the most promising technologies mainly in residential buildings as they have reached great maturity. Anyway, in most cases solar energy utilizations systems are thermal (which convert solar energy to thermal energy) and photovoltaic (which convert solar energy to electricity) used as separated collectors. Commercial photovoltaic modules have nowadays an efficiency around 15 % - 18 %. It means that the most relevant part of solar radiation is lost. Such a remark gets more importance if the active surface is located in an urban environment, where the availability of surfaces exposed to the sun is scarce if compared to the buildings thermal loads. PhotoVoltaic / Thermal cogeneration (PV/T) aims to utilize the same area both for producing electricity and heat. As solar cells are sensitive to temperature (their efficiency lowers when temperature increases), heat is beneficially collected but it cannot be available at high temperatures. Many researches on performances and characteristics of different hybrid <b>photovoltaic–thermal</b> technologies and <b>systems</b> have been carried out during the last years to face this problem; among these designs, systems utilizing air, liquid, heat pipes, phase change materials, and thermoelectric devices to aid cooling of PV cells.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations can be a valuable tool for the design and analysis of these hybrid building-integrated solar energy systems while recent advances in CFD approaches and turbulence models provide a great potential for improving prediction accuracy. This study performs 3 -dimensional steady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD simulations and evaluates the performance of five turbulence closure models, potentially suitable for modeling UTCs in terms of accuracy and computing cost. These models include four two-equation models (Standard k-ɛ, Renormalization Group Methods k-ɛ, Realizable k-ɛ and Shear Stress Transport k-ω) and one Reynolds Stress Model. A flat UTC under free stream approaching flow conditions and a corrugated UTC subjected to a plane wall jet flow were considered. The predicted air velocity, air temperature, and turbulent kinetic energy were compared against experimental data from the literature and those obtained using a specially designed full-scale experimental set-up in a solar simulator. The results show that although the Reynolds Stress Model can provide more detailed flow features at an increased computational cost compared to other models, {{it does not necessarily}} result in better performance. Among the two- equation models, the Renormalization Group Methods k-ɛ has the best overall performance for both cases studied while the Standard k- ɛ and Shear Stress Transport k-ω models can also provide acceptable prediction accuracy. A BIPV/T system with two PV panel arrangements across a UTC under the same coverage was investigated using the CFD models developed in the present study.

The {{system has been}} designed to be superimposed into a solar shading louvre; in this way the concentrating unit takes profit of the solar altitude tracking, which the shading blinds already have, to increase system performance. A dynamic energy simulation has been conducted in two different locations—Sde Boker (Israel) and Avignon (France) —both with adequate annual irradiances for solar applications, but with different weather and energy demand characteristics. The simulation engine utilized has been TRNSYS, coupled with MATLAB (where the ray-tracing algorithm to simulate the holographic optical performance has been implemented). The concentrator achieves annual mean optical efficiencies of 30. 3 % for Sde Boker and 43. 0 % for the case of Avignon. Regarding the energy production, in both locations the thermal energy produced meets almost 100 % of the domestic hot water demand as this has been considered a priority in the system control. On the other hand, the space heating demands are covered by a percentage ranging from 15 % (Avignon) to 20 % (Sde Boker).

This thesis {{is focused on}} energy performance of different configurations of building integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BIPV/T) and HVAC system that utilize recovered heat. A dynamic model for Concordia solar house which included an open loop air-cooled BIPV/T roof system was developed. The thermal network approach with explicit finite difference method was used to simulate the thermal behaviour of the house. The system studied included an air-water heat exchanger for preheating domestic hot water (DHW), water tank and rockbed storage. Predicted temperatures of the preheated air in the BfPV/T systems, PV panels and DHW were obtained and verified with data collected from the solar house. Results showed the dependence of thermo-electrical performance of the BIPV/T roof on the ambient conditions, air velocity, length and PV cavity depth. For the unglazed BIPV/T system, the heated air is suitable {{to be used as}} a preheated air in the HVAC system; for the same reason, thermal rockbed storage is not beneficial for extreme winter conditions with unglazed BIPV/T open loop air system. The BIPV/T system considered is suitable for DHW preheating.

40|$|Solar {{electricity}} is a promising energy {{technology for the}} future, and by using reflectors for concentrating solar radiation onto photovoltaic cells, the cost per produced kWh can be significantly reduced. The optical efficiency of a concentrating system determines the fraction of the incident energy that is transferred to the cells and depends on the optical properties of the system components. In this thesis, low-concentrating photovoltaic and photovoltaic-thermal systems with two-dimensional parabolic reflectors were studied and optimised, and a new biaxial model for the incidence angle dependence of the optical efficiency was proposed. Concentration of light generally results in high cell temperatures, and the uneven irradiance distribution on cells with parabolic reflectors leads to high local currents and temperatures, which reduce fill-factor and voltage. Cooling the cells by means of water increases the voltage and {{makes it possible to}} utilize the thermal energy. The performance of a 4 X concentrating <b>photovoltaic-thermal</b> <b>system</b> was evaluated. If operated at 50 °C, this system would produce 250 kWhelectrical and 800 kWhthermal per m 2 cell area and year. Optical performance can be increased by 20 % by using better reflectors and anti-reflectance glazing. Low-concentrating photovoltaic systems for façade-integration were studied and optimised for maximum annual electricity production. The optimisation was based on measured short-circuit currents versus solar altitude. Measurements were performed outdoors and in a solar simulator. It was found that the use of 3 X parabolic reflectors increases the annual electricity production by more than 40 %. High solar reflectance is crucial to system performance but by using a low-angle scattering reflector, the fill-factor and power are increased due to a more even irradiance on the modules. Long-term system performance depends on the durability of the components. The optical properties and degradation of reflector materials were assessed using spectrophotometry, angular resolved scatterometry, Fresnel modelling, optical microscopy, and surface profilometry before and after ageing. The degradation of reflectors was found to be strongly dependent on material composition and environmental conditions. Back surface mirrors, all-metal reflectors, and polymer-metal laminates degraded in different ways, and therefore accelerated ageing must be tailored for testing of different types of reflector materials. However, new types of reflector laminates showed a potential for increasing the cost-effectiveness of low-concentrating solar energy systems...|$|E

Exploiting this excess heat through a novel technology termed solar <b>photovoltaic-thermal</b> (PVT) <b>system</b> which enables both electricity and heat to be generated from a single system {{is the focus of}} the research presented in this thesis. In order to maintain an optimal PV cell temperature {{a number of}} phase change materials (PCMs) have been used in the PVT panel assembly which absorb heat whilst charging and release heat whilst discharging. A number of PCMs were tested within the PVT panels such as RT 27, OM 35, OM 46 and OM 56. PVT simulation showed that electrical output can be increased by 9 % coupled with an average water temperature rise of 20 °e. Four types of PVTs have been developed by modifying the standard thermal collector and standard PV panel which constitute the PVT collector and PVT panel respectively. It was observed that modification of the standard thermal collectors for PVT purpose is not feasible due to brittleness of the PV cell and the ambient high temperature in the collector. However, modification of the PV panel is feasible with the integration of a heat carrying fluid {{at the rear of the}} panel. A significant part of the research is an innovative design where a polycarbonate {PC} channel type PVT panel was developed. It was observed that the PC is a good PV base with the channels suitable for both water and PCM heat transfer. It was concluded this offered the best solution. The feasibility of a PV panel using PC and other polymers was tested for optical properties, electrical insulation, physical insulation, physical protection and climatic impact.

Hybrid <b>photovoltaic-thermal</b> (PV-T) <b>systems</b> can reach overall efficiencies in excess of 70 %, with electrical fficiencies in the range of 15 - 20 % and thermal efficiencies of 50 % or higher. In most applications, the electrical output of a hybrid PV-T system is the priority, hence the contacting fluid is used to cool the PV cells to maximise their electrical performance, which imposes a limit on the fluid's downstream use. When optimising the overall output of PV-T systems for combined heating and cooling provision, this technology can cover more than 60 % of the heating and about 50 % of the cooling demands of households in the urban environment. To achieve this, PV-T systems can be coupled to heat pumps or absorption refrigeration systems as viable alternatives to vapour-compression systems. This work considers the techno-economic challenges of such systems, when aiming at a low cost per kWh of energy generation of PV-T systems for co- or tri-generation in the housing sector. First, the viability and afordability of the proposed systems are studied in ten European locations, with local weather pro files, using annually and monthly averaged solar-irradiance and energy-demand data. Based on annual simulations, Seville, Rome, Madrid and Bucharest emerge as the most promising locations from those examined, and the most efficient system confi guration involves coupling PV-T panels to water-to-water heat pumps that use the PV-T thermal output to maximise the system's COP. Hourly resolved transient models are then defi ned in TRNSYS in order to provide detailed estimates of system performance, since it is found that the temporal resolution (e. g. hourly, daily, yearly) of the simulations strongly affects their predicted performance. The TRNSYS results indicate that PV-T systems have the potential to cover 60 % of the heating and almost 100 % of the cooling demands of homes at all four aforementioned locations. Finally, the levelised cost of energy for these systems is found to be in the range of 0. 06 - 0. 12 e/kWh, which is 30 - 40 % lower than that for equivalent PV only systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop methods that reduce energy consumption in a residential building in a hot and humid climate region (Thailand) using efficient architectural building components and renewable energy (solar energy) to produce electricity, domestic hot water, and supplemental cooling by night sky radiation. Improving the architectural building components, including building materials, is an option to reduce energy consumption in a building. Using renewable energy sources is another option to reduce the consumption of non-renewable energy. In residential buildings, solar energy has been utilized for space heating and domestic hot water using active solar collector systems and for generating electricity using photovoltaic (PV) systems. One photovoltaic <b>system,</b> the hybrid <b>photovoltaic-thermal</b> (PV-T) collector <b>system,</b> has been developed by several researchers over the last 20 years. The hybrid <b>photovoltaic-thermal</b> (PV-T) collector <b>system</b> is a combination photovoltaic (for producing electricity) and solar thermal collector (for producing hot water). Theoretical and experimental studies of this collector have highlighted the advantages of the hybrid PV-T collector system over separate systems of PV and solar collector in term of system efficiency and economics. Unfortunately, very little experimental data exists that demonstrates the advantages of a combined system. Therefore, one of the objectives of this study conducted was an experimental study of this system as an auxiliary energy source for a residential building. Night sky radiation has also been studied as a cooling strategy. However, no attempt so far could be found to integrate it to a hybrid PV-T collector system. The night sky radiation strategy could be operated with the hybrid PV/T collector system by using existing resources that are already present in the solar system. The integration of the night sky radiation into the hybrid PV-T collector system should yield more productivity of the system than the operation of the Hybrid PVT system alone. The research methods used in this work included instrumentation of a case-study house in Thailand, an experimental PV-T collector system, and a calibrated building thermal simulation. A typical contemporary Thai residential building was selected as a case-study house. Its energy use and local weather data were measured and analyzed. Published energy use of Thai residential buildings was also analyzed as well to determine average energy consumption. A calibrated computer model of the case-study building was constructed using the DOE- 2 program. A field experiment of the thermal PV system was constructed to test its ability to simultaneously produce electricity and hot water in the daytime, and shed heat at night as a cooling strategy (i. e., night sky radiation). The resultant electricity and hot water produced by the hybrid PV-T collector system helped to reduce the use of non-renewable energy. The cooling produced by the night sky radiation also has to potential to reduce the cooling load. The evaluation of the case-study house and results of the field experiment helped to quantify the potential reduction of energy use in Thai residential buildings. This research provided the following benefits: 1) experimental results of a hybrid PV-T solar collector system that demonstrates its performance compared to typical system of separate photovoltaic and solar collector, 2) results of night sky radiation experiments using a photovoltaic panel as a radiator to demonstrate the performance of this new space cooling strategy, and 3) useful data from the case-study house simulation results and guidelines to assist others in transferring the results to other projects...|$|R
40|$|Building-integrated <b>photovoltaic-thermal</b> (BIPV/T) <b>systems</b> replace {{conventional}} building cladding with {{solar technology}} that generates electricity and heat. For example, unglazed transpired solar collectors, known as UTCs, {{can be integrated}} with open-loop photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) systems to preheat ventilation air and/or to feed hot air into an air source heat pump, thus satisfying {{a significant part of}} the building’s heating and/or hot water requirements while also generating electricity. In the present study a model for a BIPV/T system with a two-stage prototype UTC integrated with PV panels has been developed and used to create a new component in TRNSYS. An open plan office space at Purdue’s Living Lab is used as a test-bed to explore system integration approaches with building HVAC systems and thermal storage mechanisms. The BIPV/T system is coupled with the building through a thermal storage tank, which serves as the heat source, and is connected to the air-to-water heat pump, for the radiant floor heating. The building ventilation system is coupled with the air outlet of the BIPV/T system. A detailed building energy model is developed in TRNSYS, which is used to evaluate the annual performance with the results showing significant energy savings. The objective is to develop models that can be implemented within a predictive control framework for the optimal set-point trajectory of the thermal storage tank. In the MPC formulation, the cost function is the integral of the electric energy consumption over the prediction horizon (48 hrs) subject to thermal comfort and equipment constraints. The study also investigates the impacts of the uncertainty in weather forecast (solar radiation) on MPC performance robustness for the integrated solar system. In our methodology, the TRNSYS model is used as a true representation of the building to identify the parameters of a 3 rd order linear time invariant state-space model. The sum of squares minimization was used to identify model parameters that minimize the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of time series predictions for the three state variables (floor surface temperature of the room; room air temperature; building envelope interior surface temperature) between the reduced order and the TRNSYS model. Known inputs to the system include the ambient temperature, solar radiation (absorbed by the envelope or transmitted through the south-facing glazed façade), internal heat gains (occupancy schedule, equipment, mechanical ventilation and infiltration) and the tank set point temperature. A pattern search optimization algorithm has been used over the training data space to identify the parameter values. Parameter bounds were set to constrain the solution space to physically plausible values. The training and calibration data sets includes 2351 (from Jan 4 to Feb 22, 7 weeks) and 1823 (from Feb 23 to Mar 30) data points, respectively. The simplified 3 rd order model shows satisfactory performance with the RMSE for the three state variables within 0. 5 °C. Model predictive control relevant identification methods such as 4 SID (black-box identification) are also considered and the results will be compared with those using grey-box techniques...|$|R
