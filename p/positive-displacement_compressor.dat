The benefits of proper oil atomization in <b>positive-displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> have been documented already by a number of investigations (Singh and Bowman, 1986; Stosic et al., 1988; Fujiwara and Osada, 1995; Valenti et al., 2013; Cipollone et al. 2014). The novelty of this work resides in the extension of a previous model to describe more accurately the quantity and the diameter distribution of the droplets generated by the nozzles and, consequently, to predict more precisely the heat transfer occurring between the liquid and the gas phase within a compression chamber. The model is applied to a pre-commercial mid-size compressor that is equipped with a number of pressure-swirl nozzles. The numerical data are validated successfully against the measurements of the pressure {{as a function of the}} angular position. The results indicate that the specific energy of compression is appreciable reduced with respect to the case of an adiabatic process. The model is applied here to a sliding-vane compressor, but it is general in nature and can be promptly modified for another kind of machine. It may be used also for optimizing type, number and position of the nozzles in order to further improve the performances of air compressors...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies report the benefit of proper oil {{spraying}} in <b>positive-displacement</b> <b>compressors.</b> This work presents a thermodynamic model for simulating sliding-vane air compressors that employ an injection system for the lubricating oil based on both plain orifices and pressure-swirl nozzles to exploit the thermal effect of sprayed oil inside the compression chambers. An experimental campaign on a large-size compressor is conducted measuring, among all, the pressure within a chamber. This measurement is used to validate the model. Oil droplet diameters depend strongly on the injection technology, nozzles generating a finer atomization than orifices, {{as well as the}} differential pressure. In any case, the proper positioning of the nozzles allows for an effective heat transfer from the air to the oil...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Positive-displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> and, among them, sliding-vane rotary {{machines}} {{are widely used}} in the compressed air sector. As in many other industrial fields, the efficient utilization of energy {{has become a major}} goal also in this sector. The aim of the present activity is the experimental investigation on the influence of two vanes materials (cast iron and aluminium with anodized surface) and of four commercial lubricants (characterized by different formulations and additives concentrations) on the performance of a mid-capacity sliding-vane rotary compressor in a number of operating pressures. The performance is identified by both the volume flow rate and the absorbed mechanical power, evaluated according to the international standard ISO 5167 and ISO 1217. The campaign indicates that the considered lubricants do not affect appreciably the volumetric flow rate. On the other hand, the specific lubricants determine a variation of about 1 % of the mechanical power for both materials, while the specific material a variation between 0. 9 % and 2. 6 %. The best performance is achieved by aluminium vanes and a synthetic poly-α-olefin lubricant...|$|R
40|$|Lube-oil {{injection}} {{is used in}} <b>positive-displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> and, among them, in sliding-vane {{machines to}} guarantee the correct lubrication of the moving parts and as sealing to prevent air leakage. Furthermore, lube-oil injection allows to exploit lubricant also as thermal ballast with a great thermal capacity to minimize the temperature increase during the compression. This study presents {{the design of a}} two-stage sliding-vane rotary compressor in which the air cooling is operated by high-pressure cold oil injection into a connection duct between the two stages. The heat exchange between the atomized oil jet and the air results in a decrease of the air temperature before the second stage, improving the overall system efficiency. This cooling system is named here intracooling, as opposed to intercooling. The oil injection is realized via pressure-swirl nozzles, both within the compressors and inside the intracooling duct. The design of the two-stage sliding-vane compressor is accomplished by way of a lumped parameter model. The model predicts an input power reduction as large as 10 % for intercooled and intracooled two-stage compressors, the latter being slightly better, with respect to a conventional single-stage compressor for compressed air applications. An experimental campaign is conducted on a first prototype that comprises the low-pressure compressor and the intracooling duct, indicating that a significant temperature reduction is achieved in the duct...|$|R
40|$|The {{isentropic}} {{efficiency of}} <b>positive-displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> may be improved {{in order to}} follow an increasing demand for energy savings. This work analyzes the thermal effect of the lubricating oil presence in the air during compression with the scope of exploiting it as a thermal ballast to mitigate both the gas temperature rise and its compression work. The bibliographic review shows that other authors suggested that oil can have positive effects if properly injected. Here an energy balance analysis is executed with the scope of deriving relations for the gas-liquid compression in analogy with those typical for the gas-only compression and of confirming that ideally the liquid presence may have beneficial effects, making the gas-liquid compression even better than 1 - and 2 -time intercooled gas compressions. Given these positive results, a heat transfer analysis is conducted to model the thermal interaction between gas and oil droplets within a mid-size rotary vane air compressor. A droplet diameter {{of the order of}} 100 μm leads to large reductions of both temperature increase and compression work: air can exit the discharge port at a temperature as low as 60 °C and compression work can be lowered by 23 - 28 % with respect to conventional compressors. Finally, a test rig is constructed and operated to investigate a large-flow and large-angle oil nozzle taken from the market showing that, at the operating conditions of a compressor, oil breaks up into small droplets and undefined structures with large exchange surfaces...|$|R

40|$|A way to {{increase}} the efficiency of <b>positive-displacement</b> air <b>compressor</b> is spraying the lube oil to exploit it not only as lubricating and sealing agent but also as thermal ballast. This work seeks the experimental evidence in sliding-vane compressors by measuring the air standard volume flow rate and the electrical power input of three diverse configurations. The first configuration, taken as reference, employs a conventional injection system comprising calibrated straight orifices. The other two, referred to as advanced, adopt smaller orifices and pressure-swirl full-cone nozzles designed for the purpose; the third configuration utilizes a pump to boost the oil pressure. The laser imagining technique shows that the nozzles generate sprays that break-up within a short distance into spherical droplets, ligaments, ramifications and undefined structures. Tests on the packaged compressors reveal that the advanced configurations provide almost the same air flow rate while utilizing half of the oil because the sprays generate a good sealing. Moreover, the sprayed oil is acting as a thermal ballast because the electrical input is reduced by 3. 0 % and 3. 5 %, respectively, if the pump is not or is present, while the specific energy requirement, accounting for the slightly reduced air flow, by 2. 4 % and 2. 9 %, respectively...|$|R
