5|$|The discography of John Frusciante, who is {{best known}} as the former guitarist of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{consists}} of eleven solo albums and four EPs, as well as two albums with collaborators Joe Lally and Josh Klinghoffer under the name Ataxia and one EP and one album under the alias of Trickfinger. After recording Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1992 when he got tired of the growing success of the band. He released his first solo album, Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt, in 1994 on American Recordings. His second record, Smile From the Streets You Hold, was released in 1997 and later taken off the market at his request in 1999. After returning to the Red Hot Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1998, Frusciante recorded Californication with the band and subsequently released his third solo album, To Record Only Water for Ten Days, in February 2001 on Warner Music Group.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{life-threatening}} drug addiction that developed {{after leaving the}} Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1992, Frusciante made a full recovery after a month of drug rehabilitation during {{the early months of}} 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the Red Hot Chili Peppers. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio.|$|E
5|$|Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt {{combines}} avant-garde and stream-of-consciousness styles, with guitar, {{piano and}} various effects on a four-track recorder. The album's first half, Niandra Lades, was recorded before Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1992; during {{the recording of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The second half, Usually Just a T-Shirt, was recorded while the band was on tour {{in the months leading}} up to Frusciante's departure. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt sold poorly upon its release in 1994, and was taken off the market, only to be re-released in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The North Carolina Tar Heels {{football}} team, {{representing the}} University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has had 215American football players {{drafted into the}} National Football League (NFL) since the league began holding drafts in 1936. The highest that a Tar Heel has ever been drafted is second overall, which has happened on four occasions: Ken Willard in 1965, Lawrence Taylor in 1981, Julius <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 2002, and Mitch Trubisky in 2017 The Buffalo Bills and Washington Redskins have drafted the most Tar Heels with sixteen and fifteen, respectively. Every current NFL franchise has drafted a player from North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{zucchini}} is a {{key ingredient}} in ratatouille, a stew of summer fruits and vegetables prepared in olive oil and cooked for an extended time over low heat. The dish, originating near present-day Nice, is served {{as a side dish}} or on its own at lunch with bread. Zucchini may be stuffed with meat or with other fruits such as tomatoes or bell <b>peppers</b> <b>in</b> a dish called courgette farcie (stuffed zucchini).|$|E
25|$|Intrigued by {{the many}} kinds and shapes of kelp he found on the beaches near Carmel, in 1930 Weston began taking close-ups of {{vegetables}} and fruits. He made a variety of photographs of cabbage, kale, onions, bananas, and finally, his most iconic image, <b>peppers.</b> <b>In</b> August of that year Noskowiak brought him several green peppers, and over a four-day period he shot at least thirty different negatives. Of these, Pepper No. 30, is among the all-time masterpieces of photography.|$|E

50|$|The Trinidad {{scorpion}} 'Butch T' pepper was, {{for three}} years, ranked the most pungent ("hot") <b>pepper</b> <b>in</b> {{the world according}} to Guinness World Records. A laboratory test conducted in March 2011 measured a specimen at 1,463,700 Scoville heat units, officially ranking it the hottest <b>pepper</b> <b>in</b> the world at that time. One possible secret to the chili's heat, according to a cultivator of the pepper, is fertilizing the soil with the liquid runoff of a worm farm. In August 2013, Guinness World Records recognized the Carolina Reaper as the hottest <b>pepper</b> <b>in</b> the world, at 1,569,300 SHU.|$|R

25|$|The {{flagship}} red {{variety of}} Tabasco pepper sauce measures 2,500–5,000SHU on the Scoville scale. The habanero sauce is considerably hotter, rating above 7,000 Scoville units. The chipotle sauce adds chipotle pepper {{to the original}} sauce, measuring 1,500–2,500. The garlic variety, which blends milder <b>peppers</b> <b>in</b> with the tabasco peppers, rates 1,200–1,400 Scovilles, and the green pepper (jalapeño) sauce is even milder at 600–1,200 Scovilles. The Sweet and Spicy sauce is the mildest of all the sauces at only 100–600 Scoville units.|$|E
25|$|However, early {{records of}} kimchi do not mention garlic or chili pepper. Chili peppers, now a {{standard}} ingredient in kimchi, had been unknown in Korea {{until the early}} seventeenth century. Chili peppers originated in the Americas, introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders. The first mention of chili pepper is found in Jibong yuseol, an encyclopedia published in 1614. Sallim gyeongje, a 17‒18th century book on farm management, wrote on kimchi with chili peppers. However, {{it was not until}} the 19th century that the use of chili <b>peppers</b> <b>in</b> kimchi was widespread. The recipes from early 19th century closely resemble today's kimchi.|$|E
25|$|He also {{organized}} the New American Music Union, a two-day summer music festival set for August 2008 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He has assembled a lineup of musicians including Bob Dylan, The Raconteurs, Gnarls Barkley, The Roots, {{and a second}} stage featuring college bands. (The lineup did not include Kiedis or the Red Hot Chili <b>Peppers.)</b> <b>In</b> 2011, Kiedis, along with his son Everly, appeared in the documentary, Bob and the Monster. The documentary details the life and career of musician and drug counselor, Bob Forrest. On May 11, 2011, Anthony donated a MTV European Music Award that the band had previously won to help raise funds for ongoing relief in devastated areas of Japan, which was hit with an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.|$|E

25|$|Bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard invited Irons to join Mookie Blaylock, {{the band}} {{that would become}} Pearl Jam, in 1990, when the band was first forming and {{still looking for a}} singer and a drummer. Although he did not join the band at that time because he was {{committed}} to his own band, Eleven, he did pass on a cassette of the band's work to a singer and local musician in San Diego named Eddie Vedder. Irons had formed a friendship with Vedder after meeting him through the Southern California music scene and would play basketball with him. Vedder subsequently joined the band. Irons also called the Red Hot Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1991 and asked the band to allow Vedder's new group to open for the band on its forthcoming Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour.|$|E
25|$|The Valley of Mezquital {{is three}} valleys called the Actopan, the Ixmiquilpan and the Tasquillo {{as well as}} flat areas known as Tula and Alfajayucan. The {{vegetation}} is mostly that of semi arid regions with mesquite trees and various types of cacti growing. The only areas with tree cover are those near streams and other water sources and on the mountain tops of the peaks. Despite this, the region {{is considered to be}} Hidalgo’s granary, growing corn, beans, wheat, tomatoes, onions, oats, olives, cactus fruit, tejocote and much more. It produces {{more than half of the}} alfalfa and green chili <b>peppers</b> <b>in</b> Mexico. Due to the lack of rainfall, irrigation from the areas above and below ground streams is important. However, it is also one of the areas of Mexico with the highest levels of malnutrition. The valley averages 2000 meters above sea level and has a temperate climate with freezes being rare.|$|E
500|$|Born in Haifa, Israel, Slovak immigrated {{with his}} family to the United States in 1967 when he was five years old. Slovak met future bandmates Anthony Kiedis, Flea, and Jack Irons while {{attending}} high school in Los Angeles. He joined the group Anthym along with Irons while attending Fairfax High School; Flea would later join the group, which later changed its name to What Is This?. [...] Slovak, Flea, Kiedis, and Irons started Red Hot Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1982, which became popular in the Los Angeles area, playing various shows around the city. However, Slovak quit the band to focus on What is This?, which had gotten a record deal, leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their debut album without him. He rejoined the Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1985, and recorded the albums Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan with the band.|$|E

500|$|With the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante {{provided}} backing vocals in a falsetto tenor, a style {{he started}} on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. He thoroughly enjoyed {{his role in}} the Chili Peppers as backing vocalist, and said that backing vocals are a [...] "real art form". Despite his commitment to the Chili Peppers, he felt that his work with the band should remain separate from his solo projects. When he returned to the Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1998, Kiedis wanted the band to record [...] "Living in Hell", a song Frusciante had written several years before. Frusciante refused, feeling that the creative freedom he needed for his solo projects would have conflicted with {{his role in the}} band.|$|E
500|$|Slovak {{returned}} to the Chili Peppers for their second album, Freaky Styley, which was released on August 16, 1985. What is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons {{returned to}} the Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that [...] "it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy". Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving {{the rest of the}} group to work on much of the album's material by themselves. The band lived in Detroit for a portion of the recording of the album, where Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use. [...] When Slovak was under the influence, he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a [...] "shuffling" [...] fashion, which became the inspiration for the song [...] "Skinny Sweaty Man" [...] from the band's next album. [...] After Kiedis completed a stint in rehab, he rejoined the Red Hot Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. Slovak felt a deep connection to the album; he reflected in his diary [...] "It was so fun. I'm so extremely proud of everybody's workit is at times genius." [...] Slovak was the subject of the songs [...] "Skinny Sweaty Man", [...] "Me and My Friends", & [...] "No Chump Love Sucker". He was nicknamed [...] "Slim Bob Billy", [...] "Slim", or [...] "Huckleberry", and throughout the albums Kiedis calls him by these nicknames before he starts a guitar solo. [...] On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, Slovak experimented with different musical styles, playing the sitar on the song [...] "Behind the Sun".|$|E
500|$|In a 2015 interview, Cris Kirkwood {{said that}} {{following}} Frusciante's {{departure from the}} Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1992 he auditioned for his band the Meat Puppets. Kirkwood said [...] "“He showed up with his guitar out of its case and barefoot. We were on a major label then, we just got signed, and those guys had blown up {{to where they were}} at and John needed to get out. John gets to our pad and we started getting ready to play and I said, ‘You want to use my tuner?’ He said, ‘No, I’ll bend it in.’ It was so far out. Then we jammed but it didn’t come to anything. Maybe he wasn’t in the right place and we were a tight little unit. It just didn’t quite happen but it could have worked." ...|$|E

500|$|Frogstomp was a number-one {{album in}} Australia and New Zealand. It reached the Billboard200 Top10, making Silverchair the first Australian band {{to do so}} since INXS. It was {{certified}} as a US double-platinum album by the RIAA, triple-platinum in Canada by the CRIA and multi-platinum in Australia. The album sold more than 4million copies worldwide.Paste magazine called this album the [...] "last stand" [...] of grunge. As Frogstomp and [...] "Tomorrow" [...] continued to gain popularity through 1995, the group toured the US where they supported Red Hot Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> June, The Ramones in September, and played {{on the roof of}} Radio City Music Hall at the MTV Music Awards – in between touring they continued their secondary education in Newcastle. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, the band won five awards out of nine nominations. To collect their awards on the night they sent Josh Shirley, the young son of the album's producer.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante's drug {{addiction}} worsened {{as the years}} progressed. An article published by the New Times LA described him as [...] "a skeleton covered in thin skin". He participated {{in an interview with}} Dutch public broadcast station VPRO—the first media appearance he made since leaving the Chili <b>Peppers.</b> <b>In</b> the interview Frusciante speaks of the positive effects drugs have had on his mind and proudly admits to being a [...] "junkie". He went on to confess addictions to heroin and crack cocaine, but ultimately described himself as being in the best health of his life. In 1997, Frusciante released his second solo album Smile From the Streets You Hold, primarily for drug money. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was estimated to have sold only 45,000 copies when Frusciante ordered it out of print in 1998—when Frusciante rehabilitated and rejoined the Chili Peppers. Smile From the Streets You Hold was withdrawn from the market a year later. In 1999 Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was re-released on American Recordings. In the early 2000s, Frusciante said he planned to re-release Smile From the Streets You Hold sometime in the future, but did not give any indication as to when. It was eventually re-released on American Records in Europe of 2006.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{rejoined the}} Chili <b>Peppers</b> <b>in</b> 1998, and they {{released}} their seventh studio album, Californication, in June 1999. It was a commercial success, peaking at number {{three on the}} Billboard 200 and being certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned six singles, including the Billboard Hot 100 top ten hit [...] "Scar Tissue". Californication was followed by By the Way in July 2002.
