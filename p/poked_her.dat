500|$|McCay {{originally}} used {{a version}} of the film as part of his vaudeville act. [...] The first performance was on February8, 1914, in Chicago at the Palace Theater. [...] McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with How a Mosquito Operates. [...] He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. [...] Standing {{to the right of the}} film screen, he introduced [...] "the only dinosaur in captivity". [...] As the film started Gertie <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> head out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. [...] He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. [...] For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he [...] "reappeared" [...] in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him on her back, and walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.|$|E
2500|$|In Davidson's first {{autobiography}} The Full Monty (1993), {{he talked}} about his violent and abusive behaviour towards his wife in a light-hearted manner: [...] "We’re like a couple of boxers. On the first occasion, I <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> in the eye by accident. I actually went for the mouth. Thank heaven I missed, I’d have fallen in. I just took a playful punch. Unfortunately I caught her completely wrong. The second time I gave her a shiner. I threw a bunch of keys which whacked her in the eye. Just for a giggle she kept blackening it up to make it look worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anna Maria! Anna Maria!" [...] squeaked the rat. There was a pattering {{noise and}} an old woman rat <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> head round a rafter.|$|E

6000|$|... "I was pullin' on {{my boots}} when Louise <b>pokes</b> <b>her</b> head above the wagon an' says: 'Hey, you bow-legged gurl snatcher, where's my clothes?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thanks!" [...] {{said the}} girl sharply. Then she smiled maliciously. [...] "I daresay mother would, though; she’s fond of <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> nose into other people’s business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those cousins don't {{look much}} alike, do they?" [...] remarked Jenny Wren, as she <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> {{head out of}} her house to gossip with Peter.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a black}} look on {{her yellow}} face. Suddenly a voice was heard calling. She <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> {{head out of the}} shed, and {{answered}} coolly: ...|$|E
60|$|A general shiver pervaded the listeners, and Cordy <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> {{head under}} the sofa pillows with a faint cry, while the rest involuntarily drew nearer to one another.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Alec {{took her}} aboard the ship, {{and she had}} the {{satisfaction}} of <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> inquisitive little nose into every available corner, at the risk of being crushed, lost, or drowned.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} here?" [...] said she, <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> {{head into the}} book. [...] "Oh! no wonder you can't leave off. I've been wanting you to read it all the week." ...|$|R
50|$|Mikhail Gorbachev was {{occasionally}} mocked for {{his poor}} grammar, but perestroika-era jokes usually {{made fun of}} his slogans and ineffective actions, his birth mark, Raisa Gorbachev's <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> nose everywhere, and Soviet-American relations.|$|R
6000|$|Jerry <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> head {{as far as}} {{she could}} out of the window. [...] "Miss Ponsonby, you are going to the dance," [...] she said in a {{cautious}} undertone, [...] "so don't cry any more or your eyes will be dreadfully red." ...|$|E
6000|$|They were {{mounting}} the stairs, {{and when}} they reached the library, she went in and <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> long-gloved hands well in over the fire on the hearth while she lifted her eyes to the clock. [...] "Oh, it isn't so very late. Only five." ...|$|E
60|$|Three cups of tepid {{water were}} produced, {{and the company}} sat eagerly soaking their finger tips for a time, after which much pruning and {{polishing}} went on, to the great bewilderment of Puss, who <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> own paws into the cups, {{as if trying to}} test the advantages of this remarkable American custom.|$|E
6000|$|... "He does," [...] said Jenny Wren, <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> {{head out}} of her doorway just as Peter spoke. [...] "How do you suppose he would find them {{when they are in}} the ground if he didn't hear them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The 'Guadala'. Ah! No, I think not. Her captain {{he is too}} big fool. But I {{think she}} have gone down the coast. Those your gunboats <b>poke</b> <b>her</b> nose and shove her oar in every place. How is 'Guadala'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Arf way down, fourpenny," [...] {{said the}} man at the door, <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> in the {{direction}} of Mr. May, who wanted to put her in the red velvet. But she marched down one of the pews, and took her seat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} my dish is hot," [...] she said, bending {{down at the}} oven. She half {{expected}} him to look for her, but he took no notice. She was hungry and she <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> finger eagerly in the pot to see if her brussels sprouts and potatoes and meat were ready. They were not.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next morning}} Mrs. Pomfret, who was merely [...] "driving by" [...] with her {{daughter}} Alice and Beatrice Chillingham, spied Mr. Crewe walking about among the young trees he was growing near the road, and occasionally tapping them with his stout stick. She <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> coachman {{in the back and}} cried:--"Humphrey, you're such an important man now that I despair of ever seeing you again. What was the matter last night?" ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} it was ten o'clock and going on eleven, and all the town was as still as death, except the dogs. Pony's father kept on until he got down to the river-bank, where Jim Leonard's mother lived, and he had to knock and knock before he could make anybody hear. At last Jim Leonard's mother <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> head out of the window and asked who was there, and Pony's father told her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at {{this time}} of the year; but its more'n {{probable}} the Sea Dream will kick up her heels enough to show something of what is meant by a life on the ocean wave before she <b>pokes</b> <b>her</b> nose into this port again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bolly's fine. Sleek and fat and lazy! She's been in {{the fields}} ever since you left. Not a bridle on her. Many times have I seen <b>her</b> <b>poke</b> <b>her</b> black muzzle over the fence and look down the lane. She'd never forget you, Mescal." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was sitting}} on the staircase, <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> parasol through the balusters. [...] "You need not have taken that trouble, Mr. Jeff," [...] she said pleasantly. [...] "YOU are a part of this {{mountain}} picture at all times; but I am obliged to think of dress." ...|$|R
60|$|Soames was {{standing}} stubbornly still before his Alfred Stevens--the picture he loved best. He {{did not turn}} {{at the sound of}} the door, but she knew he had heard, and she knew he was hurt. She came up softly behind him, put her arms round his neck, and <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> face over his shoulder, till her cheek lay against his. It was an advance which had never yet failed, but it failed her now, and she augured the worst.|$|E
6000|$|The old Arab {{met them}} at the {{entrance}} to his tent. His eyes narrowed wickedly when they had appraised the newcomers. They stopped before him, exchanging greetings. They had come to trade for ivory they said. The Sheik grunted. He had no ivory. Meriem gasped. She knew that in a near-by hut the great tusks were piled almost to the roof. She <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> little head further forward {{to get a better view}} of the strangers. How white their skins! How yellow their great beards! ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Whitefoot said nothing, but led the {{way down}} the tree with Whitefoot meekly following. Then began a patient search all about. Mrs. Whitefoot {{appeared}} to know just what she wanted and turned up her nose at several places Whitefoot thought would make fine homes. She hardly glanced at a fine hollow log Whitefoot found. She merely <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> nose in at a splendid hole beneath the roots of an old stump. Whitefoot began to grow tired from running about and climbing stumps and trees and bushes.|$|E
50|$|The {{comic book}} opens with Rachel Summers <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> {{head out of}} the X-Mansion to grab the mail, only to be confronted with a horrible sight. The X-Men rush to the {{entrance}} to see that the mansion has somehow been transported to the middle of a barren desert.|$|R
5000|$|The Bee Girl {{from the}} Blind Melon video [...] "No Rain" [...] is tap dancing onstage. Guitarist Jim West <b>pokes</b> <b>her,</b> {{causing her to}} fall, while he replaces her and begins to play she tries to climb onto the stage again, but he uses his foot to push her off.|$|R
50|$|The android can {{recognize}} 400 Korean and English words, {{allowing it to}} respond to questions both verbally and through 15 facial expressions: EveR-1 will show displeasure if you <b>poke</b> <b>her.</b> The android also has motion data process sensors in its artificial eyes, enabling it to follow people with its eyes and head.|$|R
6000|$|Amy followed, but she <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> {{hands out}} stiffly before her, and jerked herself along {{as if she}} went by machinery, and her [...] "Ow!" [...] was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread burn {{as she watched the}} fun with interest. [...] "It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the {{audience}} laughs, don't blame me. Come on, Meg." ...|$|E
6000|$|Soames was {{standing}} stubbornly still before his Alfred Stevens--the picture he loved best. He {{did not turn}} {{at the sound of}} the door, but she knew he had heard, and she knew he was hurt. She came up softly behind him, put her arms round his neck, and <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> face over his shoulder till her cheek lay against his. It was an advance which had never yet failed, but it failed her now, and she augured the worst. [...] "Well," [...] he said stonily, [...] "so you've come!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had never}} been quite strong, quite herself, from the night of Mrs. Val's dance. The doctor who had {{attended}} her declared that her ducking in the river had given her cold: and that this, not having been duly checked, still hung about her. Then she had been taken to a physician in London, who <b>poked</b> <b>her</b> {{on the back and}} tapped her on the breast, listened to her lungs through a wooden pipe--such was the account which Katie gave herself when she returned home--and prescribed rum and milk and cod-liver oil, declaring, with an authoritative nod, that there was no organic disease--as yet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, most entirely, and I quite {{see that}} he is right---indeed I do, Gillian. People pretend to defer to a lady, but they really don't like <b>her</b> <b>poking</b> <b>her</b> nose in, and, after all, I could {{have no right to}} say anything. My only excuse for going was to take care of Fergus.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look at Ma,' whispered Lavinia to Bella {{when this}} was done, and they stood over the {{roasting}} fowls. 'If one was the most dutiful child in existence (of course on the whole one hopes one is), isn't she enough to make one want to <b>poke</b> <b>her</b> with something wooden, sitting there bolt upright in a corner?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{that any}} good {{reason why he}} should <b>poke</b> <b>her</b> new suit into the kitchen stove? Billy Booth is a jealous fool, and he makes his wife's life miserable. She's cried all the week about her suit. Oh, Anne, I wish I could write like you, believe ME. Wouldn't I score {{some of the men}} round here!" ...|$|R
