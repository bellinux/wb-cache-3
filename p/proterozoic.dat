5|$|The <b>Proterozoic</b> {{sedimentary}} formations of the Pahrump Group were {{deposited on}} these basement rocks. This occurred following uplift and erosion of any earlier sediments from the <b>Proterozoic</b> basement rocks. The Pahrump {{is composed of}} arkose conglomerate (quartz clasts in a concrete-like matrix) and mudstone in its lower part, followed by dolomite from carbonate banks topped by algal mats as stromatolites, and finished with basin-filling sediment derived from the above, including possible glacial till from the hypothesized Snowball Earth glaciation. The very youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are basaltic lava flows.|$|E
5|$|An angular {{unconformity}} truncates progressively older (lower) {{parts of the}} underlying Pahrump Group starting {{in the southern part}} of the area and moving north. At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the <b>Proterozoic</b> Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) than the rest of the formation.|$|E
5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late <b>Proterozoic</b> and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on {{the two halves of}} the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). Radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700million years for the metamorphism during the <b>Proterozoic.</b> About 1,400million years ago a mass of granite now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500million years of erosion.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains {{contains}} low-to-high-grade metamorphic rocks. Many of {{the rocks}} of the Blue Ridge {{appear to be the}} metamorphosed equivalents of <b>Proterozoic</b> and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Others are metamorphosed igneous rocks, including Corbin metagranite, Fort Mountain gneiss, varieties of mafic and ultramafic rocks, and the metavolcanic rocks of the Gold Belt.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism; the rock has been pressure-cooked. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally sedimentary and igneous rocks with large quantities of quartz and feldspar mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted schist and gneiss, making their original parentage almost unrecognizable. Radiometric dating gives an age of 1700 million years for the metamorphism, placing it in the early part of the <b>Proterozoic</b> eon.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{interior}} of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial magmatic activity around 58 million years ago in the Paleogene period. This comprises an outer ring of coarse granite and an inner core of finer grained granite, which was intruded later. This granite was intruded into the Late <b>Proterozoic</b> to Cambrian metasediments of the Dalradian Supergroup. Other Paleogene igneous rocks on Arran include extensive felsic and composite sills in the south of the island, and the central ring complex, an eroded caldera system surrounded by a near-continuous ring of granitic rocks.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka {{consists}} of four main types of geological formations— the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the <b>Proterozoic</b> non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. Significantly, about 60% {{of the state is}} composed of the Archean complex which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks. Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} <b>Proterozoic</b> sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the <b>Proterozoic</b> Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E
25|$|The Musgrave Block is {{flanked by}} several <b>Proterozoic</b> to Palaeozoic {{sedimentary}} basins, whose sedimentary history can elucidate the timing of tectonic events in the Musgrave Block post-1080 Ma. These include the <b>Proterozoic</b> Amadeus and Officer Basins.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} <b>Proterozoic</b> saw {{at least}} two Snowball Earths, so severe that {{the surface of the}} oceans may have been {{completely}} frozen. This happened about 716.5 and 635Ma, in the Cryogenian period. The intensity and mechanism of both glaciations are still under investigation and harder to explain than the early <b>Proterozoic</b> Snowball Earth.|$|E
25|$|No rocks {{earlier than}} the <b>Proterozoic</b> occur at surface within England.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{evolution}} of the Sun made it progressively more luminous during the Archean and <b>Proterozoic</b> eons; the Sun's luminosity increases 6% every billion years. As a result, the Earth began to receive more heat from the Sun in the <b>Proterozoic</b> eon. However, the Earth did not get warmer. Instead, the geological record suggests it cooled dramatically during the early <b>Proterozoic.</b> Glacial deposits found in South Africa date back to 2.2Ga, at which time, based on paleomagnetic evidence, {{they must have been}} located near the equator. Thus, this glaciation, known as the Huronian glaciation, may have been global. Some scientists suggest this was so severe that the Earth was frozen over from the poles to the equator, a hypothesis called Snowball Earth.|$|E
25|$|The primary defined {{divisions}} of time are eons, in sequence the Hadean, the Archean, the <b>Proterozoic</b> and the Phanerozoic.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Proterozoic</b> eon {{lasted from}} 2.5Ga to 542Ma (million years) ago. In this time span, cratons grew into continents with modern sizes. The change to an {{oxygen-rich}} atmosphere {{was a crucial}} development. Life developed from prokaryotes into eukaryotes and multicellular forms. The <b>Proterozoic</b> saw a couple of severe ice ages called snowball Earths. After the last Snowball Earth about 600Ma, the evolution of life on Earth accelerated. About 580Ma, the Ediacaran biota formed the prelude for the Cambrian Explosion.|$|E
25|$|Since the Late <b>Proterozoic</b> to Early Paleozoic, erosion {{has removed}} the {{volcanic}} peaks, exposing {{a number of}} relic volcanic pipes, such as Callander Bay and the Manitou Islands in Lake Nipissing.|$|E
25|$|The first-known glaciations {{occurred}} during the <b>Proterozoic,</b> one began shortly after {{the beginning of the}} eon, while there were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the Snowball Earth of the Varangian glaciation.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} these sediments were {{deposited}} the location {{was at least}} 3,000km from the Australian continent. Underneath there is no <b>Proterozoic</b> continental basement, instead these sediments are lying on top of oceanic crust.|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn Craton {{is bound}} {{on all sides}} by younger terranes of various ages, but {{predominantly}} of <b>Proterozoic</b> age. The boundaries between the various flanking terranes provide considerable evidence of the post-Archaean events which have involved the Yilgarn Craton.|$|E
25|$|Most soil is sand over clay, {{overlying}} Archean and <b>Proterozoic</b> granite of the Yilgarn Craton. At {{the eastern}} limits {{there is some}} calcareous soil overlying Eocene limestone. The region has a low, gently undulating topography, with somewhat occluded drainage, resulting {{in a series of}} playa lakes.|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn Craton is bounded on the east-south east by the ~1,300 Ma Albany-Fraser Orogen, {{composed}} {{primarily of}} amphibolite to greenschist facies sedimentary protolith gneisses, migmatites and granites. The Albany-Fraser Orogen displays both subduction-related and prolonged strike-slip tectonic structures and is intimately interconnected {{with the other}} <b>Proterozoic</b> basins and mobile belts of Australia.|$|E
25|$|A {{terminology}} {{has evolved}} covering {{the early years}} of the Earth's existence, as radiometric dating has allowed real dates to be assigned to specific formations and features. The Precambrian Supereon is divided into three eons: the Hadean (– Ma), Archean (- Ma) and <b>Proterozoic</b> (- Ma). See Timetable of the Precambrian.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the Earth, {{there have been times when}} continents {{collided}} and formed a supercontinent, which later broke up into new continents. About 1000 to 830Ma, most continental mass was united in the supercontinent Rodinia. Rodinia may have been preceded by Early-Middle <b>Proterozoic</b> continents called Nuna and Columbia.|$|E
25|$|The Zebra River Canyon {{area of the}} Kubis {{platform}} in the deeply dissected Zaris Mountains of south western Namibia provides an extremely well exposed example of the thrombolite-stromatolite-metazoan reefs that developed during the <b>Proterozoic</b> period, the stromatolites here being better developed in updip locations under conditions of higher current velocities and greater sediment influx.|$|E
25|$|Some erupted magmas contain <=45% silica {{and produce}} ultramafic lava. Ultramafic flows, {{also known as}} komatiites, are very rare; indeed, very few have been erupted at the Earth's surface since the <b>Proterozoic,</b> when the planet's heat flow was higher. They are (or were) the hottest lavas, and {{probably}} more fluid than common mafic lavas.|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn Craton {{is a large}} craton that {{constitutes}} {{the bulk of the}} Western Australian land mass. It is bounded by a mixture of sedimentary basins and <b>Proterozoic</b> fold and thrust belts. Zircon grains in the Jack Hills, Narryer Terrane have been dated at ~4.27 Ga, with one detrital zircon dated as old as 4.4 Ga.|$|E
25|$|The town of Cleve lies on {{an ancient}} bedrock that has {{undergone}} high grade metamorphism, {{with the area}} characterised by Schists, Gneisses and Granites in a formation known as the 'Hutchinson Group'. The area's strata was laid down in the <b>Proterozoic,</b> some 600-2300 million years ago. The area underwent deformation during the orogeny events that shaped Australia.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial {{occurrences of}} tranquillityite {{have been found}} in six localities in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, Western Australia in 2011. The Australian occurrences include a number of <b>Proterozoic</b> to Cambrian age diabase and gabbro dikes and sills. It occurs as {{interstitial}} grains with zirconolite, baddeleyite, and apatite associated with late stage intergrowths of quartz and feldspar.|$|E
25|$|Since Darwin's time, {{the fossil}} record has been {{extended}} to between 2.3 and 3.5billion years. Most of these Precambrian fossils are microscopic bacteria or microfossils. However, macroscopic fossils are now known from the late <b>Proterozoic.</b> The Ediacara biota (also called Vendian biota) dating from 575million years ago collectively constitutes a richly diverse assembly of early multicellular eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|Madison Limestone forms much of {{the surface}} rock through which the Missouri River flows at Holter Dam. The {{limestone}} is rich in fossils, mostly brachiopods like clams, mussels, and mollusks. Holter Lake sits atop the Eldorado thrust fault, which juxtaposes <b>Proterozoic</b> Belt Supergroup Greyson Shale over much younger Madison Limestone and {{is part of the}} Sevier orogeny.|$|E
25|$|On the {{southwest}} of the Yilgarn Craton the Balingup Gneiss Complex is situated inboard from the Early <b>Proterozoic</b> Leeuwin Complex of metamorphic rocks. The Balingup Complex consists primarily of metasedimentary paragneiss, granite orthogneiss, with minor layers of calc-silicate, ultramafic and ortho-amphibolite gneiss. The metamorphic grade {{is considered to be}} peak granulite facies, but the majority has preserved peak amphibolite facies assemblages.|$|E
25|$|The Tethyan Himalayan sequence, Greater Himalayan {{crystalline}} complex, and Lesser Himalayan sequence {{are grouped}} together as the North Indian sequence {{due to the}} overlapping age from <b>Proterozoic</b> to Phanerozoic. For Pre-collisional Himalaya, only the North Indian Sequence is of concern as the Sub-Himalayan sequence is a rock unit that was deposited {{at the same time}} as the India and Asia collision and the resulting mountain-building process.|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn Craton and {{its cover}} {{sequences}} are host {{to a significant}} percentage of the world's endowment in economically demonstrable and recoverable reserves (EDR) of uranium. Most uranium is hosted within palaeochannels derived from granites of the Yilgarn Craton and/or its flanking <b>Proterozoic</b> orogens, and this metal is deposited within Tertiary or younger palaeodrainage and current drainage systems. Examples include Yeelirrie, Mulga Rock and Lake Way-Centipede.|$|E
25|$|The Paleozoic ("old life") era was {{the first}} and longest era of the Phanerozoic eon, lasting from 542 to 251Ma. During the Paleozoic, many modern groups of life came into existence. Life colonized the land, first plants, then animals. Two major extinctions occurred. The continents formed at the {{break-up}} of Pannotia and Rodinia {{at the end of the}} <b>Proterozoic</b> slowly moved together again, forming the supercontinent Pangaea in the late Paleozoic.|$|E
25|$|The Alderley {{sandstones}} {{are described}} as classic redbed deposits. Redbeds are a distinctive sedimentary facies traditionally associated with non-marine depositional environments such as alluvial floodplains and arid deserts. They {{range in age from}} Early <b>Proterozoic</b> to Cenozoic and are regarded as geochemical indicators of oxidizing conditions. In the past there has been much debate whether these continental red beds are primary (formed during deposition) or diagenetic (post-depositional) in origin.|$|E
