5|$|Herm is only 1½miles long (north-south) {{and less}} than half a mile wide (east-west).

5|$|Augvald {{had set up}} {{his base}} in the {{north-eastern}} part of Karmøy, but the western <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> was still ruled by another king, Ferking.

What started as a friendly visit turned sour, and Augvald returned home with his men, leaving his daughters held captive at Ferkingstad.|$|E
5|$|Few dinosaur remains {{have been}} found in Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} of western Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, {{have been found}} in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in Scania, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, including those of dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea was part of the same land mass as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> is the only place in Denmark which has yielded dinosaur remains.|$|E

5|$|In 1449 Alexander, Lord of the Isles granted <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> to Torquil MacNeill of Taynish, the {{remainder}} being {{owned by the}} monks of Paisley. In 1493 the whole island came under MacNeill control and it remained in their hands, with various brief interludes, until the 19th century. This prize {{was by no means}} without its hazards. In 1530 the notorious pirate Ailean nan Sop murdered MacNeill of Taynish and numerous island residents. A dozen years later the title deeds were lost when eleven gentlemen of Gigha were slain by raiders.|$|E
