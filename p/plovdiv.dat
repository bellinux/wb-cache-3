5|$|Various {{institutions}} around Bulgaria {{have been}} named after Petar Parchevich, including streets in the capital Sofia and Shumen. A Catholic football club known as SK Parchevich was founded in <b>Plovdiv</b> in 1923 and later merged into what is today PFC Lokomotiv <b>Plovdiv.</b> One of the neighbourhoods of the mostly Catholic-populated town of Rakovski in <b>Plovdiv</b> Province {{is also known as}} Parchevich. In addition, three schools, in <b>Plovdiv,</b> Rakovski and Chiprovtsi, are named after him, as is a community centre (chitalishte) in the Banat Bulgarian village of Asenovo, Pleven Province. Parchevich Ridge in the Breznik Heights on Greenwich Island of the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, also bears his name thanks to the efforts of the Antarctic Place-names Commission of Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian forces {{commanded}} by Ivan the Russian managed {{to withstand the}} four-month siege of <b>Plovdiv</b> undertaken by Andronikos III Palaiologos, claimant to the Byzantine throne, and his Bulgarian ally Voysil, despot of Kopsis. In their attempts to capture the city, the Byzantines employed German specialists to construct a siege machine, from which they fired with crossbows at the Bulgarian defenders. Despite the elaborate siege tactics, {{by the summer of}} 1323 the Bulgarians had not only retained the city, but also launched raids on nearby Byzantine-held fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains, such as Stenimachos (modern Asenovgrad) and Tsepina. <b>Plovdiv</b> was lost, however, to the Byzantines soon thereafter. As Ivan's forces were leaving the city to meet the Bulgarian garrison that was to replace them, the pro-Byzantine inhabitants of <b>Plovdiv</b> opened the city gates and let a covert Byzantine detachment in.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's {{plans to}} send expeditionary forces against the Ostrogoths in Italy were {{repeatedly}} hampered by Thurisind's initiatives. For example, Narses' army left Constantinople in April 551 for Salona, with hopes of finally defeating the Goths, but found itself blocked at Philippopolis (<b>Plovdiv)</b> by the Kutrigurs.|$|E

5|$|After {{a two-month}} stay in Bucharest, Vasil Levski {{returned}} to Bulgaria {{for a second}} tour, lasting from 1 May to 26 August 1869. On this tour he carried proclamations printed in Romania by the political figure Ivan Kasabov. They legitimised Levski as the representative of a Bulgarian provisional government. Vasil Levski travelled to Nikopol, Pleven, Karlovo, <b>Plovdiv,</b> Pazardzhik, Perushtitsa, Stara Zagora, Chirpan, Sliven, Lovech, Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Sevlievo and Tryavna. According to some researchers, Levski established the earliest of his secret committees during this tour, but those assumptions are based on uncertain data.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{successful}} Bulgarian actions the Byzantines were no longer capable of taking the city with a direct assault. They also could not exhaust the defenders with hunger because, after their supplies were cut, the Byzantines themselves had to deal with that problem. In addition, an army led by Samuil marched into the mountains at the Byzantines' rear. In the meantime, instead of securing the way for retreat, Leon Melissenos pulled back to <b>Plovdiv.</b> That action was an additional reason for Basil II to lift the siege. The commander of the Western armies, Kontostephanos, persuaded him that Melissenos had set off to Constantinople to take his throne.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} campaign, Isbul and Malamir {{captured}} the Thracian fortresses of Probaton (near Adrianople, modern Edirne) and Bourdizon (modern Babaeski). After conquering these two fortresses, the Bulgarian troops reached Philippopolis (now <b>Plovdiv).</b> As the defence forces of the city had fled, Isbul and Malamir entered negotiations with the population in order to persuade them to cede the fortress. Pavlov is {{of the opinion that}} the war ended with a continuation of the peace of 815. He believes that Byzantine Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) was forced to make concessions to Bulgaria, which may have included the incorporation of Philippopolis and its close surroundings into the Bulgarian Empire.|$|E

5|$|Following the unification, from 6 to 8 September, Mutkurov was {{a member}} of the interim provincial {{government}} presided by the Commissar of South Bulgaria, Georgi Stranski. Mutkurov was one of the commanders of the Bulgarian Army in the Serbo–Bulgarian War of 1885 caused by the Kingdom of Serbia's disapproval of the Bulgarian unification. In the conflict, a Bulgarian victory that defended the revolution, Mutkurov headed the troops fighting at Tsaribrod on 13 November and was also in charge of the central and right wing forces during the Pirot Offensive on 14 and 15 November. After the war Mutkurov was appointed chief of the <b>Plovdiv</b> garrison and commanded the 5th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|In 986, Basil II led a {{campaign}} with 30,000 soldiers. The commanders {{of the eastern}} armies did not {{take part in the}} campaign because they were fighting with the Arabs. The Byzantines marched from Odrin via <b>Plovdiv</b> to reach Sredets (Sofia). According to Leo Diaconus the objective of their Emperor was to subdue the Bulgarians with one strike. After the capture of Serdica which was a strategic fortress between the northeastern and southwestern Bulgarian lands Basil II intended to continue his campaign towards Samuil's main strongholds in Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|Ivan the Russian {{rose to a}} high rank in the Bulgarian {{military}} {{in the wake of}} the accession of Michael Shishman to the throne. In 1323, he was in charge of the Bulgarian defence of <b>Plovdiv</b> during the prolonged and ultimately successful Byzantine siege of the city. In 1328, he was involved in a failed Bulgarian attempt to capture the Byzantine capital Constantinople from within. Probably taking part in the turbulent events that surrounded and followed Michael Shishman's death, Ivan the Russian was last mentioned as a representative of Ivan Alexander in 1332.|$|E

5|$|Macedonia {{during the}} reign of Philip II was at first preoccupied by wars with marauding Illyrians and Thracians. Chief among Philip's Thracian enemies was the ruler Kersebleptes, who may have coordinated a {{temporary}} alliance with Athens. In a series of campaigns stretching from 356 to 340 BC, Philip II managed to ultimately subjugate Kersebleptes as a tributary vassal, conquering much of Thrace in the process and founding new cities there such as Philippi (modern Filippoi, Greece) and Philippopolis (modern <b>Plovdiv,</b> Bulgaria). Philip II also fought against the Illyrian king Bardylis, who threatened Macedonia proper, and against Grabos and Pleuratus in Illyria (centred in modern-day Albania).|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{streets and}} squares {{both inside and}} outside Armenia, {{including}} in Córdoba, Argentina, <b>Plovdiv</b> and Varna in Bulgaria, Meudon, Paris and a section of Connecticut Route 314 state highway running entirely within Wethersfield, Connecticut are named after Andranik. General Andranik Station of the Yerevan Metro was opened in 1989 as Hoktemberyan Station and was renamed for Andranik in 1992. In 1995, General Andranik's Museum was founded in Komitas Park of Yerevan, but was soon closed because the building was privatized. It was reopened on 16 September 2006, by Ilyich Beglarian as the Museum of Armenian Fedayi Movement, named after Andranik.|$|E
5|$|Rejecting the {{emigrant}} detachment {{strategy for}} internal propaganda, Levski undertook his first {{tour of the}} Bulgarian lands to engage all layers of Bulgarian society for a successful revolution. On 11 December 1868, he travelled by steamship from Turnu Măgurele to Istanbul, {{the starting point of}} a trek that lasted until 24 February 1869, when Levski returned to Romania. During this canvassing and reconnaissance mission, Levski is thought to have visited <b>Plovdiv,</b> Perushtitsa, Karlovo, Sopot, Kazanlak, Sliven, Tarnovo, Lovech, Pleven and Nikopol, establishing links with local patriots.|$|E

5|$|In 1341–1347 the Byzantine Empire was {{plunged into}} a {{protracted}} civil war between the regency for Emperor John V Palaiologos under Anna of Savoy and his intended guardian John VI Kantakouzenos. The neighbours of the Byzantines {{took advantage of the}} civil war, and while Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia sided with John VI Kantakouzenos, Ivan Alexander backed John V Palaiologos and his regency. Although the two Balkan rulers picked opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war, they maintained their alliance with each other. As the price for Ivan Alexander's support, the regency for John V Palaiologos ceded him the city of Philippopolis (<b>Plovdiv)</b> and nine important fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains in 1344. This peaceful turnover constituted the last major success of Ivan Alexander's foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1863, Levski {{returned}} to Bulgarian lands after a brief stay in Romania. His uncle Basil reported him as a rebel to the Ottoman authorities, and Levski was imprisoned in <b>Plovdiv</b> for three months, but released due to {{the help of the}} doctor R. Petrov and the Russian vice-consul Nayden Gerov. On Easter 1864, Levski officially relinquished his religious office. From May 1864 until March 1866, he worked as a teacher in Voynyagovo near Karlovo; while there, he supported and gave shelter to persecuted Bulgarians and organised patriotic groups among the population. His activity caused suspicion among the Ottoman authorities, and he was forced to move. From {{the spring of}} 1866 to the spring of 1867 he taught in Enikyoy and Kongas, two Northern Dobruja villages near Tulcea.|$|E
5|$|Medieval frescoes used {{to cover}} the {{entirety}} of the church's interior, though only some 70 fragments survive until today. Until 1961, the existence of a medieval mural layer was unknown because the walls were covered with oil paint in the 1910s. The medieval frescoes were uncovered and restored between 1970 and 1975 by a team under Dragomir Peshev. The dating of the frescoes is as controversial as that of the church itself. Bozhkov places the painting of the murals in the 12th century, while scholars Bistra Nikolova and V. Mavrodinova believe they were created in the 13th century. According to Nikolova, the mural inscriptions in Medieval Greek (as opposed to Middle Bulgarian) are evidence that the frescoes were painted during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria (1018–1185). At the time, the region of Patalenitsa would have belonged to the Byzantine bishopric centred at Philippopolis (modern <b>Plovdiv).</b>|$|E

5|$|Michael Shishman's {{accession}} to the Bulgarian throne in 1323 meant that Ivan the Russian assumed an elite {{rank in the}} Bulgarian military hierarchy. Pavlov theorizes that he became protostrator, a title borrowed from Byzantium. The title was held by the second-in-command {{of the army and}} was approximate to the Western marshal. In the same year, Ivan was dispatched to the city of <b>Plovdiv</b> (Philippopolis) which had been recently conquered by Bulgaria after decades of Byzantine rule. With a one-thousand-strong cavalry force of Alans, Bulgarians and possibly Hungarians and two thousand infantrymen, Ivan was to defend the city from Byzantine raids. In that task he was assisted by his deputy Inas and the Alan chieftains Itil and Temir. At the time, Ivan was already well-known even in Byzantium as a military commander.|$|E
5|$|Samuel's {{decision}} to face Basil II and {{the bulk of}} his army at Kleidion was not only prompted by the constant defeats and invasions which had devastated the country, but also by concerns over his authority among the nobility, which had been fatally weakened by Basil's campaigns. In 1005 for example, the governor of the important Adriatic port of Dyrrhachium had surrendered the town to Basil II. To face this threat, Samuel gathered a large army to face the Byzantines, some claiming it numbered as many as 45,000 soldiers. Basil II also prepared carefully, assembling a large army of his own and taking his most experienced commanders, including the governor of Philippopolis (modern <b>Plovdiv),</b> Nicephorus Xiphias, who had conquered the old Bulgarian capitals Pliska and Preslav from Samuel in 1001.|$|E
5|$|Sava Mutkurov {{also played}} an {{important}} part in the turbulent events of 1886. In the wake of a pro-Russian coup d'état aiming to dethrone Prince Alexander, Mutkurov and Stefan Stambolov organized a counter-coup which was widely supported by the population. Mutkurov was appointed by Stambolov as the commander-in-chief of the troops loyal to Prince Alexander, and soldiers from his <b>Plovdiv</b> garrison were transferred to the capital Sofia to arrest or drive out the plotters. The events nevertheless led to Prince Alexander's abdication on 7 September 1886 under Russian pressure. Until the election of another Bulgarian monarch, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe–Coburg and Gotha, on 14 August 1887, Mutkurov was one of the three regents of Bulgaria, along with Stambolov and Petko Karavelov (soon replaced by Georgi Zhivkov). He was also part of the delegation that welcomed the new prince as he arrived in Svishtov to assume the throne.|$|E
