40|$|The {{synchronization}} {{between two}} electrical motors (master and slave) is studied. To reduce {{the costs of}} the master}slave combination, the slave motor is mounted with a very low-resolution encoder (one pulse per revolution). Since the position measurements are asynchronous in time, standard control and analysis techniques are not applicable. Two methods are proposed to deal with these cheap, low-resolution encoders: the hybrid and the asynchronous control scheme. The presented controllers are successfully tested on a real industrial master-multi-slave system as is used for <b>mailing</b> <b>machines.</b> (1999 Elsevier Science ‚td. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|Explanation: Spread of {{information}} has become viral today, {{because of the}} Internet. This also means that false news or rumors can spread speedily through social networking sites or emails. Being involved in the circulation of incorrect information is unethical.

Direct or indirect involvement in the circulation of false information is ethically wrong. Giving wrong information can hurt other parties or organizations that are affected by that particular theme.|$|R
