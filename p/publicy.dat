5000|$|Edward Łazikowski (born January 22, 1939, in Bąków Górny Poland) is a Polish {{artist whose}} work {{includes}} drawing, painting, photography, sculpture, installation art, performance art and art theory. Łazikowski {{graduated from the}} Strzemiński Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Łódź. He presents his artistic and theoretical achievements <b>publicy</b> in individual exhibitions and taking part in collective shows in galleries and museums, poblishing catalogues and articles in various magazines, and giving interview. Initially, he went in for painting (in the 1960s), then in the mid-1970s took interest in [...] "actions" [...] and photography (mainly documentary), and in the late 1970s and early 1980s performance art. Later on he created [...] "objects" [...] (sculptures): small constructions made of wood, string and fabric, which in time became larger, and sometimes became installations. An important part of his creative process is drawing, divided by the artist into three categories: free, working and note. Starting from the 1990s, he introduced a series of works called Fragtors. The term, coined by Łazikowski, and precisely described in his theoretical work Fragtoryzacja świata (Fragtorisation of the World), {{became the basis for}} artist's present plastic activities. In his theoretical and constructive works Łazikowski tries to combine discovering reality (science) with creating it (art). Łazikowski describes his aim as to carry out the [...] "spiritualisation of his corporality (but not of the corpse), and corporalisation of his spirituality (but not of the spirit)." [...] He sometimes exhibits his works outside galleries, at places unrelated to arts, not promoted by media and advertising campaigns; often outside the [...] "field" [...] of art.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{begins by}} looking at the growing {{popularity}} of “podcasting ” as yet another manifestation of Walter Ong’s secondary orality. I also consider podcasting in relation to the work of McLuhan and other medium theorists. In the tradition of the beat poet, the DJ, and most recently the blogger, podcasting recasts the personal experience (the “phenomenological feel”), as well as the actual perspectives and preferences accessible to people on-the-fly via digital storage and playback of audio content. Podcasting certainly seems to blur notions of “public ” and “private ” in unprecedented ways, and a recent concept dubbed “publicy ” (privacy that occurs under the intense acceleration of instantaneous communications) accounts for this. While the podcast may be the latest and perhaps purest form of <b>publicy,</b> is <b>publicy</b> itself really anything new, or is it just a new form of orality (ie. secondary orality) that recasts us all as witness/participants to the chants and decrees of the iconoclast, village elder, and cultural mystic? I argue that podcast consumption, itself the product of complex cognitive and cultural processes, is consequential to its reconfigurations of our everyday soundscapes and the personal experiences bound up in them.

40|$|The recent {{production}} of population-scale genomic data offers an unprecedented opportunity {{to understand how}} natural selection has shaped human phenotypic variation within populations. To identify signatures of recent positive selection in Sardinia, we used 23 million single nucleotide polymorphisms from low-coverage whole genomes of 3, 514 Sardinians along with data from the 1000 Genomes project. Using single-population (iHS, nSL) and cross-population (Fst, PBS, XP-EHH) based statistics, we found many genetic regions showing evidence of positive selection. We found that selection statistics computed for outlier variants cannot be explained by neutral forces alone. By intersecting genome-wide association study data for hundreds of traits measured in Sardinians with <b>publicy</b> available functional genomic databases, we found that autoimmunity-related genes are enriched for these putatively adaptive variants. Taken together, these results illustrate the importance of characterizing the phenotypic variation within a population, and especially the utility of whole-genome-sequence data, when proposing and interpreting genetic signatures of positive selection...|$|E

40|$|As {{a central}} feature of every ceremony, Nepali shamans (jh[reverse congruent]akris) <b>publicy</b> recite lengthy oral texts, whose meticulous {{memorization}} constitutes {{the core of}} shamanic training. These texts include passages that explain the origins of diseases and afflictions, and provide elaborate instructions for their alleviation. Through a discursive analysis of key passages, I demonstrate that shamans possess a coherent etiology of affliction. These concepts are articulated as integrated parts of the treatments that shamans perform. Rather than attributing all afflictions to ambigous otherworldly causes, these shamanic etiologies identify precise sources and effects that cover a spectrum ranging from the purely physical to the purely metaphysical, intersecting the natural and supernatural worlds. Patients and the public are repeatedly instructed in this unambiguous system of affliction in every diagnostic and healing session, since these ceremonies always incorporate recitations of the relevant texts. Accessible to non-specialists, the system conveyed by these recitations acts to validate shamanic intervention as a significant and intelligible activity. Using their oral texts, shamans effectively reproduce worlds that require shamanic interventions. shamans (Nepal) etiology ritual discourse traditional healing...|$|E
40|$|Dramatic {{advances}} in life expectancy mean that today's retirees must plan on living into their eighties, their nineties, and even beyond. Longer life expectancies are {{the symbol of}} a prosperous society, but this progress also means that some retirees will need to plan conservatively and cut back substantially on their living standards or risk living so long that they exhaust their resources. This book examines the role that life annuities can play in helping people protect themselves against such outcomes. A life annuity is an insurance product that pays out a periodic amount {{for as long as}} the annuitant is alive, in exchange for a premium. The book begins with a history of life annuity markets during the twentieth century in the United States and elsewhere. It then explores recent trends in annuity pricing and money's worth, as well as the economic value generated for purchasers of these products. The book explains the potential importance of inflation-protected annuities and stock-market-linked variable annuities in providing more complete retirement security.

40|$|Background: Advances in second-generation {{sequencing}} of RNA made a near-complete characterization of transcriptomes affordable. However, {{the reconstruction of}} full-length mRNAs via de novo RNA-seq assembly is still difficult due {{to the complexity of}} eukaryote transcriptomes with highly similar paralogs and multiple alternative splice variants. Here, we present FRAMA, a genome-independent annotation tool for de novo mRNA assemblies that addresses several post-assembly tasks, such as reduction of contig redundancy, ortholog assignment, correction of misassembled transcripts, scaffolding of fragmented transcripts and coding sequence identification. Results: We applied FRAMA to assemble and annotate the transcriptome of the naked mole-rat and assess the quality of the obtained compilation of transcripts with the aid of <b>publicy</b> available naked mole-rat gene annotations. Based on a de novo transcriptome assembly (Trinity), FRAMA annotated 21, 984 naked mole-rat mRNAs (12, 100 full-length CDSs), corresponding to 16, 887 genes. The scaffolding of 3488 genes increased the median sequence information 1. 27 -fold. In total, FRAMA detected and corrected 4774 misassembled genes, which were predominantly caused by fusion of genes. A comparison with three different sources of naked mole-rat transcripts reveals that FRAMA’s gene models are better supported by RNA-seq data than any other transcript set. Further, our results demonstrate the competitiveness of FRAMA to state of the art genome-based transcript reconstruction approaches. Conclusion: FRAMA realizes the de novo construction of a low-redundant transcript catalog for eukaryotes, including the extension and refinement of transcripts. Thereby, results delivered by FRAMA provide the basis for comprehensive downstream analyses like gene expression studies or comparative transcriptomics. FRAMA is available a...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Further {{advances}} in modern microscopy are leading to teravoxel-sized tiled 3 D images at high resolution, thus increasing {{the dimension of}} the stitching problem {{of at least two}} orders of magnitude. The existing software solutions do not seem adequate to address the additional requirements arising from these datasets, such as the minimization of memory usage and the need to process just a small portion of data. Results We propose a free and fully automated 3 D Stitching tool designed to match the special requirements coming out of teravoxel-sized tiled microscopy images that is able to stitch them in a reasonable time even on workstations with limited resources. The tool was tested on teravoxel-sized whole mouse brain images with micrometer resolution and it was also compared with the state-of-the-art stitching tools on megavoxel-sized <b>publicy</b> available datasets. This comparison confirmed that the solutions we adopted are suited for stitching very large images and also perform well on datasets with different characteristics. Indeed, some of the algorithms embedded in other stitching tools could be easily integrated in our framework if {{they turned out to be}} more effective on other classes of images. To this purpose, we designed a software architecture which separates the strategies that use efficiently memory resources from the algorithms which may depend on the characteristics of the acquired images. Conclusions TeraStitcher is a free tool that enables the stitching of Teravoxel-sized tiled microscopy images even on workstations with relatively limited resources of memory (< 8 GB) and processing power. It exploits the knowledge of approximate tile positions and uses ad-hoc strategies and algorithms designed for such very large datasets. The produced images can be saved into a multiresolution representation to be efficiently retrieved and processed. We provide TeraStitcher both as standalone application and as plugin of the free software Vaa 3 D. </p...|$|E
