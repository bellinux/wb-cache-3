That same year she was given her own column in Teachers' World, entitled [...] "From my Window". Three years later she began contributing a weekly page in the magazine, in which she published letters from her fox terrier dog Bobs. They proved to be so popular that in 1933 they were published in book form as Letters from Bobs, and sold ten thousand copies in the first week. Her most popular feature was [...] "Round the Year with Enid Blyton", which consisted of forty-eight articles covering aspects of natural history such as weather, <b>pond</b> <b>life,</b> how to plant a school garden {{and how to make}} a bird table.

2500|$|South Pond is {{the second}} oldest {{structure}} in Midhurst, second only to St. Ann's Castle: it {{is thought to have}} been dammed in the early 12th century as a fish-pond for the Castle. [...] To the west the South Mill was in existence by 1284, and used initially to grind corn. In 1634 it was converted to a fulling mill, and in the mid-1800s it was converted again to leather production. The pond is prone to silting due to its underlying greensand geology, and has in recent years become polluted and lifeless, in large part due to over-population of ducks as a result of artificial feeding. The South Pond Group was established in 2012 to conserve and develop the area around the South Pond as a wildlife corridor. [...] Activities include clearance parties, water quality monitoring, newsletters, talks and maintaining notice and interpretation boards.

40|$|Ecological risk {{assessments}} employ mathematical fate and transport models to estimate pesticide {{concentrations in the}} environment. Results are highly based upon input data, yet the sensitivity of such models to specific parameters is unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the sensitivity of one such model, TPQPond (Haith, 2010), a model of pesticide runoff and subsequent accumulation in a receiving pond from various types of grass surfaces. The analysis was based on one-in- 10 year maximum pond concentrations of 38 different pesticides from 100 year simulations. The simulations were conducted for nine geographic locations and three golf course surface types. These concentrations are then compared to toxicity endpoints of target species (invertebrates, fish, plants, and algae). Seven input parameters were modified in order to create a range of values over which calculated risk quotients could be compared to the original values. It was determined that the model was most sensitive to changes in pond depth and turf organic carbon content. It was moderately sensitive to <b>pond</b> half <b>life</b> and turf organic carbon content values and mildly sensitive to changes in the application dates. Changes in values for minimum pond volume did not affect the calculated risk quotients, and, due to the high carbon content, both high and low modification of total suspended solids led to decreases in risk quotients. Based on these findings, it is important to choose values for input parameters carefully for a given risk assessment as small changes in parameter values that the model is sensitive to can have significant impacts on the results of the assessment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The pond smelt (Hypomesus olidus) has {{a limited}} North American distribution, being {{restricted}} {{to the west coast}} of Alaska and the drainage of the lower Mackenzie River, N. W. T. This study examined an isolated population in a small tundra lake on the Yukon coastal plain. Otolith interpretation revealed that most adult fish sampled in Lake 100 were age 4 + and 5 + years, but a few individuals lived to age 8 + and 9 +. Full maturity was not reached until age 5 + and repeat spawning was common. The sex ratio was skewed in favour of females. Growth was found to be slower in the Yukon population than in Alaskan and Japanese lakes. Some stunting was evident in Lake 100 pond smelt, but otherwise their meristic and morphometric characteristics corresponded with those from elsewhere. The pond smelt were primarily planktivorous in Lake 100 and there appeared to be no significant predation on them, but in the Mackenzie delta and elsewhere they are utilized as a forage species.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 This thesis {{documents}} the work carried out investigating the downstream processing of algal biomass for biofuel production.

A laboratory experiment was conducted which investigated the potential of using a dilute acid pretreatment followed by phospholipase and cellulase enzymes to simultaneously separate cells into their useful components. It was successfully demonstrated that cells can be degraded in this fashion and that the sugars produced were fermentable. Another investigation aimed at exploring the potential use of rapid sand filters as a first filtering and concentration step for dilute algae growth cultures such as those grown in open <b>ponds.</b> Finally, an <b>life</b> cycle inventory was compiled for a process which simultaneously produces biodiesel and bioethanol utilizing algae biomass as a feedstock.
