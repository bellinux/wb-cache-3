5|$|Apex Hides the Hurt is a 2006 {{novel by}} American author Colson Whitehead. The novel follows an unnamed {{nomenclature}} consultant who {{is asked to}} visit the town of Winthrop, which, rather conveniently for the nomenclature consultant, is considering changing its name.

5|$|Allingham {{wanted to}} join the war effort in August 1914 as a {{despatch}} rider, but his critically ill mother managed to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> {{to stay at home}} and look after her. However, after his mother died in 1915, aged 42, Allingham enlisted with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). He became formally rated as an Air Mechanic Second Class on 21 September 1915, and was posted to Chingford before completing his training at Sheerness, Kent.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E
5|$|In {{planning}} for Apollo 8, {{one of the}} responsibilities Kraft faced was ensuring that a fleet would be waiting to recover the crew when they splashed {{down at the end}} of the mission. This proved an unusual challenge, because much of the Pacific fleet of the US Navy would be on leave over the Christmas and New Year's Eve period. Kraft had to personally meet with Admiral John McCain in order to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to make the requisite resources available to NASA.|$|E
5|$|Krüger hid at {{his home}} until November 1946 when he handed himself over to the British authorities. Forging an enemy's {{currency}} was not a war crime; he faced no charges. He was detained until early 1947 when he was {{handed over to the}} French. They attempted to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to forge passports for them, but he refused; he was released in November 1948. He underwent a denazification process, during which statements were produced from the forger-inmates whose lives he had been responsible for saving. He later worked for the Hahnemühle paper company. In 1965 the East German writer Julius Mader published , an attack on the West German government for harbouring Krüger.|$|E

5|$|The soundtrack to Game of Thrones was {{originally}} to be composed by Stephen Warbeck. On February 2, 2011, only ten {{weeks prior to}} the show's premiere, {{it was reported that}} Warbeck had left the project and Ramin Djawadi had been commissioned to write the music instead. The music supervisor of Game Of Thrones Evyen Klean first suggested Djawadi to showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss as the replacement for Warbeck, and although Djawadi was reluctant as he had other commitments at that time, they managed to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to accept the project.|$|E
5|$|After {{mourning}} her death, Jude {{leads the}} party to meet Maxwell and attempts to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to dispel the barrier and save Elympios. Reunited with Milla, who has been reborn as a spirit, they convince Maxwell of their cause. However, Gaius and the spirit named Muzét seal Maxwell within the Lance of Kresnik, intent on sustaining the barrier until all spyrixs are destroyed; Maxwell sends {{the party to}} Elympios before he is completely subdued. There, the party learns about Elympios' dependence on spyrix and an ongoing research on spyrite, a power source harmless to spirits. With renewed conviction, the party confronts and defeats Gaius and Muzét. Maxwell dispels the barrier and disperses its energy to temporarily power spyrixes until the completion of spyrites. The party returns to their daily lives with Jude joining a spyrite research team, Milla resuming her role as Maxwell, and Gaius uniting Rieze Maxia under his rule.|$|E

He studied at the University of St Andrews and was a protégé of Dr. John Adamson who also <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to become a photographer. At age 14, he was apprenticed to Dr. James, a local chemist and druggist, whilst {{studying}} at Madras College. Adamson later taught him the calotype process which he had earlier taught his famous brother, Robert Adamson. Adamson <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to assist Lord Kinnaird in his calotype studio at Rossie Priory.

5|$|Anselm stuck {{firmly to}} {{the letter of the}} papal decree, despite Henry's {{attempts}} to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to give way in return for a vague assurance of a future royal compromise. Matters escalated, with Anselm going back into exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution. A distinction was drawn between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained the custom of requiring them to come and do homage for the temporalities, the landed properties they held in England. Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.|$|E
5|$|Around 21:30 on August 14, Hatanaka's rebels {{set their}} plan into motion. The Second Regiment of the First Imperial Guards {{had entered the}} palace grounds, {{doubling}} {{the strength of the}} battalion already stationed there, presumably to provide extra protection against Hatanaka's rebellion. But Hatanaka, along with Lt.Col. Jirō Shiizaki, convinced the commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, Colonel Toyojirō Haga, of their cause, by telling him (falsely) that Generals Anami and Umezu, and the commanders of the Eastern District Army and Imperial Guards Divisions were all in on the plan. Hatanaka also went to the office of Shizuichi Tanaka, commander of the Eastern region of the army, to try to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to join the coup. Tanaka refused, and ordered Hatanaka to go home. Hatanaka ignored the order.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as he}} was set free, Theodore {{returned}} to Thessalonica. Lacking any escort or followers, he disguised himself as a beggar in order to enter the city in secret. There he contacted old supporters and favourites, and organized a conspiracy that soon ousted Manuel and took over the city. As Byzantine custom barred him from re-assuming the imperial office due to his blinding, Theodore installed his son John Komnenos Doukas (r. 1237–44) as emperor (without a coronation ceremony), but remained the real ruler of the empire in his son's name. John himself appears to have been mostly interested in religion, and more inclined to enter a monastery than to become emperor. Theodore had to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> that being named emperor was a God-given gift, and that he was indeed the rightful Emperor of the Romans due to his imperial descent.|$|E

5|$|During this period, neither William nor Robert {{seems to}} have trusted Henry. Waiting until the {{rebellion}} against William Rufus was safely over, Henry returned to England in July 1088. He met with the King {{but was unable to}} <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to grant him their mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn. While he had been away, however, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, who regarded Henry as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that Henry was conspiring against the duke with William Rufus. On landing, Odo seized Henry and imprisoned him in Neuilly-la-Forêt, and Robert took back the county of the Cotentin. Henry was held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.|$|E
5|$|He was accepted, and {{although}} his appointment delighted Murray, {{the government was}} very concerned {{at the loss of}} a good Attorney General. In an attempt to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of class, {{kindergarten}} teacher Rebecca Adler (Robin Tunney) becomes dysphasic, falls to the floor, and experiences seizures. Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because the cases are usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.|$|E

5|$|The Life of Basil the Younger on {{the other}} hand reports a {{slightly}} different version, according to which the summons to Doukas were undertaken by the entire regency council, which proposed to Doukas to assume the governance of the state while Constantine VII would be limited to his ceremonial duties. According to this source, the proposal met with refusal from Doukas, and the regents had to send a second letter with their own enkolpia to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> otherwise. By the time he entered Constantinople, however, the regents had changed their minds and barricaded the palace against him. After his proclamation at the Hippodrome, Doukas resolved to besiege the palace, but finally tried to enter through the Chalke, while ordering his followers not to draw their swords so as to avoid bloodshed. There he was ambushed by archers placed by the regents, and killed along with a number of his followers.|$|E
5|$|Another effort {{involving}} the plan came about after Milošević asked the United States to stop an imminent Croatian {{attack against the}} RSK on 30 July. Although in his request he indicated that negotiations should be held based on the Z-4 Plan, he refused to meet Galbraith (who wanted Milošević to pressure the RSK into accepting it) on 2 August. Instead, Galbraith met Babić in Belgrade {{in an effort to}} <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to accept the plan. He told Babić that the RSK could not expect international sympathy because of its involvement in the Siege of Bihać, and they would have to accept Croatian terms to avoid war. As an alternative, Galbraith advised Babić to accept negotiations based on the Z-4 Plan. Babić complied, and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK delegations to talks on 3 August. Genthod, near Geneva, was selected as the location to avoid media attention. The RSK delegation was headed by Major General Mile Novaković of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina and the Croatian delegation was headed by Tuđman's advisor, Ivić Pašalić.|$|E
5|$|Athens had {{recently}} become a democracy, overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias. In their fight {{to establish the}} democracy, the Athenians had asked the Persians for aid (which {{was not in the}} end needed), in return for submitting to Persian overlordship. Some years later, Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens, assisted by the Spartans. This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes, and tried to <b>persuade</b> <b>him</b> to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians had baulked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Since they were already an enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
