5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity <b>portfolio</b> <b>will</b> be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigate}} how a firm's corporate strategic action portfolios, defined as bundles of key corporate strategic actions, relate to deregulatory and technological changes, and to firm performance.

I also hypothesize that the nature of a firm's corporate strategic action <b>portfolios</b> <b>will</b> be different depending on whether the changes are due to deregulation or technology. After establishing the relationship between environmental changes and a firm's corporate strategic action portfolios, this study measures the relationship between a firm's corporate strategic action portfolios and firm performance. All else being equal, it is hypothesized that a firm with higher levels of frequency and variety on corporate strategic action <b>portfolios</b> <b>will</b> perform better.

50|$|The {{investments}} in a <b>portfolio</b> <b>will</b> perform {{according to the}} market. As time goes on, a portfolio's current asset allocation will drift away from an investor's original target asset allocation (i.e., their preferred level of risk exposure). If left unadjusted, the <b>portfolio</b> <b>will</b> either become too risky, or too conservative. If it becomes too risky, that will tend to increase long-term returns, which is desirable. But when the excessive risks {{show up in the}} short term, the investor might have a tendency to do the worst possible thing at the worst possible time (i.e., sell at the bottom), thus dramatically diminishing their ending wealth. If the portfolio is allowed to drift to a too conservative status, then excessive short-term risk is less likely, which is desirable. However, long-term returns would also tend to be lower than desired. It is best to maintain a portfolio's risk profile reasonably close to an investor's level of risk tolerance.|$|E
