40|$|Lake Champlain, {{located between}} Vermont, New York, and Quebec {{exhibits}} eutrophication mainly due to continuing phosphorus (P) losses from upstream nonpoint source areas. Several {{state and local}} agencies have initiated efforts aimed at assessing and identifying critical sources areas for P loss. To augment these efforts, accounting of farm P inputs (in <b>purchased</b> <b>animal</b> feed and fertilizers) and P outputs (in milk, meat, or off-farm sales of harvested crops or other products) is needed {{as a means of}} determining potential P build-up in farm soils. When farm P inputs exceed P outputs, P surplus occurs on the farm. This leads to potential soil-P accumulations and risk of P loss in runoff, negatively impacting the quality of receiving water bodies. In this study, a combination of farm record data and a model-based approach, using the Integrated Farming System Model (IFSM), was used to estimate farm P inputs and outputs, identify root causes of farm P imbalances, and explore viable P balancing strategies. Three Vermont dairy farms with varying farm systems (grass-based organic farm, fully confined farm, and a mixed system farm with high-producing confined dairy cows and grazing heifers) were studied. These farms were found to have P surpluses ranging from 5. 5 Â kg/ha to 18. 7 Â kg/ha on annual basis. This study also identified critical causes of P imbalances for each farm and suggested farm specific alternative strategies needed to address the P imbalances. By balancing farm P inputs and outputs, potential accumulation of soil-P can be prevented. As a result, maximum benefits can be obtained from land treatment measures implemented to control off-field P loss without the additional concern of continuing P build-up that could reduce their effectiveness.

40|$|Wildlife is an {{important}} source of protein for many people in developing countries. Yet wildlife depletion due to overexploitation is common throughout the humid tropics and its effect on protein security, especially for vulnerable households, is poorly understood. This is problematic for both sustainable rural development and conservation management. This study investigates a key dimension of protein security in a cash-crop farming community living in a wildlife-depleted farm-forest landscape in SW Ghana, a region where protein-energy malnutrition persists. Specifically, we monitored protein sufficiency, defined as whether consumption met daily requirements, as benchmarked by recommended daily allowance (RDA). We focus on whether more vulnerable households {{were less likely to be}} able to meet their protein needs, where vulnerability was defined by wealth, agricultural season and gender of the household head. Our central hypothesis was: (a) vulnerable households are less likely to consume sufficient protein. In the context that most plant proteins were home-produced, so likely relatively accessible to all households, while most animal proteins were purchased, so likely less accessible to vulnerable households, we tested two further hypotheses: (b) vulnerable households depend more on plant protein to cover their protein needs; and (c) vulnerable households are less likely to earn sufficient cash income to meet their protein needs through <b>purchased</b> <b>animal</b> sources. Between 14 % and 60 % of households (depending on plant protein content assumptions) consumed less than the RDA for protein, but neither protein consumption nor protein sufficiency co-varied with household vulnerability. Fish, livestock and food crops comprised 85 % of total protein intake and strongly affected protein sufficiency. However, bushmeat remained {{an important}} protein source (15 % of total consumption), especially during the post-harvest season when it averaged 26 % of total protein consumption. Across the year, 89 % of households experienced at least one occasion when they had insufficient income to cover their protein needs through animal protein purchases. The extent of this income shortage was highest during the lean season and among poorer households. These findings indicate that despite wildlife depletion, bushmeat continues to make a substantial contribution to protein consumption, especially during the agricultural lean season. Income shortages among farmers limit their ability to purchase bushmeat or its substitutes, suggesting that wildlife depletion may cause malnutrition...|$|E
40|$|In animal ethics, some ethicists such as Peter Singer {{argue that}} {{we ought not to}} <b>purchase</b> <b>animal</b> {{products}} because doing so causally contributes to unnecessary suffering. Others, such as Russ Shafer-Landau, counter that where such unnecessary suffering is not causally dependent on one’s causal contributions, there is no duty to refrain from <b>purchasing</b> <b>animal</b> products, even if the process by which those products are produced is morally abhorrent. I argue that {{there are at least two}} plausible principles which ground the wrongness of <b>purchasing</b> <b>animal</b> products produced by morally abhorrent means. First, respect for the wishes and dignity of animals who have been wrongly tortured and killed requires treating their losses as losses, and not exploiting the ‘spoils’ of their losses.

40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to estimate seroprevalence and to identify flock-level factors associated with seropositivity to brucellosis in small ruminants in Kerman province, southeastern Iran. In October-November 2011, serum samples were randomly collected from 1767 sheep and 1233 goats, older than 18 months, from 300 flocks. The sera were initially screened for the presence of anti-Brucella antibodies using the Rose-Bengal test; those found to be positive were then examined by Wright and 2 -mercaptoethanol Brucella agglutination tests. A questionnaire was used to collect data on flock-level factors likely associated with the within flock seroprevalence of brucellosis. The associations were statistically evaluated for significance in multivariable logistic models. Sixty three flocks (21. 00 %; 95 % CI: 16. 80 - 26. 60) had at least one seropositive animal. The mean within-flock seroprevalence was 3. 10 % (95 % CI: 2. 60 - 3. 90). The presence of newly <b>purchased</b> <b>animals</b> (OR= 3. 42; 95 % CI: 1. 35 - 8. 65) was significantly associated with seropositivity. Our findings highlight the role of animal movement among flocks in the epidemiology of brucellosis in this region. Thus, a control program for brucellosis in the region is suggested to impose appropriate restrictions on animal trade and improve knowledge of livestock owners about quarantine principles for newly <b>purchased</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R

50|$|The game mechanics-wise stays true to its {{original}} roots. In 10 seconds, the ten in-game minutes pass, creating a second/minute ratio, like in most Harvest Moon games. The player can still grow crops, and swinging tools for the farm but decreases stamina. However, the usual game mechanic of <b>purchasing</b> <b>animals</b> {{has been replaced by}} defeating monsters in dungeons, using a similar fighting mechanic to the SNES and GBA Legend of Zelda games. The player can befriend monsters, and in return, they help the player in battle or provide sellable goods. The player can also upgrade farm equipment to make the game easier.|$|R
50|$|Predators such as bears {{sometimes}} {{appear on}} the farm.
