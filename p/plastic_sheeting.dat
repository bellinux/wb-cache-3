40|$|Abstract Agricultural {{pollution}} {{caused by}} the use of <b>plastic</b> <b>sheetings</b> has been documented to be a widespread problem in most of the major crop-planting regions of the world. In order to better understand the phytotoxic mechanisms induced by phthalic acid esters involved with this problem, Cucumber sativus L. cv Jinyan No. 4 were sown in pots to the three-leaf-stage in the presence of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP; 0, 30, 50, 100, and 200 mg L− 1) for 1, 3, 5, or 7 days. Physiology, biochemistry, and ultrastructure of seedling roots were exam-ined. The results indicated that activities of three antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD)) were stimulated at low-DBP treatments and decreased under higher levels (> 100 mg L− 1) compared to the controls. On the other hand, SOD and POD provided a better defense against DBP-induced oxidative damage in the roots of cucumber seeding, compared to CAT. The produc-tions of both malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline (Pro) were promoted under DBP stress. Visible impact on the cytoderm, mitochondrion, and vacuole was detected, possibly as a con-sequence of free radical generation.

5|$|By {{about two}} days after the passage of Hurricane Wilma, 800residents on Grand Bahama {{remained}} in shelters, including 65 families who lost their homes and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport. On Bimini, most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane. The Bahamian Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini, and successfully requested to be included under the federation's hurricane appeal for Central America. Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all available resources to assist the residents most affected. The Bahamian Red Cross began a three-month program to distribute food and other items to 1,000 of the 3,500affected families, primarily on Grand Bahama; the remaining 2,500families received assistance from the government and other organizations. Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected. In Nassau, the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items, blankets, health kits, tarpaulins and water. About a week after the hurricane, the United States Agency for International Development began providing $50,000 (2005USD) to the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies. The agency also provided $9,000 (2005USD) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas.

By a year later, housing redevelopments and disaster preparation problems continued after being impacted by Hurricane Emily; as a result, the ECHO provided €1.2million (2005EUR) to Grenada in September 2005. Nine months after the hurricane, Chinese officials provided assistance in reconstruction and handling foreign debts after meeting with the Grenadian Prime Minister; in 2007, Chinese officials funded {{the construction of a new}} $40million (2007USD) cricket stadium near St. George's.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of <b>Plastic</b> Film and <b>Sheeting</b> and the definitive published version is available at [URL] SAGE Publications. The process dynamics of single-screw extrusion on mixtures of polypropylene (PP) and recycled PP were studied using a statistical, design of experiments (DoE) approach. For a conventional screw design, the barrel temperature, screw speed and two vastly different melt viscosity polypropylene mixtures were selected as the independent factors, whilst melt pressure, mass output, screw torque and temperature rise at the die due to shear heating were the dependent responses. A central composite design (CCD) {{in the framework of}} response surface methodology (RSM) was constructed, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to determine the significance of the response surface models. The resulting statistical and response surface predictions have demonstrated that the low viscosity component concentration in the blend is a dominating factor on melt pressure and screw torque, apart from the expected effect of screw speed on output. Viscous heating is affected only by screw speed and recycled polypropylene concentration. Furthermore, the predictions have identified a wider process operating window with increased low-viscosity component concentration. The data confirm that statistical tools make quantitative predictions for the effects of experimental process variables, in accordance with the expected qualitative trends towards process optimisation, providing scope towards its application in scaled-up industrial processes...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} of polymeric films where low sliding friction surfaces are required, e. g., low-friction medical tubing and low-friction electrical wires. Typical methods {{of reducing the}} apparent sliding friction of polymeric surfaces are: (a) the use of liquid lubricants such as silicone oil, (b) powdered solid lubricants such micro-sized starch and (c) fluoropolymers [1, 2, 3]. Studies on modifying the coefficient of friction (COF) by adding different chemical entities have been previously reported [1, 2]. Such chemical moieties are partially transferred from the film to other surfaces upon contact, and may contaminate those surfaces [3]. It is known that friction is greatly influenced by many factors such as tribology, sliding speed, normal load, surface roughness, material stiffness and contact geometry [2]. Thus, in this study, the sliding friction of micro-textured isotactic polypropylene films, extruded from micro-patterned dies was assessed. We investigated two micro-patterned extrusion dies, one with rectangular texture {{and the other with}} a trapezoidal one. The effect of the texture on the apparent film-on-film COF and film-on-metal COF of was evaluated. The films were extruded at 220 °C in costumed-built cast-film line consisting of a 25 mm single screw extruder. The ASTM D- 1894 Standard Test Method for Static and Kinetic Coefficients of Friction of <b>Plastic</b> Film and <b>Sheeting</b> (method of assembly C) was used for all COF measurements on 25 mm wide films with the following exceptions: (a) a stainless steel (SS) sled (standard roughness of 400 grit) of 19 mm width was used and (b) a cross-head speed of 50 mm/min was used to pull the sleds. For the film-on-metal tests, the kinetic COF of non-textured films was measured to be 0. 348 ± 0. 023. The textured films displayed a COF of 0. 234 ± 0. 013 and 0. 218 ± 0. 011 for the rectangular and trapezoidal textures respectively. Thus, a reduction in COF of about 35 % was observed in textured films as compared to the non-textured films. For film-on-film experiments, the non-textured films possessed a kinetic COF of 0. 186 ± 0. 013. The films obtained from the rectangular textured die showed a reduction in COF of about 12 % for the machine direction configuration at 0. 163 ±. 012, whereas the films obtained from the trapezoidal textured die displayed a greater reduction of 28 % because the COF was of only 0. 134 ±. 012. On the other hand, the COF of the combination of non-textured films on rectangular textured films (COF: 0. 113 ± 0. 004) in the machine direction configuration had a more significant reduction in friction of about 40 %. These results indicate that, micro-textured polypropylene films might be effectively used in potential applications where low-sliding and clean surfaces are required...|$|R
