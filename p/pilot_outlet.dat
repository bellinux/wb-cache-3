40|$|AbstractVortex/flame {{interaction}} {{is an important}} mechanism for unsteady combustion in a swirl combustion system. Technology of low emission stirred swirl (TeLESS), which is characterized with stratified swirl flow, has been developed in Beihang University to reduce NOX emission. However, large-scale flow structure would be induced in strong swirl flow. Experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation were carried out to investigate the unsteady flow feature and its mechanism in TeLESS combustor. Hotwire was firstly applied to testing the unsteady flow feature and a distinct mode with 2244 Hz oscillation frequency occurred at the pilot swirl outlet. The flow mode amplitude decayed convectively. Large eddy simulation (LES) was then applied to predicting this flow mode and know about its mechanism. The deviation of mode prediction compared with hotwire test was 0. 8 %. The spiral isobaric structure in pilot flow passage indicates that precessing vortex core (PVC) existed. The velocity spectrum and phase lag analysis suggest that the periodic movement at the <b>pilot</b> <b>outlet</b> was dominated by precessing movement. Negative tangential momentum gradient reflects that the swirl flow was unstable. Another phenomenon was {{found out that the}} PVC movement was intermittently rotated along the symmetric axis...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic is {{a common}} trace-level {{constituent}} of gold-quartz vein deposits in mining regions. This toxic metalloid is often present in waste material, water and soil near gold mining areas. The discharge of mining drainage water containing arsenic contributes to its dispersion in the environment. The resulting contamination of surface waters, groundwater and sediments {{is a matter of}} great public concern due to the deleterious effects of arsenic on human health. In water, arsenic exists mostly as trivalent arsenite (As (III)) and pentavalent arsenate (As(V)), both forms being toxic to living organisms. Most of the existing treatment processes are effective only on As(V) which forms anionic complexes and is therefore more easily converted into solid waste, unlike As(III) which forms mobile neutral complexes. As a consequence, the removal of arsenic from water requires a preliminary oxidation step. The chemical oxidation of As(III) by O 2 is very slow (Jekel [1]), and the use of oxidant chemicals entails high operation costs (US-EPA [2]). This cost aspect could be overcome by using biological treatment with As(III) -oxidizing bacteria (Zouboulis and Katsoyiannis [3]). Arsenic oxidation capabilities of bacteria are known for a long time, since Green [4] isolated a bacteria belonging to Achromobacter in cattle dip in South Africa. Numerous studies reported isolation of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria able to oxidize arsenic (Philips and Taylor [5], Osborne and Ehrlich [6], Abdrashitova et al. [7], Battaglia-Brunet et al. [8]). The present study deals with a mining water drainage resulting of the digging of an exploration gallery in a gold-arsenopyrite mineralization (cherts and quartz veins). Its flow-rate varies between 10 and 30 m 3 h- 1 and the arsenic concentration between 10 and 500 μg L- 1 for a pH close to 6. 5. The water contains also high concentrations of iron (between 2 and 15 mg L- 1). Both arsenic and iron concentrations are higher than the French quality standards (which are set to 100 μg L- 1 for arsenic and 3 mg L- 1 for iron in this kind of context), and thus, require a treatment to be removed from the effluent before discharging it in the environment. In the earlier part of the study, Battaglia-Brunet et al. [9] identified a biological As(III) -oxidizing activity in diverse micro-environments along the water stream, from the source to the discharge point. From those results, we investigated the possibilities of using this natural phenomenon for the removal of arsenic in a passive on-site treatment process based on three successive steps: (i) biological oxidation of As(III) by indigenous bacteria biofilm in a fixed-bed reactor filled with pozzolana, (ii) precipitation of iron in the form of hydroxides, (iii) adsorption of As(V) onto iron hydroxides (and/or co-precipitation of As(V) with iron). Small-scale laboratory experiments showed that the indigenous bacterial population promoted As(III) and Fe(II) oxidation in conditions close to those of the site, i. e. temperature, water composition and oxygen availability. The immobilization of the bacteria on pozzolana by the development and the maintenance of a biofilm increased oxidation rates compared to natural conditions. These results were confirmed by long-term on site pilot-scale experiments. As and Fe removal was significant and their concentrations at the <b>pilot</b> <b>outlet</b> decreased under the discharge standards. The critical operation parameters determined in the study will be used to design a treatment unit based on the biological passive process described above...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigh Thrust Cryogenic Rocket Stages entail {{the use of}} a Vent and Relief Valve {{which can}} cater to a higher {{discharge}} rate. The Vent function is called for during ground servicing operations like tank chilling and pressurant replenishment and during flight {{to take care of the}} decrease in ambient pressure and boil-off losses. The Relief function acts as a redundant feature to protect the tanks from catastrophic failure due to structural damage caused by over-pressurization. Nevertheless, this valve needs to be characterized for both these functions during ground tests. This paper describes the modelling of and experimentation on an Inverted Type Pilot Operated Vent and Safety Valve. A mathematical model for simulating the dynamic behavior of this tank-mounted valve is developed. For this, a set of non-linear, first order, coupled ordinary differential equations, based on laws of conservation of mass and energy, are derived using fixed control volume approach. The numerical solution of these equations is obtained using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The pressure, temperature, flow rate, seat stress and lift thus obtained are plotted to find the characteristic parameters such as cracking pressure, full flow pressure, reseal pressure, opening and closing response, tank pressure decay rate and full flow rate. The valve performance is studied for the effect of main valve outlet orifice and the <b>pilot</b> valve <b>outlet</b> orifice using these simulations. These results are validated by comparing it to the test results...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA fungal {{consortium}} including Aspergillus niger, Mucor hiemalis and Galactomyces geotrichum {{was tested}} {{for the treatment of}} dairy wastewater. The bio-augmentation method was tested at lab-scale (4 L), at pilot scale (110 L) and at an industrial scale in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP). The positive impact of fungal addition was confirmed when fungi was beforehand accelerated by pre-culture on whey (5 g/L lactose) or on the dairy effluent. Indeed, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal yields increased from 55 % to 75 % for model medium, diluted milk. While after inoculation of an industrial biological tank from a dairy factory with the fungal consortium accelerated by pre-cultivation in a 1000 L <b>pilot</b> plant, the <b>outlet</b> COD values decreased from values above the standard one (100 mg/L) to values in the range of 50 - 70 mg/L. In addition, there was a clear impact of fungal addition on the 'hard' or non-biodegradable COD owing to the significant reduction of the increase of the COD on BOD 5 ratio between the inlet and the outlet of the biological tank of WWTP. It was in the range of 451 %- 1111 % before adding fungal consortium, and in the range of 257 %- 153 % after bio-augmentation with fungi. An inoculated bioreactor with fungal consortium was developed at lab-scale and demonstrated successfully at pilot scale in WWTP...|$|R
