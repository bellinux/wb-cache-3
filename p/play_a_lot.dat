500|$|Timmons became {{best known}} as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, {{including}} for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that [...] "He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky – he could <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things, and I thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor." [...] By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.|$|E

500|$|On 3 March 1910 Troy Middleton enlisted {{into the}} 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Porter in Buffalo, New York. [...] He {{was put to}} work as a company clerk, and as a private earned $15 a month, which was paid in gold until it became scarce, and was then paid in silver. [...] Private Middleton tired of this desk work quickly and asked to become a soldier. While this did not happen at Fort Porter, his talents as a {{football}} player became known, and he was pressed into duty as the quarterback of the local team, which played civilian teams in the Buffalo area as well as other army teams such as the one at Fort Niagara near Niagara Falls. [...] For the next several years Middleton would <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of football, a sport that was strongly endorsed by the army. After getting a commission, an officer is never returned to the same unit from which he served as an enlisted member, but Middleton became the exception because of his talents as a quarterback. Middleton felt that football provided him with the finest training he received while in the army, and he said he never met a good football player who wasn't also a good soldier.|$|E
500|$|In Shuffle! Essence+, {{there are}} four new storylines {{available}} in the game. Tsubomi is Kareha's younger sister, and like Kareha, she {{has a tendency to}} space out when she see something romantic or cute. Her catchphrase is [...] "Kya! Kya! Kya!". She's the same age as Primula, so they easily become friends. Sakura is Rin's and Kaede's childhood friend, they know each other since elementary school. That's why she knows about Rin's and Kaede's tragic past. Nadeshiko is Rin's homeroom teacher. She's quite self-confident, firmly stepping on the ground, single, attractive and is frequently the victim of pickup lines, including from the Lord of Devils and Itsuki. It appears she has some martial arts training (being able to slice a bottle with her bare hand). She has a habit of dealing out very strong punishments such as writing 100-page reports and dragging a tire around the track for minor offenses. However when it comes speak about romantic relationship or cuteness she can become shy, specially when someone speaks so about her. Daisy is Sia's cousin. When they were kids they used to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> together, but because of some circumstances between their fathers both of them stopped playing together. Daisy remember the precious for her time she spend with Lisianthus, but Sia seems to forgotten the old days, when they were together.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{was drafted}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants. [...] In late November, {{columnist}} David Bushnell wrote an article, [...] "Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?," [...] questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. [...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays." [...] The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: [...] "Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball[...] [...] [...] If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead." [...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It takes me about a quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. [...] I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't do much about it." [...] Bell also added, [...] "Sure it's been hard for me to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job. [...] I think it's better for me to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> but then again I'm not the coach." ...|$|E

500|$|Eight {{months after}} No Line on the Horizons release, Bono {{said he was}} {{disappointed}} with the album's sales. Regarding the lack of commercial appeal, Bono said, [...] "We weren't really in that mindset. We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we [...] create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging {{for people who have}} grown up on a diet of pop stars." [...] Clayton agreed that the album's commercial reception must be [...] "challenged" [...] but said, [...] "the more interesting challenge is, 'What is rock 'n' roll in this changing world?' Because, to some extent, the concept of the music fan—the concept of the person who buys music and listens to music for the pleasure of music itself—is an outdated idea." [...] The Edge predicted that, despite its lack of a big hit, No Line on the Horizon would grow on listeners over time. He noted that the reaction to the songs in the live setting made U2 believe that the material was connecting with the fans, adding, [...] "There's a lot of records that make great first impressions. There might be one song that gets to be big on the radio, but they're not albums that people... <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> This is one that I gather from talking to people.... Four months later, they're saying, 'I'm really getting into the album now. McGuinness believed that the conditions of the music market were more responsible for the low sales than any decline in U2's popularity.|$|E
