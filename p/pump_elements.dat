The <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> {{consists}} of a single helical rotor, which intermeshes with a double helical resilient stator, to create the moving cavities that transport the slurry. Both components suffer from weaL at different rates, due to relative sliding movement of the rotor to the stator, and the presence of the abrasives carried within the slurry. for a pump manufacturer to remain active in the market they must provide the customer with optimised material selection, for both wearing parts, at a competitive price. Wear is not an intrinsic material property and its value is dependent upon the conditions within each individual tribological system. In order to improve or optimise the wear life of a system, it is first vital to understand the complexity of the mechanisms that generate the material loss. This thesis achieves this goal, with specific reference to a pumping system, by analysing the wear mechanisms of the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> components in progressive cavity pumps and evaluating how the wear severity changes with the system parameters.

40|$|Improved efficiency, better {{controllability}} and {{low noise}} {{are the most}} demanding features form a displacement machine now-a-days. Most of the conventional displacement machines are basically a reciprocating <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> controlled by valve plates or {{with the help of}} check valve [1]. This kind of hydraulic machines loose efficiency dramatically at partial displacement because all of the pistons remain at high pressure at the cycle time and due to pressure inside the piston leakage and shear losses increases. One approach to improve the efficiency of the displacement machine can be controlling each hydraulic piston by using programmable faster valves called digital valve. As the total displacement will be controlled digitally, the total system is called Digital Displacement Technology. In digital displacement machine it is possible to disconnect some of the pistons from the load and the piston will connect only with the low pressure side, minimizing losses due to leakage and shear. As the valve will control directly with digital controller it will eliminate the necessity of servo-hydraulic control required by conventional systems. Digital valves can open fully and close again with the input signal within one revaluation of the shaft, so it gives better control to the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> results reduction in hysteresis and increase the linearity of the <b>pumping</b> <b>element.</b> In Digital Displacement machines by controlling the valves pistons are connected with the machine when pressure is equal, but in the traditional machines piston connection was pre-determined with the shaft angle.

This is accomplished through the off-design operation of the engine fuel pumps.

Future turbopump designs will incorporate various design changes/innovations to address these inefficiencies.

With the increased utilization of implantable, long-term, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), understanding the implications associated with device orientation and interaction with the body is exceedingly important. Components associated with pump thrombosis in the Thoratec© HeartMate II™ (HMII) and the HeartWare© HVAD® devices include the inflow cannula, the outflow graft, and the <b>pump</b> <b>elements</b> as well as pump pocket depth for the HMII specifically. Several studies have been conducted to analyze these interactions with the HMII, however there is minimal to no data available analyzing how the device orientation of the HeartWare HVAD affects hemodynamics and a patient’s risk for developing pump thrombosis. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study is the simulate the hemodynamic implications associated with Sub-optimal cannula angulation of the HVAD. Using Solidworks 2016 Ed., a simplified, hemo-static model of {{the left side of the}} heart was created. Dimensions for the atria, ventricle, and mitral valve were determined through the combination of Trans-Esophageal Echo cardiogram data as well as literature references. Three different inflow cannula angle scenarios were developed including a Control, a Clinically Optimal, and a Sub-optimal. Assumptions included body temperature, no accumulation within the ventricle, and no ejection or contraction. The model consists of static continuous flow set to 5 liters per minute with the assumption that the HeartWare HVAD is completely supporting the left ventricle. The results include both qualitative and quantitative data. Flow trajectory plots for each cannula scenario depict the hemodynamic flow patterns for different time points. Results show visible changes in the Sub-optimal orientation when compared to both the Control and the Clinically Optimal scenario. Additionally, it was determined that there were no statistically significant differences in the velocity vectors for any of the scenarios however, the shear stress values were determined to be significantly different for all time points, p < 0. 001 for all scenarios when compared to Control.

40|$|Rooftop {{integrated}} {{solar thermal}} systems can potentially supply medium to high temperature (100 - 400 Degree Celsius) heat to industrial and commercial applications. A key barrier for conventional concentrated solar systems is that integration with rooftops is relatively complex and cumbersome. To avoid wind loading issues and for ease of installation, low-profile collectors with form factors similar to photovoltaic panels were examined in the present study. In order to advance the field of solar thermal technology for commercial and industrial applications, this study investigated the potential for utilizing compact optical and thermal concentrators. As a major aspect of this study, an innovative low-profile optical concentrator (< 10 cm in height) was designed, developed and systematically analysed. As another potential path for innovation, thermal concentrators (e. g. passive solar receivers consisting of heat pipes and highly conductive fins or solar receivers integrated with active thermoelectric heat <b>pump</b> <b>elements)</b> were explored in this study. Also within this research, the effect of modifying the absorber from a standard selective surface (black chrome-coated copper tube) to a selective volumetric absorber (nanofluid contained within ITO-coated glass tube) was investigated. Several avenues for improvement for both receivers and the entire design were identified from these analyses. Due to the fact industrial demand may not match the transient operation time of concentrating thermal collectors, the integration of latent thermal storage in its limited free space was also investigated. To minimize the cost, shell-and-tube storage units were analysed for their technical feasibility in a characteristic industrial application. The optimum configuration was found to provide a solar fraction of ~ 60 % and an annual charging efficiency of ~ 100 %, indicating technical feasibility for this integrated collector/storage (ICS) system. Lastly, the techno-economic feasibility of these innovations for air-conditioning application was investigated. Overall, this study reveals that the proposed low-profile collector with/without an integrated storage could {{meet the needs of}} industrial and commercial heating applications. Due to the fact that solar-derived industrial heat production is an emerging market, it was ultimately found that a nominal amount of further research and manufacturing cost reductions could potentially help these types of systems to realize unsubsidized economic viability going forward...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of the erosion resistance of materials utilized {{in the construction of}} alumina pumps was carried out. This included laboratory research and, for the purpose of verification, investigation under actual service conditions. In this paper the effect of material properties on erosion resistance is considered. In the second paper the influence of phase properties and conditions of multiphase materials on material erosion resistance will be described. The results from studies of the seven most frequently utilized and recommended materials show that the erosion resistanceof candidate materials increases to a maximum and, then, decreases with decreasing material hardness. Surface examination reveals that ductile and brittle erosion mechanisms operate on the eroded surfaces of ductile and brittle materials respectively. Fracture toughness is a dominant factor for brittle materials, while hardness is a main factor for ductile materials. Under certain external conditions pump materials should be hard enough to resist material loss by ductile erosion mechanisms and should have sufficient fracture toughness to resist material loss by brittle erosion mechanisms. On the basis of the present work a schematic drawing is constructed to explain irregular patterns in the relation between resistance to material erosion and material hardness in previous works through simultaneous {{examination of}} hardness and fracture toughness. The first part of this work Erosion of materials by alumina slurry - part 1 has stated that the erosion resistance of materials in alumina pumps is connected with material properties such as hardness and fracture toughness. Part 2 investigates the erosion mechanisms of multiphase materials. Research into the erosion mechanisms of eroded surfaces as well as microstructural change below the eroded surface led to more thorough analysis of two characteristic wear-resistant materials (Norihard, Fonte 30 %Cr) and a relatively less resistant material, mottled iron. Material removal processes in different phases of multiphase materials are different, asynchronous and interactive. The erosion mechanisms of material removal from the matrices of different materials differ owing to their dependence on the matrix-phase properties and microstructure of the material. The modes of material removal of mottled iron and Norihard are established. A model of the erosion rate of material with a multiphase microstructure was proposed. In the case of <b>pump</b> <b>elements</b> for alumina slurry in an alkaline medium, a ductile matrix with sufficient hardness is important for higher erosion resistance.
