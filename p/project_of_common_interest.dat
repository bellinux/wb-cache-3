The conference was {{organized}} by the Committee of the European Network of Experimental and Representative Basins and the National Committee of the Netherlands for the International Hydrological Programme of Unesco. Much of our basic knowledge on hydrological processes has come from studies in research basins. These well-instrumented basins have also produced much very suitable data for hydrological investigations an water resources management studies. In recent years {{the significance of the}} role of research basins in hydrology has considerably changed.

The recently adopted Regulation (EU) No 347 / 2013 on guidelines {{for the implementation of}} European energy infrastructure priorities is an opportunity to improve this practice by introducing innovative cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) agreements. The Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) that will now be available for all so-called <b>Projects</b> <b>of</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Interest</b> (PCI) is a tool {{that can be used to}} design this type of agreements. • The current practice can be improved in three dimensions, and for each we propose a minimum standard. The first way to improve CBCA agreements is to base them on the CBA results. The minimum standard that we propose is that if one of the involved parties in a project is likely to be a significant net loser, that loss should at least be compensated. The second way to improve the CBCA agreements is to enter into a formal contract. The minimum standard that we propose is that this contract at least include a reward/penalty for the commissioning date. The third way to improve the CBCA agreements is to agree on a set <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> rather than individual projects. The minimum standard that we propose is that strongly complementary projects be defined as a single PCI. • We recommend ACER guarantee the minimum standards in its decisions, and we also recommend that project promoters and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) consider going beyond these minimum standards in cases where this is opportune. There is indeed room for regulatory innovation in this context, and we illustrate that innovation in CBCA agreements is already happening by referring to the cases of Norway-Sweden and Italy-Greece...|$|R
40|$|Massive {{electricity}} transmission investments {{are needed to}} achieve the energy and climate policy objectives of the European Union. The alignment of national and European interests remains the key challenge behind the realization of these investments. This thesis contributes {{to the design of}} efficient cross-border cost allocation solution as one of the regulatory tools that can {{play a significant role in}} aligning these interests. Trends in practice indicate the application of beneficiary pays principle to solve the cost allocation problem. Within the academic circle, this has been the long standing core principle of solving cost allocation problems. However, its application to cross-border {{electricity transmission}} investments with a strong national decision-making power is not widely studied. This thesis reviews various cost allocation methods to check their suitability to apply this principle. The findings indicate that these methods leave open questions regarding which benefit indicators to use for allocating the investment cost and how compensation issues are handled. Therefore, a framework to apply the beneficiary pays principle is required. Introducing transmission investments from a welfare analysis perspective, the thesis develops a framework to apply the beneficiary pays principle to solve the cost allocation problem. An important element of this framework is the use of congestion revenue as part of the solution. The design involves using congestion revenue in a compensation logic to ensure voluntary cooperation among participating countries. The designed framework is then applied in the context of two important developments in transmission investments in Europe: <b>Projects</b> <b>of</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Interest</b> (PCI) and offshore wind interconnection projects. The results show that the framework can help align national and European interests in projects with European relevance. Moreover, important implementation issues are identified. nrpages: 184 status: publishe...|$|R

Continuing a good tradition of the series, again several students had an opportunity to present, for the first time, their work to an international audience in a benevolently and friendly atmosphere. The workshop programme consisted of 44 talks often stimulating intensive discussions. As during all previous meetings the relaxed atmosphere of the Castle, ample time for discussions between the sessions, and the good weather provided nearly perfect conditions for a successful workshop. The topics discussed in the talks covered most aspects of nuclear astrophysics including abundance determinations, reaction rate measurements, modeling specific nucleosynthetic processes and stellar evolutionary phases, simulating stellar explosions, and discussing cosmic chemical evolution. It was amazing to see the enormous progress that has been achieved since the earlier workshops: Fully 3 -dimensional simulations of stellar explosions have become feasible, some important nuclear reaction rate have been measured with astonishing accuracy, and abundance determinations in stars as well as in meteorites have reached a level of quality that was not foreseen when we started these workshops.
