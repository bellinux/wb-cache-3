Many commercial mass spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such routine sequences as selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and <b>precursor</b> <b>ion</b> scanning. In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions. SRM is most often used with scanning instruments where the second mass analysis event is duty cycle limited. These experiments are used to increase specificity of detection of known molecules, notably in pharmacokinetic studies. <b>Precursor</b> <b>ion</b> scanning refers to monitoring for a specific loss from the <b>precursor</b> <b>ion.</b> The first and second mass analyzers scan across the spectrum as partitioned by a user-defined m/z value.

Types of analysis include product ion scan, <b>precursor</b> <b>ion</b> scan, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) (sometimes referred to as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)) and neutral loss scan. For example: When Q1 is in static mode (looking at one mass only as in SIM), and Q3 is in scanning mode, one obtains a so-called product ion spectrum (also called [...] "daughter spectrum"). From this spectrum, one can select a prominent product ion which can be the product ion for the chosen <b>precursor</b> <b>ion.</b> The pair is called a [...] "transition" [...] and forms the basis for SRM.

In details, the <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> at m/z 994, 1008, 1022, 1036 and 1050 were hypothesized to be a series of homologue molecules of surfactins with 14 or multiples of 14  Da difference in their molecular ion species.|$|R

Evaluation of sample preparation conditions allowed selection of solvent/matrix conditions and sample deposition methods to produce sufficiently abundant doubly and triply charged <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> for subsequent CID experiments. As previously reported, preferential cleavage was observed at sites C-terminal to acidic residues and N-terminal to proline residues for all ions examined. An increase in nonpreferential fragmentation as well as additional low mass product ions was observed in the spectra from multiply charged <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> providing increased sequence coverage. This enhanced fragmentation from multiply charged <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> became increasingly important with increasing protein molecular weight and facilitates protein identification using database searching algorithms. The useable mass range for MALDI TOF-TOF analysis of intact proteins has been expanded to 18. 2 kDa using this approach...|$|R

Fragment ions are matched to their corresponding <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> by comparing spectra acquired at slightly different reflectron electric fields. By measuring the difference in time-of-flight (TOF) between the two spectra for each fragment, {{it is possible to}} calculate the mass of the fragment ion and its parent. This new “parallel PSD” technique reduces analysis time and consumes less sample than conventional PSD, which requires an ion gate for serial preselection of <b>precursor</b> <b>ions...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Tandem {{time-of-flight}} (TOF/TOF) is a tandem {{mass spectrometry}} method where two time-of-flight mass spectrometers are used consecutively. To record {{full spectrum of}} <b>precursor</b> (parent) <b>ions</b> TOF/TOF operates in MS mode. In this mode, {{the energy of the}} pulse laser is chosen slightly above the onset of MALDI for specific matrix in use to ensure the compromise between an ion yield for all the parent ions and reduced fragmentation of the same ions. When operating in a tandem (MS/MS) mode, the laser energy is increased considerably above MALDI threshold. The first TOF mass spectrometer (basically, a flight tube which ends up with the timed <b>ion</b> selector) isolates <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> of choice using a velocity filter, typically, of a Bradbury-Nielsen type, and the second TOF-MS (that includes the post accelerator, flight tube, ion mirror, and the ion detector) analyzes the fragment ions. Fragment ions in MALDI TOF/TOF result from decay of <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> vibrationally excited above their dissociation level in MALDI source (post source decay [...] ). Additional ion fragmentation implemented in a high-energy collision cell may be added to the system to increase dissociation rate of vibrationally excited <b>precursor</b> <b>ions.</b> Some designs include precursor signal quenchers as a part of second TOF-MS to reduce the instant current load on the ion detector.|$|R

50|$|Mass-analyzed ion kinetic-energy {{spectrometry}} (MIKES) is a {{mass spectrometry}} technique by which mass spectra are {{obtained from a}} sector instrument that incorporates at least one magnetic sector plus one electric sector in reverse geometry (the beam first enters the magnetic sector).

30|$|The mass {{spectrometer}} was operated in the positive ionization mode with data acquisition in ~ 3.5  s per scan cycle, {{starting with a}} full MS scan of the <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> in the Orbitrap (400 to 1600  m/z; resolution of 30, 000 at m/z of 400; automatic gain control (AGC) of 5 [*]×[*] 105), followed by three data-dependent CID MS/MS scans of the three most abundant <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> in the ion trap and then three HCD MS/MS scans on the same <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> in the Orbitrap (resolution of 7500). The normalized activation energy of CID and HCD were set at 35 % and 48 %, and the AGC at 5 [*]×[*] 103 and 1 [*]×[*] 105, respectively. For both scan modes, the minimum MS signal for triggering MS/MS was set at 1, 000, while dynamic exclusion was implemented with a repeat count of 1 and exclusion duration of 40  s.

40|$|Three {{different}} {{commonly used}} infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy acquisition and analysis methods are described, and results from these methods are compared {{using the same}} dataset for an extensively hydrated metal cation, La 3 +(H 2 O) 36. Using the first-order laser-induced photodissociation rate constant as an IRPD intensity has several advantages over photodissociation yield and depletion/appearance methods in that intensities can be more directly compared with calculated infrared absorption spectra, and the intensities can be readily corrected for changes in laser power or irradiation times used for optimum data acquisition at each frequency. Extending IRPD spectroscopy to large clusters can be complicated when blackbody infrared radiative dissociation competes strongly with laser-induced photodissociation. A new method to obtain IRPD spectra of single <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> or ensembles of <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> that is nearly equivalent to the photodissociation rate constant method for single <b>precursor</b> <b>ions</b> is demonstrated. The ensemble IRPD spectra represent the “average” structure of clusters of a given size range, and this method has the advantage that spectra with improved signal-to-noise ratios can be obtained with no increase in data acquisition time.
