As a consequence, intense research efforts have concentrated on the development of sophisticated techniques for effective management of video sequences [1]. More recently, the fundamental <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>shifting</b> video manipulation techniques towards the processing of the visual content at a semantic level has been widely adopted. Semantic video analysis is the cornerstone of such intelligent video manipulation endeavors, attempting to bridge the so called semantic gap[2] and efficiently capture the underlying semantics of the content.|$|E

Choosing the best treatment strategy for each patient with a diffuse low-grade glioma, in other words optimizing the oncologic and functional balance, implies not only a full knowledge of {{the natural history of}} this chronic disease, but also an understanding of the adaptation of the brain in response to growth and spread of the glioma. The aim of this review is to examine the mechanisms underlying this neuroplasticity, allowing functional compensation when the tumor progresses, and opening the way to new treatments with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>shifting</b> towards “functional personalized neuro-oncology”, improving both median survival and quality of life...|$|E

Using a new phage display technology, we developed such antibody Fab fragments with subnanomolar binding affinity for tetrasulfocyanine, a near-IR in vivo imaging agent. Unexpectedly, some Fabs induced redshifts of the dye absorption peak {{of up to}} 44 nm. This is the largest shift reported for a biological system so far. Crystal structure determination and absorption spectroscopy in the crystal in combination with microcalorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering in solution revealed that the redshift is triggered by formation of a Fab dimer, with tetrasulfocyanine being buried in a fully closed protein cavity within the dimer interface. The derived <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>shifting</b> the absorption peak of a symmetric dye via packaging within a Fab dimer interface may be transferred to other diagnostic fluorophores, opening the way towards smart imaging probes that change their wavelength upon interaction with an antibody...|$|E

40|$|Liquid crystal-based {{integrated}} optical devices {{offer the}} potential for high speed and dynamically tunable optical switches in modern telecommunications networks. Here, electrically tunable devices have major advantages over their thermal counterparts, with superior response times and low operating voltages (~ 100 V). Our approach to achieving such devices is to fabricate planar optical waveguides with integrated Bragg gratings via direct UV writing 1 into silica-on-silicon samples with evanescent field coupling into a liquid crystal overlay through an etched window (Fig. 1 (a)). Such electrically tunable devices work on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>shifting</b> the Bragg wavelength by modifying the effective index of a waveguide in a multilayer substrate. Electrically controlled liquid crystal birefringence modifies the waveguide effective index, producing a Bragg wavelength shift. In our early samples, Merck 18523 nematic liquid crystal is used as it has a compatible refractive index to silica (n= 1. 49 at lambda= 1550 nm). Homeotropic alignment of the liquid crystal is provided by application of a surfactant layer...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} 114 GHz electrically tunable {{liquid crystal}} Bragg gratings using 170 Vpp voltage. The devices were made using direct UV grating writing and use evanescent coupling into an electrically tuned nematic liquid crystal. Reconfigurable integrated optical devices are essential in today's dense and complex telecommunication meshes. A commonly employed component on the silica platform fulfilling the above role is a planar Bragg grating. The ability to tune the reflection peak of these gratings {{is one of}} the key enablers in realizing an all optical dynamic network. To date, little has been reported on electrically tunable planar Bragg gratings given their potentially superior response times over temperature tuned devices. Such electrically tunable devices work on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>shifting</b> the Bragg wavelength by modifying the effective index of a waveguide in a multilayer substrate. One route to achieve this is by overlaying the grating with a liquid crystal as many liquid crystals display refractive index anisotropy that can be electrically manipulated. Modifying the liquid crystal refractive index subsequently alters the effective index of the waveguide, leading to Bragg wavelength shift. Using this approach, Sparrow et al [1] have previously demonstrated 35 GHz tunability at 1560 nm using 80 Vpp (peak-to-peak) square-wave with 250 mm-spaced aluminium electrodes. Here, we report a maximum tunability of 114 GHz at 1561. 8 nm using patterned ITO glass electrodes with 170 Vpp voltage at 1 kHz.

40|$|Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is an {{important}} cash crop for small-scale Bangandou farmers living in forested area of Cameroon. In this region, cacao is usually grown under the shade in fi elds of selectively thinned natural forestland. This study aims to clarify how the cacao-growing system has been integrated into the Bangandou's subsistence slash-and-burn agriculture and examines its role in their livelihood. Bangandou people favor establishing new cacao fi elds in primary forests or old cacao fi elds because the shaded condition is easier to create in such vegetation. When the land is cleared, {{a larger number of}} trees are left in the cacao fi elds than in the fi elds of food crops only. This strategy of leaving more trees saves the labor for felling, and attracts people to clearing the primary forests, which would otherwise require larger labor forces. Cacao seedlings are planted in a newly cleared fi eld, mixed with a variety of food crops during the initial several years, and grow while farmers harvest the food crops from the same fi elds. Unlike the food crop fi elds, weeding is indispensable to cacao growing, but it is so laborious that parts of the planted cacao fi elds often become covered with thick bush regrowth. Although these areas have to be abandoned, people may clear them for replanting after a few years. Analyses of crop rotation and vegetation change in the cacao fi elds show that the fundamental elements of their farming system have remained largely unchanged by the introduction of cacao growing, in which the same <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>shifting</b> cultivation is adopted for the new crop. This type of agriculture also ensures the stable production of food crops and acts as a buffer against unstable cacao prices and productivity...|$|E

40|$|Milking {{represents}} 40 - 50 % of {{the total}} labour input into Australian dairy farms. Unless this work input can be reduced, the job of milking will remain a major limitation to improvements in the efficiency of dairyfarming. The main aim of the field study reported in this thesis was to study the milking and cleaning performance of 15 of the 24 rotary milking systems operating in Australia in the Spring of 1973. Elements of the work routine time were analysed to measure: (a) the relative effects on milking throughput of alternative shed designs, operating systems and types of automation; (b) the relative influence of yard design, shed type, and the operator, on the ease and speed of cow movement from the cowyard onto the rotary platform; and (c) the labour requirements and relative effectiveness of different cleaning systems. Measurements were made at one evening milking and the following morning milking at each farm by 2, 3 or 4 observers, using multi-channel event recorders, stop watches and. recording sheets. Although changes in the element times of the work routine occurred as milking progressed, the labour productivity '(cows milked per man hour) did not change significantly during milking {{in the group of}} rotaries studied. Labour productivity was lower at morning milkings than at evening milkings. Productivity increased with increasing number of milking units per operator and, to a lesser extent, with the degree of mechanisation used. The time taken to move cows onto the rotary platforms increased towards the end of milking. The operators increased involvement in cow movement later in milking was partly compensated for by a decrease in his idle time. Operators rated as good, cowmen spent less time encouraging, forcing or assisting cows onto the platform than those operators rated as below average cowmen. Cows defecated less on "turnstyle" type rotary platforms than on rotary herringbone platforms which had no provision for head yoking of the cows. Although {{there were no significant differences}} in "cow-in" times or percentage of cows needing assistance onto the platform between circular and rectangular type holding yards, cow behaviour was slightly better in the group of rectangular yards studied. Mechanisation substantially reduced the amount of time spent on cleaning milking machines. It is clear that all milking systems have considerable potential for mechanisation. The amount and type of labour saved must establish the priorities put on mechanising the' various tasks involved in milking and cleaning. Mechanisation of the milking routine is pointless unless there is a corresponding increase in the number of milking units per operator. Techniques for data collection and presentation must be simplified and standardised to enable comparison of results between surveys and between milking systems, e. g. throughput should be expressed as cows per man hour per milking unit as well as cows per man hour, to permit meaningful comparisons. Good cowmanship is critical to the success of a milking system. "Cowmanship" needs to be clearly defined and. further investigated. Variations in milker and cow behaviour in the milking systems studied in the survey indicate that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>shifting</b> the emphasis from one of forcing cows to conform, to one of encouraging them to ca-operate by conditioning and training, warrants further researchRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} {{explanations}} of problematic governance are institutional rather than organisational {{and have their}} roots in the deep structures of society.
