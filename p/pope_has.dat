25|$|<b>Popes</b> <b>have</b> been {{important}} in shaping both the theological and the devotional {{aspects of the}} Roman Catholic perspective on the Virgin Mary. Theologically, <b>popes</b> <b>have</b> highlighted the inner link between Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ, in the encyclicals Mystici corporis, Lumen gentium and Redemptoris Mater.|$|R

25|$|Like all bishops, the <b>pope</b> <b>has</b> {{the option}} of resigning, though unlike other bishops, it is not required. The best known cases are those of Pope Celestine V in 1294, Pope Gregory XII in 1415 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2013. Approximately 10% of all popes left or were removed from office before death.|$|E
25|$|Chapter 23 {{also teaches}} that Christians {{are obligated to}} pray for civil {{authorities}} and to obey lawful commands. A magistrate's legal authority is not lost because of unbelief or religious differences.

25|$|Langdon and Vittoria {{make their}} way to Vatican City, where the <b>Pope</b> <b>has</b> {{recently}} died. They are told that the four Preferiti, the cardinals {{who are most likely to}} be elected pope, are missing. Langdon and Vittoria search for the preferiti in hopes that they will also find the antimatter canister. Their search is assisted by Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca (the late pope's closest aide), the Vatican's Swiss Guard and Commander Olivetti.|$|E
25|$|According to The Boston Globe {{language}} columnist Ben Zimmer, the Devil's Advocate, {{which is}} {{indicated in the}} novel to {{have a role in}} the selection of the <b>pope,</b> <b>has</b> {{nothing to do with the}} papal conclave, and was instead employed to present arguments against the proposed canonization of a person as a saint. Zimmer adds that the Devil's Advocate was abolished by Pope John Paul II in 1983, 17 years before the novel was published.|$|E

25|$|Normally, sainthood causes {{take many}} years to {{progress}} to canonization; the exceptions to these cases (causes of martyrs, who only need one miracle for sainthood; or where the <b>Pope</b> <b>has</b> granted a waiver to start the process sooner after death) are {{quite apart from the}} norm. Nevertheless, the potential for a long delay was very frustrating to many in the area and beyond who had helped and funded his cause, and to his other supporters.|$|E
25|$|In June 2017 {{after seven}} months of not {{receiving}} a response from Pope Francis to their request that he clarify highly disputed parts in his apostolic exhortation Amoris laetitia (The Joy of Love), four cardinals asked Francis for an audience in April but the <b>Pope</b> <b>has</b> yet to respond, it has emerged. In an April 25 letter hand-delivered to the Holy Father on May 6, Cardinals Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandmüller, Burke and Joachim Meisner wrote to Francis asking for an audience, having received no response to the dubia they sent him on Sept 2016.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{functions}} of the Sistine Chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a conclave of the College of Cardinals. On the occasion of a conclave, a chimney is installed in the roof of the chapel, from which smoke arises as a signal. If white smoke appears, created by burning the ballots of the election, a new <b>Pope</b> <b>has</b> been elected. If a candidate receives less than a two-thirds vote, the cardinals send up black smoke — created by burning the ballots along with wet straw and chemical additives — it means that no successful election has yet occurred.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Ratzinger was {{appointed}} to a chair in dogmatic theology at the University of Tübingen, {{where he was a}} colleague of Hans Küng. In his 1968 book Introduction to Christianity, he wrote that the <b>pope</b> <b>has</b> a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of Tübingen and the Marxist leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings. Despite his reformist bent, his views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles.|$|E
25|$|All {{previously}} existing judicial {{bodies are}} suppressed and the <b>pope</b> <b>has</b> made the vicar the ordinary and sole {{judge in the}} first instance for all suits brought in the court of the Roman diocese. The vicar passes judgement only in those cases which he has expressly reserved for himself; in other cases his auditor acts as judge, forming with the vicar one and the same court. The auditor is regarded as the official of the curia of the Roman Diocese and tries the suits according to common law. The office and jurisdiction of the camerlengo of the Roman clergy have been suppressed and his faculties and jurisdiction have been transferred completely to the auditor, who is provided with a substitute. When according to common law a suit is to be decided not by a single judge but by a full bench, the auditor is then held to be the presiding judge, in case the vicar does not reserve the position of presiding officer to himself. The appointment of the associate judges belongs to the pope; for the individual case the vicar has the right to select the associate judges from those appointed by the pope. This ordinance is especially worth noticing. The other ordinances cannot here be discussed in detail.|$|E
25|$|The {{series of}} assistants to the vicar, {{now known as}} vices-gerentes (vicegerent), begins with 1560. Until the time of Pope Clement XI (1700) they were named by the vicar; since then the <b>pope</b> <b>has</b> {{appointed}} them by a special Brief. The vicesgerens is therefore not a representative (locum tenens) of the vicar, but a subordinate auxiliary bishop appointed for life, though removable at any time. His authority (faculties) relative to jurisdiction and orders is identical {{with that of the}} vicar; for its exercise, however, he depends on the latter, as is expressly stated in the Brief of his nomination. In particular, the vicar has committed to him the administration of the treasury of relics known as the Lisanotheca or relic-treasury of the vicariate, the censorship of books, and the permission to print. The censorship of books was entrusted to the vicar by a Bull of 4 May 1515 (in the Magnum Bullarium); this right, however, is now exercised by the vices-gerens subject to the Magister sacri palatii, to whose imprimatur he adds his own name without further examination of the book in question. The really responsible censor is therefore the Magister sacri palati, not the vicesgerens. Occasionally there have been two assistants of the vicar, to one of whom were committed all matters of jurisdiction, to the other the pontificalia and ordinations; the latter was known as suffragan of the vicar.|$|E

25|$|A {{change of}} {{attitude}} was eventually signalled by the Papists Act 1778 in {{the reign of}} King George III. Under this Act, an oath was imposed, which besides being a declaration of loyalty to the reigning sovereign, contained an abjuration of Charles Edward Stuart, the Pretender to the British throne, and of certain doctrines attributed to Roman Catholics (doctrines such as those stating that excommunicated princes may lawfully be murdered, that no faith should be kept with heretics, and that the <b>Pope</b> <b>has</b> temporal as well as spiritual jurisdiction in the realm). Those taking this oath were exempted {{from some of the}} provisions of the Popery Act. The section as to taking and prosecuting priests were repealed, as also the penalty of perpetual imprisonment for keeping a school. Catholics were also enabled to inherit and purchase land, nor was a Protestant heir any longer empowered to enter and enjoy the estate of his Catholic kinsman. However, the passing of this act was the occasion of the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots (1780) in which the violence of the mob was especially directed against Lord Mansfield who had balked at various prosecutions under the statutes now repealed. The anti-clerical excesses of the French Revolution and the consequent emigration to England of Catholic priests from France led to a softening of opinion towards Catholics {{on the part of the}} English Anglican establishment, resulting in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 which allowed Catholics to enter the legal profession, relieved them from taking the Oath of Supremacy and granted toleration for their schools and places of worship The repeal of the Penal Laws culminated in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829.|$|E
