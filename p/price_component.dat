The Projected proxy cost is a calculation of a resource’s start-up and minimum load costs to determine maximum registered cost values (bid caps) for the resource. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{valuation}} of some negative external effects arising from agricultural production in Italy. External effects are treated in a transformation function as a ‘bad’ output additional to the normal output of a production activity. In this case we can distinguish a <b>price</b> <b>component</b> or shadow price of the external effect and a quantity component and estimate them separately. In order to calculate the <b>price</b> <b>component</b> of the external effects we first estimate one point on the marginal external costs curve {{and then try to}} obtain the whole curve, i. e. external costs associated to different levels of emissions in different years. As to the quantity component, net emissions of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium have been estimated. The aggregate value of external effects is then calculated for thirty years from 1961 to 1991 and deducted from the value added of the agricultural sector, as a first step towards the correction of national accounting aggregates to take environmental degradation into account.

40|$|The {{price paid}} for a {{medicine}} comprises a number of price components, the manufacturer’s selling price (MSP) being just one of them. As medicines move along the supply chain, from the manufacturer to the patient, additional costs {{are added to the}} MSP. These price components come from a variety of sources, such as freight costs, government-collected tariffs, taxes and mark-ups collected by middlemen to meet their overheads, and procurement procedures. Such fees are often high, regularly constituting between 30 % and 45 % of the price of the dispensed medicine but they can even exceed 100 % (1 – 3). Price components are a concern for all actors involved in public health and access to medicines, from governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and social insurance plans to prescribers and patients. Price components have both a direct and cumulative impact on the price of the medicine. Since price components are cumulative (i. e. each is applied to the running total), each <b>price</b> <b>component</b> rises from the base (MSP) price on which all subsequent charges are levied.

A companion paper established that with optimal product <b>prices,</b> <b>component</b> production capacity, and sequencing of orders for assembly, the system can be approximated by a diffusion process with dimension equal {{to the number of}} components (rather than the number of components plus the number of products). This state space collapse allows us to incorporate product-specific delay constraints and dynamic control of component inventory. First, we choose product <b>prices,</b> <b>component</b> production capacities, and propose a discrete review policy for expediting components and sequencing orders for assembly that satisfies delay constraints perfectly, and is asymptotically optimal when expediting is very costly. We also propose a simpler version of this policy, based on the backlog of demand for each component, that asymptotically complies with delay guarantees and achieves the same limiting expected discounted profit. Second, we numerically solve an approximating diffusion control problem for systems with both expediting and salvaging of components, and highlight useful structural properties. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Integrating {{residential}} photovoltaic (PV) {{power generation}} and energy storage systems into the Smart Grid {{is an effective}} way of utilizing renewable power and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. This has become a particularly interesting problem {{with the introduction of}} dynamic electricity energy pricing models since electricity consumers can use their PV-based energy generation and controllable energy storage devices for peak shaving on their power demand profile from the grid, and thereby, minimize their electricity bill cost. A realistic electricity price function is considered in this paper with billing period of a month, comprised of both the energy <b>price</b> <b>component</b> and the demand <b>price</b> <b>component.</b> Due to the characteristics of the realistic electricity price function and the energy storage capacity limitation, the residential storage control algorithm should properly account for various energy loss components during system operation, including the energy loss components due to rate capacity effect in the storage system as well as power dissipation in the power conversion circuitries. A near-optimal storage control algorithm is proposed accounting for these aspects, based on the PV power generation and load power consumption prediction results in the previous papers. The near-optimal control algorithm, which controls charging/discharging schemes of the storage system, is effectively implemented by solving a convex optimization problem {{at the beginning of each}} day with polynomial time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed near-optimal residential storage control algorithm achieves up to 36. 0 % enhancement in electricity cost reduction than the baseline control algorithm.

The problem statement is: What is the optimal pricing technique for movies on demand? How {{much of the}} area under demand curve can be captured by sophisticated pricing? The method used is quantitative research based on the data (12 726 individual movie valuations obtained from 479 participants) gathered in the survey conducted among Norwegian customers of a large international provider of TV-services (Canal Digital DTH).
