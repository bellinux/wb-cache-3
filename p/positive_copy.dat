5000|$|Before the {{widespread}} use of non-linear editing systems, the initial editing of all films was done with a <b>positive</b> <b>copy</b> of the film negative called a film workprint (cutting copy in UK) by physically cutting and pasting together pieces of film. Strips of footage would be hand cut and attached together with tape and then later in time, glue. Editors were very precise; if they made a wrong cut or needed a fresh positive print, it cost them money for the lab to reprint the footage and push the editing process back farther. With the invention of a splicer and threading machine with a viewer such as a Moviola, or [...] "flatbed" [...] machine such as a K.-E.-M. or Steenbeck, the editing process sped up a little bit and cut came out cleaner and more precise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Watermarking {{with both}} {{oblivious}} detection and high robustness capabilities {{is still a}} challenging problem. In this paper, we tackle the aforementioned problem. One easy way to achieve blind detection is to use denoising for filtering out the hidden watermark, which can be utilized to create either false <b>positive</b> (<b>copy</b> attack) or false negative (denoising and remodu-lation attack). Our basic design methodology is to exploit prior knowledge available at the detector side and then use it to design a “nonblind ” embedder. We prove that the proposed scheme can resist two famous watermark estimation-based attacks, which have successfully cracked many existing watermarking schemes. False negative and false positive analyses are conducted to verify the performance of our scheme. The experimental {{results show that the}} new method is indeed powerful.

40|$|Poly(propylene imine) dendrimers with dialkyl sulfide end {{groups were}} {{prepared}} and developed as inks for positive microcontact printing ((+) uCP) on gold. Long (C 10 H 21 -S-C 10 H 20 -), medium (C 3 H 7 -S-C 4 H 8 -), and short (CH 3 -S-CH 2 -) dialkyl sulfide end groups {{were attached to}} second- and third-generation PPI dendrimers to create a family of dendritic sulfides. The dendritic inks flatten upon adsorption and form monolayers on gold. (+) uCP was performed on gold using commercially available poly(dimethylsiloxane) as stamp material and n-octadecanethiol as etch resist. The gold beneath the dendrimers was selectively etched away with an acidic Fe(NO 3) 3 /thiourea solution to give the <b>positive</b> <b>copy</b> of the original master pattern. The multivalent sulfide attachment and the relatively high molecular mass of these dendrimers ensured minimal lateral ink spreading and thus optimal feature reproducibility. Contact times were varied to analyze the spreading rates of the dendritic inks. The spreading rates of the dendritic inks {{were found to be}} much lower than that of pentaerythritol tetrakis(3 -mercaptopropionate). (+) uCP with the new inks was extended to submicrometer features. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy were used to characterize the etched samples. Lines with a width of 100 nm were faithfully replicated with the third-generation dendrimers bearing medium (C 3 -S-C 4 -) end groups...|$|E
40|$|Comparative genomic {{hybridization}} (CGH) of gastric adenocarcinomas frequently shows {{gains and}} amplifications of chromosome 20. However, the underlying genetic lesion is unknown and conventional CGH results {{do not allow}} specification of the target region. In order to investigate this chromosomal aberration with a higher resolution and sensitivity, microarray-based CGH was performed with both scanning and high-resolution arrays of chromosome 20 {{in a series of}} 27 gastric adenocarcinomas. Locus-specific fragments of genomic DNA from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were spotted as microarrays. A scanning array contained a set of 27 BAC clones covering chromosome 20 q. A high-resolution array contained 27 overlapping BAC clones at 20 q 13. 2. This high-resolution array was used to narrow down the amplicon at 20 q 13. 2 in tumours showing amplification of this chromosomal region with the scanning array. <b>Positive</b> <b>copy</b> number changes on chromosome 20 q were detected in 12 of 27 cases (44 %). These changes included gain of the whole arm of chromosome 20 q in 8 of 27 (30 %) cases, amplification restricted to 20 q 12. 1 in one case, and amplifications restricted to 20 q 13 in three cases (11 %). The three tumours showing amplification restricted to 20 q 13 were analysed further using the high-resolution array. In one tumour, the whole contig was amplified at a constant level. One of the other two tumours had a clear proximal breakpoint, while the other tumour had a clear distal breakpoint within the 20 q 13. 2 region. The proximal and the distal breakpoint were approximately 800 kb apart. In the present study, an amplicon at 20 q 13. 2 has been narrowed down to 800 kb which is likely to harbour one or more putative oncogenes relevant to gastric carcinogenesis, for which ZNF 217 and CYP 24 are good candidates...|$|E
