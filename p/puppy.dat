5|$|A <b>puppy</b> born in 2012 named Jack Junior, or J.J., began {{assisting}} Jack in April 2012, {{allowing the}} older Jack to retire after the 2012–13 school year and transfer his duties to Jack Junior. However, university administrators determined in July 2013 that J.J. {{would not be}} the school's mascot going forward. By the end of August 2013, a new <b>puppy</b> had been identified from the same breeders, and John B. Carroll was introduced to the campus in October 2013.|$|E

50|$|Naturally, in the wild, {{the mother}} will begin weaning off the <b>puppies</b> because the <b>puppies</b> will start {{developing}} teeth which will irritate the mother when the <b>puppies</b> are suckling. This causes her to continually leave the <b>puppies</b> {{for longer periods}} of time, causing them to gradually be weaned off their mother. Wild dogs will also regurgitate food to transition the <b>puppies</b> to a new diet.|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{behaviour}} of <b>puppies</b> related to their adaptation to objects and subjects (socialization) was carrier out. A comparison was made {{on the degree of}} socialization of <b>puppies</b> from two common canine breeds − German shepherd and Doberman. It was established that the degree of socialization in German shepherd <b>puppies</b> was better compared to Doberman <b>puppies...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1982, a {{study to}} observe the {{differences}} between dogs and wolves raised in similar conditions took place. The dog <b>puppies</b> preferred larger amounts of sleep {{at the beginning of}} their lives, while the wolf <b>puppies</b> were much more active. The dog <b>puppies</b> also preferred the company of humans, rather than their canine foster mother, though the wolf <b>puppies</b> were the exact opposite, spending more time with their foster mother. The dogs also showed a greater interest in the food given to them and paid little attention to their surroundings, while the wolf <b>puppies</b> found their surroundings to be much more intriguing than their food or food bowl. The wolf <b>puppies</b> were observed taking part in antagonistic play at a younger age, while the dog <b>puppies</b> did not display dominant/submissive roles until they were much older. The wolf <b>puppies</b> were rarely seen as being aggressive to each other or towards the other canines. On the other hand, the dog <b>puppies</b> were much more aggressive to each other and other canines, often seen full-on attacking their foster mother or one another.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{determine}} the comparative efficacy of vaccines administered intranasally or orally to protect <b>puppies</b> from disease subsequent to experimental infection with Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb), a randomized controlled trial was performed using 48 approximately 8 -week-old specific pathogen free, Bb naive Beagle <b>puppies.</b> <b>Puppies</b> were randomized into three groups and administered vaccines containing Bb intranasally or orally, or a placebo intranasally. Twenty-one days later, all dogs were challenge exposed via aerosol administration of Bb. Clinical signs, nasal bacterial shedding and immune responses were monitored for 28 days after challenge. Intranasally vaccinated <b>puppies</b> had significantly lower rates of coughing, nasal discharge, retching and sneezing (i. e. were less sick clinically) than control <b>puppies.</b> The distinction between the orally vaccinated <b>puppies</b> and the control <b>puppies</b> was less consistent. The orally vaccinated <b>puppies</b> had less coughing and less retching than the control <b>puppies,</b> but nasal discharge and sneezing did not differ from control animals. Orally vaccinated <b>puppies</b> had higher rates of coughing, nasal discharge, retching and sneezing than the intranasally vaccinated <b>puppies.</b> Although both intranasal and oral Bb vaccines stimulated immune responses associated with disease sparing following Bb infection, the intranasal route of delivery conferred superior clinical outcomes. The observed difference in clinical efficacy suggests the need to question the rationale for the use of currently available orally administered Bb vaccines...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the acid-base status and the serum concentration of organic acids in <b>puppies</b> with naturally occurring canine parvoviral enteritis. Between July 1999 and July 2000, 25 client-owned <b>puppies</b> admitted to the St. Louis Animal Emergency Clinic South for treatment of enteritis caused by parvovirus infection were used in our study. Control blood samples were collected from 22 healthy <b>puppies</b> less than 9 months of age. Serum organic acid concentrations were quantitatively determined by HPLC. <b>Puppies</b> infected with parvovirus had significantly lower plasma concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate than controls. Although serum L-lactate tended to increase in some <b>puppies</b> with canine parvoviral enteritis, our study demonstrated that most affected <b>puppies</b> developed only mild compensated metabolic acidosis. None of the affected <b>puppies</b> had an elevated serum D-lactate concentration at admission...|$|R

She also made excursions from the camp, looking for food, and would bring back rats and snakes to Williams. Judy had another group of puppies, of which five survived. One of them was given to the camp Commandant as promised and another <b>puppy</b> was smuggled into the women's camp along with any food that the men could spare. A further <b>puppy</b> was given to the Red Cross in Medan, one more was beaten to death by a drunken guard, and the final one remained in the camp after Judy and Williams left.|$|E
5|$|Reznor {{assembled}} the first live line-up in 1988 {{to support the}} Canadian industrial music band Skinny <b>Puppy</b> on tour. The three-piece band consisted of Reznor on guitars and lead vocals, Ron Musarra on drums, and Chris Vrenna on keyboards. The band was poorly received, however, and {{they were asked to}} leave the tour after 10 dates. After the Skinny <b>Puppy</b> tour the band was rearranged and expanded to include a fourth member; Musarra departed and Vrenna moved to drums, Gary Talpas, Nick Rushe, and later David Hymes contributed on keyboards, while Richard Patrick was added as guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Reznor has toured {{with some}} of his influences, {{including}} a brief tour opening for Skinny <b>Puppy</b> in 1989. In 1995 Nine Inch Nails went on tour with David Bowie, who along with Pink Floyd had been a significant influence on The Downward Spiral.|$|E

50|$|Born {{after an}} average of 63 days of gestation, <b>puppies</b> emerge in an amnion that is bitten off and eaten by the mother dog. <b>Puppies</b> begin to nurse almost immediately. If the litter exceeds six <b>puppies,</b> {{particularly}} if one or more are obvious runts, human intervention in hand-feeding the stronger <b>puppies</b> is necessary {{to ensure that the}} runts get proper nourishment and attention from the mother. As they reach one month of age, <b>puppies</b> are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food. The mother may regurgitate partially digested food for the <b>puppies</b> or might let them eat some of her solid food. The mother dog usually refuses to nurse at this stage, though she might let them occasionally nurse for comfort.|$|R

5000|$|Factors {{influencing}} the litter size of <b>puppies</b> {{and the proportion}} of stillborn <b>puppies</b> per litter were analyzed in normally sized German dachshunds. [...] The records analyzed contained data on 42,855 litters. It was found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn <b>puppies</b> increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression. It was also found that young and older dams had smaller litter sizes and more stillborn <b>puppies</b> than middle-aged dams.|$|R
50|$|<b>Puppies</b> {{are born}} with a fully {{functional}} sense of smell but can't open their eyes. During their first two weeks, a <b>puppy's</b> senses all develop rapidly. During this stage the nose is the primary sense organ used by <b>puppies</b> to find their mother's teats, and to locate their littermates, if they become separated by a short distance. <b>Puppies</b> open their eyes about nine to eleven days following birth. At first, their retinas are poorly developed and their vision is poor. <b>Puppies</b> {{are not able to}} see as well as adult dogs. In addition, puppies' ears remain sealed until about thirteen to seventeen days after birth, after which they respond more actively to sounds. Between two and four weeks old, <b>puppies</b> usually begin to growl, bite, wag their tails, and bark.|$|R

40|$|Background Predicting subaortic {{stenosis}} (SAS) {{in adult}} Golden Retriever dogs (GRs) by evaluating them as <b>puppies</b> is {{hampered by the}} progressive expression of the SAS phenotype in youth. In some children who develop SAS as adults, an abnormal aortoseptal angle (AoSA) precedes development of stenosis. Objectives To determine the normal AoSA in young adult GRs using echocardiography; to assess the value of AoSA in GR <b>puppies</b> for predicting development of the SAS phenotype. Animals Forty-eight 2 - to 6 -month-old GR <b>puppies.</b> Methods Prospective study. <b>Puppies</b> were recruited from clients and breeders. <b>Puppies</b> were evaluated with a physical examination and an echocardiogram, and this evaluation was repeated when they were 12 – 18 -month-old adults. <b>Puppies</b> were classified as unaffected (WNL) or affected (SAS) retroactively, based on their results as adults. Results In WNL young adult GRs, mean ± SD AoSA was 152. 3 ± 6. 5 °. Mean ± SD AoSA in SAS <b>puppies</b> (144. 9 ± 8. 6 °) was significantly different from mean AoSA in WNL <b>puppies</b> (155. 7 ± 8. 8 °, P 160 ° had the SAS phenotype as a young adult; 93 % (75. 7 – 99. 1 %) of <b>puppies</b> with AoSA < 145 ° had the SAS phenotype as young adults. Peak LVOT velocity increased significantly between evaluations (P <. 0001) whereas AoSA did not (P =. 45). Conclusion and Clinical Significance A steep AoSA in GR <b>puppies</b> {{is associated with the}} SAS phenotype in young adulthood. Some GR <b>puppies</b> have an abnormal AoSA that persists in young adulthood and is detectable before peak LVOT velocity reaches levels consistent with SAS...|$|R
40|$|During {{the first}} weeks of life <b>puppies</b> remain {{protected}} against canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV 2) infection thanks to maternally derived antibodies (MDA) absorbed with colostrum after birth. The objective {{of the present study}} was to present the variability in CPV 2 -specific passive immune transfer and its consequences in <b>puppies</b> naturally exposed to the parvovirus. Seventy-nine <b>puppies</b> from one breeding kennel were included in the study at birth and followed until 56  d of age. Once per week the MDA titre for CPV 2 specific antibodies was determined in blood. Viral excretion was also evaluated on a rectal swab by CPV 2 PCR assay and <b>puppies</b> were weighed to determine growth rate. At 2  d of age, thirty-four out of seventy-nine <b>puppies</b> (43  %) had MDA ≤ 1 : 160 (designed group A) and forty-five <b>puppies</b> (57  %) had greater MDA titres (designed group B). The level of absorbed maternal antibodies was shown to be associated with breed size and growth rate during the first 48  h of life. The MDA level declined with age in all cases; however, the proportion of <b>puppies</b> with the antibody level considered as protective against CPV 2 infection was significantly higher in group B compared with A from day 2 until 42. Among all <b>puppies</b> surviving until 56  d of age, sixty-seven out of seventy (95 · 7  %) underwent CPV 2 infection. However, <b>puppies</b> from group A excreted CPV 2 significantly earlier than <b>puppies</b> from group B. The present study demonstrates the link between passive immune transfer, in terms of level of specific MDA absorbed, and length of the protection period against parvovirus infection in weaning <b>puppies...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{study done}} by the six researchers, Topál, Gácsi, Miklósi, Zirányi, Kubinyi, and Csányi compares the {{inherent}} social tendencies between dog <b>puppies</b> and wolf <b>puppies.</b> What these researchers found was that dog <b>puppies</b> showed attachment to their owners and showed to be more responsive to their owner than an unfamiliar person. The wolf <b>puppies</b> did not show to be more responsive to their owners than to an unfamiliar human. Researchers concluded {{that this is a}} genetic difference between species.|$|R
