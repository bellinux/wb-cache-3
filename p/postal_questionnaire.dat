This group was initially formed in 1987 with the researchers of multidisciplinary areas from five European countries; Netherlands, UK, Sweden, Finland, and Norway.

Other required characteristics of the new instrument were capable of being sent as a <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaire</b> for self-completion, easy to complete, applicable to everyone, can produce a single index value, and can take into account the health status ‘worse than dead’.|$|E
40|$|Screening elderly {{individuals}} {{who are at risk}} of functional decline in the community is essential in order to implement effective programmes of assessment and surveillance in a context of secondary prevention. The <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaire</b> technique consists of sending a simple questionnaire to all elderly individuals living in a defined area in order to identify those who are at risk. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and to test its capacity to predict functional decline in community-dwelling elderly people. A 21 -item <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was sent with a birthday card to a representative sample of community-dwelling individuals over the age of 75 years (n = 842). One month after sending the questionnaire, all subjects were contacted by a nurse for an in-home interview (n = 655) that included assessment of functional autonomy. One year later, the subjects (n = 607) were reassessed by the same nurse. Of the eligible subjects, 87. 4 % returned the <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> During the year following the completion of the <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> 43 subjects died, 13 were institutionalized and 109 had experienced a significant decrease on the autonomy scale, for a total annual occurrence of functional decline of 27. 2 %. Age and 14 of the 21 items of the questionnaire were associated with a significant relative risk of functional decline. The relative risk associated with not responding to the questionnaire was 2. 1. A stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that six items were independent predictors of functional decline. This 6 -item Sherbrooke <b>Postal</b> <b>Questionnaire</b> identifies as positive 56 % of the population with 75 % sensitivity and 52 % specificity. We conclude that a <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaire</b> is a feasible and valid technique for screening elderly individuals at risk for functional decline...|$|E
30|$|Seventy-eight {{patients}} receiving lumbar facet joint injections who returned an outcomes questionnaire (responders) were {{age and gender}} matched with 78 patients who did not return the <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaire</b> (non-responders) after facet joint injections. Baseline numerical rating scale (NRS) pain data were collected. NRS and Patients’ Global Impression of Change (PGIC) data were collected 1  month after injection by <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaire</b> or telephone interview.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether or not the outcome data obtained from patients returning <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaires</b> are an accurate reflection of how patients receiving image-guided lumbar facet injections respond. At least at this orthopaedic university hospital patients who return their outcomes <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaires</b> report that they are less likely to experience clinically relevant improvement and significantly more likely to be worse 1  month after lumbar facet injections compared to patients who forgot to return their <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaires</b> but were interviewed via telephone. Therefore, relying only on the data obtained from the <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaires</b> gives a less favourable impression of the outcomes from this intervention. This is not too surprising as it is logical that patients who are still suffering or particularly those who are worse after injection desire to provide feedback. Indeed, several of the envelopes containing the returned <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaires</b> also included hand-written letters with specific details about the patient’s pain and suffering.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Poor {{response}} rates to <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaires</b> can introduce bias {{and reduce the}} statistical power of a study. To improve {{response rates}} in our trial in primary care we tested the effect of introducing an unconditional direct payment of £ 5 for the completion of <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> Methods We recruited patients in general practice with knee problems from sites across the United Kingdom. An evidence-based strategy was used to follow-up patients at twelve months with <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> This included an unconditional direct payment of £ 5 to patients for the completion and return of questionnaires. The first 105 patients did not receive the £ 5 incentive, but the subsequent 442 patients did. We used logistic regression to analyse the effect of introducing a monetary incentive to increase the response to <b>postal</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> Results The response rate following reminders for the historical controls was 78. 1 % (82 of 105) compared with 88. 0 % (389 of 442) for those patients who received the £ 5 payment (diff = 9. 9 %, 95 % CI 2. 3 % to 19. 1 %). Direct payments significantly increased the odds of response (adjusted odds ratio = 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 2 to 4. 0, P = 0. 009) with only 12 of 442 patients declining the payment. The incentive did not save costs to the trial – the extra cost per additional respondent was almost £ 50.

RESULTS: The odds of response {{were more than}} doubled when a monetary incentive was used (odds ratio 2. 02; 95 % confidence interval 1. 79 to 2. 27) and almost doubled when incentives were not conditional on response (1. 71; 1. 29 to 2. 26). Response was more likely when short questionnaires were used (1. 86; 1. 55 to 2. 24). Personalised questionnaires and letters increased response (1. 16; 1. 06 to 1. 28), as did the use of coloured ink (1. 39; 1. 16 to 1. 67). The odds of response were more than doubled when the questionnaires were sent by recorded delivery (2. 21; 1. 51 to 3. 25) and increased when stamped return envelopes were used (1. 26; 1. 13 to 1. 41) and questionnaires were sent by first class post (1. 12; 1. 02 to 1. 23). Contacting participants before sending questionnaires increased response (1. 54; 1. 24 to 1. 92), as did follow up contact (1. 44; 1. 22 to 1. 70) and providing non-respondents with a second copy of the questionnaire (1. 41; 1. 02 to 1. 94).

A prospective study was designed and analysed as a case-control: postal questionnaires were sent to 138 patients together with a randomly assigned stamped or post-free return envelope. The percentage of responders was 60 % (n= 78) and we found no significant differences in response rates according to the mailing strategy (58 % for stamped and 62 % for post-free return envelopes, p = 0. 786). The time gap between hospital discharge and sending of the questionnaire had no significant influence in the response rate.
