25|$|A 2007 Uruguayan law {{mandates}} {{a minimum}} of 5% of ethanol blended with gasoline starting in January 2015. The monopolic, state-owned fuel producer ANCAP started blending <b>premium</b> <b>gasoline</b> with 10% of bioethanol in December 2009, which {{will be available in}} all the country by early January 2010.

25|$|The {{product of}} the unit, the alkylate, is {{composed}} of a mixture of high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). Alkylate is a <b>premium</b> <b>gasoline</b> blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and is clean burning. The octane number of the alkylate depends mainly upon the kind of alkenes used and upon operating conditions. For example, isooctane results from combining butylene with isobutane and has an octane rating of 100 by definition. There are other products in the alkylate effluent, however, so the octane rating will vary accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Because ethanol {{contains}} {{close to}} 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs {{have a lower}} mileage per gallon than gasoline. However, this lower energy content does not translate directly into a 34% reduction in miles per U.S. gallon, {{because there are many}} other variables that affect the performance of a particular fuel in a particular engine, though for E85 the effect becomes significant. E85 will produce lower mileage than gasoline, and actual performance may vary depending on the vehicle. Based on EPA EPA-rated mileage for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline. When making price comparisons it has to be considered that E85 has octane rating of about 104 and {{could be used as a}} substitute for <b>premium</b> <b>gasoline.</b>|$|E
5000|$|India: India's {{ordinary}} and <b>premium</b> <b>gasolines</b> are of 91 RON. The <b>premium</b> <b>gasolines</b> are generally ordinary fuels with additives, {{that do not}} really change the octane value. Two variants, [...] "Speed 93" [...] and [...] "Speed 97", were launched, with RON values of 93 and 97. India's economy-class vehicles usually have compression ratios under 10:1, thus enabling them to use lower-octane gasoline without engine knocking.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} use of a blend of 85% fuel ethanol blended with 15% gasoline. This fuel blend called E85, has a higher fuel octane than most <b>premium</b> <b>gasolines.</b> When used in a modern Flexible fuel vehicle, it delivers more performance to the gasoline it replaces at the expense of higher fuel consumption due to ethanol's lesser specific energy content.|$|R
500|$|Most filling {{stations}} in Europe sell {{three types of}} fuel: unleaded, LRP, and diesel. Although these products lack any real brand differentiation, this {{has not always been}} the case. Until well into the 1970s, Gulf (in common with other oil companies) sold distinctive brands of petrol/gasoline including subregular Gulftane, Good Gulf regular, Gulf No-Nox premium, and Gulf Super Unleaded (aka Gulfcrest). Gulf petrol was sold using the slogans [...] "Good Gulf Gasoline," [...] and [...] "Gulf – the Gas with Guts." [...] Gulf service stations often supplied customers with pens and key rings bearing these slogans. For a few years, beginning in 1966, Gulf {{stations in}} the U.S. gave away orange plastic [...] "Extra Kick Horseshoes" [...] to customers who filled their tanks with Gulf's No-Nox <b>premium</b> <b>gasoline</b> (the novelty items were commonly mounted on bumpers).|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2016 {{model year}} the Volt {{required}} <b>premium</b> <b>gasoline</b> of (R+M)/2 octane rating of 91 or higher because the higher octane permitted the 10.5:1 compression ratio engine to utilize more ignition timing advance {{in order to}} maximize its fuel efficiency by 5 to 10% as compared to regular gasoline. For users who drive mostly in electric mode and to avoid maintenance problems caused by storing the same gasoline in the tank for months, the 2011 Volt has a sealed and pressurized fuel tank to avoid evaporation, and as a result, the fuel filler has to be depressurized before opening the tank. Also the engine management system monitors the time between engine running and it is programmed to prompt the driver to run past the [...] all-electric range before recharging in order to consume some gasoline. If the driver does not run on gasoline, the system will automatically run the maintenance mode which starts the engine to consume some of the aging fuel and circulate the fluids within the engine. A configuration with an E85 flex-fuel capable engine is under development and was expected to be available in 2013.|$|E
500|$|According to Consumer Reports in December 2011, the Chevrolet Volt {{fuel cost}} in {{electric}} mode was 3.8¢/mile, while the Nissan Leaf had {{a cost of}} 3.5¢/mi. The Volt's higher cost per mile was attributed to its heavier weight. Their estimates used the U.S. national average electricity rate of 11¢/ (...) and energy consumption rates as measured on their own, unofficial tests. When comparing the Volt in range-extended mode with the four most fuel efficient gasoline-powered cars as tested by the magazine, the plug-in hybrid had a cost of 12.5¢/mi (using <b>premium</b> <b>gasoline)</b> while the Toyota Prius had a cost of 8.6¢/mi., the Honda Civic Hybrid 9.5¢/mi., the Toyota Corolla 11.9¢/mi., and the Hyundai Elantra 13.1¢/mi. The analysis also found that, on trips up to , the Volt was cheaper to drive than the other four cars because the Volt was able to drive [...] using less expensive electric power. Consumer Reports found that, using their proprietary testing, the Volt overall fuel efficiency was [...] equivalent (MPG-e), and using only range-extended mode the overall fuel economy was [...] and equivalent to the Toyota Corolla. The report noted that, , plug-in electric cars are more expensive to buy, and the previous operating costs do not include maintenance, depreciation or other costs.|$|E
2500|$|While most oil {{companies}} were switching to leaded gasolines en masse during the mid-to-late 1920s, American Oil chose to continue marketing its premium-grade [...] "Amoco-Gas" [...] (later Amoco Super-Premium) as a lead-free gasoline by using aromatics rather than tetraethyllead to increase octane levels, decades before {{the environmental movement}} of the early 1970s led to more stringent auto-emission controls which ultimately mandated the universal phase out of leaded gasoline. The [...] "Amoco" [...] lead-free gasoline was sold at American's stations in the eastern and southern U.S. alongside American Regular gasoline, which was a leaded fuel.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this study}} was to assess the effect of using two kinds of lead-free gasoline [including 92 -lead-free gasoline (92 -LFG) and 95 -lead-free gasoline (95 -LFG), rated according to their octane levels] to replace the use of <b>premium</b> leaded <b>gasoline</b> (PLG) on the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their corresponding benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaP eq) amounts from the gasoline-powered engine. The results show that the three gasoline fuels originally contained similar total PAHs and total BaP eq contents; however, we found significant differences in the engine exhausts in both contents. The above results suggest that PAHs originally contained in the gasoline fuel did not affect the PAH emissions in the engine exhausts. The emission factors of both total PAHs and total BaP eq obtained from the three gasoline fuels shared the same trend: 95 -LFG> PLG> 92 -LFG. The above result suggests that when PLG was replaced by 95 -LFG, the emissions would increase in both total PAHs and total BaP eq, but when replaced by 92 -LFG would lead to the decreased emissions of both contents. By taking emission factors and their corresponding annual gasoline consumption rates into account, we found that both total PAH and total BaP eq emissions increased from 1994 to 1999. However, the annual increasing rates in total BaP eq emissions were slightly higher than the corresponding increasing rates in total PAHs.
