25|$|Very {{recently}} the orphan OA1 receptor has been de-orphaned. Studies showed that L-DOPA is the specific ligand for the OA1 receptor. L-DOPA is {{a by-product of}} melanin biosynthetic pathway. During melanin synthesis, L-DOPA is released to the retina in the retinal <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> and is necessary for specific stages of retinal development. Activation of the OA1 receptor by L-DOPA leads to the secretion of a neurotropic factor by the retinal <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> that helps in normal retinal development.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUpon morphogenesis, {{the simple}} neuroepithelium of the optic vesicle {{gives rise to}} four basic tissues in the {{vertebrate}} optic cup: <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> sensory neural retina, secretory ciliary body and muscular iris. <b>Pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> and neural retina are established through interactions with specific environments and signals: periocular mesenchyme/BMP specifies <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> and surface ectoderm/FGF specifies neural retina. The anterior portions (iris and ciliary body) are specified through interactions with lens although the molecular mechanisms of induction have not been deciphered. As lens {{is a source of}} FGF, we examined whether this factor was involved in inducing ciliary body. We forced the <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> of the embryonic chick eye to express FGF 4. Infected cells and their immediate neighbors were transformed into neural retina. At a distance from the FGF signal, the tissue transitioned back into <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Ciliary body tissue was found in the transitioning zone. The ectopic ciliary body was never in contact with the lens tissue. In order to assess the contribution of the lens on the specification of normal ciliary body, we created optic cups in which the lens had been removed while still pre-lens ectoderm. Ciliary body tissue was identified in the anterior portion of lens-less optic cups. We propose that the ciliary body may be specified at optic vesicle stages, at the same developmental stage when the neural retina and <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> are specified and we present a model as to how this could be accomplished through overlapping BMP and FGF signals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{investigate}} {{the complexity of}} alternative splicing in the retina, we sequenced and analyzed a total of 115, 706 clones from normalized cDNA libraries from mouse neural retina (66, 217) and rat retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> (49, 489). Based upon clustering the cDNAs and mapping them with their respective genomes, the estimated numbers of genes were 9, 134 for the mouse neural retina and 12, 050 for the rat retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> libraries. This unique collection of retinal of messenger RNAs is maintained and accessible through a web-base server to the whole community of retinal biologists for further functional characterization. The analysis revealed 3, 248 and 3, 202 alternative splice events for mouse neural retina and rat retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> respectively. We focused on transcription factors involved in vision. Among the six candidates suitable for functional analysis, we selected Otx 2 S, a novel variant of the Otx 2 gene with a deletion within the homeodomain sequence. Otx 2 S is expressed in both the neural retina and retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> and encodes a protein that is targeted to the nucleus. OTX 2 S exerts transdominant activity on the tyrosinase promoter when tested in the physiological environment of primary RPE cells. By overexpressing OTX 2 S in primary RPE cells using an adeno associated viral vector, we identified 10 genes whose expression is positively regulated by OTX 2 S. We find that OTX 2 S is able to bind to the chromatin at the promoter of the retinal dehydrogenase 10 (RDH 10) gene...|$|R
50|$|The ora serrata is the {{serrated}} junction {{between the}} retina and the ciliary body. This junction marks {{the transition from}} the simple, non-photosensitive area of the ciliary body to the complex, multi-layered, photosensitive region of the retina. The pigmented layer is continuous over choroid, ciliary body and iris while the nervous layer terminates just before the ciliary body. This point is the ora serrata. In this region the <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> of the retina transitions into the outer <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> of the ciliary body and the inner portion of the retina transitions into the non-pigmented epithelium of the cilia. In animals in which the region does not have a serrated appearance, it is called the ora ciliaris retinae.|$|R
25|$|CSCR is {{a disease}} in which a serous {{detachment}} of the neurosensory retina occurs over an area of leakage from the choriocapillaris through the retinal <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> (RPE).

25|$|The {{ciliary body}} is {{triangular}} in horizontal section and is coated by a double layer, the ciliary epithelium. The inner layer is transparent and covers the vitreous body, and is continuous from the neural tissue of the retina. The outer layer is highly pigmented, continuous with the retinal <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium,</b> and constitutes {{the cells of}} the dilator muscle.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, animal models {{suggest that}} the retinal <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> fails to phagocytose the outer rod segment discs that have been shed, leading to an {{accumulation}} of outer rod segment debris. In mice that are homozygous recessive for retinal degeneration mutation, rod photoreceptors stop developing and undergo degeneration before cellular maturation completes. A defect in cGMP-phosphodiesterase has also been documented; this leads to toxic levels of cGMP.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies of}} mouse embryos {{concluded}} {{that after the}} optic vesicle evaginates from the ventral forebrain and contacts the surface ectoderm, signals from the ectoderm specify the distal region of the optic vesicle to become retina and signals from the optic vesicle induce the lens. Germline deletion of Bmp 4 resulted in failure of lens formation. We performed conditional deletion of Bmp 4 from the optic vesicle to test the function of Bmp 4 in murine eye development. The optic vesicle evaginated normally and contacted the surface ectoderm. Lens induction did not occur. The optic cup failed to form and the expression of retina-specific genes decreased markedly in the distal optic vesicle. Instead, cells in the prospective retina expressed genes characteristic of the retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium.</b> We conclude that Bmp 4 is required for retina specification in mice. In the absence of Bmp 4, formation of the retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> is the default differentiation pathway of the optic vesicle. Differences in the signaling pathways required for specification of the retina and retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> in chicken and mouse embryos suggest major changes in signaling during {{the evolution of the}} vertebrate eye...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} understanding of pigment cell biology, we developed a method to concomitantly purify melanocytes, iridophores, and retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> from zebrafish, and analyzed their transcriptomes. Comparing expression data from these cell types and whole embryos allowed us to reveal gene expression co-enrichment in melanocytes and retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> {{as well as in}} melanocytes and iridophores. We found 214 genes co-enriched in melanocytes and retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> indicating the shared functions of melanin-producing cells. We found 62 genes significantly co-enriched in melanocytes and iridophores, illustrative of their shared developmental origins from the neural crest. This is also the first analysis of the iridophore transcriptome. Gene expression analysis for iridophores revealed extensive enrichment of specific enzymes to coordinate production of their guanine-based reflective pigment. We speculate the coordinated upregulation of specific enzymes from several metabolic pathways recycles the rate-limiting substrate for purine synthesis, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, thus constituting a guanine cycle. The purification procedure and expression analysis described here, along with the accompanying transcriptome-wide expression data, provide the first mRNA sequencing data for multiple purified zebrafish pigment cell types, and will be a useful resource for further studies of pigment cell biology...|$|R
40|$|In an {{ophthalmologic}} {{study of}} 90 children with symptomatic giardiasis, ocular alterations {{were found in}} 10. Eight of these subjects presented an extensive "salt and pepper" degeneration of the <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> involving 360 degrees of the midperiphery of both eyes. In {{one of the eight}} children, the <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> showed atrophic areas, and in another there was a small hard exudate in the left eye. Of 2 remaining of the 10 children with ocular alterations, 1 presented with slight decoloration of the temporal half of the optic disc, and the other was affected by chorioretinitis. After single-dose antiprotozoic therapy (tinidazole 50 mg/kg), parasitologic tests were negative in all subjects and remained so throughout a 1 -year follow-up. However, the characteristic epithelial lesion remained unaltered in all eight children for the entire follow-up period, as well as the optic disc decoloration in the only observed case. The child affected by chorioretinitis recovered after 3 weeks of combined treatment with bethametasone plus deflazacort. In two control groups, 1 of 200 healthy children and 1 of 200 children with gastrointestinal symptoms but without giardiasis, no case of "salt and pepper" degeneration of the <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> or other significant ocular alterations was found...|$|R

25|$|Ocular {{albinism}} type 1 (OA1), {{also called}} Nettleshipâ€“Falls syndrome, {{is the most}} common type of ocular albinism, with a prevalence rate of 1:50,000. It is an inheritable classical Mendelian type X-linked recessive disorder wherein the retinal <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> lacks pigment while hair and skin appear normal. Since it is usually an X-linked disorder, it occurs mostly in males, while females are carriers unless they are homozygous. About 60 missense and nonsense mutations, insertions, and deletions have been identified in Oa1. Mutations in OA1 have been linked to defective glycosylation and thus improper intracellular transportation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt {{has long}} been {{maintained}} that the ciliary muscle derives from mesenchymal cells. The embryonic development of the avian ciliary muscle was studied in chick embryos from stage 25 HH {{to the time of}} hatching. Serial sections of the eye were stained routinely or immunocytochemically using the monoclonal antibody 13 F 4, which recognizes a cytoplasmic antigen specific for all types of muscle cells. We found that the mesenchymal immunoreactive cells, at stage 37 HH, are arranged in two distinct orientations forming the anterior and posterior portions of the ciliary muscle. At stages 38 and 39 HH the <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> contained 13 F 4 positive cells, which detach from the epithelium and apparently migrate into stroma. These epithelial cells may differentiate into muscle cells. Within this same time period a progressive accumulation of myoblasts was detected between the <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> and the ciliary muscle. Some myoblasts containing melanin were also observed. At stage 40 HH the internal portion of the ciliary muscle was visible. These findings indicate that the immunopositive epithelial cells participate {{in the formation of the}} internal portion of the muscle. We conclude that the ciliary muscle derives not only from the mesenchymal cells but also from the <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This report {{presents}} multimodal imaging of a 27 -year-old woman {{diagnosed with}} benign familial fleck retina (OMIM 228980), an uncommon disorder. Fundus photographs revealed retinal flecks that affected her post-equatorial retina but spared the macular area. Fundus autofluorescence and infrared imaging demonstrated a symmetrical pattern of yellow-white fleck lesions that affected both eyes. Her full-field electroretinogram and electrooculogram were normal. An {{optical coherence tomography}} B-scan was performed for both eyes, revealing increased thickness of the retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> leading to multiple small <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> detachments.

25|$|Microscopic {{examination}} of retinal <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> and skin pigment cells (melanocytes) of people affected by ocular albinism type 1 reveal {{the presence of}} characteristic macromelanosomes, even though skin appears normal. Studies from Oa1 knock-out mice reveal that these giant melanosomes appear due to abnormal growth of a single melanosome and not due to aggregation or fusion of many melanosomes. These melanin macroglobules are probably formed due to failure of melanosomes to separate from the ER-golgi system with the accumulation of enzymes and other secretory proteins leading to an increase organelle size. However, Incerti, et al. contradict the above theory.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indirect}} symptoms characterize Retinitis Pigmentosa {{along with the}} direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline. Phenomena such as photophobia, which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, and photopsia, the presence of blinking or shimmering lights within the visual field, often manifest during the later stages of RP. Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the {{fundus of the eye}} as the Ophthalamic triad. This includes the development of (1) a mottled appearance of the retinal <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> (RPE) caused by bone spicule formation, (2) a waxy appearance of the optic nerve, and (3) the attentuation of blood vessels in the retina.|$|E
25|$|The eye focuses {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light onto the retina. A laser beam can be focused to an intensity on the retina {{which may be}} up to 200,000 times higher than {{at the point where}} the laser beam enters the eye. Most of the light is absorbed by melanin pigments in the <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> just behind the photoreceptors, and causes burns in the retina. Ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 400nm tends to be absorbed by lens and 300nm in the cornea, where it can produce injuries at relatively low powers due to photochemical damage. Infrared light mainly causes thermal damage to the retina at near-infrared wavelengths and to more frontal parts of the eye at longer wavelengths. The table below summarizes the various medical conditions caused by lasers at different wavelengths, not including injuries due to pulsed lasers.|$|E
40|$|The {{ciliary body}} and iris are {{pigmented}} epithelial {{structures in the}} anterior eye segment that function to maintain correct intra-ocular pressure and regulate exposure of the internal eye structures to light, respectively. The cellular and molecular factors that mediate {{the development of the}} ciliary body and iris from the ocular <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we have investigated the role of Notch signaling during the development of the anterior <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> by using genetic loss- and gain-of-function approaches. Loss of canonical Notch signaling results in normal iris development but absence of the ciliary body. This causes progressive hypotony and over time leads to phthisis bulbi, a condition characterized by shrinkage of the eye and loss of structure/function. Conversely, Notch gain-of-function results in aniridia and profound ciliary body hyperplasia, which causes ocular hypertension and glaucoma-like disease. Collectively, these data indicate that Notch signaling promotes ciliary body development at the expense of iris formation and reveals novel animal models of human ocular pathologies...|$|R

The P 2 Y 1 receptor was present mainly in cornea, ciliary processes, and trabecular meshwork. The P 2 Y 2 receptors were present in cornea, ciliary processes and retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium.</b> P 2 Y 4 was present in cornea, ciliary processes, photoreceptors, outer plexiform layer and ganglion cell layer.

Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and retinal <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E

Morpholino knockdown of Rdh 5 phenocopied the apc mutant retinal differentiation defects and was rescued by treatment with exogenous all-trans retinoic acid. Microarray analyses of apc mutants and Rdh 5 morphants revealed a profound overlap in the transcriptional profile of these embryos.

40|$|International audienceInherited retinal degenerations are {{blinding}} diseases {{characterized by}} the loss of photoreceptors. Their extreme genetic heterogeneity complicates treatment by gene therapy. This has motivated broader strategies for transplantation of healthy retinal <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> to protect photoreceptors independently of the gene causing the disease. The limited clinical benefit for visual function reported up to now is mainly due to dedifferentiation of the transplanted cells that undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We have studied this mechanism in vitro and revealed the role of the homeogene OTX 2 in preventing dedifferentiation through the regulation of target genes. We have overexpressed OTX 2 in retinal pigmented epithelial cells before their transplantation in the eye of a model of retinitis pigmentosa carrying a mutation in Mertk, a gene specifically expressed by retinal pigmented epithelial cells. OTX 2 increases significantly the protection of photoreceptors as seen by histological and functional analyses.
