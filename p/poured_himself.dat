500|$|In November 1950, Namuth and Pollock's {{relationship}} came to {{an abrupt}} conclusion. [...] After coming in from the cold-weather shoot of the glass painting, Pollock, who had been treated in the 1930s for alcoholism, <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> a tumbler of bourbon whiskey after supposedly having been sober for two years. [...] An argument between Namuth and Pollock ensued with each calling the other a [...] "phony", culminating in Pollock overturning a table of food and dinnerware in front of several guests. [...] From then on, Pollock reverted to a more figure-oriented style of painting, leading some to say that Namuth's sessions robbed Pollock of his rawness and made Pollock come to feel disingenuous about doing things for the camera that he had originally done spontaneously. [...] Art critic Jonathan Jones suggests that by filming Pollock, Namuth [...] "broke the myth of trance" [...] and by framing Pollock's work in the larger surrounding landscape, destroyed Pollock's view that his paintings were boundless. [...] Jeffrey Potter, a close friend of Pollock's, described Namuth as commanding, frequently telling Pollock when to start and stop painting. [...] According to Potter, Pollock [...] "felt what was happening was phony." [...] Namuth himself describes Pollock as being [...] "very nervous and very self-conscious" [...] of the filming at the time, but less so when Pollock discussed it in a later interview.|$|E
500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak is {{a radical}} {{departure}} from West's previous hip hop albums. According to 33⅓ writer Kirk Walker Graves, 808s & Heartbreak is an avant-garde electropop album. Rolling Stone magazine called it an [...] "introspective, synthpop album," [...] while The 405 described it as West's [...] "experimental pop record." [...] According to The Independent, West abandoned his customary hip hop sound in favor of sparse, drum machine-based electropop. Pitchforks Scott Plagenhoef also categorized the album as [...] "an introspective, minimal electro-pop record", but added that it is [...] "steeped in regret, pain, and even more self-examination than a typical Kanye West album". Music writer Robert Christgau called it a [...] "slow, sad-ass and self-involved ... breakup album" [...] and analyzed that West's choice to [...] "robotize as well as pitch-correct his voice both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties". Christgau asserted that its final track [...] "Pinocchio Story" [...] is [...] "the only track here about what's really bringing [...] down: not the loss of his girlfriend but the death of his mother, during cosmetic surgery that somewhere not too deep down he's sure traces all too directly to his alienated fame." [...] Andre Grant of HipHopDX wrote that [...] "to combat this trenchant melancholia, he <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> into an all-autotunes R album" [...] which would prove divisive in hip hop. West's singing has been characterized as [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "nearly unmelodic" [...] which [...] "underscores his own cyborgish detachment." [...] Canadian writer Stephen Marche viewed that West used [...] "the shallow musical gimmickry of Auto-Tune, a program designed to eliminate individuality, and produced a hauntingly personal album." ...|$|E
