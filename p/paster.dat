5|$|Although Littleprincessemma, American Pharoah's dam, is the {{half-sister}} to graded stakes winner Storm Wolf, and to Misty Rosette, {{winner of}} the Old Hat Stakes in 2006, her own undistinguished racing career, combined with the modest record of her sire, Yankee Gentleman, dampened initial public expectations for her second-born foal. Yet American Pharoah's maternal bloodline includes Storm Cat, a Grade I winner retired early due to injury, Northern Dancer, a Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, and Terlingua, a celebrated broodmare, through whom he is a fifth-generation descendant of Secretariat. He is also descended through his dam from Flying <b>Paster,</b> a Grade I champion who was 1978 California Horse of the Year, and Exclusive Native (sire of Affirmed and Genuine Risk). Through both sire and dam, American Pharoah is a fifth- and sixth-generation descendant of Bold Ruler, {{as well as a}} sixth- and seventh-generation descendant of Tom Fool, one of the top thoroughbreds of the last century. His tail-female line traces back to The Oldfield Mare, foaled circa 1695.|$|E

25|$|The Reading Room officially {{opened in}} January 1933 and today {{contains}} reference works for easy accessibility to readers. From 1977 to 1983, the Folger Shakespeare Library was renovated. Design {{was provided by}} Hartman-Cox Architects. During this renovation, it included the addition of new book stacks, renovation of office spaces, and an expansion to the Reading Room. A second, more modern reading room dedicated as the Theodora Sedgwick Bond-William Ross Bond Memorial Reading Room was completed in 1982.

25|$|The {{land was}} {{purchased}} {{on the corner}} of Kent Avenue and East Van Buren Street in Elmhurst. This was only four blocks from land that had recently been purchased by Timothy Christian School so that it could move West from Cicero. Jay De Vries was the pastor of the congregation when it moved to Elmhurst in 1964. The new brick edifice was the church home of about sixty families and the congregation renamed itself Elmhurst Christian Reformed Church. De Vries was followed by pastors Garrett Stoutmeyer, Wayne Leys, and Bert De Jong. Peter Semeyn took over as the senior <b>paster</b> in 2011. On June 14, 1990, the church's steeple was struck by lightning. After smoldering through the early morning hours, flames began shooting from the steeple by sunrise and the church building experienced severe damage. The congregation met in several other facilities in the area—including the nearby Drury Lane Theater and Bryan Junior High School—but soon rebuilt and recovered. The church continued to grow until it had around 1,000 members in the mid-1990s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the church began to outgrow its location in spite of the annexation of several nearby properties. In 2009, the congregation made another move after constructing new building a few blocks to the south. The original Elmhurst property was sold to the Diocese of South-West America of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church for use as a new parish church building. By 2012, the church had a membership of 1,542, {{making it one of the}} largest congregations in the denomination.|$|E

Three of the men wore cotton overalls the first week and Terylene overalls the second; the other three men wore Terylene overalls the first week and cotton overalls the second. The mean lead-in-air concentration in the breathing zone when the men wore Terylene overalls was slightly greater than when they wore cotton overalls but the difference was not statistically significant. Significant differences of lead-in-air concentrations were found between men and between the two weeks but not between days within the weeks. The lead-in-air concentration did not increase during the week. Neither a change to Terylene overalls nor more frequent laundering of overalls should be recommended for <b>pasters</b> in this factory {{on the basis of this}} study...|$|R

40|$|Frustrated {{with the}} anti-intellectualism and {{academic}} conservatism {{of the early}} sixteenth century, Erasmus, in his lengthy commentary on ???The Labors of Hercules??? adage, attempts to justify his thankless and debilitating scholarly work by analogizing it to the labors of the mythic Greco-Roman strongman. My dissertation focuses on the way he and other early modern educational theorists translate learning and cognitive processes into the materialistic, embodied masculinist terms that their male aristocratic readers would understand and therefore value. Unlike the curricular-ideological analyses of traditional early modern education scholarship that ignore embodiment altogether or the analyses of more recent scholarship informed by Marxist and postmodern theories of embodiment, I provide a more sustained, historically contextualized analysis of those treatises {{in terms of the}} classically-inherited medical discourses that actually shaped them. In that regard, my dissertation brings the critical orientation of early modern body studies (generated in large part by Gail Kern <b>Paster???s</b> seminal study The Body Embarrassed) to bear on early modern educational treatises, specifically as those treatises address the bodies of (male) children, in an as yet unexplored way. As my title suggests, masculinity in the Renaissance was not thought a biological given but rather a part of an anxious performative process. Therefore, I spend considerable time exploring the way in which theories of women???s psychophysiological inferiority define and threaten male subjectivity. Specifically, I argue that educational treatises are so focused on??? really obsessed with??? the vulnerably constituted bodies of male children and the health benefits of a proper diet and exercise, because they are haunted by the authoritative role of women during early child development. These treatises, I also argue, ironically re-construct and employ aristocratic women, specifically Elizabeth I, as negative-sedentary somatic ideals against which the female knowledge and authority of mothers, nurses, and midwives are implicitly critiqued and displaced and the psychophysiological superiority of aristocratic men confirmed. While physical exercise as a form of performative masculinity is key to that displacement, it also importantly represents a crucial method by which to domesticate or civilize aristocratic men to fit, as Norbert Elias describes, the nonviolent exigencies of early modern court society. Indeed, I argue that physical exercise is part of a disciplinary process intended to internalize nonviolent dispositions. Much of the period???s literary production confronts the behavioral and affective implications of this process, and I conclude this study by exploring those implications in two literary texts: Fran??ois Rabelais???s Gargantua and Shakespeare???s The Taming of the Shrew...|$|R
