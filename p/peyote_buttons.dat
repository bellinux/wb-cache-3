500|$|L. williamsii is {{native to}} {{northern}} Mexico and southern Texas. Individual stems are about [...] high with a diameter of , and {{may be found in}} clumps up to [...] wide. A large part of the stem is usually below ground. Mescaline is concentrated in the photosynthetic portion of the stem above ground. The center of the stem, which contains the growing point (the apical meristem), is sunken. Experienced collectors of peyote remove a thin slice {{from the top of the}} plant, leaving the growing point intact, thus allowing the plant to regenerate. Evidence indicates peyote was in use more than 5,500 years ago; dried <b>peyote</b> <b>buttons</b> presumed to be from a site on the Rio Grande, Texas, were radiocarbon dated to around 3780–3660 BC. Peyote is perceived as a means of accessing the spirit world. Attempts by the Roman Catholic church to suppress its use after the Spanish conquest were largely unsuccessful, and by the middle of the 20th century, peyote was more widely used than ever by indigenous peoples as far north as Canada. It is now used formally by the Native American Church.|$|E

While he agreed it [...] "makes a beautiful design," [...] in this rare instance a picture would do—"don't send samples, thank you." [...] Presumably the same warning held for the [...] "magic" [...] mushrooms and <b>peyote</b> <b>buttons</b> that graced others' boots.|$|E
50|$|Michele Kubby won an {{acquittal}} on all charges. Steve Kubby's trial, owing to one juror's refusal to acquit, received a mistrial {{on all the}} cannabis charges, which were eventually dropped. The jury also voted to convict on a possession charge involving a psilocybin mushroom stem and a few <b>peyote</b> <b>buttons</b> (a felony) found in their house. Kubby was sentenced to 120 days in jail.|$|E

50|$|In 2005 {{researchers}} used {{radiocarbon dating}} and alkaloid analysis to study two specimens of <b>peyote</b> <b>buttons</b> found in archaeological digs from a site called Shumla Cave No. 5 on the Rio Grande in Texas. The results dated the specimens to between 3780 and 3660 BCE. Alkaloid extraction yielded approximately 2% of the alkaloids including mescaline in both samples. This indicates that native North Americans {{were likely to}} have used peyote since at least {{five and a half}} thousand years ago.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. John Raleigh Briggs (1851-1907) was {{the first}} to draw {{scientific}} attention of the Western scientific world to peyote. Louis Lewin described Anhalonium lewinii in 1888. Arthur Heffter conducted self experiments on its effects in 1897. Similarly, Norwegian ethnographer Carl Sofus Lumholtz studied and wrote about the use of peyote among the Indians of Mexico. Lumholtz also reported that, lacking other intoxicants, Texas Rangers captured by Union forces during the American Civil War soaked <b>peyote</b> <b>buttons</b> in water and became [...] "intoxicated with the liquid". Arguably, this is the first documented use of peyote by non-Native Americans.|$|E
5000|$|When {{used for}} its psychoactive properties, common doses for pure {{mescaline}} range from roughly 200 to 400 mg. This translates to {{a dose of}} roughly 10 to 20 g of dried <b>peyote</b> <b>buttons</b> of average potency; however, potency varies considerably between samples, {{making it difficult to}} measure doses accurately without first extracting the mescaline. The effects last about 10 to 12 hours. Peyote is reported to trigger states of [...] "deep introspection and insight" [...] that have been described as being of a metaphysical or spiritual nature. At times, these can be accompanied by rich visual or auditory effects (see synesthesia).|$|E
50|$|Metal jewelry {{came to the}} Plains through Spanish and Mexican metalsmiths {{and trade}} with tribes from other regions. Southern Plains Native Americans adopted metalsmithing in the 1820s. They {{typically}} cut, stamped, and cold hammered German silver, a nickel alloy. Plains men adopted metal pectorals and armbands. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, members of the Native American Church revealed their membership to others through pins with emblems of <b>peyote</b> <b>buttons,</b> water bird, and other religious symbols. Bruce Caesar (Sac and Fox-Pawnee) {{is one of the}} most prolific Southern Plains metalsmiths active today and was awarded the NEA's National Heritage Fellowship in 1998. US Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell (Northern Cheyenne) is an accomplished silversmith.|$|E
50|$|Later that day, {{they are}} {{approached}} by a Mexican gunman named Chaco who offers to protect and hunt for the group. They accept {{and for a while}} things go well, until Chaco saves the group from lawmen and then proceeds to mercilessly torture the surviving lawman to everyone's disgust. Despite this the group accepts the gift of <b>peyote</b> <b>buttons</b> which they all take by the campfire. In the morning they all awaken to being tied. Chaco taunts and beats the men, rapes Bunny, shoots Clem in the leg and leaves them for dead. Stubby, Bunny and Bud manage to put Clem on a stretcher and quietly witness Chaco meet up with his bandit compatriots. Together the bandits decimate the evangelists that the four had met earlier.|$|E
5000|$|A Cheri Oteri sketch. Debuted May 10, 1997. Collette Reardon was a disheveled {{middle-aged woman}} who {{appeared}} to be significantly impaired by some drug or mixture of drugs. In the first two sketches, she would show up in a pharmacy with a stack of numerous prescriptions for unbelievably large supplies and large doses of an assortment of drugs, most of which were notorious for being addictive. Some of the prescriptions would be for clearly recreational drugs, such as <b>peyote</b> <b>buttons,</b> that would not be available in a pharmacy. The pharmacist (often played by the guest host of the episode) was naturally skeptical of the legitimacy of the prescriptions. Subsequently, she appeared on Weekend Update as an [...] "expert" [...] and in situations where her impairment was particularly inappropriate.|$|E
50|$|L. williamsii is {{native to}} {{northern}} Mexico and southern Texas. Individual stems are about 2 - 6 cm high with a diameter of 4 - 11 cm, and {{may be found in}} clumps up to 1 m wide.
