This equilibrium is characterized by unilateral dumping by the foreign firm into the domestic economy. Two instruments of anti-dumping (AD) policy are examined, namely, a <b>price</b> <b>undertaking</b> (PU) and an anti-dumping duty.

40|$|Traditional {{tests of}} asset <b>pricing</b> <b>undertaken</b> within the CAPM {{framework}} have provided mixed results.

The paper utilises 16 years of daily data in the Australian equity market and extends existing research by investigating the effect of intervaling by conducting tests over different sampling frequencies. While some support is found for the GARCH-M specification, the inability of the "in-mean" parameter to achieve statistical significance is an empirical limitation. Despite this finding, the conditional CAPM is supported for weekly and monthly return data, however on balance, the greatest support for the model is found in the weekly return interval. Thus, we demonstrate that asset pricing tests in this context are sensitive to the return interval...|$|R

This investigation therefore set out to control for nonsynchronous trading and non-trading effects and volatility clustering in the Norwegian equity market. The problem is approached by applying a linear ARMA-GARCH-in-mean lag specification. The ARMA lag specification controls for nonsynchronous trading and non-trading effects in the mean equation. The GARCH lag specification controls for conditional heteroscedasticity and volatility clustering in the latent conditional volatility equation. All lags are Schwarz efficient. The {{results suggest that the}} conditional CAPM cannot be rejected but the in-mean parameter in ARMA-GARCH-in-mean specifications show very low statistical significance except for daily data. The result therefore suggests a compensation for risk only for short time-horizons and the in-mean parameter in ARMA-GARCH-in-mean lag specifications is a poor proxy for risk in the conditional CAPM sense. Conditional heteroscedasticity and volatility clustering need to be controlled for in daily and weekly time intervals while nonsynchronous trading needs to be controlled for in daily, weekly and monthly time intervals. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{different}} aspects of trade theory and policy. One of the main objections {{to the theory of}} strategic trade policy is that it presumes too much knowledge on the part of governments. The design of an optimal tariff in the presence of incomplete information is analysed in Chapter 2. In a Cournot duopoly model of international competition between a domestic and a foreign firm, it is shown that when the domestic firm and government have incomplete information about the marginal cost of a foreign firm, trade policy can be effectively designed. It is shown that when the foreign firm's output signals costs, there is a unique separating sequential equilibrium. There is a distortion in output due to signalling which is costly in terms of welfare. So, the optimal import tariff when signalling is lower than when the firm does not signal its costs through output. Expected foreign production is lower when signalling, and domestic firm's output and profits are higher. Incomplete information lessens the rent extracting and profit shifting argument for a tariff. An area of conflicting views in trade policy is that of antidumping (AD). In Chapter 3, a descriptive analysis of the use of AD worldwide and in Europe is presented, including an explanation of AD laws and of the implementation of these laws in Europe. An analysis of European antidumping decisions made by the European Commission between 1985 and 2003 is presented in Chapter 4. Using data on legal AD investigations, industry, imports and political influences, the Commission decision-making on dumping and injury is modelled weighing the relative impact of economic and political factors in predicting policy outcomes. Two hypotheses are formulated. The empirical findings confirm that Europe is operating a double track antidumping mechanism. Mainly economic variables are associated with a positive decision on dumping whereas only political variables are positively associated with affirmative decisions on injury. Besides, antidumping laws allow countries to settle antidumping actions either by levying duties or by demanding price undertakings from the foreign exporting (or importing) firms. A <b>price</b> <b>undertaking</b> is an agreement by the foreign exporter to eliminate injury by increasing its price or ceasing exports. However, countries have considerable discretion in allowing price undertakings. An empirical analysis of the acceptance of <b>price</b> <b>undertaking</b> decisions in Europe is presented in Chapter 5. A number of hypotheses are formulated. The econometric analysis indicates that the share of European exports to the country of the defendant; indicators of political pressure as well as the country of origin of certain defendants (non-market economies) are positively associated with the decision to refuse price undertakings. The research hypotheses in chapters 4 and 5 are examined using a legal database containing information about 805 antidumping investigations initiated in Europe published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and associated trade and industrial statistics. An overview of the thesis with a summary of conclusions and contributions is presented in Chapter 1. A summary of the main findings of the thesis is presented in Chapter 6...|$|E

40|$|A {{good deal}} of {{theoretical}} and empirical literature has debated the role of MNEs in the expansion of manufactured exports from developing countries. Prevailing opinion is that MNEs have {{played an important role}} in the rapid growth of manufactured exports of Asian NTEs. Empirical studies, however, have reported mixed findings on their role. This is because countries differ in the extent of export-oriented foreign direct investment (FDI) and subcontracting of production attracted from MNEs. Export-oriented FDI and subcontracting arise in the process of rationalization of production, according to international differences in the factor <b>prices</b> <b>undertaken</b> by MNEs. The relocation of production was an important trend in the 1970 s, but has slowed since the mid- 1980 s, with the evolution of new technologies such as flexible automation and other developments in computer integrated manufacturing. This paper examines recent trends and patterns in export-oriented FDI inflows in developing countries. Inter-industry trends are examined as well as inter-country patterns in the export orientation of the overseas affiliates of US and Japanese MNEs. Recent trends in overseas production by developing country enterprises which have recently emerged as significant sources of export-oriented FDI are also summarized.

He subsequently formed the Victorian Mounted Rifles, an early light horse unit that helped establish the concept within the Australian military, which was raised from volunteers recruited from men based in rural Victoria. In establishing his new unit, Price obtained permission to dress them in khaki, instead of the red or blue uniforms that had been common at the time. He also instituted the slouch hat as an item of their uniform, which subsequently became a defining icon of the modern Australian Army. In 1888, he briefly took command of the Victorian Rangers, commanding them until 1889. During a civil disturbance in Melbourne in 1890 when maritime workers went on strike, Price's unit was called out to aid civilian police. The orders that he gave to his men to fire on the strikers if necessary later led to him being criticised by Premier Duncan Gillies and appearing before a court of inquiry.

A unilateral switch from safe haven to earnings stripping rules is welfare improving, because it allows governments to tax at different effective rates domestic and multinational firms. Thus, we provide an explanation for the recently observed trend to replace safe haven rules with earnings stripping rules.

40|$|Achieving a {{low carbon}} {{economy has been}} the focus of Hong Kong in recent years. Strategies are put forth to support {{sustainable}} energy, because Hong Kong has inadequate local and renewable energy reserves. Smart grid technologies have benefited many countries in the world, and countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea are exploring this new green energy strategy. Hong Kong’s power companies have considered smart grid technologies, conducting pilot projects to test their local feasibility. In this research, stakeholders’ perspectives of the current status of smart grids are overviewed in Hong Kong from the angle of policy aspect. Stakeholder theory is utilized as the framework for understanding and analyzing the perceptions of stakeholder groups. An integrated and modified stakeholder power-interest matrix was developed for analyzing level of power and interest of stakeholder groups on smart grid from policy dimension. Through the course of this research project, qualitative interviews were conducted for 11 interviewees with subjectsfrom 1 six stakeholder groups, including: academics, advisory bodies, business, government, non-governmental organizations, and power companies. Follow-up quantitative questionnaires were distributed to the same target group for stakeholder analysis and to map the level of power and interest of stakeholder groups regarding smart grid policy development in Hong Kong. The data collected from interviews were compared with and contrasted against each stakeholder groups and other countries, with a view to identifying common motivations, barriers, and policy suggestions. The findings reveal that the six stakeholder groups hold medium to high power and interest in smart grid policy development in Hong Kong. Common motivations identified by local stakeholder groups include: the right to choose their own energy mix for power generation, potential behavioural change via smart meter and tariff restructuring, possible energy savings and emissions reductions for the environment, and corporate social responsibility. The most significant motivation for smart grid development shared with other countries is the goal of achieving low carbon economy and energy efficiency. Shared barriers perceived by the six stakeholder groups are: unreliable renewable power supplies, significant capital investments required, impracticalities of supplying electricity back to the grid, transfers of additional power generation costs to consumers, and limited smart grid knowledge by the public. The most significant barrier shared with international countries is funding mechanism, yet it may be difficult for Hong Kong to secure funding from the government because of problems of trust. Three stages of recommendations are suggested. Short-term recommendations centre on the policy development direction of smart grid in Hong Kong, and include implementing dynamic <b>pricing,</b> <b>undertaking</b> a large-scale pilot program and establishing an awareness campaign (funded by the government) for educating the general public. Medium-term recommendation is to establish a joint green fund with the contributions of companies with large carbon footprints.
