The person first introduced on the stage will be found indeed to be of a rank and condition, the illustration of whose character scarcely called for a dissertation on the relative position of two great princes; but the passions of the great, their quarrels, and their reconciliations involve the fortunes of all who approach them; {{and it will be}} found, on proceeding farther in our story, that this <b>preliminary</b> <b>chapter</b> is necessary for comprehending the history of the individual whose adventures we are about to relate.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, {{there is}} an {{attitude}} not unknown in the crisis against which I should particularly like to protest. I should address my protest especially to those lovers and pursuers of Peace who, very short-sightedly, have occasionally adopted it. I mean the attitude which is impatient of these preliminary details about who did this or that, and whether it was right or wrong. They are satisfied with saying that an enormous calamity, called War, has been begun by {{some or all of}} us; and should be ended by some or all of us. To these people this <b>preliminary</b> <b>chapter</b> about the precise happenings must appear not only dry (and it must of necessity be the driest part of the task) but essentially needless and barren. I wish to tell these people that they are wrong; that they are wrong upon all principles of human justice and historic continuity: but that they are specially and supremely wrong upon their own principles of arbitration and international peace.|$|E
60|$|The {{remarkable}} person, {{called by}} the title of Old Mortality, was we'll known in Scotland {{about the end of}} the last century. His real name was Robert Paterson. He was a native, it is said, of the parish of Closeburn, in Dumfries-shire, and probably a mason by profession--at least educated to the use of the chisel. Whether family dissensions, or the deep and enthusiastic feeling of supposed duty, drove him to leave his dwelling, and adopt the singular mode of life in which he wandered, like a palmer, through Scotland, is not known. It could not be poverty, however, which prompted his journeys, for he never accepted anything beyond the hospitality which was willingly rendered him, and when that was not proffered, he always had money enough to provide for his own humble wants. His personal appearance, and favourite, or rather sole occupation, are accurately described in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>chapter</b> of the following work.|$|E

6000|$|A {{descriptive}} paragraph or two, treating of the seven-gabled mansion in its more recent aspect, will bring this <b>preliminary</b> <b>chapter</b> to a close. The street {{in which it}} upreared its venerable peaks has long {{ceased to be a}} fashionable quarter of the town; so that, though the old edifice was surrounded by habitations of modern date, they were mostly small, built entirely of wood, and typical of the most plodding uniformity of common life. [...] Doubtless, however, the whole story of human existence may be latent in each of them, but with no picturesqueness, externally, that can attract the imagination or sympathy to seek it there. But as for the old structure of our story, its white-oak frame, and its boards, shingles, and crumbling plaster, and even the huge, clustered chimney in the midst, seemed to constitute only the least and meanest part of its reality. So much of mankind's varied experience had passed there,--so much had been suffered, and something, too, enjoyed,--that the very timbers were oozy, as with the moisture of a heart. It was itself like a great human heart, with a life of its own, and full of rich and sombre reminiscences.|$|E
60|$|We {{can imagine}} how his mind had worked, how he had {{declared}} to himself that, as by those loving hands into which his letters, his notes, his little details,--his literary remains, as such documents used to be called,--might naturally fall, truth of his foibles and of his shortcomings could not be told, so should not his praises be written, or that flattering portrait be limned which biographers are wont to produce. Acting upon these instructions, his daughters,--while there were two living, and since that the one surviving,--have carried out the order which has appeared to them to be sacred. Such being the case, it certainly is not my purpose now to write what may be called a life of Thackeray. In this <b>preliminary</b> <b>chapter</b> I will give such incidents and anecdotes of his life as will tell the reader perhaps all about him that a reader is entitled to ask. I will tell how he became an author, and will say how first he worked and struggled, and then how he worked and prospered, and became a household word in English literature;--how, in this way, he passed through that course of mingled failure and success which, though the literary aspirant may suffer, is probably better both for the writer and for the writings than unclouded early glory. The suffering no doubt is acute, {{and a touch of}} melancholy, perhaps of indignation, may be given to words which have been written while the heart has been too full of its own wrongs; but this is better than the continued note of triumph which is still heard in the final voices of the spoilt child of literature, even when they are losing their music. Then I will tell how Thackeray died, early indeed, but still having done a good life's work. Something of his manner, something of his appearance I can say, something perhaps of his condition of mind; because for some few years he was known to me. But of the continual intercourse of himself with the world, and of himself with his own works, I can tell little, because no record of his life has been made public.|$|E
60|$|This view necessitates a tedious {{discussion}} on a difficult point, namely whether {{the transmission of}} a character, which is at first inherited by both sexes, can be subsequently limited in its transmission, by means of selection, to one sex alone. We must bear in mind, as shewn in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>chapter</b> on sexual selection, that characters which are limited in their development to one sex are always latent in the other. An imaginary illustration will best aid us in seeing {{the difficulty of the}} case: we may suppose that a fancier wished to make a breed of pigeons, in which the males alone should be coloured of a pale blue, whilst the females retained their former slaty tint. As with pigeons characters of all kinds are usually transmitted to both sexes equally, the fancier would have to try to convert this latter form of inheritance into sexually-limited transmission. All that he could do would be to persevere in selecting every male pigeon which was in the least degree of a paler blue; and the natural result of this process, if steadily carried on for a long time, and if the pale variations were strongly inherited or often recurred, would be to make his whole stock of a lighter blue. But our fancier would be compelled to match, generation after generation, his pale blue males with slaty females, for he wishes to keep the latter of this colour. The result would generally be the production either of a mongrel piebald lot, or more probably the speedy and complete loss of the pale-blue colour, for the primordial slaty tint would be transmitted with prepotent force. Supposing, however, that some pale-blue males and slaty females were produced during each successive generation, and were always crossed together; then the slaty females would have, if I may use the expression, much blue blood in their veins, for their fathers, grandfathers, etc., will all have been blue birds. Under these circumstances it is conceivable (though I know of no distinct facts rendering it probable) that the slaty females might acquire so strong a latent tendency to pale-blueness, that they would not destroy this colour in their male offspring, their female offspring still inheriting the slaty tint. If so, the desired end of making a breed with the two sexes permanently different in colour might be gained.|$|E

5000|$|La chanteuse poignardée is a fictionalized {{biography}} of Madame Saint Huberty written by Germaine Beauguitte and published as a paperback in April 1962. The book does not profess {{to be an}} accurate representation of historical fact, and indeed the author describes it as une biographie romancée. The plot appears to follow Edmond de Goncourt's biographical study to a large extent, which, in its turn, may sometimes be less than reliable. A particularly odd feature about Beauguitte's book is that it includes a <b>preliminary</b> <b>chapter</b> added as an afterthought, written by the artist and historical biographer Marie-Magdeleine de Rasky (1897-1982), in which she {{claimed to be the}} reincarnation of Madame Saint-Huberty. Rasky's assertion was made on the basis that (i) her mind was haunted by scenes and visions of places which, although she had never visited them, somehow appeared familiar; on visiting these places (sometimes quite by chance) at a later stage in her life, and recognising that they corresponded with the earlier visions, she had then discovered that they had a close association with Saint-Huberty: and that (ii) although she had not been injured, she nevertheless carried a large scar above her left breast, which seemingly tallied with de Goncourt's account of Saint-Huberty's death. (Although 1812 accounts of the murder were not always consistent, the second part of de Rasky's claim would appear to be negated by the surgeon Matthew Ball's testimony, presented at the inquest, that the dagger had entered Saint-Huberty's right breast.) ...|$|E
