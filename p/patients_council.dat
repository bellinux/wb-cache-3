This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} Hale Mohalu struggle of 1978 - 1983, while {{placing it in}} {{the larger context of}} more than a century of Hawaiian resistance against injustice. Native Hawaiians defied the colonial, paternalistic attitude of the Hawaiʻi State Department of Health in a standoff for self-determination at Hale Mohalu, the residential leprosy facility in Pearl City, Honolulu. This resistance {{played an important role in}} the Hawaiian sovereignty movement and the ramifications from that conflict resonate today in questions over the future use of the Kalaupapa Settlement as well as the controversial issue of land development in Hawaiʻi. Although the State had shut off their water, food, and medicine, Bernard Punikaiʻa, Chairman of the Kalaupapa <b>Patients</b> <b>Council,</b> refused to allow State authorities to run roughshod over patients' civil rights at Hale Mohalu. The patient resistance Punikaiʻa led against the State's power marked a turning point in both public and patient consciousness. This dissertation gives voice to the patients in their compelling fight. It is a remarkable story not only for its broad base of community support and for the length of time it lasted, but also because it is part of a much larger history of struggle against Native Hawaiian injustice that reaches back over a hundred years into the 19 th century and resonates into the late 20 th and 21 st century with the Hawaiian sovereignty movement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Patient</b> {{advisory}} <b>councils</b> {{are a way}} {{for healthcare}} organizations to promote patient engagement. Despite mandates to implement <b>patient</b> advisory <b>councils</b> through programs like the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), there is a paucity of data measuring the impact of patients functioning in advisory roles. Our objective is to investigate whether patient engagement in <b>patient</b> advisory <b>councils</b> is linked to improvements in clinical quality, patient safety or patient satisfaction. Methods We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL and Google Scholar for English language publications between November 2002 to August 2015, {{using a combination of}} “patient advisor” and “care outcomes” search terms. Article selection utilized dual screening facilitated by DistillerSR software, with group discussion to resolve discordance. Observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and case studies were included that described patients serving in an advisory role where primary outcomes were mentioned. Reference lists of included studies and grey literature searches were conducted. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed to synthesize results. Results Database searching yielded 639 articles total after removing duplicates, with 129 articles meeting full text inclusion criteria. 32 articles were identified for final review, 16 of which were case studies. Advisory roles included <b>patient</b> advisory <b>councils,</b> ad-hoc <b>patient</b> committees, community advisory councils, experience-based co-design, and other. Four practice-based studies from one research group, involving community advisors in the design of public health interventions, found improved clinical outcomes. No prospective experimental studies assessed the impact of patient advisors on patient safety or patient satisfaction. One cluster-randomized RCT showed that patient advisors helped health care planning efforts identify priorities more aligned with the PCMH. Ten case studies reported anecdotal benefit to individual patient advisors. Conclusion Five included studies demonstrate promising methods for evaluating patient engagement in healthcare delivery and describe impacts on clinical outcomes and priority setting. Based on the case studies found, patient advisors tend to contribute to patient-facing services that may affect clinical care but are not easily evaluated. As clinics and hospitals implement <b>patient</b> advisory <b>councils,</b> rigorous evaluation of their programs is needed to support the expansion of system-level patient engagement.

Later, the necessity of segregation was negated scientifically. With several amendments of the law, the leprosy prevention law was finally outlawed through longtime endeavors of the national Hansen's disease <b>patients</b> <b>councils.</b> In the first place, it is to be stressed that the law {{aimed at the}} segregation of leprosy patients, at the erasure of leprosy patients from the society to create a safe society of healthy people. This planted an eranous concept that people with leprosy were dangerous people requiring segregation and justifying segregation. In 1931, our Otani section started an Ohtani Komyokai in order to advance the no leprosy in our prefecture movement in accord with Kensuke Mitsuda, without hearing the opinion of Noboru Ogasawara. We could not recognize the significance of segregatory policy of leprosy which committed an outrage upon human rights. We did comfort sermons to patients, but the sermons might be only helpful in persuading them to accept the present situation, namely, segregation. Now we have to accept criticisms and have to repent of our sins. We apologize to patients with leprosy and their families who had endured the sufferings of segregation for committing our failure.|$|R

The molecular diagnosis is important but still expensive. This work aimed to find clinical predictors {{of a positive}} genetic test in a Brazilian tertiary centre cohort of index cases with HCM. Methods In the study were included patients with HCM clinical diagnosis. For genotype x phenotype comparison we have evaluated echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and nuclear magnetic resonance measures. All patients answered a questionnaire about familial history of HCM and/or sudden death. β-myosin heavy chain, myosin binding protein C, and troponin T genes were sequenced for genetic diagnosis. Results The variables related to a higher probability of a positive genetic test were familial history of HCM, higher mean heart frequency, presence of NSVT and lower age. Probabilities of having a positive molecular genetic test were calculated from the final multivariate logistic regression model and were used to identify those with a higher probability of a positive molecular diagnosis. Conclusions We developed an easy and fast screening method {{that takes into account}} only clinical data that can help to select the patients with a high probability of positive genetic results from molecular sequencing of Brazilian HCM <b>patients.</b> National <b>Council</b> for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and Coordination for Enhancement of Higher Education (CAPES) ...|$|R

As such the National Health Service (NHS) was encouraged to further engage with art based offerings for <b>patients</b> (Arts <b>Council</b> England, 2007). In response to this call for action NHS Gloucestershire worked in conjunction with Artlift to develop an art on referral scheme. This is an intervention where health primary care providers and professionals refer patients for an 8 - 10 week art programme, usually delivered in a community based or primary care setting.

Methods The study population consisted of 218 health care professionals holding strategic positions in patient safety work in Swedish county councils. Using a questionnaire, the following topics were analysed in this study: profession/occupation; number of years involved in a designated task on patient safety issues; knowledge/overview of the county <b>council’s</b> <b>patient</b> safety work; ability to influence this work; conditions for this work; and the importance of various factors for current and future levels of patient safety. Results The response rate to the questionnaire was 79 %. The conditions that had the highest number of responses in complete agreement were “patients’ involvement is important for patient safety” and “patient safety work has good support from the county council’s management”. Factors that were considered most important for achieving the current level of patient safety were root cause and risk analyses, incident reporting and the Swedish Patient Safety Law.

We surveyed 328 women with LAM regarding pregnancy outcomes, pulmonary function, subjective and psychological functioning, quality of life, dyspnoea and fatigue. Amongst childless women the main reason not to attempt pregnancy was based on concerns about potential effects of pregnancy on LAM. Almost two thirds of patients had been pregnant, the majority before LAM was diagnosed, in whom pregnancy outcome was generally favourable. Women diagnosed with LAM (n= 15) during pregnancy had high rates of pneumothorax (67 %), miscarriage (7 %) and premature birth (47 %). The group diagnosed with LAM before or during pregnancy (n= 12) had lower mean FEV 1, FVC and DLCO after pregnancy compared with those diagnosed following pregnancy or never pregnant.

The SNPs were selected in predicted functional regions within 964 genes spanning 67 molecular pathways thought {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis, treatment response, and adverse effects associated with myeloma and its therapy. Patient cases and controls were derived from two large clinical trials that compared thalidomide with conventional-based treatment in myeloma <b>patients</b> (Medical Research <b>Council</b> Myeloma-IX and HOVON- 50 /GMMG-HD 3). Results: We report TrPN associations with SNPs—ABCA 1 (rs 363717), ICAM 1 (rs 1799969), PPARD (rs 2076169), SERPINB 2 (rs 6103), and SLC 12 A 6 (rs 7164902) —where we show cross validation of the associations in both trials. To investigate whether TrPN SNP associations were related to exposure to thalidomide only or general drug-related peripheral neuropathy, we performed a second analysis on patients treated with vincristine. We report SNPs associated with vincristine neuropathy, with a seemingly distinct underlying genetic mechanism. Conclusion: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that an individual's risk of developing a peripheral neuropathy after thalidomide treatment can be mediated by polymorphisms in genes governing repair mechanisms and inflammation in the peripheral nervous system. These findings will contribute to the development of future neuroprotective strategies with thalidomide therapy and the better use of this important compound. </p...|$|R
