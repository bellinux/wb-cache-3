40|$|The design & emotion {{research}} domain {{has produced}} a rich palette of theoretical and methodological approaches that support designers {{in their attempts to}} ‘design for emotion’. In this paper, we focus on situations that involve negative emotions that cannot easily be ‘solved’ through design (for example, sadness caused by the loss of a loved one). The main question addressed is: is it possible to use reversal theory for designing products that transform given strong negative emotions into positive experiences? This question is particularly relevant for situations in which the cause of the negative emotion cannot be removed or solved through design. The paper describes a design case in which this question was explored by designing a product that supports children who are hospitalized for a surgical procedure.

The purpose of this headpiece is to provide shade for the infant, since it could be covered with an animal skin, or a blanket in winter to protect against the elements in colder climates. The headpiece also provides extra head protection in case anything bumps against the cradleboard. Ornaments and sacred amulets are often attached to the headpiece as well, for example [...] "beaded umbilical cord cases, and dream catchers or medicine wheels", to amuse and help the infant develop his or her eyesight.|$|E

40|$|Temporal {{sequential}} {{analyses of}} the hydrological observational data in the Tarim Basin over {{the last forty years}} revealed an annual increase of 2 x 10 (7) m(3) in the water quantities at the three headstreams of the upper courses and an annual decrease of 3 x 10 (7) m(3) in the water flow from Alaer, which is on the upper main stream. A prediction of the trends indicates that there can be severe situations under which intermittent water interceptions occur. By means of approximate estimations on vegetative water consumption through phreatic evaporation combined with a quota assessment, the ecological water demands required to maintain the ecological environment in the mainstream area over the three different targeted years of 2005, 2010 and 2030 are defined as standing at 31. 86 x 10 (8) m(3), 36. 27 x 10 (8) m(3) and 41. 04 x 10 (8) m(3) respectively.

The paper presents a method for increasing energy absorption of protective structure of a forestry machine cabin, enabling to reduce the risk of injuries to the operators in the event of an emergency. This is achieved by introducing into the structure of the <b>protective</b> <b>frame</b> of a cab energy-absorbing mounts in which the energy is absorbed due to plastic deformation of their elements in the event of a rollover of forestry machine. The article presents the design of the mount, describes the principle of its operation in the event of an emergency, and theoretical and experimental studies of the deformable mount. As the result of theoretical and experimental investigations the geometric parameters of the energy-absorbing mount are determined...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how designers can enrich user experiences by purposefully involving negative emotions in user-product interaction. This approach {{is derived from}} a framework of rich experience, which explains how {{and under what circumstances}} negative emotions make a product experience richer and enjoyable. The approach consists of three steps, where the designer decides 1) which negative emotion is most appropriate for the user context; 2) how and when this emotion is best elicited; and 3) which <b>protective</b> <b>frame</b> is most appropriate to use and in what way it is applied to the product concept. Ten experience qualities were developed that offer prefabricated combinations of these steps, which are intended to lower the threshold of using the approach. The steps for these qualities are described, and each is briefly discussed. Lastly, the applicability of the approach in design is demonstrated by showing six examples of how the qualities have been used to generate concrete product concepts. Reflecting on the approach, we conclude that negative emotions are a viable and interesting starting point for creating emotionally rich product experiences.

5000|$|In 1911, Peruggia perpetrated {{what has}} been {{described}} as the greatest art theft of the 20th century. It was a police theory that the former Louvre worker hid inside the museum on Sunday, August 20, knowing the museum would be closed the following day. But, according to Peruggia's interrogation in Florence after his arrest, he entered the museum on Monday, August 21 around 7 am, through the door where the other Louvre workers were entering. He said he wore one of the white smocks that museum employees customarily wore and was indistinguishable from the other workers. When the Salon Carré, where the Mona Lisa hung, was empty, he lifted the painting off the four iron pegs that secured it to the wall and took it to a nearby service staircase. There, he removed the <b>protective</b> case and <b>frame.</b> Some people report that he concealed the painting (which Leonardo painted on wood) under his smock. But Peruggia was only 5'3", and the Mona Lisa measures approx. 21" [...] x 30", so it would not fit under a smock worn by someone his size. Instead, he said he took off his smock and wrapped it around the painting, tucked it under his arm, and left the Louvre through the same door he had entered.|$|R
2500|$|To deploy tanks, it {{was first}} needed to train crews and create tank units. On 14 July 1916 Estienne started {{to set up a}} {{training}} base at the Fort du Trou-d'Enfer, a fortress at Marly-le-Roi, west of Paris. For reasons of secrecy this location was officially attached to the 81st Heavy Artillery Regiment, a depot unit. On 15 August the camp was formally established and quickly filled with recruits, most of them young volunteers from various French armies. [...] At Marly the crews received their first instruction consisting of the basics of maintenance and a lot of driver training with an emphasis on crossing trenches, avoiding shell craters and running down trees and walls. Because no actual Schneider vehicles were available at first, Holt tractors were used instead; later boiler plate training chassis were employed with the superstructure removed and replaced by a <b>protective</b> wooden <b>frame.</b> From the spring of 1917 onwards about seven vehicles were used for this goal. For unit training and live fire exercises, which required much larger manoeuvre grounds, on 30 August 1916 a camp was established at Cercottes. It received its first training vehicles on 17 November 1916. To get better acquainted with the mechanical side of the tanks, most crew members left Cercottes for a month to work as a trainee at the SOMUA factory. New vehicles would normally be first delivered at Cercottes. In 1917 the Cercottes base grew to a strength of about five thousand men, many of them sent there from units {{trying to get rid of}} undesirable elements, forcing the base command to reduce manpower by again removing them. On 28 September 1916 a large instruction centre was established at Champlieu, south of Compiègne. [...] This location, close to the frontline and officially part of the warzone, could serve for final training and sending out battle-ready units to those armies needing them. [...] The tank workshops were also located there, repairing and updating existing vehicles. The bases at Cercottes and Champlieu used about sixty-four tanks purely for training purposes, to limit the wear on the combat vehicles.|$|R

These three themes include: (1) the dieting myth; (2) discriminatory policy; and (3) children as collateral damage. NAAFA reframes their message directly against the Let 2 ̆ 7 s Move! campaign, which makes their framing clearer and more relevant to public discussion.

40|$|We {{explored}} the psychological links that may exist between people’s choices of television program, conversation topics around {{the content of}} these programs, and people’s perceived degree of threat associated with these programs. The theoretical framework {{of the study was}} reversal theory (Apter, 2001). Participants were presented with a series of questionnaires assessing the degree of threat associated with potentially stressful situations (e. g., running of the bulls), the degree of enjoyment associated with television programs dealing with these situations (e. g., watching a report about the running of the bulls), and the degree of enjoyment associated with participation in conversations about these programs. The overall finding was that (a) most people like to watch frightening television programs because they find these situations to be the most entertaining once their negative consequences have been removed, (b) most people like to choose conversation topics centered on risks and risky situations for the same reason, (c) some people dislike watching frightening television programs and do not preferentially choose conversation topics centered on risks and risky situations because these situations, although not real for them, are still highly stressful, and possibly psychologically harmful.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{represents}} a serious public health concern. People who inject drugs (PWID) are at particular risk and nearly half (45 %) of PWID in England may be infected. HCV prevention interventions have only had moderate {{impact on the}} prevalence of HCV in this population. Using qualitative methods, we sought to detail the protective practices potentially linked to HCV avoidance among PWID, and explore the motivations for these. METHODS: The study used a life history approach allowing participants to detail their lived experience both {{before and during the}} course of their injecting careers. Thirty-seven participants were recruited from drug services in London, and from referrals within local injecting networks. A baseline and follow-up in-depth qualitative interview was carried out with each participant, and for half, a third interview was also undertaken. All underwent testing for HCV antibody. Analyses focused on developing a descriptive typology of protective practices potentially linked to HCV avoidance. RESULTS: Practices were deemed to be protective against HCV if they could be expected a priori {{to reduce the number of}} overall injections and/or the number of injections using shared injecting equipment. Participants reported engaging in various protective practices which fell into three categories identified through thematic analysis: principles about injecting, preparedness, and flexibility. CONCLUSIONS: All participants engaged in protective practices irrespective of serostatus. It is important to consider the relative importance of different motivations <b>framing</b> <b>protective</b> practices in order to formulate harm reduction interventions which appeal to the situated concerns of PWID, especially given that these protective practices may also help protect against HIV and other blood borne infections...|$|R
