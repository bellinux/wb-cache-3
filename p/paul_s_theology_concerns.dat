40|$|The Concepts of the Church in the Authentic Pauline Letters Abstract This {{graduation}} work {{deals with}} the concept of the church of Paul the Apostle, as portrayed in his undisputed letters. The author doesn t focus on the explanation of the single <b>Paul</b> <b>s</b> quotes about church, but aims to bring a complex view of the issue. First, it analyses {{the use of the word}} ecclesia in the Greek and the Jewish environment and the way that the Apostle Paul uses it. Further there are described different images of the church, appearing in the <b>Paul</b> <b>s</b> Epistles, and an interpretation of their importance for the understanding of <b>Paul</b> <b>s</b> vision of the church. The thesis aims attention at the beginnings of the church s institutionalization and the early hierarchy, which has been shaping during <b>Paul</b> <b>s</b> life. The work also depicts <b>Paul</b> <b>s</b> relationship with the Christian communities he founded, the authority and the requirements for daily life he represented for the early Christians. In the final chapter, which represents the core of the thesis, the author summarizes the basic fundamental characteristics of <b>Paul</b> <b>s</b> concept of the church and notices these ideas constitute also the basics of the current ecclesiology.
