25|$|In {{addition}} to his other teachings, {{he was able to}} teach a psychological test and measurement course. Because he loved the mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance. On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Clark went on to teaching an introductory class for <b>premedical</b> <b>students.</b> While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was the starting point of his experimental testing in this field in which Clark focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933. After writing the book, he decided to continue in experimental field by teaching this course in {{addition to}} the premedical course. Clark had a great desire to teach this course and felt as though this specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory. In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation. he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined conditioned reflex and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and others like him. This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for: Principles of Behavior.|$|E

Cognitive and experiential techniques are implemented in a humanistic framework to help clients recover from low self-esteem. Preliminary results from an outcome study utilizing three measures of self esteem and coping strategies (the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, the Need for Harmony Scale and Spielberger's Anger Expression Scale) suggest that this model shows promise in helping women who are survivors {{of child sexual abuse}} to build healthy self-esteem and warrants further investigation.

40|$|Background: The current {{educational}} {{approach for}} teaching {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD) anatomy to students involves instructional tools and techniques that have significant limitations. This study sought to assess the feasibility of utilizing present-day three-dimensional (3 D) printing technology to create high-fidelity synthetic heart models with ventricular septal defect (VSD) lesions and applying these models to a novel, simulation-based educational curriculum for <b>premedical</b> and medical <b>students.</b> Methods: Archived, de-identified magnetic resonance images of five common VSD subtypes were obtained. These cardiac images were then segmented and built into 3 D computer-aided designmodels using Mimics Innovation Suite software. AnObjet 500 Connex 3 D printer was subsequently utilized to print a high-fidelity heart model for each VSD subtype. Next, a simulation-based educational curriculumusing these heartmodelswas developed and implemented in the instructionof 29 <b>premedical</b> andmedical <b>students.</b> Assess-ment of this curriculumwas undertaken with Likert-type questionnaires. Results: High-fidelity VSD models were successfully cre-ated utilizing magnetic resonance imaging data and 3 D printing.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the relationship between burnout and hemodynamic and autonomic functioning in both medical students (N= 55) and <b>premedical</b> undergraduate <b>students</b> (N= 77). Questionnaires screened for health related issues and assessed school burnout and negative affect symptomatology (anxiety and depression). Continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) through finger plethysmography and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring was conducted during conditions of baseline and cardiac stress induced via the cold pressor task to produce hemodynamic, heart rate variability, and blood pressure variability indices. Independent sample t-tests demonstrated that medical students had significantly higher school burnout scores compared to their undergraduate counterparts. Controlling for age, BMI, anxiety and depressive symptoms, multiple regression analyses indicated that school burnout was a stronger predictor of elevated hemodynamics (blood pressure), decreased heart rate variability, decreased markers of vagal activity and increased markers of sympathetic tone at baseline for medical students than for undergraduates. Analyses of physiological values collected during the cold pressor task indicated greater cardiac hyperactivity for medical students than for undergraduates. The present study supports previous research linking medical school burnout to hemodynamic and autonomic functioning, suggests biomarkers for medical school burnout, and provides evidence that burnout may be implicated as a physiological risk factor in medical students. Study limitations and potential intervention avenues are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Academic {{debate is}} an {{effective}} method to enhance the competences of critical thinking, problem solving, communication skills and cooperation skills. The present study examined the improvement of debate competence which is an outcome of debate-based flipped learning. Methods: A questionnaire was administrated to second-year <b>premedical</b> school <b>students</b> at Yeungnam University. In total 45 students participated in the survey. The survey questionnaire was composed of 60 items of eight subfactors on debate competence. To investigate the homogeneous of low and high achievement groups, 18 items on empathy and 75 items on critical thinking scales were used. To compare the pretest with posttest scores, data was analyzed using paired sample t-test. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between low and high achievement groups by average grade at the beginning of the semester. There was a significant improvement in high achievers on the logical argumentation (p< 0. 001), proficiency in inquiry (p< 0. 01), active participation (p< 0. 001), ability to investigate and analyze (p< 0. 001), observance of debate rules (p< 0. 05), and acceptability (p< 0. 05). Even in low achievers, active participation (p< 0. 05) and ability to investigate and analyze (p< 0. 01) were significantly improved.

40|$|Background: The American Center for Reproductive Medicine's summer {{internship}} {{course in}} reproductive medicine and research at Cleveland Clinic is a rigorous, results-oriented annual program {{that began in}} 2008 to train both local and international students in the fundamentals of scientific research and writing. The foremost goal {{of the program is}} to encourage <b>premedical</b> and medical <b>students</b> to aspire toward a career as a physician–scientist. The internship provides participants with an opportunity to engage in original bench research and scientific writing while developing theoretical knowledge and soft skills. This study describes selected survey responses from interns who participated in the 2014 internship program. The objective of these surveys was to elicit the interns' perspective on the internship program, its strengths and weaknesses, and to obtain insight into potential areas for improvement. Methods: Questionnaires were structured around the five fundamental aspects of the program: 1) theoretical knowledge, 2) bench research, 3) scientific writing, 4) mentorship, and 5) soft skills. In addition, an exit survey gathered information on factors that attracted the interns to the program, communication with mentors, and overall impression of the research program. Results: The opportunity to experience hands-on bench research and scientific writing, personalized mentorship, and the reputation of the institution were appreciated and ranked highly among the interns. Nearly 90 % of the interns responded that the program was beneficial and well worth the time and effort invested by both interns and faculty. Conclusion: The outcomes portrayed in this study will be useful in the implementation of new programs or refinement of existing medical research training programs...|$|R
40|$|Background The goal of {{this study}} was to design and {{implement}} a novel surgical telementoring system called the System for Telementoring with Augmented Reality (STAR) that uses a virtual transparent display to convey precise locations in the operating field to a trainee surgeon. This system was compared with a conventional system based on a telestrator for surgical instruction. Methods A telementoring system was developed and evaluated in a study which used a 1 × 2 between-subjects design with telementoring system, that is, STAR or conventional, as the independent variable. The participants in the study were 20 <b>premedical</b> or medical <b>students</b> who had no prior experience with telementoring. Each participant completed a task of port placement and a task of abdominal incision under telementoring using either the STAR or the conventional system. The metrics used to test performance when using the system were placement error, number of focus shifts, and time to task completion. Results When compared with the conventional system, participants using STAR completed the 2 tasks with less placement error (45 % and 68 %) and with fewer focus shifts (86 % and 44 %), but more slowly (19 % for each task). Conclusions Using STAR resulted in decreased annotation placement error, fewer focus shifts, but greater times to task completion. STAR placed virtual annotations directly onto the trainee surgeon's field of view of the operating field by conveying location with great accuracy; this technology helped to avoid shifts in focus, decreased depth perception, and enabled fine-tuning execution of the task to match telementored instruction, but led to greater times to task completion...|$|R
