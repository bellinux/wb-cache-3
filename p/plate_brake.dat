50|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>brake</b> tester is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} a vehicles braking system in a dynamic test. The unit consists of two moving parallel plates mounted on force transducers. A measurement of the braking force is made when a vehicle passes over the plates and then applies its brakes. The braking action causes the individual plates to ‘slip’ forwards allowing a calculation of braking force to be made. Brake imbalance between {{the left and right}} hand side can also be measured by the differences in voltage measured on each of the force transducers under the chassis. Due to the nature of it dynamic operation, <b>plate</b> <b>brake</b> testers are far less common than roller brake testers in UK garages although they are also an extremely accurate method of measurement.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} squeal noise in car brake systems has been present since early 20 th century. Many {{investigators}} {{have tried to}} solve the problem using experimental, analytical and computational methods. Still there is no known solution for suppressing squeal noise.

This contributes to eliminate or attenuate squeal nose generated by the brake system.

40|$|Contact is the {{principal}} way load is transferred to a body. The study of stresses and deformations arising due to contact interaction of solid bodies is thus of paramount importance in many engineering applications. In this work, problems involving contact interactions are investigated using finite element modeling. In the first part, a new augmented Lagrangian multiplier method is implemented for the finite element solution of contact problems. In this method, a stabilizing term is added to avoid the instability associated with overconstraining the non-penetration condition. Numerical examples are presented to show the influence of stabilization term. Furthermore, dependence of error on different parameters is investigated. In the second part, a disc brake is investigated by modeling the disc in an Eulerian framework which requires significantly lower computational time than the more common Lagrangian framework. Thermal stresses in the brake disc are simulated for a single braking operation {{as well as for}} repeated braking. The results predict the presence of residual tensile stresses in the circumferential direction which may cause initiation of radial cracks on the disc surface after a few braking cycles. It is also shown that convex bending of the pad is the major cause of the contact pressure concentration in middle of the pad which results in the appearance of a hot band on the disc surface. A multi-objective optimization study is also performed, where the mass of the back <b>plate,</b> the <b>brake</b> energy and the maximum temperature generated on the disc surface during hard braking are optimized. The results indicate that a brake pad with lowest possible stiffness will result in an optimized solution with regards to all three objectives. Finally, an overview of disc brakes and related phenomena is presented in a literature review. In the third part, a lower limb donned in a prosthetic socket is investigated. The contact problem is solved between the socket and the limb while taking friction into consideration to determine the contact pressure and resultant internal stress-strain in the soft tissues. Internal mechanical conditions and interface stresses for three different socket designs are compared.

40|$|The {{process which}} {{converts}} the kinetic {{energy of the}} vehicle into mechanical energy is known as Braking, which must be dissipated {{in the form of}} heat. The device using for decelerating or stopping the rotation of a wheel is called as disc brake.

Friction material in the form of brake pads (mounted on a device called a brake calliper) is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electromagnetically against both sides of the disc to stop the wheel.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} thermal {{stresses}} in a brake disc during a braking operation are simulated. The simulations are performed {{by using a}} sequential approach where the temperature history generated during a frictional heat analysis is used as an input for the stress analysis. The frictional heat analysis {{is based on the}} Eulerian method, which requires signicantly lower computational time as compared to the Lagrangian approach. The stress analysis is performed using a temperature dependent material model both with isotropic and kinematic hardening behaviors. The results predict the presence of residual tensile stresses in circumferential direction for both hardening behaviors. These residual stresses may cause initiation of radial cracks on the disc surface after a few braking cycles. For repeated braking an approximately stable stress-strain loop is obtained already after the rst cycle for the linear kinematic hardening model. So, if the fatigue life data for the disc material is known, its fatigue life can be assessed. These results are in agreement with experimental observations available in the literature. The simulation results predict one hot band {{in the middle of the}} disc for a pad with no wear history. It is also shown that convex bending of the pad is the major cause of the contact pressure concentration in middle of the pad which results in the appearance of a hot band on the disc surface. The results also show that due to wear of the pad, dierent distributions of temperature on the disc surface are obtained for each new brake cycle and after a few braking cycles, two hot bands appear on the disc surface. This sequential approach has proved tremendously cheap in terms of computational time so it gives the freedom to perform multi-objective  optimization studies. Preliminary results of such a study are also presented where the mass of the back <b>plate,</b> the <b>brake</b> energy and the maximum temperature generated on the disc surface during hard braking are optimized.

When the stock brake is applied, fluid passes freely through the stunt master cylinder inlet port and compensating port and out the exhaust port to the rear wheels. When the stunt brake is applied, the piston in the master cylinder blocks off the compensating port to the exhaust port and pressurizes the rear brake system, cutting off the original brake master cylinder besides the compensating port in the stunt brake. BF Goodrich TA's were added for enhanced stick, as were Tilton brake calipers. The improved traction required installation of a hydraulic in-line brake power booster lifted from a Volvo P-1800. It operates on engine vacuum to aid in breaking loose the pavement-hugging TA's. To further enhance the growl of the vehicle, Robert's team installed a NOS port-injected nitrous system, which was later replaced with a plate-type configuration.
