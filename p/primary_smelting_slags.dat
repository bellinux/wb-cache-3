40|$|International audienceLead {{blast furnace}} (LBF), {{one of the}} {{processes}} used in non-ferrous metallurgy, generates huge amounts of <b>primary</b> <b>smelting</b> <b>slags</b> which are often directly landfilled. The slags sampled from the industrial basin of Nord-Pas-de-Calais (northern France) still contain significant quantities of lead and zinc and are exposed to weathering conditions at their disposal site. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate metal leachability when LBF slags come into contact with ultrapure water, sterile growth media or growth media inoculated with a heterotrophic bacterium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The changes in the surface morphology of slag prior and after the alteration experiments as well as the formation of secondary mineral phases has been monitored by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX). P. aeruginosa was shown to play a significant role in LBF slags weathering by enhancing the leaching and solubility of toxic elements (Zn and Pb) present in LBF slags. Sorption of Zn and Pb onto bacterial cells and complexation of these toxic metals by siderophores is expected to dramatically enhance the solubility, and therefore the mobility of these metals. Leached out elements were further complexed either with phosphate present in the growth medium or with carbonate which led to the formation of secondary Zn or Pb precipitate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>smelting</b> <b>slags,</b> {{known as}} Lead Blast Furnace (LBF) and Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF), were {{generated}} by the former pyrometallurgical industries located in Noyelles-Godault, Northern France. Following its closure in 2003, 4 million tons of primary slags have been landfilled as a heap {{in the vicinity of}} the Deûle River, near the industrial basin of Nord-Pas-de-Calais. These slag materials are often enriched in particular metals (Pb, Zn) that can be released into the environment through alteration processes and leaching. Many biological and chemical processes might take place within these tailings and thus affect significantly the slag weathering. Predicting the environmental impact of these wastes requires an understanding of the mineral-water interactions as well as the influence of the biological activities (the involvement of microorganisms). Thus, this research is designed to simulate the natural weathering of slag by simulating different weathering conditions with or without the involvement of the microorganisms as well as by varying several chemical parameters. Chemical weathering of both LBF and ISF slags was studied by as a function of pHs (4, 5. 5, 7, 8. 5 and 10) as well as under two atmospheres (open air and nitrogen). Significant amounts of Ca, Fe and Zn were released under acidic conditions (pH 4) with a decrease towards the neutral to alkaline conditions (pH 7 and 10) for both slags. The concentrations of all elements increased gradually after 216 h compared to initial 24 h of leaching period. The presence of oxygen under open-air atmosphere not only enhanced oxidative weathering but also encouraged formation of secondary oxide and carbonate phases. In addition, Zn dissolution was related to extremes zinc isotopic signatures in the leachate; heavier δ 66 Zn values at low pH than at high pH for both slags under open-air atmosphere. On the other hand, bioweathering of both slags was studied in the presence of a pure heterotrophic bacterial strain (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in a bioreactor operated in batch conditon as well as in a semi-flow through reactor with intermittent leachate renewal conditions. P. aeruginosa is shown to play a significant role in slags weathering by enhancing the leaching and solubility of Zn and Pb. In addition, the cumulative bulk release of dissolved Fe, Si, Ca and Mg doubled in the presence of bacteria, probably due to the release of soluble complexing organic molecules (e. g. siderophores). Bacterial biomass served as the bioadsorbent for Pb, Fe and Zn as 70 - 80 % of Pb and Fe, 40 - 60 % of Zn released are attached to and immobilized by the bacterial biomass. Oxides, hydroxides and carbonates were predicted as secondary phases during chemical weathering of slags whereas carbonates and phosphates were dominant phases during bioweathering. These predictions were in agreement with the observations by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysisLe crassier du site MetalEurop (Noyelles-Godault) a accueilli des scories de première fusion entre les années 1936 à 2003.

This paper explores the analytical potential of a comprehensive multivariate statistical strategy for identifying the primary production origins of bloomery iron artifacts using bulk chemical analyses of bloomery <b>smelting</b> <b>slag</b> and slag inclusions in iron artifacts. This strategy includes a multivariate model for identifying distinct slag inclusion types introduced during smelting and refining. Principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis are then applied to <b>smelting</b> <b>slag</b> training sets to create multivariate provenance fields, the chemical distributions of which are defined by kernel density estimation. Single and multi-group evaluation methods are examined.

The efficacy of this strategy is demonstrated through its application to a previously examined data set derived from three iron production experiments and a published archaeological example.

In order to minimize the copper loss in <b>smelting</b> <b>slag</b> and increase the direct recovery of copper in the smelting process, {{it is important to understand}} the settlement mechanisms of copper matte droplets in the slag. The settlement of matte droplets is also directly related to the slag cleaning process where the target is to achieve lowest copper content in the discarded slag. A bottom-blown furnace for slag cleaning is under development in Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals Co., Ltd. Preliminary trials have shown low level of copper in the final slag indicating fluid dynamic plays important role in settlement of the matte droplets. A simulation of copper matte settlement in slags was investigated by settling water droplet in silicone oil with/without stirring. It was found that terminal velocity of water droplet settling in stagnant silicone oil is a function of droplet radius, density difference of two liquids and viscosity of silicone oil (slag). Quantitatively the terminal velocity of water droplet settling in stagnant silicone oil can be represented as a simplified Hadamard-Rybczynski equation. Under stirring by bottom-blown gas, it was found that the settlement velocity of water droplet in silicone oil was enhanced comparing with its settlement in stagnant silicone oil and it increases with increasing gas flowrate until the standing wave occurred. This result clearly explains the advantage of bottom-blown furnace in cleaning of <b>smelting</b> <b>slags</b> and it will be used to further improve the copper recovery in slag cleaning process using bottom-blown furnace...|$|R

Various heterogeneous viscosity models have been tested using large experimental dataset in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO- 2 ̆ 7 FeO 2 ̆ 7 -SiO 2 system in reducing conditions close to the equilibrium with metallic iron. The Roscoe equation with new empirical parameters was found to provide reasonable agreement with experimental data. Examples of model application to industrial nonferrous <b>smelting</b> <b>slag</b> systems are presented. This model can also be applied to coal ash slags...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} phase equilibria and {{liquidus}} temperatures {{have been carried}} out in the systems “FeO”-SiO and ZnO-“FeO”-SiO at Po 10 atm. Research techniques have been developed to enable the ZnO-containing system to be investigated under reducing conditions controlled by CO-CO gas mixture. The experimental approach includes master slag preparation, high-temperature equilibration, quench, and electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA). Phase compositions in the quenched samples were measured by EPMA and used for construction of phase diagram. It was found that the isotherms of the system ZnO-“FeO”-SiO at Po 10 atm are significantly different from those in equilibrium with metallic iron and those predicted by FactSage. The presence of ZnO in copper <b>smelting</b> <b>slag</b> significantly increases the liquidus temperature in spinel primary phase field. Partitioning of ZnO in liquid and spinel is also discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{petrographic}} and petrologic analysis of 21 olivine-pigeonite ureilites, along with new experimental results on melt compositions predicted {{to be in}} equilibrium with ureilite compositions. We conclude that these ureilites are the residues of a partial melting/smelting event. Textural evidence preserved in olivine and pigeonite record the extent of <b>primary</b> <b>smelting.</b> In pigeonite cores, we observe fine trains of iron metal inclusions that formed by the reduction of olivine to pigeonite and metal during <b>primary</b> <b>smelting.</b> Olivine cores lack metal inclusions but the outer grain boundaries are variably reduced by a late-stage reduction event. The modal proportion of pigeonite and percentage of olivine affected by late stage reduction are inversely related and provide an estimation {{of the degree of}} <b>primary</b> <b>smelting</b> during ureilite petrogenesis. In our sample suite, this correlation holds for 16 of the 21 samples examined. Olivine-pigeonite-liquid phase equilibrium constraints are used to obtain temperature estimates for the ureilite samples examined. Inferred smelting temperatures range from approximately 1150 C to just over 1300 C and span the range of estimates published for ureilites containing two or more pyroxenes. Temperature is also positively correlated with modal percent pigeonite. Smelting temperature is inversely correlated with smelting depth [...] the hottest olivine-pigeonite ureilites coming from the shallowest depth in the ureilite parent body. The highest temperature samples also have oxygen isotopic signatures that fall toward the refractory inclusion-rich end of the carbonaceous chondrite-anhydrous mineral (CCAM) slope 1 mixing line. These temperature-depth variations in the ureilite parent body could have been created by a heterogeneous distribution of heat producing elements, which would indicate that isotopic heterogeneities existed in the material from which the ureilite parent body was assembled...|$|R
