40|$|Abstract. Even though RFID {{technology}} has expanded enormously, this expansion has been hindered by privacy concerns. In {{order to prevent}} an adversary from tracking RFID tags and thus breaking location privacy, tags have to update their internal state with every authentication attempt. Although this technique solves the privacy problem, it has the side effect that tags and back office might desynchronize. This desynchronization {{can be caused by}} physical conditions or by adversarial intervention. If we look at consumer <b>product</b> <b>identification,</b> RFID <b>labels</b> and barcodes are bound to coexist for quite some time. In this paper we exploit this coexistence to reduce the workload at the reader/backoffice and allow re-synchronization. Concretely, we propose an authentication protocol that achieves correctness, forward-privacy under mild additional assumptions and synchronization in the random oracle model...|$|R
50|$|Permanent <b>product</b> <b>identification</b> by a <b>label</b> is commonplace; labels need {{to remain}} secure {{throughout}} {{the life of}} the product. For example, a VIN plate on an automobile must be resistant to heat, oils and tampering; similarly, a food label must endure until the food has been used. Removable product labels need to bond until they are removed. For example, a label on a new refrigerator has installation, usage and environmental information: the label {{needs to be able to}} be removed cleanly and easily from the unit once installed.|$|R

Images are analyzed and stored by the system, generating a report, where all the captured visual information is included. The information is further stored in a way, that allows the retrieval of each report. Results and discussion about the system are presented...|$|R

To assess each modality’s potential contribution to overall product experiences, we developed a split-modality approach, in which subjects experienced real-life products through only one modality: vision, touch, audition, or olfaction. Responses focused on (1) description of the sensory experience, (2) <b>product</b> <b>identification,</b> and (3) descriptions of associations and memories linked to this experience. Visual and tactual information were most detailed, made <b>product</b> <b>identification</b> easiest, and yielded the clearest memories of past events, associations to persons, and associations with other products.
