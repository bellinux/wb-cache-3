30|$|The {{second half}} of the {{abstracted}} transmitter-receiver chain, namely demapping and decoding, is combined together in the link performance model (LPM). The formerly calculated <b>postequalization</b> SINR is mapped to BLER and throughput, dependent on the MCS chosen for transmission. This is also the connecting point between the Vienna 5 G LL simulator and SL simulator (cf. Section 4.2. 3).|$|E
30|$|Then, the {{scheduling}} is performed. Also for the scheduler {{several types}} are available, {{such as a}} classic round robin scheduler or a best channel quality indicator (CQI) scheduler, but also user-defined functions can comfortably be added here. According to the respective scheduling metric, users are assigned to transmit on the available elements in the resource grid. Once this is done for all BSs, the link quality model (LQM) is called. This {{is one of the}} major abstractions for our SL simulator, since coding, modulation, channel, and equalizer are combined into a <b>postequalization</b> SINR value, which represents the combined performance of the physical layer transmission (cf. [40]).|$|E
40|$|A {{new channel}} {{estimation}} method for discrete multitone (DMT) communication {{system based on}} sparse Bayesian learning relevance vector machine (RVM) method is presented. The Bayesian frame work is used to obtain sparse solutions for regression tasks with linear models. By exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, sparse Bayesian learning provides accurate models for estimation and consequently equalization. We consider frequency domain equalization (FEQ) using the proposed channel estimate at both the transmitter (preequalization) and receiver (<b>postequalization)</b> and compare the resulting bit error rate (BER) performance curves for both approaches and various channel estimation techniques. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed RVM-based method is superior to the traditional least squares technique...|$|E
40|$|This letter {{presents}} a visible light communication (VLC) {{system based on}} a single 50 - μm gallium nitride light emitting diode (LED). A device of this size exhibits a 3 -dB modulation bandwidth of at least 60 MHz - significantly higher than commercially available white lighting LEDs. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is employed as a modulation scheme. This enables the limited modulation bandwidth of the device to be fully used. Pre- and <b>postequalization</b> techniques, as well as adaptive data loading, are successfully applied to achieve a demonstration of wireless communication at speeds exceeding 3 Gb/s. To date, this is the fastest wireless VLC system using a single LED...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the novel}} concept of {{combined}} equalization is investigated for coded uplink MC-CDMA. For combined-equalization it is presumed that channel state information (CSI) {{is available at}} the transmitter (Tx) {{as well as at the}} receiver (Rx). As a result, combined-equalization achieves considerable performance improvements over preor post-equalization applied alone if the corresponding preand post-equalization techniques within combined-equalization are chosen in a preferred way. For combined-equalization the design criterion at Tx is optimal power assignment with respect to CSI rather than avoidance of multiple-access interference (MAI), whereas MAI cancellation followed by maximum ratio combining (MRC) of the almost interference free signal is the main task at Rx. Thus, combined-equalization offers two degrees of freedom - at Tx and Rx - in order to resolve the two contrary design goals of optimal power allocation with respect to the fading channel and MAI supression/avoidance. As a result, improved single-user bounds for MC-CDMA systems transmitting over fading channels are achieved in the case of combined-equalization. Simulation results show that these improved single-user bounds can be approached very closely even for fully-loaded systems if the combined pre- and <b>postequalization</b> techniques are chosen accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Passive time {{reversal}} has aroused considerable {{interest in}} underwater communications as a computationally inexpensive means of mitigating the intersymbol interference {{introduced by the}} channel using a receiver array. In this paper the basic technique is extended by adaptively weighting sensor contributions to partially compensate for degraded focusing due to mismatch between the assumed and actual medium impulse responses. Two algorithms are proposed, one of which restores constructive interference between sensors, {{and the other one}} minimizes the output residual as in widely used equalization schemes. These are compared with plain time reversal and variants that employ <b>postequalization</b> and channel tracking. They are shown to improve the residual error and temporal stability of basic time reversal with very little added complexity. Results are presented for data collected in a passive time-reversal experiment that was conducted during the MREA’ 04 sea trial. In that experiment a single acoustic projector generated a 2 / 4 -PSK phase-shift keyed stream at 200 / 400 baud, modulated at 3. 6 kHz, and received at a range of about 2 km on a sparse vertical array with eight hydrophones. The data were found to exhibit significant Doppler scaling, and a resampling-based preprocessing method is also proposed here to compensate for that scaling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—It {{is known}} that {{conventional}} nulling-and-canceling (NC) detection for multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) systems cannot exploit all of the available diversity, and, thus, its performance is significantly inferior to that of maximum likelihood (ML) detection. Conventional NC employs the layerwise <b>postequalization</b> signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as reliability measures for layer sorting. These SNRs are average quantities that do {{not depend on the}} received vector. In this paper, we propose the novel dynamic nulling-and-canceling (DNC) technique that uses approximate a posteriori probabilities as measures of layer reliability. The DNC technique is a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) nulling scheme combined with an improved “dynamic” layer sorting rule that exploits the information contained in the current received vector. We calculate the error probability of DNC for a simple special case and show that it is upper bounded by the error probability of conventional NC. Simulation results are presented for spatial multiplexing systems and for systems using linear dispersion codes. It is demonstrated that the DNC technique can yield near-ML performance {{for a wide range of}} system sizes and channel SNRs at a fraction of the computational complexity of the sphere-decoding algorithm for ML detection.
