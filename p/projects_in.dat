40|$|According to {{the problem}} of seriously {{degraded}} natural forest in Southwest China prior to the implementation of Natural Forest Protection Project, under the guidance of principle of practicality and systematicness, we establish the comprehensive-benefit evaluation index system of restoring the degraded natural forest in Southwest China, including 3 second-level indices, 12 third-level indices and 24 fourth-level indices. In addition, we use the method of Analytic Hierarchy Process to conduct comprehensive-benefit evaluation on implementation of Natural Forest Protection <b>Project</b> <b>in</b> Southwest China. The results show that since ten years of implementation of Natural Forest Protection <b>Project</b> <b>in</b> Southwest China, it has gained considerable comprehensive benefit. The comprehensive evaluation index of Natural Forest Protection <b>Project</b> <b>in</b> Southwest China is 83. 08; the ecological benefit index of Natural Forest Protection <b>Project</b> <b>in</b> Southwest China is 56. 75; the economic benefit index of Natural Forest Protection <b>Project</b> <b>in</b> Southwest China is 19. 05; the social benefit index of Natural Forest Protection <b>Project</b> <b>in</b> Southwest China is 7. 28. The effect of construction of Natural Forest Protection <b>Project</b> <b>in</b> Southwest China is good. The evaluation index system and research results in this paper will provide the empirical guidance for comprehensive-benefit evaluation of Natural Forest Protection <b>Project</b> <b>in</b> China, and especially in Southwest China.
