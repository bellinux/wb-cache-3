50|$|The use of psionic powers {{involves}} {{a variant of}} the proficiencies system developed in the 2nd Edition rules. Each power has a score rated in terms of a particular attribute. When attempting to use a power, the player makes a <b>Power</b> <b>Check</b> by rolling 1d20 and comparing the result to the Power Score. A roll {{less than or equal to}} the Power Score means success. Additionally, each power description includes a specific penalty suffered by the psionicist if a 20 is rolled. A psionicist has a fixed number of Psionic Strength Points, derived from his wisdom score, to expend on psionic powers. A psionicist expends the number of PSPs required by a particular power, then attempts a <b>Power</b> <b>Check.</b> If the check fails and the power doesn't work, he forfeits half the PSP cost but is free to try again later. If he passes the check and the power is successful, the psionicist has the option of expending additional PSPs to maintain the power in subsequent rounds. Psionicists recover lost PSPs every hour in which no additional PSPs are expended. The less physical exertion, the more PSPs recovered; a walking PC recovers 3 PSPs per hour, and a resting PC recovers twice as many.|$|E

5000|$|Academic {{reactions}} to the result included Attila Juhász, of the think tank Political Capital, who said: [...] "You should not expect Áder to become a <b>power</b> <b>check</b> and resist the Prime Minister, that's not what you can read from his career. It's also important that the president elected now will be in office until 2017, and the office will be held by someone from the innermost circles of Fidesz even if the party loses the 2014 parliamentary elections". Ferenc Kumin of the Századvég Foundation, said that Áder was presented as representative of the plurality of groups within the country {{in opposition to the}} criticism levelled against him of his closeness to the [...] "political right" [...] and that his first speech to Parliament was [...] "convincing proof" [...] of his readiness for the [...] "high position and the magnitude of his job with due humility". Gábor Filippov of the Hungarian Progressive Institute said that Áder will be to show that he is not bound by his previous Fidesz-associations as he took the duties of President from a non-partisan approach.|$|E
50|$|In The Complete Psionics Handbook, {{the skills}} of the psionicist are based on wisdom and {{constitution}} just as a fighter's abilities derive from strength and a wizard's talents stem from intelligence. Characters of chaotic alignment were not allowed to become psionicists, with the rationale being that volitale chaotics lack the discipline required to focus their mental energies. The book assigned psionic powers to six disciplines, which include clairsentience (divination), psychokinesis (animating and controlling existing objects and forces), psychometabolism (body-changing powers), psychoportation (teleportation variants), telepathy (mental communication and psychic attacks), and metapsionics (enhancement of other psychic abilities). Powers are designated as either sciences (major powers) or devotions (minor powers). As a psionicist gains experience and advances in level, he acquires more powers; for instance, a 1st-level psionicist has only one science and three devotions, but gets 10 sciences and 25 devotions if he makes it to 20th level. As a psionicist rises through the ranks, he also gains access to defense modes, which are special telepathic powers, such as Mind Blank and Tower of Iron Will, which are received free of charge and don't count against a psionicist's normal power limits. Each power has a score rated in terms of a particular attribute. When attempting to use a power, the player makes a <b>Power</b> <b>Check</b> by rolling 1d20 and comparing the result to the Power Score. A roll {{less than or equal to}} the Power Score means success. Additionally, each power description includes a specific penalty suffered by the psionicist if a 20 is rolled. A psionicist has a fixed number of Psionic Strength Points, derived from his wisdom score, to expend on psionic powers. A psionicist simply expends the number of PSPs required by a particular power, then attempts a <b>Power</b> <b>Check.</b> If the check fails and the power doesn't work, he forfeits half the PSP cost but is free to try again later. If he passes the check and the power is successful, the psionicist has the option of expending additional PSPs to maintain the power in subsequent rounds. Psionicists recover lost PSPs every hour in which no additional PSPs are expended. The less physical exertion, the more PSPs recovered; a walking PC recovers 3 PSPs per hour, and a resting PC recovers twice as many. The book presents over 150 powers, such as Enhanced Strength, Inflict Pain, Switch Personality, Hear Light, Psychic Surgery, Flesh Armor, Cause Decay, Levitation, ESP, Teleport, and Clairaudience. Psychic combat has its own chapter, and the book includes updates on psionic monsters (including the thought eater and cerebral parasite), a discussion of society's reaction to psionicists, and a section describing the role of psionics in Ravenloft and other TSR campaign settings.|$|E
5000|$|Trita Parsi {{writes that}} Israel {{supplied}} Iran with {{arms and ammunition}} because it viewed Iraq as {{a danger to the}} peace process in the Middle East. Ariel Sharon believed it was important to [...] "leave a small window open" [...] to the possibility of good relations with Iran in the future. According to David Menashri of Tel Aviv University, a leading expert on Iran, [...] "Throughout the 1980s, no one in Israel said anything about an Iranian threat - the word wasn't even uttered." [...] Parsi explained in an interview with Diane Rehm that despite the anti-Israeli rhetoric publicly displayed by Iran, in actuality, the two nations secretly depended upon the support of one another to face the formidable opposition of both Iraq and the Soviet Union. He cites as evidence the fact that this relationship endured despite the ramped up rhetoric that was brought about by the Islamic Revolution in Iran, up until the collapse of the Soviet Union and destruction of the Iraqi military by the U.S. in the Persian Gulf War, both in 1991. Though he claims that Iran long used Israel as a means to create unified pan-Islamic, anti-Israel sentiment through which all the Muslim countries in the region could be unified under Iranian leadership, Israel and Iran, he argues, only truly began to see each other as strategic rivals after the threat of Soviet Union fell away, and after Iraq no longer could serve as a <b>power</b> <b>check</b> in the region.|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{indication of}} available power {{is required for}} helicopter mission planning purposes. Available power is currently estimated on U. S. Army Blackhawk helicopters by performing a Maximum <b>Power</b> <b>Check</b> (MPC), a manual procedure performed by maintenance pilots on a periodic basis. The MPC establishes Engine Torque Factor (ETF), an indication of available power. It is desirable to replace the current manual MPC procedure with an automated approach that will enable continuous real-time assessment of available power utilizing normal mission data. This report presents an automated power assessment approach which processes data currently collected within helicopter Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) units. The overall approach consists of: 1) a steady-state data filter which identifies and extracts steady-state operating points within HUMS data sets; 2) engine performance curve trend monitoring and updating; and 3) automated ETF calculation. The algorithm is coded in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) and currently runs on a PC. Results from the application of this technique to HUMS mission data collected from UH- 60 L aircraft equipped with T 700 -GE- 701 C engines are presented and compared to manually calculated ETF values.

50|$|The first Dominican {{constitution}} was promulgated on November 6, 1844, {{immediately after the}} nation achieved independence from Haiti. It was a liberal document with many familiar elements—separation of <b>powers,</b> <b>checks</b> and balances, and {{a long list of}} basic rights. However, an authoritarian government replaced the country's liberal, democratic government during its first year. The new regime proceeded to write its own constitution. This second constitution considerably strengthened the executive, weakened the legislative and the judicial branches, and gave the president widespread emergency powers, including the power to suspend basic rights and to rule by decree. Thereafter, governance of the country often alternated between liberal and authoritarian constitutional systems.|$|R

Focusing on the budget surplus, we find that stronger effective checks and balances explain why cycles are weaker in developed and established democracies. Once the discretional component of executive power is isolated, there are significant cycles in all democracies.

5000|$|Thus the {{executive}} ("Her Majesty's Government") is [...] "fused" [...] with Parliament.
