40|$|Abstract. Disc <b>permeameters</b> are the {{preferred}} method for measuring unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Kψ) in situ. However, in swelling clays, Kψ measured using 3 -D measurement and analysis methods are often several {{orders of magnitude}} too high and are of no value for modelling internal drainage. During a series of experiments, the causes of inflated Kψ values were identified and a modified method developed to accurately measure Kψ. On a Black Vertosol, Kψ was strongly correlated with water content and measurement period, with higher flow rates occurring until the soil profile had fully wet up. Near-saturated Kψ measured under <b>permeameters</b> was up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than field-saturated conductivity (KFS) measured in ponded rings. This discrepancy was caused by residual capillarity and unrestricted swelling at the wetting front in unsaturated soils. In addition, lateral flowwas common and surface depressions around <b>permeameters</b> filledwithwater, erroneously contributing to measured infiltration and invalidating assumptions in the 3 -D analysis. To prevent this, <b>permeameters</b> were confined within rings to restrict flow to 1 D, and measured Kψ (confined) was then compared with Kψ (unconfined) and KFS (ponded rings). Confining flow to 1 D reduced Kψ by up to 2 orders of magnitude for a Black Vertosol and {{by a factor of}} 3 for a Red Ferrosol. Near-saturated Kψ from confined <b>permeameters</b> agreed well with KFS after similar short measurement durations (e. g. 0. 5 h), but Kψ was still overestimated until steady-state flow was established. Therefore, to derive estimates ofKψ that reflect natural flow during internal drainage, we recommend (i) pre-wettin...|$|R

The testing was performed on simulated buried waste sites utilizing a variety of encapsulating grouts, including high-sulfate-resistant Portland cement, TECT, (a proprietary iron oxide cement) and molten paraffin. By creating monoliths using in-situ jet grouting of encapsulating materials, the waste is simultaneously protected from subsidence and contained against further migration of contaminants.

Using RF frequencies of 80, 94, and 153 MHz, water flow through the clay sample was sharply decreased for a relatively short period of time and then stabilized at a higher hydraulic conductivity; nevertheless, the stable value was lower than that of the unstimulated case. Using a frequency of 153 MHz, water flow through the sand sample was sharply increased for a relatively short period and then stabilized at a hydraulic conductivity higher than the unstimulated case. At 153 MHz, the test was replicated with a decrease of the input RF power from 30 to 20 W, and then to 10 W, on the clay sample. The results revealed that the change in the hydraulic conductivity was larger at the higher input RF power.

The overall objectives {{of the present study was}} to facilitate and increase the use of sand-bentonite mixtures, including industrial waste materials and mixtures, in landfill barriers, and to increase the knowledge and understanding of the hydraulic conductivity. For engineering purposes, it would be useful to establish a relationship between the hydraulic conductivity of sand-bentonite mixtures and some more easily determined parameters, as it is complicated and time-consuming to determine the hydraulic conductivity of a landfill barrier in situ. Therefore, a methodology to estimate semi-theoretical relationships between hydraulic conductivity, dry density and bentonite content for sand-bentonite mixtures with different types of bentonite was developed. A number of laboratory and field tests were performed in order to develop and verify the semi-theoretical relationships for sand-bentonite mixtures.

The use of a faster, more efficient method would increase the capabilities for tracking changes in hydraulic conductivity of reclamation soil covers with time. Three air <b>permeameter</b> design options were evaluated. One design was chosen and a prototype was built.

Consequently, Darcy <b>permeameter</b> and seepage meter tests were not preferred approaches.

The Hvorslev falling-head <b>permeameter</b> test is considered the most robust method for measuring K of the upper 0. 25 m of the streambed because of the inherent limitations of the empirical grain-size methods and less sediment disturbance for <b>permeameter</b> than slug tests. However, lateral variability in K along transects on the Platte, North Platte, and Wood Rivers was greater than variability in K between valid <b>permeameter,</b> grain-size, or slug tests, indicating that the method used may matter less than making enough measurements to characterize spatial variability adequately. At the Platte River tributary sites, the upper 0. 3 m of the streambed typically had greater K than sediment located 0. 3 to 2. 5 m below the streambed surface, indicating that deposits below the streambed may limit ground water/surface water fluxes.
