5|$|Notable {{events of}} a local scope include the {{university}} boat-race, held in the University Park since 1991, {{which has become a}} local spectator event attracting some 20,000 people. The boat race pits costumed teams from the university departments against each other in inflatable boats in a challenge to win the Gyldne Bækken (Golden Chamber Pot) trophy. The annual lighting of the Christmas lights on the Salling department store in Søndergade has also become an attraction in recent times, <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> pedestrianised city centre with thousands of revellers. Significant dates such as Saint Lucy's Day, Sankt Hans (Saint John's Eve) and Fastelavn are traditionally celebrated with numerous events across the city.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{started the}} season strongly, scoring 74 and 83 {{in a loss}} to New South Wales in the second match of the summer, but was soon confronted by Jardine's Englishmen. He made five and 25 as England crushed Victoria by an innings. Although England did aim at the batsmen's body, they did not enforce {{the second half of}} the Bodyline structure, by not <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> leg side. This changed in the next match, when Woodfull led an Australian XI against the {{tourists}} in Melbourne, in what was effectively a Test rehearsal. With Jardine rested from the match, his deputy Bob Wyatt used the full Bodyline tactics for the first time. The match was drawn and Woodfull struggled, making 18 and a duck. Utilising his hopping technique and attempting to play unorthodox shots resembling overhead tennis smashes, Bradman failed to make an impact, and England were buoyed ahead of the Tests.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} an uncomplicated skin or soft tissue abscess is opening and draining. There {{does not appear}} to be any benefit from also using antibiotics in most cases. A small amount of evidence did not find benefit from <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> abscess with gauze.|$|E

25|$|On January 12, 1991, Pioneer Courthouse Square {{held one}} of the largest gatherings in its history, when a crowd {{estimated}} at more than 12,000 attended an anti-war rally protesting the country's involvement in the Gulf War, <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> square and overflowing onto the surrounding streets, which police temporarily closed to traffic.|$|E
25|$|Case-hardening {{involves}} <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> low-carbon iron {{within a}} substance high in carbon, then heating this pack to encourage carbon migration into {{the surface of}} the iron. This forms a thin surface layer of higher carbon steel, with the carbon content gradually decreasing deeper from the surface. The resulting product combines much of the toughness of a low-carbon steel core, with the hardness and wear resistance of the outer high-carbon steel.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, four DLC <b>packs</b> were released. <b>The</b> first <b>pack,</b> <b>the</b> Faction <b>Pack,</b> {{was to be}} {{available}} in June 2013, however the release date was pushed back to July 2013. This pack contains three bonus single-player missions, with the player playing as a Red Line Sniper, a Fourth Reich 'Heavy' soldier, and a Polis Ranger in training, with new weapons {{not found in the}} main storyline. <b>The</b> other three <b>packs</b> were released within 60 days of releasing <b>the</b> Faction <b>Pack.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>pack,</b> <b>the</b> Tower <b>Pack,</b> gives single-player challenge missions that have online leaderboards. <b>The</b> third <b>pack,</b> <b>the</b> Developer <b>Pack,</b> features a shooting gallery, a combat simulator, an in-game museum, and a single-player mission titled [...] "The Spiders' Nest".

50|$|The {{two major}} ice <b>packs</b> are <b>the</b> Arctic ice <b>pack</b> and <b>the</b> Antarctic ice <b>pack.</b> <b>The</b> most {{important}} areas of <b>pack</b> ice are <b>the</b> polar ice <b>packs</b> formed from seawater in the Earth's polar regions: <b>the</b> Arctic ice <b>pack</b> of <b>the</b> Arctic Ocean and <b>the</b> Antarctic ice <b>pack</b> of <b>the</b> Southern Ocean. Polar packs significantly change their size during seasonal {{changes of the}} year. Because of vast amounts of water added to or removed from the oceans and atmosphere, the behavior of polar ice packs has {{a significant impact on}} global changes in climate.|$|R
25|$|Chromatin {{changes are}} a {{plausible}} {{explanation for the}} co-regulation seen in clusters. Chromatin consists of the DNA strand and histones that {{are attached to the}} DNA. Regions were chromatin is very tightly packed are called heterochromatin. Heterochromatin consists very often of remains of viral genomes, transposons and other junk DNA. Because of tight <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> DNA is almost unreachable for the transcript machinery, covering deleterious DNA with proteins {{is the way in which}} the cell can protect itself. Chromatin which consists of functional genes is often an open structure were the DNA is accessible. However, most of the genes are not needed to be expressed all the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} applying the carbon {{to the surface}} of the iron involved <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> iron in a mixture of ground bone and charcoal or a combination of leather, hooves, salt and urine, all inside a well-sealed box. This carburizing package is then heated to a high temperature but still under the melting point of the iron and left at that temperature for a length of time. The longer the package is held at the high temperature, the deeper the carbon will diffuse into the surface. Different depths of hardening are desirable for different purposes: sharp tools need deep hardening to allow grinding and resharpening without exposing the soft core, while machine parts like gears might need only shallow hardening for increased wear resistance.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{additional}} instruments {{are used for}} <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for producing very fine pieces use additional tools. In Kerman, a saber like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In Bijar, a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on in order to compact the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process to compact the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression of the pile, warps, and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.|$|E

25|$|The Kamnas {{had four}} children, though one {{died in an}} {{accident}} at the farm at age three. One son, Edgar, in time took over the farming on the farm. About 1910 the Kamna family built an addition to the barn, and around 1920 built a second addition to the barn. They continued adding buildings to the farm in the early 1900s including a woodshed, privy, pumphouse, chicken coop, smokehouse, potato shed, and a canning shed. The last addition was a garage in the 1920s. In the 1920s the family added indoor plumbing to the farmhouse, {{and in the process}} enclosed parts of two porches. The Kamnas grew oats, fescue, rye grass, vetch, and sub-clover on the farm and used the barn for sorting and <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> seeds, running the farm into the 1950s. As of 2007 the farm was owned by Wayne Reed and Petrina Pometto. On October 10, 2007, the Manning–Kamna Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|Periodic {{explicit}} object packing: Git stores each {{newly created}} object {{as a separate}} file. Although individually compressed, this takes {{a great deal of}} space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of packs that store a large number of objects in one file (or network byte stream) called packfile, delta-compressed among themselves. Packs are compressed using the heuristic that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (newly added history) are still stored singly, and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose, but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the git gc command. For data integrity, both packfile and its index have SHA-1 checksum inside, and also the file name of packfile contains a SHA-1 checksum. To check integrity, run the git fsck command.|$|E

500|$|In 1865 Clifford {{was chosen}} to act {{as one of the}} special counsels prosecuting former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. [...] Davis was to be prosecuted for treason, but {{for a variety of reasons}} the charges were {{eventually}} dropped after four years of political and legal wrangling. [...] Clifford contributed to a debate in 1866 over the difficulty of prosecuting Davis in Virginia, noting that without essentially <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> jury, a failed prosecution would result in the awkward outcome of a Virginia jury in some sense overturning the outcome of the war.

The rebels had sailed the ship to Nassau in the Bahamas, British territory, where most were freed, as Britain had abolished slavery. The owners of the slaves brought suit for $150,000 against their insurers, who declined to pay. Benjamin made several arguments, the most prominent of which was that the slaveowners had brought the revolt on themselves by <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> slaves in overcrowded conditions.|$|E

500|$|A fire {{destroyed}} {{half the}} village in 1895, burning 26 buildings and causing more than $125,000 in damage. The village had no form of fire protection, though {{there had been an}} attempt prior to the fire to establish such a utility.

About 10,000 people came to Rosendale following the fire to look at the charred remains, <b>packing</b> <b>the</b> village in [...] "a scene [...] an old-time country fair". In 1900, the village attempted to purchase a water plant for $40,000. The New York & Rosendale Cement Company sued to prevent bonding for the purchase. Before the case could reach the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, the village elected a new board of trustees, which attempted to block the purchase. They were unsuccessful and the village was forced to complete the purchase in 1903. The village enacted an ordinance in December 1901 to remove snow, ice and dirt from local gutters and sidewalks. Power lines were built throughout {{the village in}} 1906.|$|E
