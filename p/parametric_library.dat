30|$|HBIM {{processes}} are continuously evolving. Latest studies attempt to automate the HBIM process, creating an accessible and modifiable <b>parametric</b> <b>library</b> of pre-defined digital objects that can represent {{a diversity of}} actual objects. This, for example, has been attempted with the architectural grammar of classical Europe and Ireland in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} century [19]. This approach may be argued to be at odds with the nature of heritage: while historic objects and building components are valued for their individuality, parametric libraries implicitly assume that they can be reproduced digitally with generalisable digital objects. The possibilities and limitations of parametric libraries are under active research. Dore and Murphy [11] propose an integration of HBIM library using ADE, a CityGML extension (GML stands for Generative Modelling Language). ADE enriches the existing semantic class in CityGML, making library objects more suitable for describing built heritage. Indeed, ADE divides the model into sub-elements that are enriched with attributes and external references. External references can be databases or web resources, containing heritage-specific information such as historical data, chronological phases, different layers, etc. Efforts like ADE have developed the mainstream HBIM knowledge. However, many researchers agree on the fact that—in general—further research is needed [11, 16, 27, 30, 62] to simplify essential tasks,—and specifically—especially <b>parametric</b> <b>library</b> creation, which is still manual [9, 27] and time-consuming [7, 62].|$|E
30|$|<b>Parametric</b> {{smart object}} <b>libraries</b> are {{an attempt to}} square the circle: to create generalizable objects that can {{represent}} individual features of historic buildings. Their advantage is that they contain objects that are virtual format of existing constructive elements, {{and need to be}} modelled just once. Their parametric nature is of great advantage as they can be modified and updated as needed, e.g. when there has been a maintenance, a process of change, a new discovery, etc. <b>Parametric</b> <b>libraries</b> can contain different kind of objects: constructive elements, architecture-language components, constructive techniques, etc. There are two main libraries so far: HBIM and JHBIM, which is a specific HBIM extension for Old Jeddah. These libraries have been created following procedural modelling rules, coded with GDL scripts, in order to automatically create elements that are based on shape grammars. Nevertheless, using <b>parametric</b> smart objects <b>libraries</b> can be slightly restrictive, since if a specific architectural style is not present in <b>parametric</b> <b>libraries,</b> they need to be manually modified. As new libraries for historical styles are developed, research will be needed in order to identify the limitations of this approach.|$|R
40|$|Jig has {{widely used}} in various {{applications}} such as in inspection, machining, assembly and fabrication works. Some cases jig developmental works {{take more than a}} year to complete especially in automotive and aerospace industries where precision and safety are prime important. In most applications in small and medium scale industries, the jig design works are done manually and based on trial and error basis. This results in losses in production time and cost. With the development of computer and information technology, the design work can be simplified and the whole fabrication process can be shortened. In this project, Unigraphic software was utilized to document the design procedure and facilitate the whole jig design and assembly process via <b>parametric</b> part <b>library</b> concept. The spreadsheet function within Unigraphic software was used to parameterize all the common parts in jig application. Three case studies were used in developing the design procedure which includes two inspection and one machining jigs. The proposed procedure was written in the sequential order according to the norm of jig design procedure being practiced in small and medium scale industries. In order to design a jig, the designer has to follow the steps in the proposed procedure and match with the <b>parametric</b> part <b>library</b> database which has been developed using Unigraphic software environment. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure and <b>parametric</b> parts <b>library</b> created in the Unigraphic software were evaluated using two different jigs for machining and inspecting a motorcycle oil pump body. It is found that the proposed procedure and <b>parametric</b> part <b>library</b> concept works well for designing and assembling these two jigs...|$|R

40|$|Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) {{is a novel}} {{prototype}} {{library of}} parametric objects based on historic data and a system of cross platform programmes for mapping parametric objects onto a point cloud and image survey data. The HBIM process begins with remote collection of survey data using a terrestrial laser scanner combined with digital photo modelling. The next stage involves the design and construction of a <b>parametric</b> <b>library</b> of objects, {{which are based on}} the manuscripts ranging from Vitruvius to 18 th century architectural pattern books. In building parametric objects, the problem of file format and exchange of data has been overcome within the BIM ArchiCAD software platform by using geometric descriptive language (GDL). The plotting of parametric objects onto the laser scan surveys as building components to create or form the entire building is the final stage in the reverse engin- eering process. The final HBIM product is the creation of full 3 D models including detail behind the object's surface concerning its methods of construction and material make-up. The resultant HBIM can automatically create cut sections, details and schedules in addition to the orthographic projections and 3 D models (wire frame or textured) ...|$|E
40|$|In an {{extensive}} {{review of existing literature}} {{a number of}} observations were made in relation to the current approaches for recording and modelling existing buildings and environments: Data collection and pre-processing techniques are becoming increasingly automated to allow for near real-time data capture and fast processing of this data for later modelling applications. Current BIM software is almost completely focused on new buildings and has very limited tools and pre-defined libraries for modelling existing and historic buildings. The development of reusable <b>parametric</b> <b>library</b> objects for existing and historic buildings supports modelling with high levels of detail while decreasing the modelling time. Mapping these parametric objects to survey data, however, is still a time-consuming task that requires further research. Promising developments have been made towards automatic object recognition and feature extraction from point clouds for as-built BIM. However, results are currently limited to simple and planar features. Further work is required for automatic accurate and reliable reconstruction of complex geometries from point cloud data. Procedural modelling can provide an automated solution for generating 3 D geometries but lacks the detail and accuracy required for most as-built applications in AEC and heritage fields...|$|E
40|$|International audienceParametric {{modelling}} approach {{applied to}} cultural heritage virtual representation {{is a field}} of research explored for years since it can address many limitations of digitising tools. For example, essential historical sources for fortification virtual reconstructions like plans-reliefs have several shortcomings when they are scanned. To overcome those problems, knowledge based-modelling can be used: knowledge models based on the analysis of theoretical literature of a specific domain such as bastioned fortification treatises can be {{the cornerstone of the}} creation of a <b>parametric</b> <b>library</b> of fortification components. Implemented in Grasshopper, these components are manually adjusted on the data available (i. e. 3 D surveys of plans-reliefs or scanned maps). Most of the fortification area is now modelled and the question of accuracy assessment is raised. A specific method is used to evaluate the accuracy of the parametric components. The results of the assessment process will allow us to validate the parametric approach. The automation of the adjustment process can finally be planned. The virtual model of fortification {{is part of a larger}} project aimed at valorising and diffusing a very unique cultural heritage item: the collection of plans-reliefs. As such, knowledge models are precious assets when automation and semantic enhancements will be considered...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a {{new approach}} for generating digital heritage models from laser scan or photogrammetric data using Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM). HBIM is a plug-in for Building Information Modelling (BIM) software that uses <b>parametric</b> <b>library</b> objects and procedural modelling techniques to automate the modelling stage. The HBIM process involves a reverse engineering solution whereby parametric interactive objects representing architectural elements are mapped onto laser scan or photogrammetric survey data. A library of parametric architectural objects has been designed from historic manuscripts and architectural pattern books. These parametric objects were built using an embedded programming language within the ArchiCAD BIM software called Geometric Description Language (GDL). Procedural modelling techniques have been implemented with the same language to create a parametric building façade which automatically combines library objects based on architectural rules and proportions. Different configurations of the façade are controlled by user parameter adjustment. The automatically positioned elements of the façade can be subsequently refined using graphical editing while overlaying the model with orthographic imagery. Along with this semi-automatic method for generating façade models, manual plotting of library objects {{can also be used}} to generate a BIM model from survey data. After the 3 D model has been completed conservation documents such as plans, sections, elevations and 3 D views can be automatically generated for conservation projects. 1...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the crucial}} {{problems}} in integrating machines and human experts in new-generation engineering design and manufacture systems is the effective man-machine communication. The object-oriented knowledge-based environment requires an appropriate graphical user interface built on the modern principles of object- and constraint-oriented programming, visual languages and hypermedia.
