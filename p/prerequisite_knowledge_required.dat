Casuistry offers a much needed corrective to principle-based approaches. I offer a defense of a 2 ̆ 2 principle-modest 2 ̆ 2 casuistry and explore the epistemology of casuistry, describing the <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>required</b> for casuistry.

By stimulating their mental processes, it should enable students to develop higher level math skills and acquire problem solving abilities. The present paper describes the design of a study of metacognitive processes, set up in problem solving conditions and applied to the math field, supported by online networking technologies. The cultural hypotheses underlying the project are the studies on Cooperative Learning, in general, and on the role of this approach in teaching/learning mathematics, in particular. Reference is made not only to the studies of Vygotsky and Johnson & Johnson, but also to those of Schoenfeld and Cousinet. During presentation of the work at the Congress, the results of the above pilot study, analysing the metacognitive processes adopted by the students during use of the first hypermedia prototype, will be illustrated...|$|R

40|$|The science {{sequence}} {{typical of}} most United States high {{schools of the}} twentieth century placed biology first, chemistry second and physics as the final science course. This sequence is being challenged as we enter the twenty first century. Those who comprehend the underpinnings of modern science recognize the strong argument for the new high school science sequence. Review of modern biology texts reveal that <b>prerequisite</b> chemistry <b>knowledge</b> is <b>required</b> to most fully comprehend modern biology. 1 Review of typical chemistry texts reveal that <b>prerequisite</b> physics <b>knowledge</b> is <b>required</b> to most fully comprehend chemistry. It would seem most logical that the instructional system, to be most productive, would sequence courses according to prerequisites to maximize instructional productivity and efficiency. The sequence suggested by such an instructional analysis places Physics first, Chemistry as a second course and a Biology as the third course in the proposed sequence. This new suggested sequence is completely inverted from the predominant sequence since the late 19 th century. Currently a majority of schools still follow some variation of the traditional sequence that starts in Biology which is followed by Chemistry and then Physics. The goal of this small single school investigation was to establish if a sequence in science courses {{can make a difference in}} high school science learning.

40|$|Arnold Sommerfeld, a German {{theoretical}} physicist, stated ‘If {{you want}} to be a physicist, you must do three things—first, study mathematics, second, study more mathematics, and third, do the same’ (as cited in Kevles, 1995, p. 200). The importance of mathematics appears to be lost in a modern world of open universities with an emphasis on social inclusion.

This paper will present the preliminary results of a study examining students enrolled in an introductory physics course as part of an enabling programme in regional Australia.

Students enrolled in the Introductory Physics course are required to have a very basic level of mathematics but mathematics and physics staff believe the level should be higher.

40|$|Germ  cell  transplantation  technology  may  become  an  important  tool  for  the  successful  closed {{life-cycle}} aquaculture {{of southern}} bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) (SBT), to ease the fishing pressure on the wild stocks and develop a self-sustained industry. Currently, there are  issues  surrounding  the  care  and  maintenance  of  SBT  broodstock,  as  they  are  large  animals (up to 160 kg) and reach sexual maturity at a late age (10 – 12 years). Germ cell transplantation  has  the  potential  to  overcome  the  difficulties  in  maintaining  large  bodied  broodstock, such as SBT, by transplanting donor-derived testicular cells (SBT) into a smaller bodied  surrogate  species  such  as  yellowtail  kingfish  (Seriola  lalandi)   (YTK).   YTK  has  been  selected as a prospective surrogate host, as YTK larval development and spawning occurs at a similar temperature as SBT, and reaches sexual maturity at a younger size (3 kg) and age (3 - 4 years) than SBT. Another reason why YTK has been selected as a potential surrogate for SBT {{is that they are}} a commercially important species and the aquaculture of this species is already well developed in South Australia, in close proximity to where SBT testis material is available. The current study has laid the framework for a germ cell transplantation protocol for SBT by establishing some of the <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>required</b> for this technology to progress. The first component of the study optimised an effective protocol to collect and dissociate SBT testis material to obtain a high number of viable testicular cells for transplantation was developed.   This  component  also  examined  the  effect  of  size  and  maturity  of  SBT  on  obtaining viable cell numbers. Secondly, the study confirmed an effective method to cryopreserve  SBT  testis  material  to  ensure  that  SBT  testicular  cells  were  readily  available  year-round for germ cell transplantation. The study established the optimised rearing conditions for YTK in a small-scale rearing system in the third component. Lastly, the current study assessed the suitability of YTK as a surrogate host for SBT by successfully transplanting SBT testicular cells into YTK larvae, and then rear those transplanted larvae at low density in a  small-scale  system.   This  component  successfully  demonstrated  that  YTK  supported  the  migration and colonisation of transplanted SBT testicular cells and therefore, YTK has the potential to act as a surrogate broodstock for SBT.

While institutions are responding to this increased demand by establishing graduate programs in bioinformatics, entrance barriers for these programs are high, largely due to the significant <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> which is <b>required,</b> both in the fields of biochemistry and computer science.

50|$|Bloom's {{original}} theory {{assumes that}} with practice, the slower learners will become faster learners {{and the gap}} of individual differences will disappear.

Bloom places the blame on teaching settings where students aren't given enough time to reach mastery levels in <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> before moving on to the new lesson. He also uses this to explain why variance in student learning is smaller in the first grade when compared to students in the 7th grade (the smart get smarter, and the slower fall further behind).

40|$|Purpose For {{traditional}} instructor-led classroom presentations, {{the designer}} can {{ensure that the}} learner makes a connection to new factual type of material by becoming familiar with the <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> that is <b>required</b> to understand the instructional presentation and adjusting {{the level of the}} presentation and the examples provided during the presentation based on student feedback. Content organization and practical examples that enhance the online learning experience of new tasks and procedures and tie new procedures and job-tasks to old ones, however, create more of a challenge. The challenge is to avoid the creation of what is called “functional fixedness ” which occurs as a result of becoming focused on a single task structure rather than its application {{to a wide variety of}} situations. It also is a product of the difficulty of providing a logical sequence for exercises and relevant examples that provide learning experiences that are sufficiently linked so as to be integrated with previous tasks and skills. This paper examines how we can assist learners in to integrate new concepts and procedures to the level where they can be applied to similar by making them active participants in the instructional presentation and providing them with useful examples and tools by which to integrate new concepts and procedures with the existing knowledge base. It also establishes conditions to ensure that the learner receives meaningful learning regardless of the current knowledge or experience with the new system. They include: • The instructional product must make the learner an active participant in the learning process. This follows principles of Wittrock’s Generative Learning Theory. • The external requirements of the instruction must match the internal conditions of the learning. This is similar to Gagne’s Conditions for Learning. • The instructional exercises must be structured in such a way as to stimulate cognitive activity...|$|R
