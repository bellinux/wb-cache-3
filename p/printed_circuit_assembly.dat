40|$|Boundary scan and {{built-in}} self-test are {{supplemented by}} conventional testing techniques. Eight discrete levels of testing were implemented. by Cary J. Wright The HP E 5200 A broadband service analyzer {{is a highly}} complex digital system packed into a field-portable case. During its design, it was essential to achieve the highest densities possible by {{using some of the}} latest technologies. To achieve the functionality required, the main processor <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>assembly</b> for the product had to be extremely densely populated. This <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>assembly</b> contains over 1000 components, including 29 XFP parts, 30 FP parts, and almost 8700 solder joints (see “HP E 5200 A Broadband Service Analyzer Surface Mount Assembly ” for further details). Because of the sheer density of the <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>assembly,</b> testing by conventional bed-of-nails in-circuit techniques alone was not feasible. In addition, normal defect rates specified by surface mount placement vendors were in the order of 200 ppm. From this data, each <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>assembly</b> was predicted to have at least one defective solder joint after the placement process. Because of the high cost of this <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>assembly,</b> it was very important to be able to accurately and quickly identify defects with high success rates. The target yield for the assembly and commissioning process was set to 100 %. Overall Test Strategy To overcome the challenges presented, it was necessary to implement a comprehensive test strategy that included boundary scan and built-in self-test, supplemented by conventional testing techniques. With this complex <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>assembly</b> it was decided that a multitiered testing strategy would be used. Such a strategy would increase yield by identifying faults early and by verifying functionality in small discrete stages. Another advantage was that the tests could be reused for other purposes such as service, calibration, or confidence tests. Fig. 1 shows the production test strategy that was implemented for the service analyzer project. Eight discrete levels of testing were implemented. Each level verifies basic functionality before proceeding to the next stage of assembly or testing. The chance of catastrophic and difficult-to-diagnose failures is minimized...|$|E

50|$|Wave {{soldering}} is a bulk soldering process used in {{the manufacture}} of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards. The circuit board is passed over a pan of molten solder in which a pump produces an upwelling of solder that looks like a standing wave.
