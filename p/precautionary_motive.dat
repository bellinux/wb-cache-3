From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself.

40|$|The notable {{increase}} in international reserve holdings {{over the past}} decade and their use during the global financial crisis of 2008 / 2009 has sparked renewed interest in the analysis of the optimal level of reserve holdings, in particular in countries which are subject to sudden stops. Less attention has been given to the optimal composition of reserves and even less to the joint determination of level and composition. In light of current developments, we show that despite the common belief that higher reserve levels should go along with higher diversification to minimize the opportunity costs from holding reserves, the opposite may even be true. It depends on the factors that stand behind the {{increase in}} reserves whether increased diversification is optimal or not. We estimate for a panel of 20 countries the determinants of the currency composition of reserves and show how it is affected by the different motives of reserve accumulation. In line with the recent literature on reserve levels we find that reserve accumulation is primarily driven by <b>precautionary</b> <b>motives,</b> which in turn underpins the allocation of reserves to safe assets. While we find primarily evidence of the allocation being a function of <b>precautionary</b> <b>motives,</b> we also find some weak evidence for reserve accumulation to lead to more diversified portfolios if reserve accumulation is driven by other factors than <b>precautionary</b> <b>motives.</b> JEL Classification: F 31, F 33, E 42, G 11 currency composition, <b>Precautionary</b> <b>Motives,</b> reserve accumulation...|$|R

We would expect considerable wealth mobility over the life cycle if the life-cycle motives and incentives to accumulate are strong and affect behavior. The data are from an administrative Swedish source that retains wealth information from tax registers. The data are unique, they follow a large sample of households over almost 40 years. There is substantial mobility when we follow individual households over long enough time spans. We find that wealth mobility increased until the end of the 1980 s and then started to decrease.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{importance}} of <b>precautionary</b> and mercantilist <b>motives</b> in accounting for the hoarding of international reserves by developing countries, and provides a model that quantifies the welfare gains associated with optimal self insurance against sudden stops and capital flight. The variables associated with the mercantilist motive, while statistically significant, can only account for {{a small part of}} reserve accumulation. A more conspicuous variable is the degree of capital account liberalization, boding well for <b>precautionary</b> <b>motives</b> as they are strengthened by international capital flows. Further evidence of <b>precautionary</b> <b>motives</b> is provided by the strength of variables reflecting two past financial crises in Mexico and Asia. Overall, the empirical results suggest that <b>precautionary</b> <b>motives</b> played a more prominent role behind reserve accumulation by developing countries. We then investigate the micro foundation of precautionary demand in an open, emerging market economy where banks finance longterm projects with short-term deposits, following Diamond and Dybvig (1983). A large precautionary demand for international reserves—self-insurance against sudden stop—arises when liquidity shocks can force a premature closing of long-term projects and impose large output costs on the economy.

50|$|Precautionary saving {{is saving}} (non-expenditure of {{a portion of}} income) that occurs in {{response}} to uncertainty regarding future income. The <b>precautionary</b> <b>motive</b> to delay consumption and save {{in the current period}} rises {{due to the lack of}} completeness of insurance markets. Accordingly, individuals will not be able to insure against some bad state of the economy in the future. They anticipate that if this bad state is realized, they will earn lower income. To avoid adverse effects of future income fluctuations and retain a smooth path of consumption, they set aside a precautionary reserve, called precautionary savings, by consuming less in the current period, and resort to it in case the bad state is realized in the future.|$|E

Following Jappelli and Pistaferri (2000) I analyze a 3 - year (1989 - 1993) rotating {{panel of the}} Bank of Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW). I exploit a unique indicator of subjective variance of income growth, which allows to measure {{the strength of the}} <b>precautionary</b> <b>motive</b> for saving, and a variety of survey-based indicators of liquidity constraints. However, my analysis deviates from Jappelli and Pistaferri’s in three aspects. First of all, I attempt to differentiate between the standard <b>precautionary</b> <b>motive</b> for saving caused by uncertainty from the one due to liquidity constraints. I address this issue by using an endogenous switching regression approach, which allows me to cope with endogeneity issues associated with sample splitting techniques. Secondly, I try to capture changes in consumption behaviour of households who are not constrained at present, but expect binding constraints in the future. Finally,I cope with the downward bias in the estimation of the parameter associated to the subjective variance of income growth, using a direct measure of risk aversion. I eventually found the <b>precautionary</b> <b>motive</b> for savings to be stronger for those households who face binding constraints, or expect constraints to be binding in the future. Indeed, a complementarity relation exists between precautionary savings and liquidity constraints. Moreover, the introduction of a survey-based measure of risk aversion allows a better identification of the coefficient associated with the subjective measure of variance of income growth. <b>precautionary</b> <b>motive,</b> liquidity constraints...|$|E
