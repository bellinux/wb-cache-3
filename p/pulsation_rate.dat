These are named after the prototypical star for such variables: Delta Scuti. Delta Scuti variables typically range from spectral class A2 to F8, and a stellar luminosity class of III (subgiants) to V (main sequence stars). They are short-period variables that have a regular <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> between 0.025 and 0.25 days. Delta Scuti stars have an abundance of elements similar to the Sun's (see Population I stars) and between 1.5 and [...] The <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> of IK Pegasi A has been measured at 22.9 cycles per day, or once every 0.044 days.|$|E

The four separate milking cups are removed individually, meaning that an empty quarter does not stay attached while the other three are finishing, resulting in less threat of injury.

50|$|Milking {{machines}} {{work in a}} {{way that}} is different from hand milking or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the teat canal (or opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow. The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate)</b> to allow the liner to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue. The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking phase) and closed (rest phase) is called the pulsation ratio.|$|E

In this study, three important factors were investigated in vitro using a mock flow loop: a) the <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> of the flow, b) the hematocrit of blood and c) the vessel wall compliance. The results may be useful {{for the development of a}} noninvasive method for assessing blood vessel wall compliance and fetal hematocrit in utero.

40|$|In the Hong Kong rocky intertidal, the {{demography}} of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita japonica {{is largely}} determined by regular, intense mortality {{events in the}} summer and subsequent pulses of recruitment in late summer. During 2 consecutive summers from 2000 to 2001, 34 to 52 and 98 to 99 % of T. japonica were killed on the mid- and high shore, respectively, with younger cohorts suffering higher mortality in the mid-shore. Recruitment of T. japonica occurs in late summer; as a result, the population in the high shore consists of a single cohort of new recruits, while the mid-shore supports 2 cohorts (new recruits and adult survivors). To investigate how thermal stress affects acorn barnacle populations, air and rock temperatures and sub-lethal physiological measures (body temperature, sinus <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> and haemolymph osmolality) of T. japonica were taken on the mid- and high shore during daytime, low spring tides in June-July 2001. Mean body temperature increased gradually after emersion, reaching a maximum of ∼ 48 °C at noon, 6 to 8 °C higher than the adjacent rock surface. T. japonica entered a heat-induced coma when body temperatures reached 45 °C. Osmolality of the haemolymph and sinus <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> increased with body temperature as a result of water loss and possibly altered haemolymph pressure; both were greater in high than in mid-shore individuals, with barnacles on horizontal surfaces being hotter than those on vertical surfaces. Body temperature and sinus <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> differed between shore levels, but were similar at spatial scales of 1 to 20 m at the same tidal height. Haemolymph osmolality, however, varied over this distance, probably due to individual variation in the amount of mantle water trapped before emersion and possible micro-habitat differences. Heat and desiccation stress, therefore, {{play an important role in}} determining the life history of T. japonica by limiting their distribution and abundance and influencing the demography of the population at different spatial scales. © Inter-Research 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The results about a {{scientific}} research regarding milking of mares of Murgese breed are related {{in the present}} work. The developed pregramme had the aim to compare hand and mechanical milking with two <b>pulsation</b> <b>rates</b> (120 and 140 cycles/min) and to define dimensional standards, mechanical and operative solutions, to design and/or to conform machine milking of mares with special reference to Murgese breed. The study was carried out on 4 multiparous mares, after a suitable adaptation period. The trial lasted 45 days, and during this period the animals were milked twice a day. The research showed a considerable advantage, both from a productive and a technical-operative point of view, to milk this species with mechanical plants, instead of by hand. Moreover, mechanical milking at 140 cycles/min, was the better conditions than those examined, because it’s possible to obtain the best productions of milk, the smallest specific power consumptions, and moreover the greatest working capacities and labour productivity. The standard of adaptation of the observed animals to the mechanical milking and their obtained productions, can be considered adequate; yet, with the present study, some mechanical and operative solutions are defined to project plants and to fit in secirity those existing...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{a number}} of {{industrial}} scale pulsed disc and doughnut (PDD) solvent extraction columns have been operating with no pulsation. However most of the published research studies in the literature that describe and predict the performance of PDD columns were developed for pulsing conditions. In this study the Sauter-mean drop diameter, d(32), was measured and correlated under pulsing and non-pulsing conditions using a 75 mm diameter PDD column. Under non-pulsing conditions, {{the results show that}} the d(32) slightly decreased with increasing dispersed phase velocity, while there was no noticeable change in d(32) with continuous phase velocity. Under pulsing conditions, the d(32) decreased with increasing pulsation intensity from zero. The cumulative drop size distribution in disc and doughnut columns was found to be predicted well using the Weibull function.

40|$|Pulsations {{driven by}} partial {{ionization}} of hydrogen {{in the envelope}} are often considered important for driving winds from red supergiants (RSGs). In particular, {{it has been suggested}} by some authors that the <b>pulsation</b> growth <b>rate</b> in a RSG can be high enough to trigger an unusually strong wind (or a super-wind), when the luminosity to mass ratio becomes sufficiently large. Using both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic stellar evolution models with initial masses ranging from 15 to 40, we investigate 1) how the <b>pulsation</b> growth <b>rate</b> depends on the global parameters of supergiant stars, and 2) what would be the consequences of a pulsation-driven super-wind, if it occurred, for the late stages of massive star evolution. We suggest that such a super-wind history would be marked by a runaway increase, followed by a sudden decrease, of the winds mass loss rate. The impact on the late evolution of massive stars would be substantial, with stars losing a huge fraction of their H-envelope even with a significantly lower initial mass than previously predicted. This might explain the observed lack of Type II-P supernova progenitors having initial mass higher than about 17. We also discuss possible implications for a subset of Type IIn supernovae...|$|R

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the udder characteristics, {{partitioning}} of milk in the mammary gland and efficiency of machine milking in donkeys. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of the udder and teats, milk yield in relation to pulsation rates (90, 120 and 150 cycles/min), milk partitioning in the mammary gland, composition of the spontaneously removed and residual milk fractions and milking efficiency. Forty-one healthy Martina Franca jennies in the third month of lactation and routinely milked twice daily were used in three studies. Udder characteristics were evaluated by direct measurements and ultrasonographic scanning. Residual milk was obtained by milking after an oxytocin administration (40 IU i. m.). The prevalent shapes were 'bowl' for udders and 'conical' for teats. After milking the udder characteristics decreased within a range from- 11 · 6 % (udder depth) to- 25 · 7 % (diameter of teat at the base). The internal structures of the udder resulted as several pockets of ducts empting directly into the teat. The <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> of 120 cycles/min improved (P< 0 · 05) the milk yield in comparison to the 90 and 150 cycles/min, reduced the residual milk fraction, thus improved (P< 0 · 05) milking efficiency. Residual milk composition had higher (P< 0 · 05) fat content and somatic cell count than the spontaneously removed milk fraction. The udders revealed several pockets of ducts empting into the teat instead of a single cisternal cavity and showed a certain compliance.

40|$|As {{telecommunications}} traffic grows {{in response to}} the internet and other high bandwidth users, there will be an increasing need to operate at high data rates that are beyond the processing speeds of electronics. Semiconductor lasers which incorporate individually contacted sections with direct current injection can be applied for high speed optical signal processing because they offer bistabilities, self-pulsations (SP), and excitability on a very fast time scale. SPs are particularly interesting since applications such as clock recovery for signal regeneration and demultiplexing can be addressed. Different laser designs have been investigated to tailor fast SPs. Devices containing two DFB sections provide SP due to dispersive Q-switching (DQS) with <b>pulsation</b> <b>rates</b> in the order of the relaxation oscillations, as well as mode beating pulsations in dual-mode lasers with two highly-pumped DFB sections. In this talk we focus on experiments with lasers where the optical feedback is given by semiconductor sections without a grating. This situation was intensively studied theoretically, originally by Tager and Petermann who predicted very fast SPs. Recently, our cooperation partners at WIAS have created comprehensive bifurcation diagrams, which help the experimentalist to prepare and control the desired laser dynamics. In addition, their simulation tool LDSL is used to understand the impact of effects such as spontaneous emission noise, longitudinal spatial hole burning and nonlinear gain saturation, all of which are present in fabricated devices. For the PFL device, which is the simplest design of monolithically integrated feedback device, both Tager-Petermann and DQS self-pulsations, as well as excitability at a homoclinic bifurcation are demonstrated. However, the feedback strength in experimental devices is low due to optical losses which arise in the integrated feedback cavity. Furthermore, there is no means to vary the feedback strength, which results in restricted control of the frequency {{and the quality of the}} SP...|$|R

Taste intensities of pulsatile MSG and NaCl stimuli at pulsation periods below, at and above individual taste fusion periods (TFP in seconds) {{were compared to}} taste intensities of a continuous reference of the same net tastant concentration and quality. In line with results previously reported for sucrose, pulsation-induced taste enhancement peaked around TFP for both MSG and NaCl and did not require perception of tastant pulsation. TFP and pulsation effects were independent of the taste transduction mechanism (G-protein-coupled receptor for MSG versus ion-channel for NaCl). The absence of a relation between TFP and taste sensitivity suggests that temporal gustatory resolution and taste sensitivity are not necessarily influenced by the same factors. The results support earlier findings that early stages of taste transduction are involved in pulsation-induced taste enhancement.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{desalination}} to provide drinking water of acceptable standards has been established. A review of desalination techniques suggests that solar powered reverse osmosis with energy recovery {{is likely to}} satisfy the widest range of applications in inland Australia and elsewhere. Of the energy recovery techniques, the 'flow-regulated' approach appears well suited to remote applications, because it maintains its set recovery ratio regardless of insolation levels, and starts and stops automatically at sunrise and sunset. Operating and capital costs of units needs to be minimised and operational flexibility maximised for wide application in remote areas. This project aimed to develop, produce and test a low cost solar powered desalinator that was portable, reliable and flexible. The thesis describes the theoretical and practical development of a production model through the four prototypes. The prototypes were tested to determine {{the performance of a}} variety of membranes, the efficiency of the pumps and energy recovery system, and the water slippage of valves and seals. The available energy from the two-panel tracking array was also assessed. A model which describes the hydraulics of 'flow-regulated' energy recovery systems was developed and incorporated in a spreadsheet program and used to assess the performance of the prototypes. The relevance of all the variable components affecting fresh water production can be assessed through graphically presented results from the spreadsheet.

Quarter milk flow profiles were analysed and translated into variables such as milk yield and milking duration for the whole milking or for the increase, steady state, declining and overmilking phases. These variables were {{used to test the}} effect of technical milking machine settings (pulsation or milking vacuum, <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> or ratio and detachment level) on quarter milking performance. Also the effects of the factors of quarter position and milking time were examined. An experiment with three milking vacuum levels, carried out in a milking parlour with these quarter milking facilities is described. Significant effects of vacuum level, quarter position and time of milking on milk yield and milking duration in the defined milk removal phases were shown. Moreover, the effects differed significantly among cows and quarters. The study reveals marked differences in milk flow profiles per quarter. For optimal milking the milking process control should anticipate these differences and use the information for more efficient milking and safeguarding teat and udder health...|$|E
40|$|White dwarfs {{are well}} studied objects. The {{relative}} simplic- ity of their physics allows to obtain very detailed models {{which can be}} ultimately compared with their observed properties. Among them there is a specific class of stars, the ZZ–Ceti stars that are character- ized by the extreme stability of their periods of <b>pulsation.</b> The <b>rate</b> of change of the period {{is closely related to}} the characteristic cooling time of the star, which can be accurately computed. This property not only allows to directly test the evolution of white dwarfs but also to constrain parameters of any new physical theory able to perturb the cooling regime. This technique has been successfuly aplied to the case of axions and can be used to constrain the properties of other theoreti- cal particles. The program we propose here consists in using the ability of the Antartic plateau to perform long time and non–interrupted ob- servations to establish the seismological properties of a well defined set of variable white dwarfs (and other stable pulsators).

40|$|The x-ray pulsar GX 1 + 4 was {{observed}} by us in four balloon- borne experiments carried out from Hyderabad, India during 1991 - 1995 period {{with a hard}} x-ray telescope. The x-ray telescope consists of two collimated large area xenon-filled proportional counters with an effective area of 2400 cm 2, a field of view of 5 ffi Θ 5 ffi and sensitive in the energy band of 20 - 100 keV. The pulsar was detected in bright state {{in two of the}} four experiments and x-ray pulsations with 120 second period were detected clearly. <b>Pulsation</b> period, <b>rate</b> of change of period with time, pulse fraction, pulse profile and energy spectra of the source were determined from these studies. During March 1995 observation, the x-ray pulse of GX 1 + 4 was found to be double-peaked compared to a single-peak pulse profile detected in December 1993. Details of these results are presented and their interpretation discussed in terms of the current accretion models of x-ray binaries. I. INTRODUCTION The 121 sec x [...] ...|$|R
