25|$|The Disney Pixar film Cars {{and several}} {{spin-off}} video games featured a Fabulous Hudson Hornet named Doc Hudson, a retired <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> champion. The <b>Piston</b> <b>cup</b> is the franchise's {{version of the}} Winston Cup Series, which changed to Sprint Cup Series in 2004 (today Monster Energy Cup Series).|$|E
500|$|A {{parody of}} the track {{was used in the}} 2006 Pixar film Cars. It is the venue for the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> tiebreaker race between the movie's main {{character}} Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), retiring veteran Strip [...] "The King" [...] Weathers (voiced by Richard Petty) and perennial runner-up Chick Hicks (voiced by Michael Keaton). The race is held at the Los Angeles International Speedway, which is a conglomeration of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena where the Rose Bowl is located, as well as the Auto Club Speedway.|$|E
500|$|In a world {{populated}} by anthropomorphic vehicles, the last {{race of the}} <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> championship ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran Strip [...] "The King" [...] Weathers, infamous runner-up Chick Hicks, and rookie Lightning McQueen. The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway in California. McQueen is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow {{him to leave the}} unglamorous sponsorship of Rusteze, a bumper ointment company, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, but ends up lost in the run-down desert town of Radiator Springs, while inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road.|$|E
50|$|At the end, Lightning, Mater, and Sally {{decide to}} take a celebratory trip across the country. When asked if he brought his trophy, Lightning notes he did not, but left it in a good place, {{revealed}} to be at Doc Hudson's clinic next to the racing legend's own three <b>Piston</b> <b>Cups.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the cast}} from the {{original}} Cars remained intact for the sequel, but three voice actors of the original film have died since its release. Joe Ranft (who voiced Red) died {{in an automobile accident}} on August 16, 2005, ten months before Cars was released. The first film was dedicated in memoriam to him. Red appears in this film, but he does not speak or vocalize. George Carlin (who voiced Fillmore) died of heart failure on June 22, 2008; Fillmore also shows up in Cars 2, and he was voiced by Lloyd Sherr (who also voices Tony Trihull). Paul Newman (who voiced Doc Hudson) died of cancer on September 26, 2008. After Newman's death, Lasseter said they would [...] "see how the story goes with Doc Hudson." [...] Doc was eventually written out, with a few references to the character, where he is thought to have died before the events of the movie, as Mater says that he would have been proud for McQueen's <b>Piston</b> <b>Cups,</b> which have been renamed after Doc; also, in the Tokyo race, one of the announcers says that Doc {{was one of the best}} dirt racers ever.|$|R
40|$|The piston {{is one of}} {{the parts}} that most easily become worn out and {{experience}} failure in mud pumps for well drilling. By imitating the body surface morphology of the dung beetle, this paper proposed a new type (BW- 160) of mud pump piston that had a dimpled shape in the regular layout on the <b>piston</b> leather <b>cup</b> surface and carried out a performance test on the self-built test rig. Firstly, the influence of different dimple diameters on the service life of the piston was analyzed. Secondly, the analysis of the influence of the dimple central included angle on the service life of the piston under the same dimple area density was obtained. Thirdly, the wear of the new type of piston under the same wear time was analyzed. The experimental results indicated that the service life of the piston with dimples on the surface was longer than that of L-Standard pistons, and the maximum increase in the value of service life was 92. 06 %. Finally, the Workbench module of the software ANSYS was used to discuss the wear-resisting mechanism of the new type of piston...|$|R
500|$|After {{being arrested}} and impounded {{overnight}} (while guarded by a rusty, but friendly, tow truck named Mater), McQueen is {{ordered by the}} town judge, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately. The local lawyer, Sally Carrera, requests that McQueen should instead be given community service to repave the road, to which Doc reluctantly agrees. McQueen tries to repave the road in a single day, but turns out shoddy, and he is forced to repave the road again, which takes several days to complete. During this time, he befriends several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs {{used to be a}} popular stopover along the old U.S. Route 66, but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing it, the town literally vanished from the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is the [...] "Fabulous Hudson Hornet", a three-time <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> winner, whose racing career ended after an accident in 1954, and quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes repaving the road, which has invigorated the cars to improve their town, and spends an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town, led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race, while Sally chastises Doc after discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered by them instead.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{films are}} set in NASCAR; recent ones include: Days of Thunder (1990), [...] (2005), [...] (2006), and Logan Lucky (2017). A fictionalized version of NASCAR (the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup)</b> was also {{at the center of}} the Pixar film Cars (2006) and its {{subsequent}} sequels.|$|E
50|$|In Cars: The Video Game, {{written by}} Pixar and {{considered}} a continuation {{to the story}} started in the movie, Lightning McQueen finds himself {{at the start of}} the next <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> season. With the help of the citizens of Radiator Springs, McQueen readies to start his quest for the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup,</b> taking lessons in powersliding from Doc, boosting from Fillmore, and racing backwards from Mater. With his new skills, Lightning once again makes a championship run in the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup,</b> much to the irritation of Chick Hicks.|$|E
40|$|The paper reveals one of {{possible}} methods for higher productivity {{and reliability of}} building self-propelled pneumopunchers which are intended for making holes in soil while using trenchless method and constructing various engineering communications under car, tram and rail lines, airport runways. A new design of building pneumopuncher with increased productivity due to higher speed for hole formation in soil and its reliability has been presented in the paper. A formula for determination of displacement increment for a new pneumopuncher {{in comparison with the}} conventional one has been obtained in the paper. The paper describes a design and operation principal of the building self-propelled pneumopuncher which is equipped with a locking mechanism with the purpose to neutralize action of soil elastic forces and reactive repulsive force. The locking mechanism keeps the pneumopuncher in the hole. The pneumopuncher consists of a body with anvil, movable hammer, a manifold which is set in axial deepening of the hammer, a nut and a locking mechanism. Improvement of operational pneumopuncher reliability is attained {{due to the fact that}} the locking mechanism is made in the form of two coaxially positioned inner and outer cups having a common basis. A piston is installed in the middle of the inner cup, a spring is fixed over the piston and a rod with a breaking shoe is positioned at the end. Height of the inner cup is less the outer cup height and there is an annular cavity between them which is connected with a chamber. The chamber is formed by the <b>piston,</b> the inner <b>cup</b> and the manifold. The annular cavity through an opening in the inner cup wall, two sylphons, a channel in the nut end and an opening in the vertical wall of the manifold are connected with a chamber of operating stroke. The sylphons are placed between the outer cup and the nut, between the nut and the manifold. Differential equations for movement of pneumopuncher in soil have been compiled. While solving the equations a formula for determination of increase in displacement of the pneumopuncher with the locking mechanism and without it has been obtained in the paper. </p...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} film, Lightning {{is one of}} the three contestants in a <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> tiebreaker race before an audience of [...] "more than two hundred thousand cars" [...] in Los Angeles, California. By the start of Cars 2, he has won four <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> championships.|$|E

5000|$|Lightning McQueen is a racer {{participating}} in the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup.</b> Lightning is sponsored by Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, which uses the catchphrase, [...] "With Just a Little Rust-eze, you can look like Lightning McQueen!" [...] However, he secretly disdains Rust-eze and hopes to be chosen for sponsorship by the much more glamorous and successful Dinoco oil company. He is certain Dinoco will offer to sponsor him if he wins the prized <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fearing {{his title}} is in jeopardy, Chick enlists the {{assistance}} of The Delinquent Road Hazards - DJ, Boost, Wingo, and Snot Rod — the same rowdy cars who detoured McQueen to Radiator Springs, to hijack McQueen's racing gear from Mack on Interstate 40. Lightning is able to retrieve his equipment and bring the delinquents to justice before winning the next race, which sends Chick into a frenzy. Lightning challenges Chick to a Grand Prix in Radiator Springs, followed by one more <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> race in L.A.. Lightning wins these events, taking the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> in his sophomore season.|$|E
50|$|By {{the start}} of Cars 2, Doc has died of Engine Cancer (The same thing as Heart Cancer, and is very rare). The <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> has been renamed in his honor, and his clinic has been {{converted}} into a museum that displays trophies and mementos from his career.|$|E

5000|$|Cars (2006) parodies NASCAR, an advertising-heavy sport which {{controversially}} {{had long}} allowed {{alcohol and tobacco}} sponsorships. NASCAR's sponsors were replaced with fictional or parody brands; Dinoco Oil takes pride of place, followed by a string of invented automotive aftermarket products positioned as pharmacy or medical brands. [...] "Dale Earnhardt Inc." [...] displaced [...] "Junior #8"'s sponsor Budweiser to avoid advertising beer in a Disney feature. NASCAR's former [...] "Winston Cup" [...] trophy became the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup,</b> removing a tobacco advertisement.|$|E
5000|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} town of Radiator Springs, where it takes place after the movie, the player must compete in 50 races to help Lightning McQueen win the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup.</b> The game takes place in an open world {{environment}} in the vein of Need for Speed and Midnight Club and features ten playable characters from the film, all voiced by the original voice talent. [...] The game also features a number of minigames and items for the player to collect.|$|E
50|$|Doc Hudson {{does not}} appear in Cars 2 as his voice actor Paul Newman died from lung cancer in September 2008. Pixar decided having Doc appear in Cars 2 would be not a good idea. A {{conversation}} between McQueen and Mater indicates that Doc died before the second film. Doc's memory lives on, as the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> was renamed after him. During the Japan leg of the World Grand Prix, one of the commentators notes that Doc {{was one of the best}} dirt-track racers of all time.|$|E

5000|$|Finn McMissile, a British spy, infiltrates the world's largest {{untapped}} {{oil reserves}} {{owned by a}} group of lemon cars. After being discovered, he flees and fakes his death. Lightning McQueen, now a 4-time <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> champion, returns home to Radiator Springs to enjoy some quiet time. However, Italian formula race car, Francesco Bernoulli, challenges McQueen to the newly created World Grand Prix, led by its creator Sir Miles Axlerod. McQueen and his best friend Mater — along with Luigi, Guido, Fillmore, and Sarge — depart for Tokyo for the first race of the Grand Prix.|$|E
5000|$|Mater runs [...] "Tow Mater Towing and Salvage" [...] and is {{the first}} to befriend and support Lightning {{throughout}} his adventure in Radiator Springs. During the film, Mater shows Lightning how to do [...] "Tractor-Tippin'" [...] and how to drive backwards without crashing, a technique which Lightning uses to counter Chick Hicks' dirty racing in the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> tiebreaker. In the end, McQueen asks Tex to give Mater an opportunity to fly in a Dinoco helicopter like he always wanted, saying to Sally that Mater is his best friend.|$|E
5000|$|The {{track on}} which the opening race (Motor Speedway of the South) takes place {{is based on an}} {{enlarged}} version of Bristol Motor Speedway. The venue for the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> tiebreaker race (the Los Angeles International Speedway) is a conglomeration of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena where the Rose Bowl is located, as well as the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana. The sign [...] "City of Emeryville - Closed for the race" [...] is a nod to Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville, California in the San Francisco Bay Area.|$|E
50|$|Cars is {{the seventh}} Pixar film. The {{story is about}} rookie racecar, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), who gets lost {{on the way to}} California for a tiebreaker race in the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup,</b> a famous race worldwide, and ends up in a little town called Radiator Springs on Route 66, that had since been {{forgotten}} because the Interstate was built. He accidentally wrecks the road and is sentenced to fix it. During his time, he goes tractor tipping with his new best friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and goes on a drive with his love interest Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt).|$|E
50|$|Lightning's {{paint scheme}} is {{nearly the same}} as it was in the first movie (his large {{lightning}} bolt is repainted dark red, and a smaller bolt is threaded through his number, and has only three sponsor stickers on either side), though it is modified for the World Grand Prix with green-tinted flames on the end of his large bolt and a <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> logo on the hood instead of his usual Rust-Eze sponsor. His reflective lightning decals are removed, he has a different spoiler, and his sticker headlights and taillights are replaced with actual working lights.|$|E
50|$|One wheel {{cylinder}} operates the brake on each wheel. Two pistons operate the shoes, one {{at each end}} of the {{wheel cylinder}}. The leading shoe (closest to the front of the vehicle) is known as the primary shoe. The trailing shoe is known as the secondary shoe. Hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder acts on the <b>piston</b> <b>cup,</b> pushing the pistons toward the shoes, forcing them against the drum. When the driver releases the brakes, the brake shoe springs restore the shoes to their original (disengaged) position. The parts of the wheel cylinder are shown to the right.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Hudson Hornet {{was introduced}} in 1951 and manufactured until 1954. Fabulous Hudson Hornets won NASCAR cups for three consecutive years (Herb Thomas in 1951 and 1953, and Tim Flock in 1952), paralleling Doc Hudson's three <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> wins in those same years. The Hudson Motor Company was merged into Nash Motors on January 14, 1954 to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). After brief use as a marque on Nash-designed AMC vehicles, the Hudson name disappeared entirely by 1957. The automaker continued until its March 9, 1987 takeover by Chrysler, but never won another NASCAR championship cup.|$|E
50|$|Six {{years after}} the second film in 2011- in 2017, the story starts out with Lightning McQueen, now a seven-time <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> winner and racing legend, racing in the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> while pitted against his old racing friends, Cal Weathers and Bobby Swift all who pull pranks on each other after each race. On the final lap of one race, Jackson Storm, a {{high-tech}} racer, appears out of nowhere on the track, roaring past McQueen to win. Storm continues to win race after race throughout the season and many veteran racers are prompted to retire or are fired by their sponsors {{to make room for}} the next generation - including Cal and Bobby. Then on the final race of the season in Los Angeles, Lightning pushes himself too hard while trying to catch up to Storm and gets himself into a serious crash with Sally, Mater, Sarge, Fillmore, Luigi and Guido all watching in horror. The film's premise revolves around Lightning recovering from the crash that happened earlier and being trained by Cruz Ramirez, a technician and lifelong fan of Lightning, during the off season in hopes of returning to his racing career. His main motivation to return to racing is to be able to enter the Florida 500 race and defeat Storm, after being given an ultimatum by new sponsor Sterling to permanently retire to a life as a paid spokesperson if he loses his next race. Sterling was the main antagonist, but he hid his nature and pretended to be a fan.|$|E
50|$|Five {{years after}} {{the events of the}} first film in 2006- in 2011, Lightning McQueen, now a four-time <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> champion, returns to Radiator Springs after a {{successful}} racing season. He is pleased to renew his friendship with Mater. McQueen's respite is interrupted when he is recruited to participate in the first ever World Grand Prix, sponsored by former oil tycoon Miles Axelrod to promote his new biofuel, Allinol. McQueen initially declines but is publicly taunted by Formula One race car Francesco Bernoulli. Mater intervenes to defend McQueen, leading him to reconsider and join the race. Mater hopes to tag along on the tour and, despite concerns about Mater's meddling behavior, McQueen reluctantly agrees.|$|E
50|$|After McQueen fixes the road, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) {{no longer}} wants him in town, so {{he calls the}} news crew to take McQueen to Los Angeles, but it doesn't take long for Doc to realize how much he's helped Radiator Springs, so {{he goes back to}} being the Hudson Hornet and becomes McQueen's crew chief, while most of the Radiator Springs folks become his pit crew. McQueen is about to win the race, but helps The King (Richard Petty) cross the finish line after Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) crashes him and wins the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> after being in third on the last lap, but is later booed by {{everyone}} as comeuppance.|$|E
50|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts at}} training, including damaging Sterling's simulator {{and participating in}} a demolition derby, Lightning decides to seek out Doc's old pit boss Smokey, ultimately tracking him down at the Thomasville Motor Speedway in Doc's old hometown in {{what appears to be}} the Great Smoky Mountains. Trained on smarts as well as speed, Lightning runs part of the Florida 500, with Smokey as his crew chief, before pulling out and giving Cruz a shot at stardom, with him as a crew chief. Cruz and Lightning share the victory due to Lightning starting the race, and ultimately a sponsorship under the merged Dinoco-Rusteze brand. Lightning ends the film with a race at Radiator Springs, now a mentor of young talent while running the occasional <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> race.|$|E
50|$|During {{the final}} lap, the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> is clearly within McQueen's grasp. Hicks, realizing {{he is about}} to finish in last place, forces Weathers to crash. On the track's Jumbotron, McQueen {{witnesses}} the crash behind him, which is reminiscent of the crash that ended Doc's career 52 years before. In order to help Weathers, McQueen stops before reaching the finish line, essentially forfeiting the win. McQueen is praised for his selfless sportsmanship, so much so that Dinoco Race Team owner Tex offers to hire him to succeed Weathers. McQueen declines, realizing that he should stay with his Rust-eze sponsors in appreciation for managing to get him where he was. Tex respects his decision and instead offers to do him a favor. McQueen uses the favor to gain a ride on the Dinoco helicopter for Mater, fulfilling Mater's dream.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{less than}} happy when an amazed McQueen discovers his past and asks, [...] "Why did you quit {{at the top of}} your game?" [...] After McQueen {{finishes}} fixing the Radiator Springs road that he damaged when arriving in town, as part of Hudson's court ruling, McQueen decides to stay in town for a while, but Doc was unable to bear having him around any longer and calls the news and press, prompting McQueen to immediately leave for the <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> championship race in California. But seeing how disheartened everyone was by the unplanned departure, Doc realizes Lightning had become more important to them than he thought. He eventually admits the truth to everyone about his racecar days and takes back his #51 racing colors to become McQueen's pit crew chief. Nearly the entire town travels to California as McQueen's pit crew and cheering section. At the race, Doc finally receives a long-overdue acknowledgment for his return.|$|E
5000|$|Doc's {{stickers}} say [...] "twin H power", {{which was}} an optional dealer-installed dual carburetor intake manifold, with twin 1-barrel carburetors and air filters. It was standard on 1952 model Hornets. Doc was once known as the Fabulous Hudson Hornet (#51), {{one of the most}} famous race cars to have ever lived; he won three consecutive Piston Cups (1951/52/53), and he still held the record for most wins in a single season (27, also the number of NASCAR Grand National races won by Hudson Hornets in 1952). All that changed for the famous Hornet when a terrible crash on the track during the final lap of the 1954 <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> championship race saw him put out for the season in a career-ending injury which closely parallels the fate of Herb Thomas, NASCAR's 1951 and 1953 champion. Upon his return, he was received with a complete absence of fanfare and told that he was a has-been who had been passed up for the next rookie in line. He kept a newspaper article on the career-ending crash as a reminder never to return to the life that nearly killed him.|$|E
5000|$|In a world {{populated}} by anthropomorphic vehicles, the last {{race of the}} <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> championship ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran Strip [...] "The King" [...] Weathers, infamous runner-up Chick Hicks, and rookie Lightning McQueen.

50|$|Lightning McQueen, now a seven-time <b>Piston</b> <b>Cup</b> racing legend, {{suddenly}} {{finds himself}} overshadowed by Jackson Storm, an arrogant rookie who {{belongs to a}} new generation of racers that use the latest technology to improve their performance. This results in Lightning's fellow veterans either being retired or fired by their sponsors and replaced by the new rookies. In the final race of the season, as he tries to catch up to Storm and the other leaders, Lightning loses control and suffers a violent, nearly fatal rollover crash, leaving him badly injured. 4 months later, while recovering in Radiator Springs, Lightning isolates himself from his friends and spends his time watching footage of his late mentor, Doc Hudson. Confronted by his girlfriend, Sally Carrera, Lightning fears being forced into retirement as Doc was. Rusty and Dusty, the owners of Lightning's Rust-eze racing team, send him to a new state-of-the-art racing center, much to his surprise. When he arrives, he learns that they have sold Rust-eze to new owner Sterling, who assigns him to work with trainer Cruz Ramirez. Lightning eventually becomes impatient and annoyed with Cruz's methods and attempts to use a high-tech racing simulator, only to cause severe damage to the equipment.|$|E
