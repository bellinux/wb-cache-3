5|$|After his {{quarrel with}} the Royalist court in exile, Rupert {{travelled}} to Heidelberg {{to visit his}} brother Charles Louis, now partially restored as Elector Palatine, where the two had an ambivalent reunion. Charles Louis and Rupert had not been friendly as children and had almost ended up on opposite sides during the Civil War. To make matters worse, Charles Louis had been deprived of half the old Palatinate under the <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Westphalia, leaving him badly short of money, although he still remained responsible under the Imperial laws of apanage for providing for his younger brother and had offered the sum of £375 per annum, which Rupert had accepted. Rupert travelled on to Vienna, where he attempted to claim the £15,000 compensation allocated to him under the <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Westphalia from the Emperor. Emperor Ferdinand III warmly welcomed him, {{but was unable to}} pay such a sum immediately—instead, he would have to pay in installments, to the disadvantage of Rupert.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the forces}} of the Swedish Empire {{dominated}} Northern Germany, and along with her ally France, Sweden became guarantee power of the <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Westphalia in 1648.

With the Treaty of Bromberg (1657), concluded during the Second Northern War, the electors were freed of Polish vassalage for the Duchy of Prussia and gained Lauenburg–Bütow and Draheim.

5|$|Great Britain {{had broken}} the <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} became the first step towards {{the creation of the}} Third Coalition. By April 1805, Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia. Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, {{challenging}} the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation. In 1555, the <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that {{the faith of}} the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583. From the Cologne War {{until the end of the}} Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands. The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent. The <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states. German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Grunwald, First Battle of Tannenberg or Battle of Žalgiris, {{was fought}} on 15 July 1410 during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. The {{alliance}} of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila) and Grand Duke Vytautas, decisively defeated the German–Prussian Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Knights' leadership {{were killed or}} taken prisoner. Although defeated, the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege of their fortress in Marienburg (Malbork) and suffered minimal territorial losses at the <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Thorn (1411) (Toruń), with other territorial disputes continuing until the <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Melno in 1422. The knights, however, would never recover their former power, and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands under their control. The battle shifted {{the balance of power}} in Central and Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish–Lithuanian union as the dominant political and military force in the region.|$|E
