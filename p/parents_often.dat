5|$|Carte {{was brought}} up in Dartmouth Park Road. His cultured mother exposed her family to art, music and poetry, and young Carte studied the violin and then the flute at an early age. The family spoke French at home two days a week, and his <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> took their {{children}} to the theatre. He was educated at University College School, which he left in 1860. In 1861, he achieved First Class level in the matriculation examination and then attended University College, London. However, he left later that year to work in his father's business, along with his brother, Henry. He studied music during this time and composed some pieces, which he dedicated to the actress Kate Terry. He also acted in amateur theatricals.|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{attended}} {{public schools}} through eighth grade {{and received a}} basic education. He had not determined a career path {{for himself and his}} <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> criticized him for lacking ambition; they insisted that he seek employment. He began by working as a custodian at a local church and later for the railroad, hauling ballast to construction sites. At the church, he joined the choir where he met and began to court Bertha Lanterman. When Portland's first public high school was opened in 1876, Haynes returned to school at age 19 and completed two more years. Bertha and her family moved to Alabama during the spring of 1877, and Haynes began a regular correspondence with her. During the summer of that year, a series of revival meetings were held in Indiana by Francis Murphy, a leader of a national temperance organization known as the Murphy Movement. Haynes attended the meetings, probably at his parents' urging, and became interested in temperance. He took two of Murphy's pledge cards and carried one for most of his life; the other he mailed to Bertha.|$|E

50|$|Narcissistic <b>parenting</b> <b>often</b> {{leads to}} {{children}} being either victimized or bullying themselves, hypersexual in nature (media driven), having a poor or overly inflated body image, tendency to use and/or abuse drugs or alcohol, body modification such as piercings or tattoos, or acting out (in a potentially harmful manner) for attention.|$|R
25|$|An {{inability}} to locate abducted children taken to Mexico remains {{the single largest}} frustration that left-behind <b>parents</b> face. <b>Often</b> family members in Mexico help hide the taking parent and child and deny knowledge of their location when questioned by authorities. Taking <b>parents</b> also <b>often</b> disappear again when ordered to appear before a judge for a Convention hearing.|$|R
25|$|Most {{forms of}} {{psychotherapy}} use spoken conversation. Some also use various {{other forms of}} communication such as the written word, artwork, drama, narrative story or music. Psychotherapy with children and their <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> involves play, dramatization (i.e. role-play), and drawing, with a co-constructed narrative from these non-verbal and displaced modes of interacting.|$|E
25|$|Korean kindergartens {{are private}} schools, and monthly costs vary. Korean <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> send their {{children}} to English kindergartens to give them a head start in English. Such specialized kindergartens can be mostly taught in Korean with some English lessons, mostly taught in English with some Korean lessons, or completely taught in English. Almost all middle-class parents {{send their children}} to kindergarten.|$|E
25|$|For the {{traditional}} observance of the day, school children form processions through the hallways {{of the school}} building carrying candles, and hand out lussekatt buns. While rarely observed at home, <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> take time off work to watch these school processions in the morning, and if their child should be chosen Lucia it is considered a great honor. Later on in the day, the procession usually visits local retirement homes, hospitals, and nursing homes.|$|E
50|$|Children at the {{threshold}} of adolescence in the nine-to-twelve-year-old group would seem to have particular vulnerabilities to parental separation. Among such problems were the very 'eagerness of these youngsters to be co-opted into the parental battling; their willingness to take sides...and the intense, compassionate, caretaking relations which led these youngsters to attempt to rescue a distressed <b>parent</b> <b>often</b> to their own detriment.|$|R

25|$|However, {{there is}} a lack of good quality {{research}} on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. Many <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce.|$|E
25|$|Fidgeting is the act {{of moving}} about restlessly. Fidgeting may {{be a result of}} nervousness, agitation, boredom or a {{combination}} of these. It may be a result of genes and is often an unconscious act. Fidgeting may involve playing with one's fingers, hair, or items of clothing. A common act of fidgeting is to bounce one's leg repeatedly. Rings are another common focus of fidgeting; variations include ring spinning, twirling or rolling along a table. <b>Parents</b> <b>often</b> consider fidgeting to be a bad habit, especially in schoolchildren.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{the parents}} would often name their child after an older relative, so that his/her name would {{live on in}} the family. Today, however, these are not binding {{conditions}} and are often ignored: <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> pick a name without conforming with these traditions, however it is really up to the parents as still many of them continue to observe these traditions. Traditions to name a child after the parents' best man or maid of honor or the saint on whose name day the child is born also exist.|$|E

The animal parent normally dies with the child eating its way out of the host at full gestation. They worship Malia, the Mother of Disease, and Thed, the goddess of rape and mother of Chaos.|$|R

25|$|Dr. Joanne Smith Finley interviewed Uyghur {{youth and}} found that Uyghur <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> {{pressure}} their children, daughters and sons, not to intermarry, the reactions from their children are mixed, with some Uyghurs like Mälikä and Aygül saying {{they would have to}} obey their parents and split up from their Han partner, while other Uyghurs said they would abscond and run away with their Han partner like a 20 year old Uyghur woman named Gülshäm who said she would run off with a Han if the relationship was not allowed by her father.|$|E
25|$|Early use of augmentative and {{alternative}} communication systems may assist {{the child in}} developing spoken language skills. Overall language delay is associated with problems of intellectual disability, deafness, and learned helplessness. Children with cerebral palsy {{are at risk of}} learned helplessness and becoming passive communicators, initiating little communication. Early intervention with this clientele, and their <b>parents,</b> <b>often</b> targets situations in which children communicate with others so that they learn that they can control people and objects in their environment through this communication, including making choices, decisions, and mistakes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} {{generation}} of settlers, Koryo-saram tended to abandon traditional Korean naming practices and follow Russian naming patterns, using a Russian given name, Russian-style patronymic (derived from the father's name, regardless of whether his name was Russian or Korean), and Korean surname. Succeeding generations tended to have both a Russian given name and a Russian patronymic. This differs from the pattern typical in the US, where Korean American <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> register their children with a Korean given name as their legal middle name (e.g. Daniel Dae Kim, Harold Hongju Koh).|$|E

25|$|This {{language}} is less spoken by the younger generations in the city, who use Italian instead as that {{language is}} compulsory {{in education and}} the mass media. Italian has increasingly become predominant in social relations, both formal and informal, relegating Sardinian to a mostly marginal role in everyday life. Young people often have only passive competence in the language, gathered from elderly relatives who still speak it, as their <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> speak only Italian, or they may use a juvenile slang (italianu porceddinu) that mixes both Sardinian and Italian.|$|E
25|$|Some {{high schools}} {{have one or}} more {{teachers}} experienced in offering counseling to college-bound eleventh and twelfth graders. They usually work {{in conjunction with the}} guidance department who assist students in planning their high school academic path. Counselors handle many students and schools and generally do not have a role of overseeing or managing a student's college applications. Advisors recommend that students get to know their school counselor. Counselors do not complete interviews, write essays, or arrange college visits. <b>Parents</b> <b>often</b> meet with the school counselor during the eleventh grade. Most counselors have responsibility for helping many students and, as a result, it is difficult for them to provide individual help to a particular student; one estimate was that the average ratio for all high schools of counselors to students was 460 to 1. Only about a quarter of public high schools have a counselor devoted to college counseling issues full-time, while almost three quarters of private schools have a dedicated college counselor. A report suggested that private school counselors have substantially more contact with university admissions staff than public school counselors.|$|E

[...] "I suppose my politics remained essentially in the middle-of-the-road Labour left {{until the end of the}} 1970s". Starkey blames the Callaghan administration for [...] "blow the nation's finances".

500|$|The book {{begins as}} an autobiography. Couillard {{was born in}} the late-1960s in the Montreal {{district}} of Ville-Émard; then she moved to the suburb of Lorraine when she was 4. Her <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> fought as her mother believed that her husband was unfaithful; the family incurred financial problems when Couillard's father changed careers. At age 12, Couillard was diagnosed with epilepsy. At age 17, she bought several properties with a boyfriend. They lived together briefly before breaking up and selling the properties. Couillard then became a friend, then lover, of Gilles Giguère, a money lender who was associated with the controversial motorcycle club Hells Angels. In 1996, after the police raided Giguère's apartment and (according to Couillard) threatened him, Giguère became sullen and withdrawn: the police had charged him with conspiracy to commit murder. But twomonths later, they let the charge drop. [...] Giguère was soon murdered.|$|E
500|$|Edgardo {{returned}} to the Catechumens on 22 October, and was visited by his <b>parents</b> <b>often</b> over the next month. As with Momolo's first round of visits, two different versions emerged of what happened. According to Edgardo's parents, the boy was obviously intimidated by the clergymen around him and threw himself into his mother's arms {{when he first saw}} her. Marianna later said: [...] "He had lost weight and had turned pale; his eyes were filled with terror... I told him that he was born a Jew like us and like us he must always remain one, and he replied: Si, mia cara mamma, I will never forget to say the Shema every day.'" [...] One report in the Jewish press described the priests telling Edgardo's parents that God had chosen their son to be [...] "the apostle of Christianity to his family, dedicated to converting his parents and his siblings", and that they could have him back if they also became Christians. The clerics and nuns then knelt and prayed for the conversion of the Mortara household, prompting Edgardo's parents to leave in terror.|$|E
