5|$|About 16hours {{before the}} storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the {{government}} of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined {{with the threat of}} Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|As {{fish stocks}} dwindle {{in the upper}} ocean, deep-sea {{fisheries}} are increasingly being targeted for exploitation.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 112 fictional films {{are known to}} have been {{produced}} in the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) between 1926 and the colony's dissolution in 1949. The earliest motion pictures, imported from abroad, were shown in late 1900, and by the early 1920s imported serials and fictional films were being shown, often with localised names. Dutch companies were also producing documentary films about the Indies to be shown in the Netherlands. The first reports of fictional film <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indies date from 1923, although the work in question was not completed. The first locally produced film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng, was directed by L. Heuveldorp and released on 31 December 1926.|$|E
5|$|After facing {{criticism}} {{for a lack}} of <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first two weeks, Smith turned in a record-setting performance against the St. Louis Rams in Week 3. In the first quarter, he scored on each of his first three career receptions with 74-, 41-, and 18-yard touchdowns. The 74-yard score was the longest completion of quarterback Joe Flacco's career. He became the first NFL rookie, and only the twelfth player, to amass three touchdown receptions in a single quarter. Smith finished the game with five receptions for 152yards in the 37â€“7 victory. It remains a Ravens rookie record, as does Smith's 30.4 yards per catch that day.|$|E

5|$|After {{the storm}} was named, {{officials}} in Texas began making preparations for Don. The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston issued a level one alert for Don, and city officials began preparing for a possible evacuation. On July 27, oil companies throughout the western Gulf of Mexico began removing non-essential personnel from their rigs and platforms in preparation for Don. The next day, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko and Apache announced the evacuations {{of some of the}} oil facilities in the area, while Exxon-Mobil began preparing the Baytown Refinery for a possible storm strike. Several oil companies stopped oil production as a result of Don; by midday on July 28, 6.8% of oil production and 2.8% of natural gas <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf had been shut in ahead of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Although 85% {{of world}} crude {{production}} was still coming from Pennsylvania wells in the 1880s, drilling in Russia and Asia began {{to reach the}} world market. Robert Nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant and cheaper Russian oil fields, including the region's first pipeline and the world's first oil tanker. The Paris Rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing. Additional fields were discovered in Burma and Java. Even more critical, {{the invention of the}} light bulb gradually began to erode the dominance of kerosene for illumination. But Standard Oil adapted, developing a European presence, expanding into natural gas <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. then into gasoline for automobiles, which until then had been considered a waste product.|$|E
5|$|Although {{existing}} sources do not record {{when the}} Mk. XIV went into <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK, they do record that operational testing started in January 1942 and production examples started reaching squadrons in March. It was manufactured by small machine shops and instrument makers, {{such as the}} Aron Meter Company. Production was too slow to meet the demand; between July and October, fewer than a hundred a month were being delivered. As the design was finalized, automated production was undertaken and by mid-1943, 900 a month were available. This was enough to equip the heavy bombers as they arrived from the production lines and by late 1942 the Handley Page Halifax was being delivered with the sight head already installed.|$|E
