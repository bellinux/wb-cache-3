However, peri-implantitis is the most important complication in implant dentistry. Peri-implantits can be caused by inadequate implant-abutment connections (IAC). The aim of our study is to evaluate the influence of 9 ̆ 3 conical plus octagonal 9 ̆ 4 (i. e. I-Fix connection) on implant survival and success rate. All the implants included in this study were of a completely new type (I-Fix implants and abutments by FMD Falappa Medical Devices S. p. A. Rome, Italy). Sixty-six implants were inserted in males and females.

METHODS: Morse tapered I-A sets were selected and divided in two groups {{depending on the}} type of abutment: <b>passing</b> <b>screw</b> (PS) and solid (S), and then subdivided into four subgroups (n= 6) according to the suspension volume: PS 1 : 0. 1 µL; PS 3 : 0. 3 µL; PS 5 : 0. 5 µL; PS 7 : 0. 7 µL; S 1 : 0. 1 µL; S 3 : 0. > 3 µL; S 5 : 0. 5 µL and S 7 : 0. 7 µL. A control test was performed to verify the presence of external contamination during the inoculation and the implants were incubated for microbiological analysis. The microleakage was evaluated every 24 h for 7 days by the clarity of solution. After this period, the implants were disassembled for confirmation of bacterial viability. RESULTS: All the specimens with 0. 7 µL and one sample of S 5 presented turbidity in the control test indicating external contamination, and were excluded from the study. After 7 days of observation, none of the specimens presented positive results for microleakage and the bacterial viability was confirmed in all specimens. The 0. 1 µL and 0. 3 µL volumes did not present bacterial microleakage, meaning that these volumes may be inadequate for analysis.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate, by finite element analysis (FEA), the influence of finish line on stress distribution and resistance to the loads of a ZrO 2 crown and porcelain in implant-supported. Material and methods. The object of this analysis consisted of a fxture, an abutment, a <b>passing</b> <b>screw,</b> a layer of cement, a framework crown, a feldspatic porcelain veneering. The abutment’s marginal design was used in 3 different types of preparation: feather edge, slight chamfer and 50 °, each of them was of 1 mm depth over the entire circumference. The ZrO 2 Y-TZP coping was 0. 6 mm thick. Two material matching for the abutment and the framework was used for the simulations: ZrO 2 framework and ZrO 2 abutment, ZrO 2 framework and T abutment. A 600 N axial force distributed over the entire surface of the crown was applied. The numerical simulations with finite elements were used to verify the different distribution of equivalent von Mises stress for three different geometries of abutment and framework. Results. Slight chamfer on the matching ZrO 2 - ZrO 2 is the geometry with minimum equivalent stress of von Mises. Even for T abutment and ZrO 2 framework slight chamfer is the best configuration to minimize the localized stress. Geometry that has the highest average stress is one with abutment at 50 °, we see a downward trend for all three configurations using only zirconium for both components. Conclusions. Finite element analysis. performed for the manifacturing of implant-supported crown, gives exact geometric guide lines about the choice of chamfer preparation, while the analysis of other marginal geometries suggests a possible improved behavior of the mating between ZrO 2 abutment and ZrO 2 coping. for three different geometries of the abutment and the coping.

Fractures of the distal humerus are relatively uncommon injuries where operative intervention can be exceptionally challenging. The distal humeral trochlea provides a very narrow anatomical window through which to pass a fixed-angle locking screw, which must also avoid the olecranon, coronoid, and radial fossae. We describe 3 patients (ages 27, 49, and 73 years) with a bicolumnar fracture of the distal humerus where very short distal locking screws were used. Intra-articular screw placement was avoided but loss of fixation occurred in two patients and a third was treated with a prolonged period of immobilization. We postulate that fixed-angle screw trajectories may {{make it difficult for}} the surgeon to place screws of adequate length in this anatomically confined region, and may lead to insufficient distal fixation.

Then the flow visualizations in the local center region were carried out. Moreover, the dispersive, distributive and stretching mixing efficiencies of the tri-screw and twin-screw extruders were compared, respectively. The results show that when the particles move from one screw to another, there are great abrupt changes in the velocities and displacements, which induce the abrupt change in the stress magnitude. Most of particles, which are initially distributed in the inlet plane of the center region, fast flow out the outlet and don’t <b>pass</b> through any <b>screw.</b> This special phenomenon induces a series of new characteristics in the residence time distribution (RTD), flow number, segregation scale and time averaged efficiency.

The Biomet Matthews Nail is a new retrograde intramedullary nail designed as an alternative surgical option to treat these fractures. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the comparative endurance of both devices. Method The {{dynamic compression}} screw (DCS) and Biomet Matthews Nail (BMN) were implanted into composite femurs, which were subsequently cyclically loaded using a materials testing machine. Simulated fractures were applied to each femur prior to the application of load. Either a Y type fracture or a transverse osteotomy was prepared on each composite femur using a jig to enable consistent positioning of cuts. Results The Biomet Matthews Nail demonstrated a greater endurance limit load over the dynamic compression screw in both fracture configurations. Conclusion The distal locking <b>screws</b> <b>pass</b> through the Biomet Matthews Nail in a unique "cruciate" orientation.

50|$|A {{set screw}} {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used to secure an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a set screw has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind set screw (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The set <b>screw</b> <b>passes</b> through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object.

Of the 80 patients enrolled in this trial, 64 still were alive after 1 year. Among these patients, 30 had the nail classically locked with two screws transfixing the nail in two separate holes (Group A), and 34 had the nail locked with one <b>screw</b> <b>passing</b> through a slot (Group B).

Central Valley of California, {{has declined}} from 130, 000 salmon during the 1940 s {{to less than}} 500 salmon during the early 1990 s and in 2007. The Tuolumne River's naturally produced fail-run Chinook salmon population was judged {{to be at a}} high risk of extinction since 1990 because escapement has repeatedly declined to low levels, the population has declined rapidly, and the mean percentage of hatchery fish in the escapement has been high. A potential consequence of the population declining to 157 salmon from 1990 to 1992 and the resulting loss of genetic viability is that the population's productivity declined by about 50 % from 1996 to 2005. The decline in escapement is primarily due to inadequate minimum iv. stream flow releases from La Grange Dam in late winter and spring during the non-flood years. In most years, except spring 2005, the number of smolts migrating from the Tuolmnne River has been a good predictor of adult recruitment. The estimated number of smoltsized ouUnigrants <b>passing</b> rotary <b>screw</b> traps near the mouth of the Tuolumne River approximately doubled in response to 2 - to 3 -day, 3, 000 cfs pulse flows in late winter that inundated about 500 acres of floodplain habitat. Adult recruitment more than doubled when prolonged late winter pulse flows of at least 3, 000 cfs occurred and the water temperatures near the river's mouth were kept below 15 °C through at least early May. Another problem is that up to 58 % of Mew, ed River Hatchery Chinook salmon strayed to the Sacramento River Basin whenever flows in the San Joaquin River were less than 3, 500 cfs for 10 days in late October. Other analyses show that spawner abundance, spawning habitat degradation, and the harvest of adult salmon in the ocean have not caused the decline in escapement. mllm,ltlMmlw 0 b~l~m noe= l sdmJ 20091129 - 0230 FERC PDF (Unofficial) i 0 / 06 / 200...|$|R

They were used 40 morse taper implants with their respective abutments divided in 4 groups (n = 10) : G 1 solid abutment; G 2 - solid abutment with carbon deposition in attrition zone; G 3 evaluation only in the <b>screw</b> of the <b>passing</b> abutment; G 4 - evaluation only in the <b>screw</b> of the <b>passing</b> abutment with carbon deposition in the screw thread; G 5 - evaluation only in the passing abutment without the screw action; G 6 - evaluation only in the passing abutment with carbon deposition in attrition zone without the screw action. Each abutment received a sequence of 5 tightening and removal torque (20 Ncm in solid abutment and 10 Ncm in passant screw abutment). The results of ANOVA statistic test for two factors of variation (removal torque and carbon), showed that there is significant statistic difference between the groups: G 1 higher than G 2 (p < 0. 01); G 4 higher than G 3 (p < 0. 01); G 6 higher than G 5 (p < 0. 01). This study concluded that control group G 1 showed a higher value through the arithmetical media (23. 706 Ncm) in relation of the experimental group G 2 (22. 114 Ncm); the experimental group G 4 showed higher value through the arithmetical media (8. 218 Ncm) in relation of the control group G 3 (7. 354 Ncm) and the experimental group G 6 showed higher values through the arithmetical media (10. 268 Ncm) in relation of the control group G 5 (6. 906 Ncm), and also showed that there was not significant difference (p < 0. 01) to the removal torque factor in all the groups studied, that is, there was not a material deformation interference with the tightening and removal torque cycles repetition...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{hydropower}} {{is developing}} rapidly {{in many countries}} in response to policies of encouraging renewable energy and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This rapid increase {{in the construction of}} hydroelectric turbines provides a substantial risk to migrating biota, especially fish. Some turbines, such as the Archimedes screw design, are regarded as relatively friendly to fish but have not yet been assessed for their potential impacts on threatened lamprey species. To assess the risk of impingement and the patterns of movement by emigrating river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis transformers and drifting larval ammocoetes at the site of an Archimedes screw turbine in north-east England, drift nets were set over the periods of January to June 2009 and November 2009 to May 2010. Drifting Lampetra sp. larvae were recorded in all sampling months, November to June, while emigrating lampreys were recorded in all months but June (93 % captured between December and April), reflecting a higher period of impingement risk than expected. Night-time catches were 24 - and 8 -fold higher for transformers and larvae, respectively, than daytime catches. Catch per unit water volume data in different channel areas suggest that lamprey larvae behaved as passive particles within the river flow but that transformers selected areas of higher flow. Damage rates of lampreys <b>passed</b> through the <b>screw</b> were low (1. 5 %), suggesting minor impacts on downstream-moving larval and juvenile lampreys. However, the cumulative potential impacts of multiple hydropower sites on downstream fish passage, including lampreys, should be considered by regulatory agencies when planning hydropower development within catchments...|$|R
