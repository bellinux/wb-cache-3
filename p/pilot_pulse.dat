40|$|Skilled pilots {{often use}} pulse control when {{controlling}} higher order (i. e. acceleration-command) vehicle dynamics. Pulsing {{does not produce}} a stick response that resembles what the human Crossover Model predicts. The Crossover Model (CM) assumes the pilot provides compensation necessary (lead or lag) such that the suite of display-human-vehicle approximates an integrator {{in the region of}} crossover frequency. However, it is shown that the CM does appear to drive the pilots pulsing behavior in a very predictable manner. Roughly speaking, the pilot generates pulses such that the area under the pulse (pulse amplitude multiplied by pulse width) is approximately equal to area under the hypothetical CM output. This can allow a pilot to employ constant amplitude pulsing so that only the pulse duration (width) is modulated a drastic simplification over the demands of continuous tracking. A <b>pilot</b> <b>pulse</b> model is developed, with which the parameters of the pilots internally-generated CM can be computed in real time for pilot monitoring and display compensation. It is also demonstrated that pursuit tracking may be activated when pulse control is employed...|$|E

The method is based on the reduced Maxwell equation, atomic density matrix formalism and adiabatic approximation. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of our method we investigate in detail the case of propagation of the polarization pulse under conditions of coherent population trapping in a medium of two-level atoms with degenerate energy levels. Equations describing the evolution of various field parameters are derived. It is shown that pulses of ellipticity and spatial orientation of polarization ellipse propagate with slowing. Analytical expressions for the slowing factor are obtained. A previously unknown effects of the stimulated phase modulation and the generation of a phase <b>pilot</b> <b>pulse</b> by the variation of spatial orientation of the polarization ellipse are predicted.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a low {{complexity}} multichannel scheme for Ultra Wideband (UWB) channel impulse response estimation.

40|$|Gas filled {{coaxial cable}} beam loss {{monitors}} are a proven diagnostic in short pulse linacs and transport lines. At the SLAC linear collider (SLC), where the bunch length (σz) is ~ 1 mm, monitor cables with lengths ranging from 100 m to 3 km {{are used to}} locate beam losses of 5 x 10 8 particles (1. 5 % of the nominal intensity) with a resolution of +/- 1 m. The monitor is effective because of the simplicity of its installation and signal interpretation. Future linear colliders (LC) will use beams made up of trains of many closely spaced bunches and will therefore require more careful signal processing in order to locate losses. Typical collider operation will involve the use of pilot pulses, made up of only one bunch, to test subsystem performance prior to full power operation. A simple signal processor {{will be able to}} locate losses by comparing the evolution of the loss monitor signal as the number of bunches is increased. The monitor must have 10 times greater sensitivity than the SLC monitors in order to provide a prediction of the expected beam loss at full power using only the signal from the <b>pilot</b> <b>pulse.</b> This paper describes the proposed linear collider loss monitor system. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{behavioral}} {{models are}} developed that closely reproduced pulsive control response of two pilots from the experimental pool using markedly different control techniques (styles) while conducting a tracking task. An intriguing find {{was that the}} pilots appeared to: 1) produce a continuous, internally-generated stick signal that they integrated in time; 2) integrate the actual stick position; and 3) compare the two integrations to issue and cease pulse commands. This suggests that the pilots utilized kinesthetic feedback in order to perceive and integrate stick position, supporting the hypothesis that pilots can access and employ the proprioceptive inner feedback loop proposed by Hess' pilot Structural Model. The Pulse Models {{used in conjunction with}} the pilot Structural Model closely recreated the pilot data both in the frequency and time domains during closed-loop simulation.

The method is based on the inversion of a predictive combustion model that was previously developed by the authors, and that is capable of estimating the heat release rate and the in-cylinder pressure {{on the basis of the}} injection rate. The model equations have been rewritten in order to derive the injected mass as an output quantity, starting from use of the measured in-cylinder pressure as input. It has been verified that the proposed method is capable of estimating the injected mass of <b>pilot</b> <b>pulses</b> with an uncertainty of the order of ± 0. 15 mg/cyc, and the total injected mass with an uncertainty of the order of ± 0. 9 mg/cyc. The main sources of uncertainty are related to the estimation of the in-cylinder heat transfer and of the isentropic coefficient c = cp/cv. The estimation of the actual injected quantities in the combustion chamber can represent a powerful means to diagnose the behavior of the injectors during engine operation, and offers the possibility of monitoring effects, such as injector ageing and injector coking, as well as of allowing an accurate control of the pilot injected quantities to be obtained; the latter are in fact usually characterized by a large dispersion, with negative consequences on the combustion quality and emission formation.

The experimental data were acquired for six key-points representative of the engine working conditions over a NEDC (New European Driving Cycle). The experimental tests have been carried out according to the Design of Experiment approach and for each point several variation lists of the main engine variables have been considered. As a first step, the main engine variables which are expected to be related to the formation and oxidation of PM have been identified. An exponential mathematical model has then been introduced and a detailed statistical analysis has been carried out for each key-point in order to identify the most robust combination of the input variables among all the possible ones. It was verified that PM emissions are correlated to a great extent to the value of the chemical heat release at the end of the injection of the main pulse. This quantity is in fact related to the mass of burned gases which is generated by the oxidation of the <b>pilot</b> <b>pulses</b> that precede the main injection. Such a mass can have a large impact on the local oxygen concentration and temperature of the charge in which the fuel of the main pulse is injected, with a consequent effect on PM formation.

40|$|New {{correlations}} {{have been}} developed to predict the ignition delay of the main and multiple pilot injections {{as a function of the}} operating conditions in diesel engines. The ignition delay was first modeled through a global-mechanism approach, which accounts for the physical and chemical contributions separately. Semi-empirical correlations were then developed to predict the ignition delay of the <b>pilot</b> and main <b>pulses</b> for model-based control applications. Interest in this kind of application has in fact increased among car manufacturers over the last few years. An experimental investigation has been set up and carried out on a Euro 5 diesel engine at ICEAL-PT (Internal Combustion Engine Advanced Laboratory at the Politecnico di Torino), in order to assess the dependence of the ignition delay of each injection pulse on several parameters. The physical delay has been evaluated, with reference to the global-mechanism model, starting from a scaling law for the evaluation of the liquid length of the spray that was developed by Sandia National Laboratories. It has been verified that the physical delay depends on the charge and fuel thermodynamic conditions, as well as on the injector nozzle characteristics and injection pressure. The chemical delay, for the pilot injections, has been modeled by means of an Arrhenius-like expression that takes into account the effects of the charge density, temperature and oxygen concentration evaluated at the end of the physical delay. The chemical delay of the main injection has been modeled using a similar expression that includes an additional parameter, i. e., the total injected fuel quantity of the pilot injection shots. The thermodynamic and chemical conditions of the charge at the start of the main injection are in fact influenced to a great extent by the burning process of the pilot injection shots. The control-oriented approach, which is based on semi-empirical correlations to predict the ignition delay of the <b>pilot</b> and main <b>pulses,</b> was then developed. These correlations are robust and easy to apply, and are therefore suitable for integration with low-throughput combustion control algorithms that can be implemented in the engine control unit.

40|$|A {{potential}} non-lethal {{technique to}} reduce bird-aircraft collisions, aircraft-mounted light, {{has been considered}} for nearly 3 decades, but has received no formal research as to its efficacy. We tested the hypothesis that during daylight hours birds exposed to an approaching vehicle exhibiting pulsing landing lights would react more quickly than birds experiencing an on-coming vehicle with non-pulsing (steady) or no lights (control). We used the PulseliteTM system (Precise Flight, Inc., Bend, Oregon, USA), an early recognition lighting system that allows an aircraft <b>pilot</b> to <b>pulse</b> the landing, taxi, or forward-facing recognition lights, and 2 General Electric sealed-beam 250 -W aircraft landing lights. Using video, we quantified avoidance behavior by captive brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), Canada geese (Branta Canadensis), European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), herring gulls (Larus argentatus), and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) in separate experiments where captive birds were exposed to a vehicle fitted with the PulseliteTM system, and approaching at a consistent speed (33. 5 m sec- 1). While most species showed no differential response to light treatments, brown-headed cowbird groups (9 groups per treatment, 6 birds per group) responded more quickly to pulse versus control treatments, equating to a greater mean [SE] distance of the approaching vehicle from mid-cage per reacting bird (control: 35. 8 [9. 7] m; pulse: 50. 5 [10. 9] m). However, in a subsequent experiment involving the exposure of brown-headed cowbirds to control, pulse, and steady-light treatments, we observed no statistical difference in response among treatment groups (6 groups per treatment; 6 birds per group). While 250 -W landing lights, pulsed at 45 cycles min- 1, can influence avian behavior {{in response to an}} on-coming vehicle, the effects of the lights are inconsistent.

40|$|AbstractPulse-jet bag {{filters are}} {{frequently}} employed for particle removal from off gases. Separated solids form a layer on the permeable filter media called filter cake. The cake {{is responsible for}} increasing pressure drop. Therefore, the cake has to be detached at a predefined upper pressure drop limit or at predefined time intervals. Thus the process is intrinsically semi-continuous. The cake formation and cake detachment are interdependent and may influence {{the performance of the}} filter. Therefore, understanding formation and detachment of filter cake is important. In this regard, the filter media is the key component in the system. Needle felts are the most commonly used media in bag filters. Cake formation studies with heat treated and membrane coated needle felts in <b>pilot</b> scale <b>pulse</b> jet bag filter were carried out. The data is processed according to the procedures that were published already [Powder Technology, Volume 173, Issue 2, 19 April 2007, Pages 93 – 106]. Pressure drop evolution, cake height distribution evolution, cake patches area distribution and their characterization using fractal analysis on different needle felts are presented here. It is observed that concavity of pressure drop curve for membrane coated needle felt is principally caused by presence of inhomogeneous cake area load whereas it is inherent for heat treated media. Presence of residual cake enhances the concavity of pressure drop at the start of filtration cycle. Patchy cleaning is observed only when jet pulse pressure is too low and unable to provide the necessary force to detach the cake. The border line is very sharp. Based on experiments with limestone dust and three types of needle felts, for the jet pulse pressure above 4 bar and filtration velocity below 50 mm/s, cake is detached completely except a thin residual layer (100 – 200 μm). Uniformity and smoothness of residual cake depends on the surface characteristics of the filter media. Cake height distribution of residual cake and newly formed cake during filtration prevails. The patch size analysis and fractal analysis reveal that residual cake grow in size (latterly) following regeneration initially on the base with edges smearing out, however, the cake heights are not leveled off. Fractal dimension of cake patches boundary falls in the range of 1 – 1. 4 and depends on vertical position as well as time of filtration.

40|$|Aim : To {{analyze the}} effects of {{aircraft}} noise, resting pulse rate, and other factors on the risk of high diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in Indonesian Air Force pilots. Methods : A nested case-control study was conducted using data extracted from annual medical check-ups indoctrination aerophysiologic training records at the Saryanto Aviation and Aerospace Health Institute (LAKESPRA) in Jakarta from January 2003 – September 2008. For analysis of DBP: the case group with DBP ≥ 90 mmHg were compared with contral group with DBP < 79 mmHG. One case matched to 12 controls. Results: Out of 567 pilots, 544 (95. 9 %) had complete medical records. For this analysis there were 40 cases of high DBP and 480 controls for DBP. Pilots exposed to aircraft noise 90 - 95 dB rather than 70 - 80 dB had a 2. 7 -fold increase for high DBP [adjusted odds ratio (ORa) = 2. 70; 95 % confi dence interval (CI) = 1. 05 - 6. 97]. <b>Pilots</b> with resting <b>pulse</b> rates of ≥ 81 /minute rather than ≤ 80 /minute had a 2. 7 -fold increase for high DBP (ORa = 2. 66; 95 % CI = 1. 26 - 5. 61).

As a consequence, next-generation CV- QKD systems {{will have to be}} implemented with a local local oscillator (LLO). This issue has been explicitly tackled in recent works, where the proposed and implemented approach, that we call LLO-sequential, consists in sequentially (temporally) multiplexing quantum signal optical pulses with phase reference <b>pilot</b> tones optical <b>pulses.</b> We develop a comprehensive analysis of the noise model and the hardware requirements in order to perform LLO CV-QKD. This analysis allows to quantitatively understand one of the limits of CV-QKD implemented with the LLO-sequential approach: such systems, unless operated at very high speed, have very strong requirements in terms of tolerable laser phase noise. LLO-sequential CV-QKD can thus in practice only be implemented with expensive, low phase noise lasers, such as ECL lasers. The main contribution of this work is to introduce designs for LLO CV-QKD based on self-coherence phase sharing, in which the phase reference information and the quantum information are coherently obtained from a single optical wavefront. We propose in particular a design, called LLO-displacement, where the phase reference information is encoded in the displacement of the standard CV-QKD Gaussian modulated coherent state (GMCS) protocol. We analyze the performance and the hardware requirements of the LLO-displacement design and our results indicate that {{it can be used to}} perform CV-QKD over distances up to 100 km with realistic and affordable hardware, in particular with standard telecom equipment and low cost DFB lasers. This opens a practical path towards the development of coherent quantum communications systems compatible with next-generation networks requirements. Comment: Second version.

40|$|In Diesel engines the {{optimization}} of engine-out emissions, {{combustion noise}} and fuel consumption requires the experimental {{investigation of the}} effects of different injection strategies as well as {{of a large number of}} engine operating variables, such as scheduling of <b>pilot</b> and after <b>pulses,</b> rail pressure, EGR rate and swirl level. Due to the high number of testing conditions involved full factorial approaches are not viable, whereas Design of Experiment techniques have demonstrated to be a valid methodology. However, the results obtained with such techniques require a subsequent critical analysis, so as to investigate the cause and effect relationships between the set of engine operating variables and the combustion process characteristics that affect pollutant formation, noise of combustion and engine efficiency. To this purpose, the zero-dimensional multizone diagnostic combustion model developed at ICEAL was applied for the combustion and emission formation analysis in two different diesel engines, for various sets of injection strategies and engine operating parameters. The experimental data were acquired at the highly dynamic test rig of ICEAL, both in a EURO V low compression ratio diesel engine with a twin-stage turbocharger, equipped with piezoelectric injectors, and in a PCCI low compression ratio diesel engine equipped with solenoid injectors. The model results were discussed and reported in the well known ϕ-T diagrams, which give a synthetic representation of the local thermodynamic charge conditions during the mixture formation and premixed diffusion combustion processes. The rail pressure increase was found to be an effective means to improve fuel-charge premixing and to lower the average local equivalence ratio of the charge during premixed combustion, so leading to a decrease in soot formation. As regards the effects of cooled high-pressure EGR on combustion, it was shown that an increase of its rate does not significantly affect the average equivalence ratio during premixed combustion, which is associated to the soot formation rate. Finally, a proper calibration of the dwell-time between pilot and main injection, so as to have the main injection pulse center-of-gravity phased in correspondence to the start of pilot burning, resulted to produce a reduction of CO and soot emissions higher than 50 % with respect to baseline case, without any deterioration of NOx emission...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Research {{suggests}} {{that it is important to}} establish regular physical activity and healthy eating patterns during the early years (0 - 5 years). Engaging in healthy behaviours during this stage of life supports growth and development and lays the foundation for a lifetime of health and wellbeing. Despite these benefits, research indicates that children in Canada are not meeting the daily recommended physical activity guidelines for early years. Moreover, their diets are lacking in fruits and vegetables and are high in processed foods. As many early years children spend a large part of their day in childcare centres, educators can have a large influence on their physical activity and healthy eating behaviours. In the Canadian Prairie Provinces many childcare centres are located in rural communities. Previous research {{suggests that}} rural educators are influenced by unique factors associated with geographic local (e. g., access to resources to promote physical activity and year round access to variety of healthy foods) when attempting to provide healthy opportunities for children. In order to address the specific factors identified by rural educators and support healthier behaviours among rural early year’s children, a multilevel physical activity and healthy eating intervention (Healthy Start) was developed using McLeroy’s ecological model and a population health approach. Healthy Start was pilot tested in three rural childcare centres. Purpose: The primary purpose of this dissertation study was to evaluate Healthy Start, a multilevel community-based physical activity and healthy eating intervention, in rural childcare centres throughout Saskatchewan. In order to achieve this primary purpose, the specific dissertation objectives were addressed as follows. Paper 1 : a) Determine if over the course of the intervention, Healthy Start contributed to increases in physical activity levels and improvements in motor skill development among early years children aged 3 to 5 years; b) Determine if Healthy Start supported educators in providing children with more opportunities for physical activity; c) Describe educators’ experiences and perceptions of Healthy Start and its influence on physical activity within the childcare centre environment. Paper 2 : a) Assess to what extent, Healthy Start contributed to healthier eating behaviours among early years children aged 3 to 5 years over the course of the intervention; b) Determine if Healthy Start supported childcare staff (educators and cooks) in providing children with more opportunities for healthy eating; c) Describe educators ‘experiences and perceptions of Healthy Start and its influence on healthy eating within the childcare centre environment. Paper 3 : To <b>pilot</b> a <b>pulse</b> crop intervention study in one of the intervention childcare centres in order to: a) Increase knowledge and awareness about the nutritional value and health benefits of pulse crops among childcare staff (educators and cooks); b) Support childcare staff in providing children with more opportunities for pulse crop consumption; c) Expand the variety of healthy foods consumed by early years children by incorporating locally grown pulse crops into the childcare centre meals. Methods: A population health controlled intervention study using a wait-list control design (48 weeks delayed-intervention) was used to evaluate the impact of the intervention. Mixed methods were employed to determine the intervention’s influence on children and educator behaviours and on the childcare centre environment. Results: Overall, increases in children’s physical activity levels and improvements in healthy eating behaviours were observed in the intervention group. Moreover, educators felt the intervention was effective in supporting them to increase physical activity and healthy eating opportunities provided to rural early years children. Lastly, improvements to childcare centre environments were made to promote healthy behaviours among the children. Conclusion: Collectively, the pilot study provided insight into the complexities and feasibility of promoting physical activity and healthy eating among early years children in childcare centres, particularly in rural communities. This was an innovative intervention which addressed critical factors at multiple levels contributing to the development of healthy behaviours among rural early years children. The lessons learned in this dissertation study can be used to improve the Healthy Start intervention so its implementation can be effectively expanded to childcare centres within and outside of Saskatchewan. Additionally, the findings can contribute to the limited body of literature on implementing and evaluating interventions aimed at increasing both physical activity and healthy eating in Canadian childcare centres. In turn, supporting the healthy development of early years children in the province and beyond...|$|R

S'inicia el treball realitzant un estudi sobre les condicions d'operació per al tractament en continu d'una solució del colorant tèxtil Gris Lanaset G (complex organometal·lic) en un bioreactor fluiditzat per polsos d'aire amb el fong Trametes versicolor en forma de pèl·lets, establint la concentració de nutrients i el temps de residència hidràulic al qual s'ha d'operar per assolir percentatges de decoloració que compleixen la normativa d'abocament. Es proposa el mecanisme de decoloració, que té lloc en varies etapes en sèrie, primer es produeix l'adsorció inicial del colorant sobre la biomassa, posteriorment aquest es transfereix cap a l'interior de les cèl·lules, on es produeix el trencament del complex metàl·lic i finalment s'excreten al medi dels productes de degradació. Es determina el temps de residència cel·lular màxim en 40 dies i s'estableix la metodologia de renovació de biomassa en forma de pèl·lets per al tractament en continu. La renovació total de la biomassa es realitza en tres etapes, renovant un terç de la biomassa total del bioreactor en cada etapa, de manera que transcorregut un temps de residència cel·lular s'hagi renovat tota la biomassa del sistema. Es dissenya un reactor fluïditzat per polsos d'aire a escala pilot de 10 litres de volum útil i es realitza un estudi del comportament fluidodinàmic determinant el temps de mescla del sistema, i s'opera en discontinu i continu sense problemes operacionals. Un cop comprovada la bondat de l'escalat del bioreactor, s'introdueixen canvis paulatinament per adaptar el procés a condicions d'operació industrials, con són la no esterilitat de l'efluent a tractar, la supressió de macronutrients i micronutrients, la substitució de glucosa de qualitat anàlisi per glucosa de qualitat industrial, i així acabar tractant aigües residuals reals d'una indústria tèxtil sense esterilitzar on es posen de manifest alguns problemes que requeriran estudis posteriors. Donat que el procés d'eliminació de color més utilitzat a escala industrial és l'adsorció, s'estudia a escala laboratori l'adsorció del colorant Gris Lanaset G amb carbó actiu granular per tal de realitzar posteriorment un anàlisi comparatiu tant econòmic com ambiental dels dos processos, el d'adsorció i el biotecnològic. Aquests anàlisis posen de manifest que els costos d'operació del tractament biològic són únicament un 20 % superiors que els costos d'operació del procés d'adsorció, i que aquest percentatge es podria reduir encara més trobant substrats alternatius a l'extracte de malta per la formació dels pèl·lets. També es posa de manifest que el procés biotecnològic és més sostenible que el procés d'adsorció, i per tant el procés biotecnològic és una alternativa interessant des de el punt de vista ambiental al tractament d'adsorció. In {{this work}} are shown {{the most important}} results obtained in the experimental studies done {{with the goal of}} improving in the knowledge to develop a continuous process treatment for the decolourisation of textile wastewaters by ligninolytic fungi. The work starts with an operation conditions study for the continuous treatment of the dye Gris Lanaset G, which is a textile metal-complex dye, in an air pulses fluidised bioreactor by the white root fungi Trametes versicolor in pellet morphology. The nutrients concentration is established, and the effect of the hydraulic residence time in the decolourisation percentages is evaluated, taking into account the accomplishment of the standards established. It is proposed the decolourisation mechanism, which presents tree steeps: first of all, the dye is adsorbed in the biomass, after the dye is transferred into the cells, where takes place the break down of the metal complex, and finally the degradation products are released to the liquid medium. The maximum cellular residence time is determined in 40 days, and the biomass renovation methodology is established for the continuous treatment. The total biomass renovation takes place in three steeps, renovating one third of the total biomass in the bioreactor in every steep, {{in such a way that}} in the course of one cellular residence time, all the biomass in the bioreactor has been renovated. A <b>pilot</b> scale air <b>pulses</b> fluidised bioreactor is designed with a 10 L working volume, and the fluidodimanic behaviour is studied, determining the mixing time of the system. Without having any operational problem, the batch and continuous operation is carried out successfully. Once it is checked the goodness of the system, some changes are introduced gradually to adapt the system to industrial conditions. The changes are: the non-sterility of the effluent, the suppression of macronutrients and micronutrients, and the substitution of analysis quality glucose by industrial quality glucose. Finally is carried out the treatment of non-sterile real textile wastewaters. The most used removal colour process at industrial scale is the adsorption, so the adsorption of the dye Gris Lanaset G in granular activated carbon (GAC) is studied. The goal of this study is to make a comparative economical and environmental analysis of the two processes, adsorption and biodegradation. These analysis show that the operational cost of the biologic treatment is only 20 % more than the operational cost for the adsorption process. This percentage could be lower if an alternative substrate is found for the pellets formation. Also is showed that the biotechnological rocess is more sustainable than the adsorption one, so the biotechnological process is an interesting choice from the environmental point of view to the adsorption treatment...|$|R
