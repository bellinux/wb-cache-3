5000|$|<b>Piroxicam</b> [...] (INN, BAN, USAN, AAN; in some {{countries}} it is spelt piroksikam or piroxikam) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class used to relieve the symptoms of painful, inflammatory conditions like arthritis. <b>Piroxicam</b> works by preventing the production of endogenous prostaglandins which {{are involved in the}} mediation of pain, stiffness, tenderness and swelling. The medicine is available as capsules, tablets and (not in all countries) as a prescription-free gel 0.5%. It is also available in a betadex formulation, which allows a more rapid absorption of <b>piroxicam</b> from the digestive tract.|$|E
50|$|Ampiroxicam is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It is a prodrug of <b>piroxicam.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Piroxicam</b> is an NSAID and, as such, is a non-selective COX {{inhibitor}} possessing both analgesic and antipyretic properties.|$|E
50|$|Droxicam is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug of the oxicam class. A prodrug of <b>piroxicam,</b> it is {{used for}} the relief of pain and inflammation in musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.|$|E
50|$|Photosensitivity is a {{commonly}} overlooked adverse effect {{of many of}} the NSAIDs. The 2-arylpropionic acids are the most likely to produce photosensitivity reactions, but other NSAIDs have also been implicated including <b>piroxicam,</b> diclofenac and benzydamine.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} some {{differences}} in the propensity of individual agents to cause gastrointestinal ADRs. Indomethacin, ketoprofen and <b>piroxicam</b> appear to have the highest prevalence of gastric ADRs, while ibuprofen (lower doses) and diclofenac appear to have lower rates.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of Daypro for the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, 616 patients participated in active controlled clinical trials against aspirin, <b>piroxicam,</b> and other NSAIDs. Similar to the rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials, patients were given Daypro in both variable and in fixed dosing schedules. Patients received Daypro in either single or divided doses. The variable dosing schedule ranged from 600 to 1200 mg/day and the fixed dosing schedule was set to 1200 mg/day. Oxaprozin was found to be comparable to 2600 to 3200 mg/day doses of aspirin or 20 mg/day doses of <b>piroxicam.</b> The once a day and divided dosing schedules were both effective. Several days of administration were needed for oxaprozin to reach its full effect.|$|E
50|$|Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) with analgesic and fever reducer effects. It is {{a derivative}} of oxicam, {{closely related to}} <b>piroxicam,</b> and falls in the enolic acid group of NSAIDs. It was developed by Boehringer-Ingelheim. Meloxicam starts to relieve pain about 30-60 minutes after administration.|$|E

50|$|Meloxicam use {{can result}} in {{gastrointestinal}} toxicity and bleeding, headaches, rash, and very dark or black stool (a sign of intestinal bleeding). Like other NSAIDs, its use is {{associated with an increased}} risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. It has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than diclofenac, <b>piroxicam,</b> naproxen, and perhaps all other NSAIDs which are not COX-2 selective. Although meloxicam inhibits formation of thromboxane A, it does not appear to do so at levels that would interfere with platelet function.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} group of analgesics are nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAID). Acetaminophen/paracetamol {{is not always}} included in this class of medications. However, acetaminophen may be administered as a single medication or {{in combination with other}} analgesics (both NSAIDs and opioids). The alternatively prescribed NSAIDs such as ketoprofen and <b>piroxicam</b> have limited benefit in chronic pain disorders and with long-term use are associated with significant adverse effects. The use of selective NSAIDs designated as selective COX-2 inhibitors have significant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks which have limited their utilization.|$|E
50|$|Interactions {{with other}} drugs {{are typical of}} NSAIDs. Combination with vitamin K antagonists like {{warfarin}} {{increases the risk of}} bleeding. Combination with ciclosporin can lead to reduced kidney function, and to acute renal failure in rare cases. Lornoxicam can also increase the adverse effects of lithium, methotrexate and digoxin and its derivatives. The effect of diuretics, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists can be reduced, but this is only relevant in patients with special risks like heart failure. As with <b>piroxicam,</b> cimetidine can increase plasma levels but is unlikely to cause relevant interactions.|$|E
50|$|Isoxicam is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{that was}} taken or applied to reduce inflammation and as an analgesic reducing pain in certain conditions. The drug was introduced in 1983 by the Warner-Lambert Company. Isoxicam is a chemical analog of <b>piroxicam</b> (Feldene) which has a pyridine ring in lieu of an isoxazole ring. In 1985 Isoxicam was withdrawn from the French market, due to adverse effects, namely Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell syndrome) resulting in death. Although these serious side affects were observed only in France, the drug was withdrawn worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|The polymer {{employed}} {{should be}} non-toxic, non-irritant and devoid of leachable impurities. It should have good wetting and spreadability property.

Film obtained should be tough enough so that there won't be any damage while handling or during transportation. Combination of microcrystalline cellulose and maltodextrin has been used to formulate Oral Strips of <b>piroxicam</b> made by hot melt extrusion technique. Pullulan has been the most widely used film former (used in Listerine PocketPak, Benadryl, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|Pfizer UK was {{presented}} with the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement in 1979, {{in recognition of the}} outstanding contribution made to tropical medicine by the medicine Mansil (oxamniquine), which had been developed at the Sandwich site. Feldene (<b>piroxicam),</b> a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug developed jointly by the Sandwich site and Pfizer's R&D facility in Groton, United States, was launched in 1980. In 1984, a third phase of buildings was completed at the Sandwich site. The oral antifungal drug Diflucan (fluconazole), which had been discovered at the Sandwich site, was launched in 1988. In December 1997, Pfizer announced an investment of £109 million in a new research facility at the Sandwich site, creating 1,000 jobs.|$|E

5000|$|Medication is {{the main}} method of {{managing}} pain in TMD, mostly because there is little if any evidence {{of the effectiveness of}} surgical or dental interventions. Many drugs have been used to treat TMD pain, such as analgesics (pain killers), benzodiazepines (e.g. clonazepam, prazepam, diazepam), anticonvulsants (e.g. gabapentin), muscle relaxants (e.g. cyclobenzaprine), and others. Analgesics that have been studied in TMD include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. <b>piroxicam,</b> diclofenac, naproxen) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib). Topical methyl salicylate and topical capsaicin have also been used. Other drugs that have been described for use in TMD include glucosamine hydrochloride/chondroitin sulphate and propranolol. Despite many randomized control trials being conducted on these commonly used medications for TMD a systematic review carried out in 2010 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support or not to support the use of these drugs in TMD. Low-doses of anti-muscarinic tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or nortriptyline have also been described. [...] In a subset of people with TMD who are not helped by either noninvasive and invasive treatments, long term use of opiate analgesics has been suggested, although these drugs carry a risk of drug dependence and other side effects. Examples include morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol, hydrocodone, and methadone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} SNP epoxygenase {{variants}} are as follows. 1) CYP2C8*3 (30411A>G, rs10509681, Lys399Arg) converts arachidonic acid to 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET with a turnover rate {{less than half}} that of wild type CYP2C8; in a single recent report, male but not female carriers of the CYP2C8*3 allele had an increased risk of essential hypertension. Bearers of this SNP may or may not show increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are its substrates such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, <b>piroxicam,</b> tenoxicam, and valdecoxib. 2) CYP2J2*7 (−76G>T, rs890293, upstream Promoter (genetics) site) has decreased binding of the Sp1 transcription factor resulting in its lowered expressionas and lowered levels of EETs in plasma. Carriers of this SNP among a Uygur population in China had a higher risk of coronary artery disease. However, CYP2J2*7 carriers showed no association with hypertension, heart attack, or stroke in a study of 5,740 participants of the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study; since other studies have afforded contradictory results, this allele is currently regarded as not associated with cardiovascular diseases (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance). [...] Bearers of this SNP in a Chinese Population had a higher risk of younger onset of type 2 diabetes and among a Chinese Han population had a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. 3) CYP2C8*2 (11054A>T, rs11572103, Ile269Phe) and CYP2C8*4 (11041C>, rs1058930, variants have reduced arachidonic acid-metabolizing activity but have not been clearly associated with cardiovascular or other diseases. 4) CYPC28*4 (3608C>T, rs1058930, Ile264Met) has reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. It has not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but has a higher incidence in subjects with type II diabetes in a small sample of Caucasians in Germany. [...] 5) The CYP2C9*2 (3608C>T, rs1799853, Arg144Cys) variant has a 50% reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolizing activity compared to CYP2C9 wild type carriers of it show no association with cardiovascular disease but exhibit poor metabolism of the anti-coagulating, blood-thining agent, warfarin. These carriers are susceptible to the gastrointestinal bleeding side effects of warfarin and the NSAID cited above. 6 [...] ) CYP2C9*3 (42624A>C, rs1057910, Iso359Leu) encodes an expoxygenase with reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. This allele has not been directly associated with cardiovascular diseases but may be associated with the poor metabolism and therefore adverse reactions to warfarin, NSAID, sulfonylurea-containing oral hypoglycemic agents, and the anti-(epilepsy) drug, phenytoin. 7) CYP2C19*2 (19154G>A, rs4244285, Il264Met) and CYP2C19*3 (17948G>A, rs4986893, His212X) are loss-of-function null alleles; carriers of the CYP2C19*3 but not the CYP2C19*2 allele showed a reduced risk of developing essential hypertension in a large Korean population study. Bearers of null alleles would be expected to be poor metabolizers of several drugs which are CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 substrates. This is particularly the case with Clopidogrel, a drug used to block platelet activation, blood clotting, and thereby heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery occlusion in people at high risk of these events; CYP2C19 metabolizes clopidogrel to it active form. Consequently, patients with severe deficiencies in this CYP, i.e. bearers of CYP2C19*3 or CYP2C19*2 alleles, fail to gain protection from clopidogrel and have a higher risk of the cited cardiovascular events than clopidogrel-treated patients bearing wild type CYP2C19 alleles. 8) CYPC19*17 (-800C>T, rs12248560, site upstream gene promoter site) causes overproduction of its epoxygenase and thereby the ultra fast metabolism of arachidonic acid. Bearers of this allele have not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but clearly show a decreased risk of developing breast cancer and endometriosis possible because their rapid metabolism of estrogen leads to lower estrogen levels and thereby a lower risk of these estrogen-fueled diseases. These bearers also a higher rate of metabolism of, and therefore reduced responsiveness to, certain proton pump inhibitor and antidepressant drugs.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{research}} was aimed {{to increase the}} intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) of <b>piroxicam</b> with solid dispersion system of piroxicam-betacyclodextrin (SDSPB). This system can overcome the dissolution problem of <b>piroxicam.</b> Method: Determination of <b>piroxicam</b> IDR was performed using intrinsic dissolution tester in 100 rpm speed of stir. Free CO 2 water was used as solvent. <b>Piroxicam</b> concentration in was measured using spectrophometer. The <b>piroxicam</b> IDR of SDSPB which was prepared using solvent method with freeze drying was compared with control (<b>piroxicam</b> alone). Then the interaction of <b>piroxicam</b> with betacyclodextrin was analyzed using IR spectra. Result:The IDR of SDSPB and <b>piroxicam</b> pellet are 1. 2247 and 0. 244 mgcm- 2 minute- 1 respectively. This enhancement was predicted due to inclusion complex and electrostatic interaction of <b>piroxicam</b> and betacyclodextrin. Conclusion: The SDSPB can enhance six times fold of <b>piroxicam</b> IDR (p� 0, 05). The researches purposed to formulate SDSPB tablet and to test its bioavailability are needed to confirms this IDR enhancement...|$|E
40|$|<b>Piroxicam</b> is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drug that}} is characterised by low solubility and high permeability. In order to improve the drug dissolution rate, the co-grinding method {{was used as an}} approach to prepare <b>piroxicam</b> co-ground in the carriers such as glucosamine hydrochloride. As, this amino sugar (glucosamine HCl) has been shown to decrease pain and improve mobility in osteoarthritis in joints, therefore, the incorporation of glucosamine in <b>piroxicam</b> formulations would be expected to offer additional benefits to patients. The effect of the order of grinding on the dissolution of <b>piroxicam</b> was also investigated. Co-ground drug and glucosamine were prepared in different ratios using a ball mill. The samples were then subjected to different grinding times. In order to investigate the effect of the grinding process on the dissolution behaviour of <b>piroxicam,</b> the drug was ground separately in the absence of glucosamine. Mixtures of ground <b>piroxicam</b> and unground d-glucosamine HCl were prepared. Physical mixtures of <b>piroxicam</b> and glucosamine were also prepared for comparison. The properties of prepared co-ground systems and physical mixtures were studied using a dissolution tester, FTIR, SEM, XRPD and DSC. These results showed that the presence of glucosamine HCl can increase dissolution rate of <b>piroxicam</b> compared to pure <b>piroxicam.</b> Generally, all dissolution profiles showed the fastest dissolution rate when ground <b>piroxicam</b> was mixed with unground glucosamine. This was closely followed by the co-grinding of <b>piroxicam</b> with glucosamine where lower grinding times showed the fastest dissolution. The solid state studies showed that the grinding of <b>piroxicam</b> for longer times had no effect on polymorphic form of <b>piroxicam,</b> whereas mixtures of piroxicam–glucosamine ground for longer times (60 min) converted <b>piroxicam</b> polymorph II to polymorph I...|$|E
