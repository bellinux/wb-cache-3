40|$|Deficit {{irrigation}} {{is increasingly}} being practiced in water-limited areas to overcome water scarcities. Although, this practice reduces yield losses, {{there is limited}} information currently available on how this practice can affect crops when the irrigation water contains elevated levels of salts. An experiment {{was set up to}} investigate salt uptake and distribution and salt tolerance of <b>potted</b> Soultanina <b>vines</b> <b>grafted</b> on different rootstocks (41 B, 1103 P, 110 R) and irrigated with effluent containing relatively high concentrations of salts and fresh water at different fractions of evapotranspiration (0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 00 ET). Irrigation with recycled water induced the development of leaf burns, which were more intense in 1998 despite the lower leaf-Na and -Cl content. This may have been due to the more severe water deficit and/or to the more adverse climatic conditions which prevailed during that season. Decreasing the irrigation level induced the development of leaf burns causing only minor changes to leaf-Na or -Cl content. Differences in salt uptake, accumulation and distribution were observed among the rootstocks investigated in this work, suggesting that differences exist in the mechanisms regulating salt uptake and distribution in the shoot. Despite these differences, a distinct superiority in terms of salinity tolerance among rootstocks was only observed at the 0. 50 ET irrigation level, where <b>vines</b> <b>grafted</b> on 41 B developed earlier and more acute leaf burns than the other rootstocks. These findings suggest that leaf salt content alone it is not to classify genotypes according to their tolerance to salinity and that salinity-induced damage is linked with prevailing environmental conditions. Furthermore, it can be inferred that grapevines have additional mechanisms to cope with salt stress which may counteract differences in salt uptake and accumulation in the shoot. ...|$|R
40|$|Two-year-old Sultana and Mke vines (Vitis vinifera L.) grafted onto Rupestris du Lot (Vitis rupestris Scheele) and 110 R (Vitis berlandieri Vitis rupestris) {{were grown}} in soil, sand, {{sphagnum}} peat and farmyard manure mixture (2 : 1 : 1 : 1 v/v) irrigated with 0. 3, 2. 7 and 5. 45 dS m- 1 NaCl solutions {{for a period}} of 60 days. Biomass accumulation, relative chlorophyll content, leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and transpiration were significantly reduced by salinity in all graft combinations. The inhibiting effect of salinity on growth varied according to the characteristics of the scion genotype and the level of salinity. The results imply the predominance of the scion genotype in determining variation in the leaf-level physiological characteristics of <b>grafted</b> <b>vines</b> because stomatal conductance and transpiration were higher in Sultana than in Mke at the same leaf water potential and the level of salinity, regardless of the rootstock genotype. NaCl treatments did not affect leaf Cu concentration while inducing significant Na, K, Ca, N, P, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn elevations in the leaves of all scion/rootstock combinations. While salinity caused an increase in N content and a decrease in K content in the roots of all graft combinations, it had no influence on Ca, P, Cu and Zn concentrations. In contrast to the Sultana <b>grafted</b> <b>vines,</b> NaCl salinity led to a decrease in Mg, Fe and Mn concentrations in the roots of Mke <b>grafted</b> <b>vines.</b> Nevertheless, ion accumulation in leaves and roots of <b>grafted</b> <b>vines</b> under saline or non-saline conditions was controlled predominantly by the genotype of the scion. In response to salinity, Sultana grafts accumulated higher amounts of ions in their leaves than in their roots. However, in Mke, higher ion concentrations were seen in the roots.

40|$|<b>Grafting</b> <b>vines</b> as a {{means of}} {{propagation}} was known as early as the 2 nd century B. C. (Cato in his treatise De agri cultua.). The use of rootstocks in Vitis, however, was not extensively used until 1880 {{because it was the only}} effective method to combat the devastating root louse phylloxera, Phylloxera vitifoliae (Fitch), (Coombe, 1999). In California, grape growers have been using rootstocks for over 100 years (Foott et al., 1989). Much of the worldâs viticulture is based primarily on grafting, where the scion is a cultivar of Vitis vinifera and the rootstock is either a North American Vitis species or an interspecific Vitis hybrid (Weaver, 1976). The major reason to use rootstocks is in their resistance to some severe biotic problems such as phylloxera and nematodes. Reynolds and Wardle (2001) outlined seven major criteria for choosing rootstocks in the order of importance as phylloxera resistance, nematode resistance, adaptability to high pH soils, adaptability to saline soils, adaptability to low pH soils, adaptability to wet or poorly drained soils and adaptability to drought. Numerous reports have also proved that rootstocks affect vine growth, yield, fruit quality and wine quality.

50|$|Like {{many other}} plants, grape vines are {{susceptible}} to chlorosis, and symptoms of iron deficiency tend to be common on soils rich in limestone. In the wake of The Great French Wine Blight, when European Vitis vinifera were affected by Phylloxera, chlorosis became a greater problem in viticulture. To deal with the Phylloxera blight, V. vinifera was grafted onto rootstock based on American species of the Vitis genus, such as Vitis riparia, Vitis rupestris, Vitis berlandieri. However, many of these were less adapted to the lime-rich soils that were common in France's vineyards, in particular many of those that produced wines of top quality. Many <b>grafted</b> <b>vines</b> in lime-rich vineyards therefore showed signs of iron deficiency, and in France this specific form of chlorosis was termed chlorose calcaire. The problem was largely overcome by the selection of lime-resistant American vines as basis for hybrid vines used for rootstock material. However, since such rootstocks may be less than optimal in other respects, {{it is necessary for}} the viticulturalist to balance the need for chlorosis resistance against other viticultural needs. This is illustrated by {{one of the most common}} lime-resistant rootstocks, 41 B, which is a hybrid between V. vinifera cultivar Chasselas and V. berlandieri, which generally has a sufficient, but not extremely high, Phylloxera resistance.|$|R

Water stress (Psi(pd) < 0. 8 MPa) was apparent in the unirrigated vines from veraison onward. The absence of irrigation strongly influenced vine growth and performance. Pruning weight, cane weight, and cane number were all reduced as a consequence of zero irrigation. Yields were reduced in unirrigated treatments due to a reduction in cluster number, cluster weight, and berry weight rather than fruit set or berry number.

The last vintage of pre-phylloxeric wines was 1945, when the harvest was down to only one-tenth of today's output, or around 2.5 hectoliters per hectare, which meant that only 600 bottles were produced in this vintage. Despite this very small production and continuous consumption of the wine, thousands of bottles claimed to be RomanÃ©e-Conti 1945 have been traded over the decades, including large-format bottles that were never filled by the domaine in that vintage. It has therefore been concluded that RomanÃ©e-Conti 1945 is forged to an unusually high extent. After the 1945 harvest, the old vines were uprooted and the vineyard left fallow. The vineyard was replanted in 1947, and no RomanÃ©e-Conti vintages were produced after the replantation until 1952.

Perold planted the four seeds from his cross in the garden of his official residence at Welgevallen Experimental Farm and then apparently forgot about them. In 1927 he left the university to take up a job with KWV co-operative and the garden became overgrown. The university sent in a team to tidy it up, just as Charlie Niehaus happened to pass by. He was a young lecturer who knew about the seedlings, and rescued them from the clean-up team. The young plants were moved to Elsenburg Agricultural College under Perold's successor, CJ Theron. In 1935 Theron grafted them onto newly established Richter 99 and Richter 57 rootstock at Welgevallen. Meanwhile, Perold continued to visit his former colleagues. Theron showed him the newly <b>grafted</b> <b>vines,</b> and the one that was doing best was selected for propagation and was christened Pinotage. The first wine was made in 1941 at Elsenburg, with the first commercial plantings at Myrtle Grove near Sir Lowry's Pass.
