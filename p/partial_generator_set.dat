If Plow[*]>[*] 0, the diesel <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> produces PDE and this power is totally dumped by the flexible load. If Plow[*]<[*] 0 and {{is within the}} scope of PDE (a net load exists), the diesel <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> provides PDE, one part is used to satisfy the load demand and any remaining power is dumped. However, if Plow[*]<[*] 0 and exceeds the range of PDE, the diesel <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> only outputs PDE, and the demand gap is filled by the battery. If the battery is functioning at its maximum capability and more power is needed, the diesel <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> will supply the increment automatically (E and F in Fig.  6).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for {{estimating}} {{the moment of}} inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was proposed in this paper, which was defined as Governor Sensitivity Test Method (GSTM). In this method, the moment of inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was estimated by means of measure transient speed change of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> when the engine load increases suddenly. In the present, {{there have been some}} methods for estimating the moment of inertia of engine, such as, Additional Mass Method, Running Down Test Method and Accelerating- Decelerating Method Under No Load. These methods for estimating the moment of inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> all have shortcomings on accuracy or operability. These shortcomings have been overcome by using the GSTM method proposed in this paper. It is easy to operate, and the factors affecting estimation errors are small. In this paper, the basic principle of the GSTM method was discussed. The factors affecting estimation errors ware analyzed. An example of calculating the moment of inertia of an engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> using the GSTM method was presented. The result of calculating the moment of inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was used to simulate the transient speed response of an engine <b>generator</b> <b>set.</b> The GSTM method was verified to be practical by comparing the results of simulation and experiment...|$|R

Feedback energy {{recycling}} {{is one of}} the most important energy-saving technologies of diesel <b>generator</b> <b>sets.</b> The current methods of recovering feedback energy are mainly by the energy storage device.
