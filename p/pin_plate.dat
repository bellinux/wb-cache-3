Composite forged metal frames were preferred by many European makers until the American system was fully adopted by the early 20th century.

40|$|The gap {{waveguide}} {{technology is}} a promising candidate as a cost-effective and low-loss platform for realizing microwave devices particularly at frequencies higher than 40 GHz. In this study, two types of groove gap waveguide filters and also a diplexer are presented. Coupling mechanism of these filters is based on carving on the <b>pin</b> <b>plate</b> and iris between adjacent cavities. Two fifth-order Chebyshev filters are realised at 62. 5 GHz. The proposed diplexer consists of RX and TX iris groove gap waveguide filters at the centre frequency of 59. 5 and 62. 5 GHz and an E-plane groove gap waveguide T-junction. The required transition of the groove gap waveguide to WR- 15 is designed and used as an input port of the filters. Moreover, E-plane groove gap waveguide T-junction is designed as the connecting part of the groove gap waveguide filters to the WR- 15 antenna port. Finally all parts are integrated. The proposed diplexer is manufactured in aluminium by sawing and milling and then silver plating is done. The RX and TX passbands of the diplexer is around 1. 7 and 2. 4 % with the measured return loss better than 13. 6 dB and minimum insertion loss of 0. 9 and 0. 8 dB, respectively...|$|E

30|$|As {{commercial}} products, {{the exact}} materials’ composition and fabrication {{process of the}} aforementioned absorbable magnesium implants are not publicly available in scientific publications. However, one may {{have a look at}} patent databases such as that of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The following examples are three US patents assigned to the three companies who already commercialized the absorbable metals technology. First, the US Patent #US 9700652 B 2 was assigned to Biotronik claiming an absorbable medical implant made of fiber-reinforced magnesium or fiber-reinforced magnesium alloys (Loeffler et al. 2017). It is comprised of a matrix of crystalline magnesium or magnesium alloy reinforced by amorphous or nanocrystalline fibers made of Mg-(10 – 40  wt%) Zn-(0 – 20  wt%)X, wherein X is selected from the group of lanthanum, yttrium, silicon, aluminum, and calcium. This composite-like structure allows an increased strength and tunable corrosion behavior which are desirable for coronary stent applications. Second, Syntellix assigned the US Patent # US 9402669 B 2 which claims a method for producing a medical implant, such as bone screw, nail, <b>pin,</b> <b>plate,</b> and suture anchor, from a magnesium alloy which contains 2.5 – 5  wt% RE, 1.5 – 5  wt% yttrium, 0.1 – 2.5  wt% zirconium, and 0.01 – 0.8  wt% zinc (Neubert and Schavan 2016). The method consists of melting the alloy at 700 – 900  °C, atomizing the molten alloy into alloy powder under a protective-gas atmosphere, shaping the powder into a green body, extruding it at 300 – 400  °C to obtain a molded part, and finally producing the medical implant from it. Third, the US Patent US 20170119922 A 1 was assigned to U&I claiming a magnesium alloy for forming a medical implant, comprising 0 – 23 wt % calcium and 0 – 10 wt % zinc (Koo et al. 2017). The alloy possesses controlled corrosion resistance properties due to the electrical potential difference between magnesium phase and Mg 2 Ca phase which is not greater than 200  mV as measured in a biomimetic solution specified in the patent. As can be seen, the inventions claimed in those patents based on the material composition that leads to a controlled corrosion resistance, the composite structure that leads to an improved strength, and the processing method that results into a molded semi-finished material.|$|E
