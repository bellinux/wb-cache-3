50|$|File {{utilities}} create, list, copy, {{move and}} delete files, and alter metadata. They {{may be able}} to truncate data, truncate or extend space allocation, append to, move, and modify files in-place. Depending on the underlying structure of the file system, they may provide a mechanism to <b>prepend</b> <b>to,</b> or truncate from, the beginning of a file, insert entries into the middle of a file or delete entries from a file.|$|E
5000|$|... (head {{sentinel}} {{trick is}} used here to simplify coding). Note how the callee now appends {{to the end}} of the growing list, rather than have the caller <b>prepend</b> <b>to</b> the beginning of the returned list. The work is now done on the way forward from the list's start, before the recursive call which then proceeds further, a.o.t. backward from the list's end, after the recursive call has returned its result. It is thus similar to accumulating parameter technique, turning a recursive computation into an iterative one.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{the term}} difference list may refer {{to one of}} two data structures for representing lists. One of these data structures contains two lists, and represents the difference of those two lists. The second data structure is a functional representation of a list with an efficient concatenation operation. In the second approach, difference lists are implemented as single-argument functions, which take a list as argument and <b>prepend</b> <b>to</b> that list. As a consequence, concatenation of difference lists of the second type is implemented essentially as function composition, which is O(1). However, of course the list still has to be constructed eventually (assuming all of its elements are needed), which is plainly at least O(n).|$|E

50|$|The Latvian SSR had the +7 013 area code. The {{original}} format was 8 (013) xxx xxxx. In 1993, Latvia {{switched to}} the +371 code. The plan remained relatively the same until 2008, when a 6 was <b>prepended</b> <b>to</b> all landlines.|$|R

50|$|Per the specification, {{the usual}} hash symbol (#) will be <b>prepended</b> <b>to</b> channel names that {{begin with an}} {{alphanumeric}} character—allowing it to be omitted.

5000|$|In lexicology, an {{appurtenance}} is a modifier that is appended or <b>prepended</b> <b>to</b> {{another word}} to coin {{a new word}} that expresses [...] "belongingness".

50|$|If {{the base}} and all the digits in the set of digits are non-{{negative}}, negative numbers cannot be expressed. To overcome this, a minus sign, here »-«, {{is added to the}} numeral system.

50|$|But {{today there}} are a number of add-on {{utilities}} which implement tar file indexing, thus enabling random access, both for raw tar files and for tar files compressed with gzip (which is amenable to indexing).

25|$|Before DEFLATE is applied, {{the data}} is {{transformed}} via a prediction method: a single filter method {{is used for the}} entire image, while for each image line, a filter type is chosen to transform the data to make it more efficiently compressible.

50|$|The basic {{mathematics}} of a CRC accepts (considers as correctly transmitted) messages which, when {{interpreted as}} a polynomial, are a multiple of the CRC polynomial.
