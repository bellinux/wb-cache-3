40|$|In the {{scientific}} sources {{of recent years}} one can find statements {{about the role of}} connective tissue dysplasia with placentation disorders one of the manifestations of which is a local abruption of chorion and placental tissue. At present it is important not only to search for sensitive tests to control the effectiveness of treatment of retrochorionic hematomas and local forms of premature placental abruption but also to develop and implement treatment-and-prevention programs. We analyzed the course of pregnancy and labor in 80 women between 20 – 40 years of age with local non-progressive abruption of chorion and a normally positioned placenta, who were divided into two groups depending on the suggested complex of treatment and prevention in the program of optimization of pregnancy management. The control group included 20 relatively healthy women with a physiological course of pregnancy. It was reasonable and pathogenetically justifiable to start applying complex treatment of disturbed homeostatic processes from the pregestational stage. This accounted for the introducing a complex of vitamin agents, polyunsaturated fatty acids and angiogenic inductors into the treatment program. To achieve this goal, the pregestational preparation of this category of patients was complemented with a <b>polyvitamin</b> <b>complex</b> with folic acid, nitric oxide inductors and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which influenced not only the total effect of treatment but also increased the effectiveness of each component of the treatment program. The analysis of the prevalence of undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia (UCTD) identified a constantly high percentage of women with a clinically significant dysplastic phenotype – 63 women (78. 75 %), providing convincing evidence of the fact that uteroplacental apoplexy was associated with congenital weakness of connective tissue (ОR - 18. 17; 95 % DІ; 6. 3 - 36. 5, р< 0. 001).   According to the analytical research, 54 out of 80 pregnant women (67. 5 %) with local non-progressive abruption of chorion and placenta developed various complications in the course of pregnancy – preeclampsia, placental dysfunction, threat of premature labor, uterine hemorrhage, etc. One should also note a considerable number of cases of fetal distress, which was to a certain extent associated with the existing complications in the course of pregnancy and labor and fetoplacental dysfunction. The analysis of the results of pregnancy completion showed a significant reduction in the prematurity rate. For instance, in women of the basic group, spontaneous abortion was observed 3. 5 times less often and premature labor 2 times less often than in the comparison group (р< 0. 05). Thus, in 80 % of pregnant women of the basic group the necessary conditions were created to develop and prolong their pregnancy and complete it with term labor whereas in the comparison group the percentage was 55 % (р< 0. 05). Besides, the use of the agents suggested by us enabled a decrease in the development of such gestational complications as chronic placental insufficiency by 2 times, late gestosis and hydramnion by 2. 5 times. Modification of the basic complex treatment by introducing the suggested membrane-stabilizing and antioxidant agents as well as the use of the indicated preventive measures at the stages of placentation and probable development of placental insufficiency helped decrease the percentage of abortions and the development of negative reproductive and perinatal losses...|$|E
40|$|Outcomes of {{the studies}} of Picovit (KRKA, Slovenia) vitamin and mineral {{preparation}} series' efficiency {{in the prevention of}} hypo and avitaminoses in apparently healthy children and in children administered therapy and rehabilitation measures for reasons of chronic somatic pathology are described. Picovit polyvitamin and vitamin & mineral complexes have been specifically designed for children of various ages and contain all necessary vitamins and minerals in safe RDA approved quantities; they are manufactured under a special micro capsulation technology. It has been proved that Picovit series medications are highly efficient, safe, convenient for administration and use, and have high organoleptic characteristics which allows recommending them for an ample use in paediatrics.

40|$|The most {{important}} biochemical processes in human organism {{are carried out}} with vitamins and microelements involved. Acting as biological catalysts, vitamins {{have an impact on}} metabolism and provide protection against unfavourable environmental factors. The key source of vitamins and microelements for a person is food. The content of vitamins in a diet varies and depends on a range of various reasons. However, now the diet may not fully meet vitamin and microelement requirements. The result of this is widespread prevalence of sub-clinical deficiency of vitamins and microelements. Patients from one of the risk groups, children with atopy, are especially susceptible to this condition. Hypoallergenic diet prescribed as part of the therapeutic measures, is often the cause of imbalanced and irrational nutrition. Modern vitamin complexes may solve the issue of subnormal supply of vitamins and apparent hypovitaminosis in children with allergic diseases.

40|$|One {{of modern}} actual {{problems}} of prophylactic pediatrics is vitamin and mineral provision of schoolchildren. The information about prevalence, etiology, clinical manifestation of vitamin starvation in children was described. The measures of prophylaxis of hypovitaminosis {{with use of}} food substances enriched with vitamins and microelements, and with <b>polyvitamin</b> and mineral <b>complexes,</b> fortified drinks, premixes were reviewed. Recommended daily consumption rate of main vitamins and composition of modern vitamin and mineral complexes was indicated.

40|$|The {{researchers}} {{examined how}} well the children aged between 3 – 5 years old were provided with с, В 1, В 2, В 6 and РР vitamins {{both before and after}} 3 months of taking in two forms of the polyvitaminic complex (syrup and pastilles). The examination was performed {{on the basis of the}} renal excretion of the ascorbic acid, thiamine, riboflavin, 4 cpiridoxyl acid and 1 cmetylnicotinamide. The polyvitaminic complex intake led to increase of excretion of all the examined vitamins apart from the ascorbic acid, warned about the deterioration of provision with с and в 6 vitamins and some what improved children's provision with В 1, В 2 and РР vitamins. However, the intake of this complex in the applied doses didn't ensure complete normalization of the vitamin status indices among all the examined children, which indicates the necessity to apply it in bigger doses, as the manufacturing firm recommends to.
