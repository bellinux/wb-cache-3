40|$|Watson, Mary P. Transition-metal catalyzed {{cross-coupling}} reactions {{have transformed}} organic synthesis {{to a new}} level. Traditionally, these reactions have focused on using halides and triflates as electrophiles. However, alcohol-based substrates show advantage of readily availability and environmental friendly. Chapter 1 is an introduction of applying nickel-based catalysts to the activation of strong carbon-oxygen bonds. In this case, aryl and vinyl <b>pivalates</b> have been successfully coupled with olefins in a Heck reaction to give the 1, 2 -disubstituted alkenes in good yield. 1, 1 '-Bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene (dppf) was identified as the most effective ligand. Various functional groups are tolerated in the optimized conditions, but high temperature was required to obtain synthetically useful yield. In Chapter 2, a stereospecific Suzuki cross-coupling of enantioenriched secondary benzylic <b>pivalates</b> with arylboroxines was achieved with a nickel-based catalyst to deliver diarylethanes and triarylmethanes. This reaction features high yields {{and high levels of}} stereochemical fidelity. Furthermore, benzylic alcohol precursors are readily available in high ee. The use of mild organoboron reagents enabled various base-sensitive functional groups to be tolerated and increased the convenience of this class of cross-coupling by avoid handling of air-sensitive Grignard reagents. Chapter 3 describe my development of stereospecific Suzuki cross-coupling of tertiary benzylic acetates to deliver di- and triarylalkanes with quaternary stereocenters. Exceptional high levels of stereochemical fidelities are observed, delivering these quaternary centers in remarkable enantiomeric enrichment. Both chapter 4 and 5 focus on the use of allylic <b>pivalates</b> as substrates in the nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. In chapter 4, a stereospecific Suzuki coupling of allylic <b>pivalates</b> with arylboroxines to deliver highly enantioenriched 1, 3 -diaryl alkenes. This method features in the use of mild reaction conditions, high regioselectivity, readily available and highly enantioenriched alcohol-based electrophile and excellent functional groups tolerance. Our study shows a π-allylnickel intermediate accounts for the regioselectivty. Chapter 5 describes a stereospecific Miyaura coupling of allylic <b>pivalates</b> with organodiboron reagents to afford highly enantioenriched α-chiral γ-alkyl/aryl allylic boronates. Notably, a significant solvent effect was observed. By the choice of solvent, either inversion or retention of stereochemistry can be selected. Under optimized conditions, either enantiomer was obtained from a single enantiomer of starting material. Overall, the main idea behind these methods was to develop non-precious metal-based catalysts, find mild conditions and use alcohol-based starting material.

40|$|The Suzuki-Miyaura {{cross-coupling}} {{is widely}} used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and organic light-emitting materials. Utilization of phenol derivatives in Suzuki-Miyaura coupling is economically, environmentally and synthetically desired. Nickel is less expensive, and more reactive than Pd in activation of inert C-Cl and C-O bonds. Replacing Pd catalysts with Ni in the borylation and cross-coupling of aryl halides and representative C-O based electrophiles provides inexpensive and efficient access to biaryl moieties. ^ In Chapter 2, the nickel catalyzed neopentylglycolborylation of ortho-substituted aryl halides was achieved by zero-valent metals accelerated NiCl 2 (dppp) /dppf mixed-ligand system. As {{a result of the}} fast borylation reaction, an enhancement of the yield of ortho- and para-substituted aryl halides catalyzed by nickel was achieved. ^ In Chapter 3, Ni(COD) 2 /PCy 3 catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl and heteroaryl mesylates and sulfamates with aryl and heteroaryl neopentylglycolboronates in THF at room temperature was discussed. Meanwhile, the efficiencies of six different phenol derivatives, namely mesylates, sulfamates, <b>pivalates,</b> carbamates, carbonates and methyl ethers were compared in four different nickel-based cross-coupling reaction conditions. Aryl mesylates and sulfamates were the most reactive under Ni(COD) 2 /PCy 3 /K 3 PO 4 /THF catalytic condition, producing quantitative yields. The conditions developed for cross-coupling of aryl <b>pivalates,</b> sulfamates, carbamates and carbonates with arylboronic acids are not efficient for cross-coupling with aryl neopentylglycolboronates. The efficiencies of four aryl-boron nucleophiles in the Ni-catalyzed coupling of aryl halides, mesylates and sulfamates were compared. Aryl-boronic acids are much more reactive than aryl neopentylglycolboronates in nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling in THF. Aryl neopentylglycolboronates were demonstrated to be more reactive and less expensive than currently used pinacol boronates and cross-couple quantitatively. ^ In Chapter 4, a bench stable and inexpensive NiIICl(1 -naphthyl) (PPh 3) 2 /PCy 3 mixed-ligand catalytic system was developed as a more accessible alternative to the air-sensitive Ni(COD) 2 /PCy 3 catalytic system.

40|$|Cross-coupling {{technology}} {{has become an}} indispensable tool for the rapid and efficient synthesis of complex molecules. Over {{the past few decades}} a foundational understanding of organometallic chemistry has been laid using palladium and other precious metals. Recent research on first row base metal catalysts such as nickel, cobalt and iron has uncovered new and complementary modes of reactivity compared to their more well-studied precious metal counterparts. While nickel sits one row above palladium on the periodic table, ongoing research has illustrated that nickel possesses a unique reactivity profile. Thus, while nickel is commonly thought of as a cheaper alternative to palladium, research in the field of nickel catalysis has demonstrated far more potential than this. The unique propensity of nickel to undergo single electron chemistry as well as its ability to break strong carbon oxygen bonds make research into nickel reactivity an immensely beneficial endeavor to the fields of inorganic, organometallic and synthetic organic chemistry. Chapter 1 describes the development of a stereospecific Suzuki coupling of benzylic carbamates and <b>pivalates</b> with aryl- and heteroarylboronic esters. The reaction proceeds with selective inversion or retention at the electrophilic carbon, depending on the identity of the ligand used. Tricyclohexylphosphine ligand provides products with retention of configuration at the electrophilic carbon, while an N-heterocyclic carbene ligand SIMes provides products with inversion. Chapter 2 discusses the development of a regio- and stereoselective nickel-catalyzed hydroarylation of alkynes using propargylic carbamates as directing groups. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions using arylboronic acids in the absence of base. A range of heterocycles and functional groups are tolerated under the reaction conditions. Additionally, the method is applied to the synthesis of tamoxifen. Chapter 3 details a nickel-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling reaction of benzylic esters and aryl halides. Both inter- and intramolecular variants proceed under mild reaction conditions. A range of heterocycles and functional groups are tolerated under the reaction conditions.

40|$|A preeminent goal {{of organic}} {{synthesis}} {{is to achieve}} structural complexity with functional value in a step, atom, and time economical fashion. Cycloadditions, as exemplified by the Diels-Alder reaction, represent uniquely powerful processes to achieve this goal. Most of widely-used cycloadditions require transition metal or organic catalysts to achieve the desired control of reactivity and selectivity, which rely on mechanistic understandings at the molecular level. Modern density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide the foundation to achieve such level of understanding, and my PhD research focuses on studying the mechanism and selectivities {{of a series of}} important transition-metal-catalyzed and organocatalytic cycloadditions through DFT calculations. The first part of the thesis includes my studies on the mechanism and selectivities of transition-metal-catalyzed cycloadditions. Chapter 1 focuses on the mechanism and origins of selectivities in Ru(II) -catalyzed intramolecular (5 + 2) cycloadditions and ene reactions of vinylcyclopropanes and alkynes. The favored mechanism involves an initial ene-yne oxidative cyclization to form a ruthenacyclopentene intermediate, which is different from that found earlier with rhodium catalysts. Based on this new mechanism, solvent effect, chemoselectivity, diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity are explained. Chapter 2 includes the study of mechanism and ligand-controlled selectivities in [Ni(NHC) ]-catalyzed intramolecular (5 + 2) cycloadditions and homo-ene reactions of vinylcyclopropanes and alkynes. The reaction mechanism of nickel catalysts {{is similar to that of}} ruthenium catalysts, which involves the alkyne-alkene cyclization to form a metallacyclopentene intermediate. The selectivity between the (5 + 2) and homo-ene products is determined in the subsequent competing reductive elimination and β-hydride elimination steps. The anisotropic steric environments of SIPr and ItBu ligands are the major reasons for the reversed selectivity of these two similar-sized ligands. Chapter 3 emphasizes the study of terminal methyl effects in Rh(I) -catalyzed intermolecular (5 + 2) cycloadditions of vinylcyclopropanes and allenes. A competitive allene dimerization is found to irreversibly sequester the rhodium catalyst. This explains the necessity of methyl substituents on the reacting double bond of allenes to achieve the desired cycloadditions. The second part of the thesis focuses on my studies of the organocatalyzed cycloadditions. Chapter 4 illustrates the explorations of the mechanism and controlling factors of the organocatalyzed carbonyl-olefin metathesis. In the (3 + 2) cycloadditions between hydrazonium and alkenes, the distortion of reactants controls the reactivities. In the subsequent cycloreversions, the strain-release of the five-membered ring intermediates determines the reaction barriers. For these two reasons, the cyclopropene derivatives are found to be the most reactive in experiments. Chapter 5 discusses the distortion-acceleration effect of alkynyl substituents in the stepwise hexadehydro-Diels-Aleder (HDDA) Reaction. The HDDA reaction follows a stepwise mechanism with a diradical intermediate. The alkynyl substituent dramatically accelerates the HDDA reaction mainly by decreasing the distortion energy required to achieve the diradical transition state. Chapter 6 focuses on the mechanism and selectivity of N-triflylphosphoramide catalyzed (3 + + 2) cycloaddition between hydrazones and alkenes. The protonation of hydrazones by Brønsted acid catalysts are found to be crucial for the facile (3 + + 2) cycloaddition. This explains the acidity-dependent catalytic activities of this reaction. Based on the mechanism, we have also explained the origins of enantioselectivities when a chiral N-triflylphosphoramide catalyst is employed. Chapter 7 includes the study of mechanism and origins of switchable chemoselectivity of Ni-catalyzed C(aryl) -O and C(acyl) -O activation of aryl esters with phosphine ligands. For aryl esters, nickel with bidentate phosphine ligands cleaves C(acyl) -O and C(aryl) -O bonds via three-centered transition states, and this cleavage favors the weak C(acyl) -O bond. However, when monodentate phosphine ligands are used, the five-centered C(aryl) -O cleavage transition state makes C(aryl) -O activation favorable. In the case of aryl <b>pivalates,</b> nickel with bidentate phosphine ligands still favors the C(acyl) -O activation, but the subsequent decarbonylation requires very high barrier and the alternative C(aryl) -O activation occurs...|$|R
