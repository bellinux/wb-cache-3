5|$|Some {{scientific}} {{studies suggest that}} ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling {{has the effect of}} intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex)</b> and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.|$|E

In {{images from the}} Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering. Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> the only known {{example of such a}} phenomenon in the Solar System.

5000|$|Odd {{structures}} {{known as}} polar vortices lie within the cold polar collars. They are giant hurricane-like storms four {{times larger than}} their terrestrial analogs. Each vortex has two [...] "eyes"—the centres of rotation, which are connected by distinct S-shaped cloud structures. Such double eyed structures are also called <b>polar</b> dipoles. <b>Vortexes</b> rotate with the period of about 3 days {{in the direction of}} general super-rotation of the atmosphere. The linear wind speeds are 35-50 m/s near their outer edges and zero at the poles. The temperature at the cloud-tops in the <b>polar</b> <b>vortexes</b> are much higher than in the nearby polar collars reaching 250 K (−23 °C). The conventional interpretation of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortexes</b> is that they are anticyclones with downwelling in the centre and upwelling in the cold polar collars. This type of circulation resembles the winter <b>polar</b> anticyclonic <b>vortexes</b> on Earth, especially the one found over Antarctica. The observations in the various infrared atmospheric windows indicate that the anticyclonic circulation observed near the poles may penetrate as deep as to 50 km altitude, i.e. {{to the base of the}} clouds. The polar upper troposphere and mesosphere are extremely dynamic; large bright clouds may appear and disappear over the space of a few hours. One such event was observed by Venus Express between 9 and 13 January 2007, when the south polar region became brighter by 30%. This event was probably caused by an injection of sulfur dioxide into the mesosphere, which then condensed forming a bright haze. The two eyes in the vortexes have yet to be explained.|$|R

25|$|The Antarctic {{ozone hole}} {{is an area}} of the Antarctic {{stratosphere}} in which the recent ozone levels have dropped to as low as 33 percent of their pre-1975 values. The ozone hole occurs during the Antarctic spring, from September to early December, as strong westerly winds start to circulate around the continent and create an atmospheric container. Within this <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> over 50 percent of the lower stratospheric ozone is destroyed during the Antarctic spring.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> formed over Antarctica is {{very tight}} and the {{reaction}} occurring {{on the surface of}} the cloud crystals is far different from when it occurs in atmosphere.

Based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data over the last 35 years and by using the NOAA HYSPLIT trajectory model, researchers showed that Erebus volcano gas emissions (including hydrogen chloride (HCl)) can reach the Antarctic stratosphere via high-latitude cyclones and then the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> Depending on Erebus volcano activity, the additional annual HCl mass entering the stratosphere from Erebus varies from 1.0 to 14.3 kt.|$|E
25|$|These polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) form during winter, in {{the extreme}} cold. Polar winters are dark, {{consisting}} of 3 months without solar radiation (sunlight). The lack of sunlight contributes to a decrease in temperature and the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> traps and chills air. Temperatures hover around or below −80°C.

This material and additional data of other stations are used to discuss the primary chemical origin of the spring time ozone depletion in connection with dynamically conditioned variations of ozone distribution in the southern polar stratosphere. A mean pattern featured by three typical time periods of the ozone depletion using the height-time variations of pronounced maxima of the vertical ozone distribution is drawn to localize the chemical active regionDuring spring in 1987 the ozone variations are discussed in more detail to separate different dynamical impacts like an irregular outflow of ozone into the troposphere and the control of vertical ozone distribution by dynamics of the southern <b>polar</b> stratospheric <b>vortex</b> itself.

The polar night jet moves at a greater height of about [...] than it does during the summer. During these dark months the air high over the poles becomes much colder than the air over the equator. This difference in temperature gives rise to extreme air pressure differences in the stratosphere, which, when combined with the Coriolis effect, create the polar night jets, that race eastward at an altitude of about [...] [...] The <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is circled by the polar night jet.

500|$|A polar, sub-polar, or Arctic cyclone (also {{known as}} a <b>polar</b> <b>vortex)</b> is a vast area of low {{pressure}} that strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer. A polar cyclone is a low-pressure weather system, usually spanning [...] to , in which the air circulates in a counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere, and a clockwise direction in the southern hemisphere. The Coriolis acceleration acting on [...] the air masses moving poleward at high altitude, causes a counterclockwise circulation at high altitude. The poleward movement of air originates from the air circulation of the Polar cell. The polar low is not driven by convection as are tropical cyclones, nor the cold and warm air mass interactions as are extratropical cyclones, but is an artifact of the global air movement of the Polar cell. The base of the polar low is in the mid to upper troposphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the polar cyclone has two centers on average. One center lies near Baffin Island and the other over northeast Siberia. In the southern hemisphere, it tends to be located {{near the edge of the}} Ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude. When the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is strong, its effect can be felt at the surface as a westerly wind (toward the east). When the polar cyclone is weak, significant cold outbreaks occur.|$|E

After all tropical eruptions the <b>polar</b> stratospheric <b>vortex</b> was intensified. The tropospheric anomaly patterns after tropical eruptions {{are very similar to}} those of winter months with a very strong stratospheric vortex, irrespective whether volcanically forced or not. Hence, if they have any effect on the wintertime tropospheric circulation, tropical eruptions seem to force a natural mode of the stratospheric winter circulation which is associated with a specific response of the tropospheric circulation with maximum amplitude over the North Atlantic and adjacent continental regions. Therefore, it remains difficult to give statistical evidence of volcanic impact on climate {{on the basis of the}} few observations after these rare events. A combination of observational studies and model experiments may help to overcome these difficulties in the future. (orig.)
