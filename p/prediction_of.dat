However, the agency reaffirmed its <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> an above-average season, citing warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures {{in parts of the}} Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea and the likelihood of La Niña conditions during the peak of the season.|$|E
5|$|One {{surprising}} <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> the permutation by duplication {{mechanism is}} that intermediate permutations can occur. For instance, the duplicated {{version of the}} protein should still be functional, since otherwise evolution would quickly select against such proteins. Likewise, partially duplicated intermediates where only one terminus was truncated should be functional. Such intermediates have been extensively documented in protein families such as DNA methyltransferases.|$|E

40|$|The Langley Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Royal Aircraft Establishment have {{undertaken}} a cooperative program {{to conduct an}} assessment of their patched viscous-inviscid interaction methods for predicting the transonic flow over nozzle afterbodies. The assessment was made by comparing the <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> the two methods with experimental pressure distributions and boattail pressure drag for several convergent circular-arc nozzle configurations. Comparisons <b>of</b> the <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> the two methods with the experimental data showed that both methods provided good <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> the flow characteristics of nozzles with attached boundary layer flow. The RAE method also provided reasonable <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> the pressure distributions and drag for the nozzles investigated that had separated boundary layers. The NASA method provided good <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> the pressure distribution on separated flow nozzles that had relatively thin boundary layers. However, the NASA method was in poor agreement with experiment for separated nozzles with thick boundary layers due primarily to deficiencies in the method used to predict the separation location...|$|R

5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E
