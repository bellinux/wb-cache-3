25|$|A {{standard}} tandem cell {{consists of}} one n-DSC and one p-DSC {{in a simple}} sandwich configuration with an intermediate electrolyte layer. n-DSC and p-DSC are connected in series, which implies that the resulting <b>photocurrent</b> will be controlled by the weakest photoelectrode, whereas photovoltages are additive. Thus, <b>photocurrent</b> matching {{is very important for}} the construction of highly efficient tandem pn-DSCs. However, unlike n-DSCs, fast charge recombination following dye-sensitized hole injection usually resulted in low photocurrents in p-DSC and thus hampered the efficiency of the overall device.|$|E
25|$|A {{photodiode}} is a p–n junction or PIN structure. When a photon {{of sufficient}} energy strikes the diode, it creates an electron-hole pair. This mechanism {{is also known}} as the inner photoelectric effect. If the absorption occurs in the junction's depletion region, or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the anode, and electrons toward the cathode, and a <b>photocurrent</b> is produced. The total current through the photodiode is the sum of the dark current (current that is generated in the absence of light) and the <b>photocurrent,</b> so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.|$|E

25|$|Dye sensitised {{solar cells}} {{operate as a}} photoanode (n-DSC), where <b>photocurrent</b> result from {{electron}} injection by the sensitized dye. Photocathodes (p-DSCs) operate in an inverse mode compared to the conventional n-DSC, where dye-excitation is followed by rapid electron transfer from a p-type semiconductor to the dye (dye-sensitized hole injection, instead of electron injection). Such p-DSCs and n-DSCs can be combined to construct tandem solar cells (pn-DSCs) and the theoretical efficiency of tandem DSCs is well beyond that of single-junction DSCs.|$|E

25|$|After 50 years, {{during which}} {{solid-state}} electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube, the photomultiplier remains {{a unique and}} important optoelectronic component. Perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts, electronically, as a nearly perfect current source, owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals. There is no Johnson noise associated with photomultiplier signal currents, {{even though they are}} greatly amplified, e.g., by 100 thousand times (i.e., 100dB) or more.

25|$|Although the dye {{is highly}} {{efficient}} at converting absorbed photons into free electrons in the TiO2, only photons {{absorbed by the}} dye ultimately produce current. The rate of photon absorption depends upon the absorption spectrum of the sensitized TiO2 layer and upon the solar flux spectrum. The overlap between these two spectra determines the maximum possible <b>photocurrent.</b> Typically used dye molecules generally have poorer absorption in the red part of the spectrum compared to silicon, which means that fewer of the photons in sunlight are usable for current generation. These factors limit the current generated by a DSSC, for comparison, a traditional silicon-based solar cell offers about 35 mA/cm2, whereas current DSSCs offer about 20 mA/cm2.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have found}} that using dyes {{comprising}} a perylenemonoimid (PMI) as the acceptor and an oligothiophene coupled to triphenylamine as the donor greatly improve the performance of p-DSC by reducing charge recombination rate following dye-sensitized hole injection. The researchers constructed a tandem DSC device with NiO on the p-DSC side and TiO2 on the n-DSC side. <b>Photocurrent</b> matching was achieved through adjustment of NiO and TiO2 film thicknesses to control the optical absorptions and therefore match the photocurrents of both electrodes. The energy conversion efficiency of the device is 1.91%, which exceeds the efficiency of its individual components, but is still much {{lower than that of}} high performance n-DSC devices (6%–11%). The results are still promising since the tandem DSC was in itself rudimentary. The dramatic improvement in performance in p-DSC can eventually lead to tandem devices with much greater efficiency than lone n-DSCs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this mode}} the diode is often reverse biased (with the cathode driven {{positive}} {{with respect to}} the anode). [...] This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction's capacitance. The reverse bias also increases the dark current without much change in the <b>photocurrent.</b> For a given spectral distribution, the <b>photocurrent</b> is linearly proportional to the illuminance (and to the irradiance).|$|E

40|$|This work {{systematically}} {{investigated the}} relationship between structure, morphology, photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photocatalytic (PC) properties of TiO 2 catalysts. A series of TiO 2 catalysts with various phase compositions (anatase-, brookite- and finally rutile-rich samples) and morphologies (1 D morphology, rhomboid nanoparticles (NPs) and flower-like assemblies of nanorods) were prepared by an acidic hydrothermal treatment of hydrogen titanate nanofibres (H-TNFs). The structures of the samples, such as crystal phase composition and their spatial distribution, were extensively characterised, and the samples were tested for photocatalytic degradation of ethanol. A strong correlation is found between PEC and PC properties. PEC measurements revealed that the brookite-rich samples generated high but unstable <b>photocurrents.</b> The anatase and rutile-rich samples showed good stability, but for the rutile-rich samples low <b>photocurrents</b> were detected due to the poor conductivity of this polymorph. In contrast, the sample containing 93. 2 % anatase and 6. 8 % brookite with elongated morphology not only showed the ability to generate high <b>photocurrents</b> but also maintained a stable photoresponse upon {{an extended period of}} time, because of its well-balanced bi-crystalline structure and elongated morphology.
