Hoffmann had previously published a number of conventional directmate Babsons, {{but this one is}} significant as it is the first cyclic Babson: rather than black promotions being matched by White, they are related in cyclic form: Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> queen means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> bishop, Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> bishop means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> rook, Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> rook means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> knight, and Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> knight means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> queen.|$|R

The division, which was untried in combat, was struck with a strong attack by several {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division's line. The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half, and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to Yongsan, <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> fight there.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius entered {{diplomatic}} relations with the Croats and Serbs in the Balkans. He tried to repair the schism in the Christian church {{in regard to the}} Monophysites, by <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> compromise doctrine called Monothelitism. The Church of the East (commonly called Nestorian) was also involved in the process. Eventually this project of unity was rejected by all sides of the dispute.|$|E

25|$|Most {{promoting}} pieces <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> {{piece that}} exists in the initial setup of the board.

However, while <b>an</b> eastern barbarian <b>promotes</b> to <b>a</b> lion on its first capturing move, it does not further <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> furious fiend on its second. Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of the}} game. This should be obvious from the game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|R
5|$|Innovation management: The {{value of}} the {{coordinating}} role of design in new product development has been well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> continuous learning process.|$|E
5|$|Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie {{canceled}} the yearly preseason matchup in Tampa, {{claiming that the}} Buccaneers approached the matchup with excessive intensity, resulting in Dolphin injuries.

30|$|Considering {{parts and}} {{components}} suppliers, we verify that imports from the ROW, EU, EA, LA, and North America <b>promoted</b> <b>an</b> {{increase in the}} sophistication of the final products traded inside Latin America. A 1 % increase in North American participation in the import basket composition, all ceteris paribus, <b>promotes</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.06 % {{in the quality of}} the intra-bloc export basket, while imports from EU <b>promoted</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.04 %, followed by increases of 0.02 % in the case of imports from LA or EA, and 0.01 % for the ROW. The second column reveals that imports just from LA and North America had a positive effect in the electric machinery sector, while the coefficients for imports from other regions are statistically insignificant. Increases of 1 % in imports from North America <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.07 % in the quality of final electric machinery intra-bloc export basket, while imports from LA <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.06 %. Transport equipment coefficients were all statistically insignificant. In the second half of Table  5, we verify similar results for the case of pooled machinery data. North American imports <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.1 % in the quality of the parts and components export basket, while imports from the EU and EA <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.04 % each. In column 5, the coefficients are slightly different, revealing that imports only from China <b>promote</b> <b>a</b> 0.04 % increase in the intra-bloc export basket of electric machinery parts and components, while imports from EA have a negative effect. Once again, transport equipment coefficients are statistically insignificant.|$|R
5|$|The design {{approaches}} of Monolith Soft have shifted over its lifetime, with early games such as Xenosaga and Baten Kaitos being distinguished by a narrative-heavy approach, while later titles have {{focused more on}} gameplay. The company's stated goals are to create projects with wide creative freedom and to allow younger developers to contribute to these projects. The company is also notable for its focus on <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> comfortable working environment with little to no overtime in contrast to the majority of other Japanese game developers, alongside collaborating with other studios and companies.|$|E

5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{professional}} wrestling performances, celebrity involvement {{has been a}} major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more hype and media attention for the event, in this way receiving more attraction to the event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E

Most of the projects were directed toward construction of roads, canals, and other projects to enhance the commercial appeal and economic viability of the state. During Jennings's second term the state government continued to support public improvements, with new road construction and expanded settlement into central Indiana. After Indianapolis became {{the site for the}} state's permanent capital in 1821 and new settlers arrived in the area, the Indiana General Assembly appropriated $100,000 for new road construction and improvements to some of the more important routes, but it was considerably short of the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|Mario & Sonic on the Wii and DS is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players can assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character while competing against the others in these events. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such as swinging a paddle. The DS version uses the stylus and button controls. Both games closely follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. Sega adopted the IOC's mission of <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> sporting spirit and its desire to interest young people in the Olympics by using its characters. Due to this atmosphere of competitive sportsmanship, Sega received approval by Nintendo to include Mario in the game with Sonic. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Raised a Catholic, Antoine {{worked as}} a coal miner in his youth, then as a steelworker, before {{performing}} his military service in 1866. After marrying Catherine in 1873, he moved several times for professional reasons. Deeply impressed by Allan Kardec's writings, he organized a spiritualist group in the 1890s. In 1893, {{the death of his}} son marked the definitive loss of his faith in Catholicism. In 1896, he explained his Spiritist views in a book, then discovered the gifts of healing. Quickly known as a healer, he gathered many followers, mainly among workers disappointed by Catholicism or medicine. In 1906, he broke with Spiritism and started a religion, then published three books outlining his doctrine and consecrated the first Antoinist temple. After his death in 1912, Catherine ensured the continuity of the religion, <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> centralized worship around the person of her husband and providing additional rules in the organization. When she died in 1940, some differences happened between the French and the Belgian temples.|$|E
