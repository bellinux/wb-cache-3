40|$|It is very {{important}} to be able to simulate axial piston pumps in order to under- stand its impact on the velocity, pressure and temperature of the lubricating oil in the pump. These variables have huge impact on the leakage in the lubricating gaps which is strongly related to the amount of power loss in the pump. This thesis main focus have been to further develop a in-house developed FSI (Fluid Structure Interacting model) software called CASPAR, which is developed by MAHA Fluid Power Research Center in order to calculate the velocity, pressure and temperature in an axial piston pump. This software has been further developed in three main research steps. One step was to develop a simplified and fast model that predicts the case temperature in an axial piston pump. The case temperature has previously been proven {{to have an impact on}} the power loss due to thermal deformation of the structure in the lubricating gaps. The calculated case temperature with this model should be used as a mixed boundary condition in the calculation tool CASPAR. The case temperature was previously taken from measurements. Measurements regarding the case temperature in an actual axial piston pump has been taken in order to analyze and validate the developed model for the case temperature. The behavior of the model has shown that the gap height is strongly influenced by the case temperature, hence the simplification to use constant gap heights in the lubricating gaps are not a valid approximation. Instead a further investigation has to be done and a recommendation to integrate the developed model with CASPAR, where both gap heights and leakage are calculated. CASPAR is divided into two parts, the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Module</b> and Gap Flow Module. These have been further developed in this thesis in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the calculations of axial piston pumps. This was done by using and merging previous versions of the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Module</b> in to one single version and to develop the possibility to simulate the three lubricating gaps in an axial piston pump simultaneously with the Gap Flow Module. The new single version of the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Module</b> is called the Coupled <b>Pressure</b> <b>Module</b> and it is now possible to run simulations while combining different models considering different physical effects. The simultaneous calculations of the lubri- cating gaps is called the Coupled Gap Flow Module. This has improved the time efficiency compared to independently calculated lubricating gaps. Friction forces are transmitted between the gaps in the way it is meant to be and the Coupled <b>Pressure</b> <b>Module</b> and Coupled Gap Flow Module is a part of the step against the development of the new version of CASPAR. The new version of CASPAR should be one improved version where more physics is included compared to the old versions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the instrumentation of a microfluidic analyzer enabling {{the characterization of}} single-cell biophysical properties, which includes seven key components: a microfluidic module, a <b>pressure</b> <b>module,</b> an imaging module, an impedance module, two LabVIEW platforms for instrument operation and raw data processing, respectively, and a Python code for data translation. Under {{the control of the}} LabVIEW platform for instrument operation, the <b>pressure</b> <b>module</b> flushes single cells into the microfluidic module with raw biophysical parameters sampled by the imaging and impedance modules and processed by the LabVIEW platform for raw data processing, which were further translated into intrinsic cellular biophysical parameters using the code developed in Python. Based on this system, specific membrane capacitance, cytoplasm conductivity, and instantaneous Young’s modulus of three cell types were quantified as 2. 76 ± 0. 57 μF/cm 2, 1. 00 ± 0. 14 S/m, and 3. 79 ± 1. 11 kPa for A 549 cells (ncell = 202); 1. 88 ± 0. 31 μF/cm 2, 1. 05 ± 0. 16 S/m, and 3. 74 ± 0. 75 kPa for 95 D cells (ncell = 257); 2. 11 ± 0. 38 μF/cm 2, 0. 87 ± 0. 11 S/m, and 5. 39 ± 0. 89 kPa for H 460 cells (ncell = 246).

40|$|Pressure {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters measured when testing models in wind tunnels. For models tested in the cryogenic environment of the National Transonic Facility at NASA Langley Research Center, the technique of utilizing commercially available multichannel <b>pressure</b> <b>modules</b> inside the models is difficult due to the small internal volume of the models and the requirement of keeping the <b>pressure</b> transducer <b>modules</b> within an acceptable temperature range well above the - 173 degrees C tunnel temperature. A prototype multichannel <b>pressure</b> transducer <b>module</b> has been designed and fabricated with stable, repeatable sensors and materials optimized for reliable performance in the cryogenic environment. The module has 16 single crystal silicon piezoresistive pressure sensors electrostatically bonded to a metalized Pyrex substrate for sensing the wind tunnel model pressures. An integral temperature sensor mounted on each silicon micromachined pressure sensor senses real-time temperature fluctuations to within 0. 1 degrees C to correct for thermally induced non-random sensor drift. The data presented here are from a prototype sensor module tested in the 0. 3 M cryogenic tunnel and thermal equilibrium conditions in an environmental chamber which approximates the thermal environment (- 173 degrees C to + 60 degrees C) of the National Transonic Facility...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronically}} scanned pressure (ESP) {{measurement system}} concept {{was selected for}} application at the Langley Research Center's National Transonic Facility.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} the approaches and methods selected in fabrication of a carbon composite demonstration {{structure for the}} Composite Crew Module (CCM) Program. The program is managed by the NASA Safety and Engineering Center with participants from ten NASA Centers and AFRL. Multiple aerospace contractors are participating in the design development, tooling and fabrication effort as well. The goal {{of the program is}} to develop an agency wide design team for composite habitable spacecraft. The specific goals for this development project are: a). To gain hands on experience in design, building and testing a composite crew module. b) To validate key assumptions by resolving composite spacecraft design details through fabrication and testing of hardware. This abstract is based on Preliminary Design data [...] The final design will continue to evolve through the fall of 2007 with fabrication mostly completed by conference date. From a structures perspective, the. CCM {{can be viewed as a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>module</b> with variable pressure time histories and a series of both impact and quasi-static, high intensity point, line, and area distributed loads. The portion of the overall space vehicle being designed and. fabricated by the CCM team is just the <b>pressure</b> <b>module</b> and primary loading points. The heaviest point loads are applied and distributed to the <b>pressure</b> <b>module</b> at. an aluminum Service Module/Alternate Launch Abort System (SM/ALAS) fittings and at Main and Drogue Chute fittings. Significant line loads with metal to metal impact is applied at. the Lids ring. These major external point and line loads as well as pressure impact loads (blast and water landing) are applied to the lobed floor though the reentry shield and crushable materials. The <b>pressure</b> <b>module</b> is divided into upper and lower. shells that mate together with a bonded belly band splice joint to create the completed structural assembly. The benefits of a split CCM far outweigh the risks of a joint. These benefits include lower tooling cost and less manufacturing risk. Assembly of the top and bottom halves of the pressure shell will allow access to the interior of the shell throughout remaining fabrication sequence and can also potentially permit extensive installation of equipment and. crew facilities prior to final assembly of the two shell halves. A Pi pre-form is a woven carbon composite material which is provided in pre-impregnated form and frozen for long term storage. The cross-section shape allows the top of the pi to be bonded to a flat or curved surface with a second flat plate composite section bonded between two upstanding legs of the Pi. One of the regions relying on the merits of the Pi pre-form is the backbone. All connections among plates of the backbone structure, including the upper flanges, and to the lobe base of the pressure shell are currently joined by Pi pre-forms. The intersection of backbone composite plates is formed by application of two Pi pre-forms, top flanges and lobed surfaces are bonded with one Pi pre-form. The process of applying the pre-impregnated pi-preform will be demonstrated to include important steps like surface preparation, forming, application of pressure dams, vacuum bagging for consolidation, and curing techniques. Chopped carbon fiber tooling was selected over other traditional metallic and carbon fiber tooling. The requirement of schedule and cost economy for a moderate reuse cure tool warranted composite tooling options. Composite tooling schedule duration of 18 weeks compared favorably against other metallic tooling including invar tooling. Composite tooling also shows significant cost savings over low CTE metallic options. The composite tooling options were divided into two groups and the final decision was based on the cost, schedule, tolerance, temperature, and reuse requirements...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{potential}} and {{capability of the}} qNano instrument, a nanoparticle analysis research instrument developed by IZON Science Ltd. The qNano operates {{on the basis of}} the Scanning Ion Occlusion Spectroscopy (SIOS) technology which is similar to the Coulter technique also known as resistive pulse sensing. This coupled with an adjustable nanopore and IZON’s recently developed Variable <b>Pressure</b> <b>Module</b> (VPM) makes qNano a versatile nanoparticle analysis apparatus. In this study the potential of the instrument to detect inorganic and metal nanoparticles is explored. Polystyrene, silica, gold, silver, and magnetic nanoparticles have been used in this research to better understand the system and its components and to discover the capacity of the instrument to detect these particles. Using polystyrene nanoparticles, it was found that the adjustable nanopore exhibit membrane softening and follows the Mullins effect. Each of the apertures also possesses a characteristic window of operation, which refers to a range of stretch setting for accurate particle detection. The adjustable nanopore also allows for sizing particles with different diameters. The effect of surface functionality in the signal output was also investigated. Gold nanoparticles were synthesized via the citrate reduction method and the study of gold nanoparticles suspended in IZON’s standard buffer solution was looked into in depth. It was found that the gold nanoparticles aggregate in the buffer solution due to the presence of potassium chloride (KCl) salt which screens the electrostatic stabilization provided by the citrate ions. Silver nanoparticles show similar aggregation. With the concentration of gold and KCl remaining constant, resistive pulses caused by gold aggregates were detected after a period of three hours. Varying the concentration of gold nanoparticles shows that larger aggregates are formed as opposed to small aggregates with higher population. Identification of different types of particles present in a solution is yet to be achieved at this stage. Silica and magnetic nanoparticles were studied briefly. Successful measurements of magnetic particles were achieved with the aid of the <b>pressure</b> <b>module.</b> However, aggregates of magnetic particles were also formed and can be seen with the naked eye after solution was left standing overnight. Casein stabilized silica particles shows erratic current readings as the ethanol used in fabricating the silica particles collapse the casein micelle structure thus making the stabilization by casein void. Overall, this thesis has shown the qNano instrument’s ability in detecting nanoparticles other than biological molecules. This thesis also shows the potential of qNano as a versatile research instrument. The prospect of further research using this instrument is tremendous especially in characterising in greater detail inorganic and metal nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|A nonintrusive high angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing (HI-FADS) {{system was}} {{installed}} and flight-tested on the F- 18 high alpha research flight vehicle. The {{system is a}} matrix of 25 pressure orifices in concentric circles on {{the nose of the}} vehicle. The orifices determine angles of attack and sideslip, Mach number, and pressure altitude. Pressure was transmitted from the orifices to an electronically scanned <b>pressure</b> <b>module</b> by lines of pneumatic tubing. The HI-FADS system was calibrated and demonstrated using dutch roll flight maneuvers covering large Mach, angle-of-attack, and sideslip ranges. Reference airdata for system calibration were generated by a minimum variance estimation technique blending measurements from two wingtip airdata booms with inertial velocities, aircraft angular rates and attitudes, precision radar tracking, and meteorological analyses.

Flight test results used all 25 orifices or used a subset of 9 orifices. Under moderate maneuvering conditions, the HI-FADS system gave excellent results over the entire subsonic Mach number range up to 55 deg angle of attack.

40|$|AbstractA WDNetXL <b>Pressure</b> Control <b>module</b> {{to support}} {{planning}} and real-time functioning analysis of Remote Real Time Control (RRTC) devices is here presented. RRTC devices allow the optimal background leakage reduction by maintaining a constant value of pressures into the network. In fact, RRTC devices tune their action (e. g., opening degree of a shutter) by maintaining a target pressure value at the hydraulically critical control node. The key {{idea is that}} the pressure variation at critical node is influenced by the water distribution network behavior over time and, then, the RTTC devices are modulated accordingly. The communication technologies allow the real-time transfer of pressure readings from remote/critical nodes to PLC units driving the devices. Furthermore, the WDNetXL <b>Pressure</b> Control <b>module</b> allows the simulation of three different control strategies of the RRTC PCVs in order to select the best one for the specific WDN and accounting for the actual pressure/flow measurements available at the device...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimentally}} validated {{theoretical model}} {{was developed to}} investigate the influence of operating conditions {{on the performance of}} a multi-tube membrane module containing cobalt oxide silica (COxS) membranes with molecular sieving properties. The model investigated the separation process for a binary gas mixture consisting of H and Ar at 400 °C. Engineering parameters such as feed flow rate, feed <b>pressure,</b> <b>module</b> size and flow configuration were systematically varied in order to optimise the separation performance promoting three main goals: H yield, H purity and H recovery. Changing these parameters led to different flows and H fractions in the feed domain, thus altering the driving forces for the preferential permeation of H. The simulated results suggest that gas separation was greatly improved by reducing the module radius which meets all of the three aforementioned optimisation criteria. Interestingly, increasing the feed flow rate and feed pressure were found to be beneficial but the former led to lower H recovery whilst the latter did not deliver the same purity when compared to lower feed pressure. In addition, two flow configurations, counter-current and co-current, were compared. It was observed that the results of counter-current were effectively the same as the co-current. This was attributed to the high gas-through-gas diffusion for high-temperature membrane operation. Finally, neglecting diffusion effects, or considering advection only, leads to over prediction of H permeate molar fraction...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{mechanisms}} underlying sleep spindles (~ 11 - 15 Hz; > 0. 5 s) help {{to protect}} sleep. With age, it becomes {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain sleep at a challenging time (e. g. daytime), even after sleep loss. This study compared spindle characteristics during daytime recovery and nocturnal sleep in young and middle-aged adults. In addition, we explored whether spindles characteristics in baseline nocturnal sleep {{were associated with the}} ability to maintain sleep during daytime recovery periods in both age groups. Methods: Twenty-nine young (15 women and 14 men; 27. 3 ± 5. 0) and 31 middle-aged (19 women and 13 men; 51. 6 y ± 5. 1) healthy subjects participated in a baseline nocturnal sleep and a daytime recovery sleep after 25 hours of sleep deprivation. Spindles were detected on artefact-free NREM sleep epochs. Spindle density (nb/min), amplitude (μV), frequency (Hz) and duration (s) were analyzed on parasagittal (linked-ears) derivations. Results: In young subjects, spindle frequency increased during daytime recovery sleep as compared to baseline nocturnal sleep in all derivations, whereas middle-aged subjects showed spindle frequency enhancement only in the prefrontal derivation. No other significant interaction between age group and sleep condition was observed. Spindle density for all derivations and centro-occipital spindle amplitude decreased whereas prefrontal spindle amplitude increased from baseline to daytime recovery sleep in both age groups. Finally, no significant correlation was found between spindle characteristics during baseline nocturnal sleep and the marked reduction in sleep efficiency during daytime recovery sleep in both young and middle-aged subjects. Conclusion: These results suggest that the interaction between homeostatic and circadian <b>pressure</b> <b>module</b> spindle frequency differently in aging.

40|$|Objective 1 : To {{evaluate}} the Datex Ohmeda GE S/ 5 Non Invasive Blood <b>Pressure</b> <b>module</b> {{in comparison to}} the standard invasive arterial blood pressure (IABP) technique in anaesthetized dogs. Objective 2 : To determine optimal cuff position and site for the noninvasive system on the patient. Objective 3 : To assess the effect of different anesthetic protocols (methadone-isoflurane, dexmedetomidine-propofol and dexmedetomidine-alfaxalone) on the performance of the Datex Ohmeda GE S/ 5. Study design: A prospective study. Animals: Thirty-two client owned dogs undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. Methods: Three different anesthetic protocols were used. Invasive blood pressure was measured using either the femoral or dorsal pedal artery. For oscillometric noninvasive blood pressure (O-NIBP) measurement, the cuff was placed at the contra lateral limb during the surgical procedure when possible, otherwise the tail base was used. Recordings were made pre-, per- and post operative. The tail base and front limb O-NIBP measurements were continued post operatively. Statistical analysis of the Invasive Arterial Blood Pressure (IABP) and O-NIBP data was performed using a (modified, percentual) Bland Altman analysis. An ANOVA was used to compare the different protocols. Result 1 : The Datex Ohmeda GE S/ 5 O-NIBP produced highly variable results for all blood pressure measurements. The least variable results came from the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) for all measurement-sites. Result 2 : The most reliable site for O-NIBP measurements is the tail base followed by the hind limb. The front limb is less accurate. Result 3 : The number of failures in order to obtain a direct reading in the Datex O-NIBP were higher in the dexmedetomidine protocols. Bias itself did not differ between the protocols. Conclusion 1 & 2 : The most accurate data produced by the Datex O-NIBP was the MAP. The optimal site for cuff placement was the tail base. However, due to the high variability of all values {{it is difficult to determine}} whether the machine is producing accurate (e. g. unbiased) results. It should be noted that trend information (multiple consecutive measurements) gathered with the Datex O-NIBP can be useful. However sudden drops or increases of O-NIBP do not necessarily indicate that the anesthesia is insufficient, as it could also be accounted for by the variability of the O-NIBP. Conclusion 3 : Anesthetic protocols do influences the number of failures to provide direct measurement. This is most likely related to the use of dexmedetomidine (a 2 -agonist) which causes vasoconstriction. This vasoconstriction is the likely culprit for the increased failure to provide direct measurements with the Datex O-NIBP. Clinical relevance: The Datex Ohmeda GE S/ 5 can not be used on patients that need accurate blood pressure monitoring because of high anesthetic risks (ASA-III or up). In cases where placement of the arterial catheter-system for the IABP fails and patients in ASA-I and ASA-II (where protocols usually don’t include measurement of the arterial blood pressure (ABP)) it can be used to get information on the arterial blood pressure trend. In these before mentioned situations, the MAP is shown to be the most reliable...|$|E
40|$|Design and {{fabrication}} cost {{drivers for}} cryogenic transonic wind tunnel models are defined. The major cost factors for wind tunnel models are model complexity, tolerances, surface finishes, materials, material validation, and model inspection. The cryogenic temperatures {{require the use}} of materials with relatively high fracture toughness {{but at the same time}} high strength. Some of these materials are very difficult to machine, requiring extensive machine hours which can add significantly to the manufacturing costs. Some additional engineering costs are incurred to certify the materials through mechanical tests and nondestructive evaluation techniques, which are not normally required with conventional models. When instrumentation such as accelerometers and electronically scanned <b>pressure</b> <b>modules</b> is required, temperature control of these devices needs to be incorporated into the design, which requires added effort.

The <b>pressure</b> power generation <b>module</b> has the advantages that the <b>pressure</b> power generation <b>module</b> is simple and reasonable in structure and flexible in operation, mechanical energy generated during walking of people is collected to be converted into electric energy which is directly supplied to lighting appliances, and thereby power consumed by public places or commercial buildings can be effectively saved...|$|R
40|$|During the construction, {{installation}} and initial {{operation of the}} Evaporative Cooling System for the ATLAS Inner Detector SCT Barrel Sub-detector, some performance characteristics were observed to be inconsistent with the original design specifications, therefore the assumptions made in the ATLAS Inner Detector TDR were revisited. The main concern arose because of unexpected pressure drops in the piping system {{from the end of}} the detector structure to the distribution racks. The author of this theses made a series of measurements of these pressure drops and the thermal behavior of SCT-Barrel cooling Stave. Tests were performed on the installed detector in the pit, and using a specially assembled full scale replica in the SR 1 laboratory at CERN. This test setup has been used to perform extensive tests of the cooling performance of the system including measurements of pressure drops in different parts of system, studies of the thermal profile along the stave pipe for different running conditions / parameters and coolant flow measurements in the system. The pressure drops in the system and the associated temperatures in the barrel cooling loops have been studied as a function of the system variables, for example; input liquid pressure, vapour back <b>pressure,</b> <b>module</b> power load and input liquid temperature. Measurements were performed with 10, 11, 12, 13 barabs inlet liquid pressure in system, 1. 2, 1. 6, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0, 6. 0 barabs vapour back pressure in system, and 0 W, 3 W, 6 W, 9 W, 10. 5 W power applied per silicon module. The measurements clearly show that the cooling system can not achieve the design evaporation temperature of - 25 C in every part of the detector (SCT Barrel loops) in case of 13 barabs nominal inlet liquid pressure, 1. 2 barabs minimum possible back pressure and 6 W nominal power per SCT Barrel silicon module and especially at the end of the ATLAS ID operation period when modules will work on full power of 10. 5 W. This will lead to the problem of thermal run-away of the ATLAS SCT, especially near the end of the operational period after significant radiation exposure has occurred. The LHC luminosity profile, depletion voltage and leakage current values and the total power dissipated from the modules were revised. Thermal runaway limits for the ATLAS SCT sub-detector were also revised. Results show that coolants evaporation temperature necessary for the sub-detector's safe operation over the full lifetime (10 years) is - 15 C with a safety factor of 2. Laboratory measurements clearly show that the cooling system can not achieve even this necessary evaporation temperature of - 15 C. It is now impossible to make mechanical modifications to the cooling system, for example; changing the diameter of the cooling pipes, or the thermal performance of the in-system heat exchanger or reducing the vapour back pressure. It was therefore decided to investigate changes to the cooling fluid and to test mixtures of Hexafluoroethane (R 116) C 2 F 6 and Octafluoropropane(R 218) C 3 F 8 at differing ratios instead of just pure C 3 F 8 coolant presently used. For this purpose, a new "blending" machine was assembled in the SR 1 laboratory, with a new device an "on-line acoustic flow meter and fluorocarbon coolant mixture analyzer" (Sonar Analyzer) attached to it. The Machines were connected to the already existing laboratory test station and new extensive tests were performed to investigate different proportion of C 3 F 8 /C 2 F 6 blends to find the mixture ratio which resulted in the best operational performance as measured by: the temperature distribution, pressure drops and flow parameters over the system, to ensure best cooling performance of SCT Barrel cooling loops for long term ATLAS SCT operation. Measurements were performed with different percentage of C 2 F 6 (1...|$|E
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{will be the}} largest, highest power {{spacecraft}} {{placed in}} orbit. Because of this {{the design of the}} electrical power system diverged markedly from previous systems. The solar arrays will operate at 160 V and the power distribution voltage will be 120 V. The structure is grounded to the negative side of the solar arrays so under the right circumstances it is possible to drive the ISS potential very negative. A plasma contactor has been added to the ISS to provide control of the ISS structure potential relative to the ambient plasma. The ISS requirement is that the ISS structure not be greater than 40 V positive or negative of local plasma. What are the ramifications of operating large structures with such high voltage power systems? The application of a plasma contactor on ISS controls the potential between the structure and the local plasma, preventing degrading effects. It is conceivable that there can be situations where the plasma contactor might be non-functional. This might be due to lack of power, the need to turn it off during some of the build-up sequences, the loss of functionality for both plasma contactors before a replacement can be installed, similar circumstances. A study was undertaken to understand {{how important it is to}} have the contactor functioning and how long it might be off before unacceptable degradation to ISS could occur. The details of interaction effects on spacecraft have not been addressed until driven by design. This was true for ISS. If the structure is allowed to float highly negative impinging ions can sputter exposed conductors which can degrade the primary surface and also generate contamination due to the sputtered material. Arcing has been known to occur on solar arrays that float negative of the ambient plasma. This can also generate electromagnetic interference and voltage transients. Much of the ISS structure and <b>pressure</b> <b>module</b> surfaces exposed to space is anodized aluminum. The anodization thickness is very thin to provide the required solar absorptance and emittance. For conditions where ISS structure can charge negative a large percentage of the array voltage, the dielectric strength of this layer is low, and dielectric breakdown (arcing) can occur. The energy stored capacitively in the structure can be delivered to the arc. The mechanisms by which this energy is delivered and how much of the energy is available hasn't been fully quantified. Questions have been raised regarding the possibility of whether a sustained arc might result due to current collected by the solar arrays from local plasma. It was postulated that even if dielectric breakdown didn't occur, impacts due to micrometeoroids and space debris could penetrate thin layers of dielectric on ISS and initiate an arc due to the coupling provided by the dense local plasma produced by the impact. This was proven in experiments conducted jointly by MSFC and Auburn University. A target chamber with a simulated ionospheric plasma and a biased, anodized aluminum plate and a 1 -microfarad capacitor was used. The plate was then impacted by 75 -micron particles accelerated to orbital velocity. Arc discharges were sustained for higher voltages but a threshold appears below which no discharge was initiated. Most items without an exposed power system will float electrically near the local plasma potential. This is true of the Space Shuttle, an Astronaut on EVA, and similar items. The structure of ISS might be at a large negative voltage. Therefore, capacitively stored energy can be transferred during docking, installing external boxes and equipment and Astronaut contact with ISS structure. The circumstances of when this can happen and the resulting effects are evaluated in this study. Also, a crewmember on EVA might be in the vicinity of an arc. All safety aspects of such an encounter including charging, molten particles from the arc site and EMI have been evaluated. This paper will report on the total results of this study focussed on the 4 A configuration, scheduled to be complete in November, 2000. Interactions such as arcing, debris induced arcs, sustained arcs, sputtering, contamination from sputtering and arcing, docking interactions and Astronaut safety issues will all be addressed...|$|E

40|$|A {{collection}} of experimental data {{acquired in the}} NASA low-speed multistage axial compressor while operated in rotating stall is presented in this paper. The compressor was instrumented with high-response wall <b>pressure</b> <b>modules</b> and a static pressure disc probe for in-flow measurement, and a split-fiber probe for simultaneous measurements of velocity magnitude and flow direction. The data acquired to-date have indicated that a single fully developed stall cell rotates about the flow annulus at 50. 6 % of the rotor speed. The stall phenomenon is substantially periodic at a fixed frequency of 8. 29 Hz. It was determined that the rotating stall cell extends throughout the entire compressor, primarily in the axial direction. Spanwise distributions of the instantaneous absolute flow angle, axial and tangential velocity components, and static pressure acquired behind the first rotor are presented {{in the form of}} contour plots to visualize different patterns in the outer (midspan to casing) and inner (hub to mid-span) flow annuli during rotating stall. In most of the cases observed, the rotating stall started with a single cell. On occasion, rotating stall started with two emerging stall cells. The root cause of the variable stall cell count is unknown, but is not attributed to operating procedures...|$|R
