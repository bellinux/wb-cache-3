5000|$|Monod {{starts off}} chapter I {{entitled}} [...] "Of Strange Objects" [...] with {{a consideration of}} the difference between natural and artificial objects and states that [...] "the basic premise of the scientific method... is that nature is objective and not projective"(Monod, 3). Through a series of thought experiments and rhetorical questions he leads the reader on a difficult path to three characteristics of living beings. One is teleonomy which Monod defines as the characteristic of being [...] "endowed with a purpose or project"(Monod, 9). Another is autonomous morphogenesis which points out that a living being’s structure results from interactions within the being as opposed to the external forces that shape artificial artifacts. Monod offers a single exception to this last criterion {{in the form of a}} crystal and at this point he states that the internal forces that determine structure within living beings are [...] "of the same nature as the microscopic interactions responsible for crystalline morphologies"(Monod, 11), a theme that he promises to develop in later chapters. The last general property Monod offers up as distinguishing living organisms is reproductive invariance which is the ability of a living being to reproduce and transmit the information corresponding to their own highly ordered structure. The author defines the primary telonomic project [...] "as consisting in the transmission from generation to generation of the invariance content characteristic of the species"(Monod, 14) (the preservation and multiplication of the species). Monod later retracts autonomous morphogenesis (spontaneous structuration) as a property of living beings and says instead that it should be thought of as [...] "mechanism" [...] leaving two essential properties of living beings: reproductive invariance and structural teleonomy. He then brings up and defends against a possible thermodynamic objection to reproductive invariance and points out the extreme efficiency of the teleonomic apparatus in accomplishing the preservation and reproduction of the structure. Here the author restates that nature is objective and does not pursue an end or have a purpose and he points out an apparent [...] "epistemological study of the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge contradiction" [...] between the teleonomic character of living organisms and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity.</b> With that cliffhanger of internal intellectual struggle Monod ends chapter one.|$|E
50|$|The {{last chapter}} {{in the book is}} “The Kingdom and the Darkness”. Once man {{extended}} his domain over the subhuman sphere and dominated his environment the main threat became other men and tribal warfare came to be an important evolutionary selection factor and this would favor group cohesion. Cultural evolution affected physical evolution; “it is behavior that orients selective pressure” (Monod, 162). The author then says that due to the accelerating pace of cultural evolution, it no longer affects the genome and that selection does not favor the genetic survival of the fittest through a more numerous progeny. He brings up statistics that show a negative correlation between intelligence and the average number of children per couple and a positive correlation of intelligence between spouses which concentrates them among a shrinking elite. He also points to scientific and ethical advances that have allowed “genetic cripples” to live and reproduce (the author regards this as suspending natural selection). Monod says this suspension of natural selection is a peril to the species but that it will take quite a while for any serious effects and that there are more urgent dangers in modern society. He advances the idea “that nature is objective, that the systematic confronting of logic and experience is the sole source of true knowledge” (Monod, 165). He talks briefly about how ideas are selected based on the performance value and the spreading power (he states that ideas that explain man by assigning him a destiny spread the most). The author believes that we contain an inborn genetic need to search out the meaning of existence and that is responsible for the creation of myths, religion, and philosophy. He implies that this genetic component accounts for religion being the base of social structure and the reoccurrence of the same essential form in myths, religion, and philosophy. He admits that the idea of objective knowledge as the only source of truth may seem austere and unattractive in that it does not provide an explanation that will calm the anxiety of man; “It wrote an end to the ancient animist covenant between man and nature, leaving nothing in place of that precious bond but an anxious quest in a frozen universe of solitude” (Monod, 170). The author points to what he sees as the acceptance of objective science in practice but not in spirit. He says that the important message of science is that in the defining of a new source of truth which demands revision of ethical premises and a total break with the animist tradition. Our values are rooted in animism and are at odds with objective knowledge and truth. This jarring and isolating revelation places value judgments within the hands of man himself. Monod believes that objective truth and the theory of values cannot be separated “because the very definition of “true” knowledge reposes in the final analysis upon an ethical postulate” (Monod, 173). It is at this point that author’s argument turns upon itself by admitting that making objectivity the condition for true knowledge, which helps to separate value judgments from true knowledge and define science, is itself an axiomatic ethical choice. By asserting the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity,</b> which is accepted in modern science, one is choosing to adhere to what Monod calls the ethic of knowledge. The author proposes that man should rise above his need for explanation and fear of solitude to accept the ethic of knowledge and frames this ethic as accepting both the animal and ideal in man.Jacques Monod ends the book with his fundamental conclusion that “The ancient covenant is in pieces; man knows at last that he is alone in the universe's unfeeling immensity, out of which he emerged only by chance. His destiny is nowhere spelled out, nor is his duty. The kingdom above or the darkness below; it is for him to choose” (Monod, 180).|$|E
5000|$|In chapter two [...] "Vitalisms and Animisms" [...] Monod {{states that}} {{invariance}} must have preceded teleonomy, a conclusion {{reached by the}} Darwinian idea that teleonomic structures are due to variations in structures that already had the property of invariance and could therefore preserve the effects of chance mutations. He offers the selective theory as being consistent with the postulate of objectivity and allowing for epistemological coherence. The author then {{says that in the}} rest of the chapter he will address religious ideologies and philosophical systems that assume the reverse hypothesis: that invariance developed out of an initial teleonomic principle (this defies the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity).</b> He divides these theories into vitalist, in which the teleonomic principle operates only in living matter (there is a purpose/direction in which living things alone develop), and animist, in which there is a universal teleonomic principle (that is expressed more intensely in the biosphere and therefore living beings are seen as products of universally oriented evolution which has culminated in mankind). Monod admits he is more interested in animism and will therefore devote more analysis to it. He briefly discuses the murky metaphysical vitalism of Henri Bergson and then discusses the scientific vitalism of Elsasser and Polanyi which contend that physical forces and chemical interactions that have been studied in non-living matter do not fully account for invariance and teleonomy and therefore other [...] "biotonic laws" [...] are at work in living matter. The author points out that the scientific vitalist argument lacks support and that it draws its justification not from knowledge or observations but from our present day lack of knowledge. He goes on to point out that today the mechanism of invariance is sufficiently understood to the point that no non-physical principle ("biotonic law") is needed for its interpretation. Monod next points out that our ancestors had a history of animating objects by giving spirits to them so as to bridge the apparent gap between the living and non-living. To them a being made sense and was understandable only through the purpose animating the being and so if mysterious objects, such as rocks, rivers, rain, and stars, exist it must also be for a purpose (essentially there are no inanimate objects to them). The author says that this animist belief is due to a projection of man's awareness of his own teleonomic functioning onto inanimate nature. Nature is explained with the same conscious and purposive manner as human activity. Monod points out that this animist line of thought is still present in philosophy that makes no essential distinction between matter and life and frames biological evolution as a component of cosmic evolution (evolutive force operating throughout the entire universe). He contends that these lines of thought abandon the postulate of objectivity and also contain the anthropocentric illusion. At the end of this chapter Monod states that the thesis he [...] "shall present in this book is that the biosphere does not contain a predictable class of objects or of events but constitutes a particular occurrence, compatible indeed with first principles, but not deducible from those principles and therefore essentially unpredictable" [...] (Monod, 43). In his view the biosphere is unpredictable for the same reason that the particular configuration of atoms in a pebble are unpredictable. By this Monod does not mean to imply that the biosphere is not explicable from initial conditions/first principles but that it is not deducible (at best predictions could be no more than statistical probabilities of existence). He then points out that society is willing to accept a universal theory that is compatible with but does not foresee the particular configuration of atoms in a pebble but it is a different story when it comes to humans; [...] "We would like to think ourselves necessary, inevitable, ordained from all eternity. All religions, nearly all philosophies, and even a part of science testify to the unwearying, heroic effort of mankind desperately denying its own contingency" [...] (Monod, 44). It is this contingency of human existence that is the central message of Chance and Necessity; that life arose by chance and all beings of life, including humans, are the products of natural selection.|$|E

40|$|In {{classical}} Continuum Mechanics, <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Objectivity</b> {{requires that}} balance laws and constitutive equations must be form-invariant {{with respect to}} rigid motions of the spatial frame of reference. Any tensorial quantity {{is said to be}} objective if it obeys the appropriate tensor transformation law. Quantities such as temperature and stress tensor are known to be objective. In Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, which is a prevalent numerical method in nanoscience on atomistic basis, <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Objectivity</b> was rarely discussed. This research explores the objectivity issue in the classical MD by examining the governing equation and constitutive equation. It can be shown that the interatomic potential and the corresponding interatomic force are objective because they are determined by relative atomic positions, which are objective. On the other hand, velocity and relative velocity are not objective. As a consequence, quantities such as temperature and Virial stress that are calculated based on apparent atomic velocities are not objective. Therefore, multiphysics body forces generated by these nonobjective quantities are not objective either. This becomes problematic when the system or subsystem is described in a noninertial reference frame, i. e., the reference frame undergoes acceleration or rotation. To resolve this deficiency, this research proposes the theory of Objectivity Incorporated MD. With the adoption of an objective form of velocity, the objectivity of temperature and Virial stress are restored. The theory also requires all kinds of body forces to be objective so that the constitutive equation well satisfies the <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Objectivity.</b> The theory further supplements the governing equation with fictitious force, which accounts for the motion of reference frame, so that MD simulation can be extended to noninertial reference frame.

This article highlights some aspects of and perspectives on the prosecutor’s role and raises some central questions regarding the prosecutor’s obligation to objectivity according to the case-law of the ECtHR.     The fundamental duty to act objectively is first of all crucial for the prosecutor’s role as the protector of human rights, because prosecutors’ objectivity and independence is an integrated element of the state’s human rights obligations (the positive obligation to conduct an “effective official investigation” and right to an “effective” domestic remedy). ECtHR’s case-law has a strong focus on the objectivity of police and prosecutors, and the court has performed a thorough examination of several aspects of this obligation.     The prosecutor’s duty to act objectively is further elaborated in connection with aspects of the law on evidence, especially regarding the collection of evidence, the evaluation of evidence, evidentiary standards, and the prosecution's burden of proof.
