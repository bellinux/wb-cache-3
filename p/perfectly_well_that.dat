500|$|Despite {{these recent}} developments, Larkin and his circle are {{nonetheless}} still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet Andrew Duncan, writing of The Movement on his pinko.org website, notes that [...] "there {{now seems to}} be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s—an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents." [...] Peter Riley, a key player in the British Poetry Revival, which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: [...] "What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable 'life'. W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas knew <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere." ...|$|E

He [...] {{sits and}} listens and I read books, because I know <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> <b>that,</b> don't take offense, that 90 {{percent of what}} I hear on {{television}} is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.|$|E
2500|$|Having read Westropp, Sir John knew <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> all the former's Mesolithic {{implements}} were surface finds. He {{used his}} prestige {{to quell the}} concept of Mesolithic as best he could, but the public could see that his methods were not typological. The less prestigious scientists publishing in the smaller journals continued {{to look for a}} Mesolithic. For example, Isaac Taylor in The Origin of the Aryans, 1889, mentions the Mesolithic but briefly, asserting, however, that it formed [...] "a transition between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic Periods." [...] Nevertheless, Sir John fought on, opposing the Mesolithic by name as late as the 1897 edition of his work.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Lynn grunted. He was <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> aware <b>that</b> {{the house}} would seem more {{desirable}} {{to his wife and}} daughters from the very fact that it belonged to a [...] "Lady" [...] anybody. He was <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> aware, also, <b>that</b> his companion had suspected this. The consideration of these facts left him, however, unaffected. He was disposed, if anything, to admire the cleverness of the young man who had realized an outside asset.|$|R

2500|$|Brando made {{a similar}} comment on Larry King Live in April 1996, saying [...] "Hollywood is run by Jews; it is owned by Jews, {{and they should have}} a greater {{sensitivity}} about the issue of—of people who are suffering. Because they've exploited—we have seen the—we have seen the nigger and greaseball, we've seen the chink, we've seen the slit-eyed dangerous Jap, we have seen the wily Filipino, we've seen everything, but we never saw the kike. Because they knew <b>perfectly</b> <b>well,</b> <b>that</b> that is where you draw the wagons around." [...] Larry King, who is Jewish, replied, [...] "When you say—when you say something like that, you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are—" [...] Brando interrupted: [...] "No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The music {{industry}} suggested that iPods {{have a substantial}} and legitimate commercial use in contrast to Grokster, to which Souter replied, [...] "I know <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> I can buy a CD {{and put it on}} my iPod. But I also know if I can get music without buying it, I'm going to do so." [...] On the other hand, the justices seemed troubled at the prospect of ruling that Grokster's alleged business model of actively inducing infringement and then reaping the commercial benefits was shielded from liability. Grokster argued that affirming the Ninth Circuit would only prevent an injunction against future use of the P2P software, while the plaintiffs would still be free to pursue damages in the district court for alleged past wrongful acts. Much of the Court, however, expressed skepticism that Grokster's continuing enterprise could be severable from the consequences of those prior acts.|$|E
2500|$|William Langewiesche, an author, {{journalist}} and aviator, {{said that in}} Cairo he encountered three groups of people. He said that the ordinary Cairenes believed {{that there was an}} American conspiracy to attack EgyptAir 990 and that the Americans were covering up the fact. He added that a small group of Cairenes, mostly consisting of [...] "intelligentsia", [...] "knew <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> Batouti, the co-pilot, had pushed that airplane into the water, and that the Egyptian government was stonewalling and was engaged in what they saw as a typical exercise in Egyptian governing." [...] Langewiesche said that [...] "people involved directly in the investigation" [...] had [...] "presented a uniform party line, a uniform face with very few cracks. They stonewalled me, and that in itself was very interesting." [...] Langewiesche argued that [...] "in the stonewalling they were revealing themselves" [...] and that if they truly believed Batouti was innocent, they would have invited Langewiesche to see proof of this theory.|$|E

2500|$|In 1923, the Supreme Court {{decided in}} United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind {{that people of}} Indian descent were not white men, and thus not {{eligible}} to citizenship. While Thind was a high caste Hindu born in the northern Punjab region and classified by certain scientific authorities as of the Aryan race, the court conceded {{that he was not}} white or Caucasian since the word Aryan [...] "has to do with linguistic and not at all with physical characteristics" [...] and [...] "the average man knows <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> there are unmistakable and profound differences" [...] between Indians and white people. In United States v. Cartozian (1925), an Armenian immigrant successfully argued (and the Supreme Court agreed) that his nationality was white in contradistinction to other people of the Near East—Kurds, Turks, and Arabs in particular—on the basis of their Christian religious traditions. In conflicting rulings In re Hassan (1942) and Ex parte Mohriez, United States District Courts found that Arabs did not, and did qualify as white under immigration law.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
