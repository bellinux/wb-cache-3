5|$|A {{total of}} 138pieces of {{equipment}} were used on Syro, including synthesisers, samplers, sequencers, processing units, MIDI interfaces, drum machines, vocoders, graphic equalisers and mixing desks. Among the brands James used were Yamaha, SSL, Sennheiser, Boss, Roland, Korg and AKG. Several <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> were further modified by James himself.|$|E
5|$|The Shuttle is {{the first}} orbital {{spacecraft}} designed for partial reusability. It carries large payloads to various orbits, and, during the Shuttle–Mir and ISS programs, provides crew rotation and carries various supplies, modules and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> to the stations. Each Shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or 10 years' operational life.|$|E
5|$|While {{they are}} {{expensive}} <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> their popularity and adoption by firefighters in the United States is increasing markedly {{due to the}} increased availability of government equipment grants following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Thermal imaging cameras pick up body heat, and they are normally used in cases where people are trapped where rescuers cannot find them.|$|E

50|$|Information hiding {{serves as}} an {{effective}} criterion for dividing any <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> software or hardware, into modules of functionality. For instance a car is a complex <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> In {{order to make the}} design, manufacturing, and maintenance of a car reasonable, the complex <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> is divided into modules with particular interfaces hiding design decisions. By designing a car in this fashion, a car manufacturer can also offer various options while still having a vehicle which is economical to manufacture.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} apparatus {{was only}} suitable for small fires, and was supplemented in 1902 with a steam-operated pumper and a hose wagon, both horse-drawn. The two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> were purchased by Walter Law's Briarcliff Realty Company and were loaned {{to the fire}} company without charge. At the time, the fire company housed its equipment and horses at the Briarcliff Farms' Barn A (present-day St. Theresa's School) and used the Wheelwright shop as a meeting room and for social events.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} rover and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access to}} three other <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{all of which can}} be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{alleged to have}} {{developed}} 'a terrifying reputation for killing its crew' when finally issued in 1942, following production difficulties. When it was issued (mainly to Home Guard units and those units in the regular Army tasked with point defence, such as guarding airfields, ammunition shortages meant that on average these units only had six or seven modified mortar rounds per gun. Despite these limitations many Home Guard units developed an attachment to the weapon, some later claiming it was 'one of the best <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> ever issued to the force'.|$|E
5|$|Six Flags designers' {{decorative}} theme {{attempts to}} capture the spirit of Batman's world for those queuing to board the ride. As the queue moves through Gotham City Park, the theme becomes more ominous. Modeled after Anton Furst's award-winning set design for the original Batman film, the atmosphere indicates a crime-ridden and dirty environment, with wrecked cars, discarded <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> crumbling concrete, and a Gotham City Police car riddled with bullet holes. The queue then enters the ride structure. The ride passenger loading area is modeled on Batman's Batcave, and features {{a replica of the}} Batsuit from the 1989 film.|$|E
5000|$|Diversity factor (or {{simultaneity}} factor [...] ) is {{a measure}} of the probability that a particular <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> will turn on coincidentally to another <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> For aggregate systems it is defined as the ratio of the sum of the individual non-coincident maximum loads of various subdivisions of the system to the maximum demand of the complete system.|$|R

5|$|On {{the table}} are various other <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> {{that the natural}} philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to {{demonstrate}} the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and {{to begin the process}} of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E
