50|$|Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a {{multifunctional}} peptide {{that controls}} proliferation, differentiation and other functions in many cell types. TGF-beta-1 is a peptide of 112 amino acid residues derived by proteolytic cleavage from the C-terminal of a precursor protein. These proteins interact with a conserved family of cell surface serine/threonine-specific protein kinase receptors, and generate intracellular signals using a conserved family of proteins called SMADs. They <b>play</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>roles</b> {{in the regulation}} of basic biological processes such as growth, development, tissue homeostasis and regulation of the immune system.|$|E

50|$|Chemokines are a {{group of}} small (approximately 8 to 14 kD), mostly basic, {{structurally}} related molecules that regulate cell trafficking of various types of leukocytes through interactions with a subset of 7-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors. Chemokines also <b>play</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>roles</b> in the development, homeostasis, and function of the immune system, and they have effects on cells of {{the central nervous system}} as well as on endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis or angiostasis. Chemokines are divided into 2 major subfamilies, CXC and CC, based on the arrangement of the first 2 of the 4 conserved cysteine residues; the 2 cysteines are separated by a single amino acid in CXC chemokines and are adjacent in CC chemokines.|$|E
50|$|The {{complexes}} of macromolecules {{that are}} referred to as MAs occur ubiquitously in nature, where they are involved in the construction of viruses and all living cells.

In each of these roles, complex mixtures of become organized in specific structural and spatial ways. While the individual macromolecules are held together by a combination of covalent bonds and intramolecular non-covalent forces (i.e., associations between parts within each molecule, via charge-charge interactions, van der Waals forces, and dipole-dipole interactions such as hydrogen bonds), by definition MAs themselves are held together solely via the noncovalent forces, except now exerted between molecules (i.e., intermolecular interactions).|$|E
