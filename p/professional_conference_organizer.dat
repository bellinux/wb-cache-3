50|$|The World Congress of Accountants (WCOA) {{has been}} held {{under the auspices of}} the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the {{worldwide}} organization for the accountancy profession, every five years since 1977 and every four years since 2002. The host organization rotates every four years to a different national professional accounting organization, chosen by an IFAC selection team. The objective of the team is to select the candidate most likely to host a financially and otherwise successful World Congress and surrounding program. Selection criteria include the abilities and experience of the member body and the <b>professional</b> <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> in organizing such events; the suitability of the proposed venue; and the attractiveness to potential delegates of the venue and of the country in which it is situated; among other criteria.|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} for host {{organizations}} that operate conventions to employ <b>professional</b> <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> (PCOs) to perform a variety of professional services relating to the organization, management and operation of the event. As such, a productive relationship between the host and PCO {{is essential to the}} successful operation of the event. Yet, the relationship is often strained as the host organization may feel uncertain about the selection of the PCO or may have reservations about its performance. Such an arrangement represents a classic principle-agent relationship that can be examined through agency theory. This study examines this relationship {{from the perspective of the}} host organization. It found that hosts do express concerns about adverse selection and moral hazard, but that these concerns can be mitigated by a series of pre- and post-contract awarding control measures.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the views of}} key decision-makers in the convention industry {{as part of a}} CRC for Sustainable Tourism research project. In particular, it {{examines the}} relationships between the main participants, the key factors for a successful convention and the emerging trends within the industry. In order to explore these influences, the research method used structured interviews with international convention associations, <b>professional</b> <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> (PCOs) and international delegates. In-depth telephone interviews were conducted with nine international associations from Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as eight PCOs, all of whom facilitate international conventions within Australia. Nineteen international delegates were also interviewed at two international conferences. The findings from these interviews suggest that the decision-making process for conventions is influenced by a complex set of relationships between the three sets of interviewees. The study revealed that the relationships between the convention bureaus and convention centers were very important. The interviews confirmed the findings of previous studies regarding the key success components for a convention, but also pointed to emerging trends in the convention sector that will impact upon success in the future. These trends included the increasing number of female conference delegates, the increased need for Internet facilities for conventions, and the high priority placed by convention participants on the safety of the convention destination...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} ICT/business {{alignment}} {{has been extensively}} discussed in the literature, but almost always {{in the context of}} large firms from the manufacturing and retailing industry. In addition, prior research has predominately conceptualized and operationalized ICT/business alignment at the firm level, very few {{attempts have been made to}} explore the issue at the process level. In this study, we developed an ICT alignment profile by adopting the value discipline theory to examine this concept from the business process perspective. Adopting the Resource Based View (RBV) and Contingency theory, a conceptual model that captures the antecedents of strategic ICT/business alignment, strategic alignment, and performance outcomes is proposed and empirically tested in the context of Australian <b>professional</b> <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> (PCO); Partial Least Square (PLS) was used for the data analysis. The contribution of this study is fourfold. First, ground in both RBV and Contingency theory, an integrative research model incorporating resources factors and contingency factors was developed to empirically assess the alignment between ICT and business strategy in the context of PCOs. Second, this study moves beyond the dominated firm level alignment paradigm by conceptualizing and evaluating the concept of alignment from the business process perspective, the process approach provided in-depth insights to the relationship between alignment and firm performance. Third, this study added the small firm perspective to strategic alignment literature in respect of antecedent to the alignment and its subsequent outcomes. Last but not least, this research also contributed to MICE literature by providing valuable insights as to the technology advancement in the business event industry in Australia...|$|R
40|$|A {{conference is}} not only a meeting but an {{experience}} as well. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze and evaluate four <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> within the area of Stockholm Sweden, and to identify their range of activities. Studies were made regarding these <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> and how they cooperate with other companies to offer a wider aspect of range. The purpose was also to find out how the demand side of the market appears. The demand side of the market could give an implication of how the <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> appear from their perspective and how the <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> adjust to their demand. This study attempted to find out if and how these four <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> had power to be competitive on the fierce market of conference. A qualitative method was chosen where interviews with <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> and <b>conference</b> participants were performed. The conclusion of the study is that one-day -conferences are more often held at geographical more central conference facilities and overnight conferences are usually held at less central conference facilities. These less central facilities are the ones that are in a bigger need of a cooperative scheme to be able to offer competitive conferences. Though the four <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> are using different methods they are all successful. By taking advantage of their respective geographical position and networks they provide their own conditions for succes...|$|R
40|$|The {{book has}} been {{structured}} in, what we hope the reader will agree, is a logical manner. In Part One, the authors define business travel and tourism and talk a little about its historical development. They identify {{the different types of}} business travel and tourism, from the individual business trip to major conventions and exhibitions to incentive travel packages, training courses to product launches. Chapters 3 and 4 then focus on the demand and supply side of the industry, respectively, while Chapter 5 looks at the role of the destination in business travel and tourism. Part One ends with two chapters on the macro-environment of business travel and tourism and its economic, social and environmental impacts. Part Two concentrates on the development and management of business travel and tourism in terms of its physical and the human infrastructure, as well as the marketing of the business travel and tourism product. The book then changes to the practical side of business travel and tourism, in Part Three. Chapter 11 looks at the key issues involved in the organization of business tourism events, with Chapter 12 offering examples of good practice. The final chapter in Part Three offers seven detailed interactive exercises to provide an opportunity for the reader to think about what is involved in organizing business tourism events, designing business tourism facilities or marketing business travel and tourism destinations. The aim throughout Part Three is to encourage good practice and professionalism. Part Four looks at a range of challenges that the authors believe will face business travel and tourism in the future. The penultimate part, Part Five, features a variety of detailed case studies, designed to illustrate points and issues covered in the text. Part Six consists of a glossary of terms –a valuable explanation of some of the jargon used in this specialist field of tourism. A full bibliography, provides a wide variety of relevant references for the reader who wishes to look deeper into issues raised in this book. Preface xv Throughout the book, copious use is made of examples drawn from around the world. Furthermore, each chapter concludes with discussion points and exercises to help readers deepen their understanding of the subject. This book is aimed at both students and practitioners. The authors hope it is written in a style which will make it accessible and attractive to both audiences. It should be particularly useful for students on undergraduate and diploma courses in tourism. However, it will, hopefully, also be of interest to <b>professional</b> <b>conference</b> <b>organizers,</b> incentive travel executives, destination marketers, and those involved in the planning of new conference and exhibition venues. The book’ s appeal should be to those interested in business tourism wherever in the world they are based, from Brighton to Bangkok, Brisbane to Barcelona, Bogota to Bethlehem, Boston to Beirut, or Barbados to Bali. We hope you enjoy reading this book and that you find it useful in some way. If it helps raise the profile of this largely undervalued and under-recognized sector of tourism, then writing it will have been time well spent...|$|R

40|$|Keynote and plenary {{speakers}} at <b>professional</b> <b>conferences</b> {{serve as}} highly visible {{role models for}} early-career scientists and provide recognition of scientific excellence. This recognition may be particularly important for women, who are underrepresented in senior positions in the biological sciences. To evaluate whether conferences fulfill this potential, we examined distinguished speakers at North American ecology conferences between 2000 and 2015 and compared these data with {{the percentage of women}} ecologists at diverse career stages. We found that 15 %– 35 % (x = 28 %, n = 809) of the distinguished speakers were women, which is significantly lower than the percentage of female ecology graduate students (x = 55 %, n = 26, 802) but consistent with the percentage of women in assistant- and associate-faculty positions. We recommend that <b>conference</b> <b>organizers</b> institute policies to enhance speaker gender balance, to provide support for speakers with family responsibilities, and to actively monitor gender-related trends in their societies to achieve the equitable representation of women in distinguished speaking roles...|$|R
