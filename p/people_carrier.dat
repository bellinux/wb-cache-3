Even so, {{she insisted}} on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year. Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed. She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week, even though the Queen {{and the rest of}} the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken—she insisted that she be shielded from the press—she travelled to the service in a <b>people</b> <b>carrier</b> with blacked–out windows, which had been previously used by Margaret.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Carrier</b> First Nations <b>people</b> are the {{original}} inhabitants of Central Northern British Columbia. Along with First Nations throughout Canada, the <b>Carrier</b> <b>people</b> have endured years of hardship {{as a result}} of European colonization. Over time, this has resulted in erosion of traditional practices and decline in overall health. The focus of this research is the mental health of Carrier First Nations. In present day, Western European mental health services are provided to <b>Carrier</b> <b>people.</b> There is ongoing concern that these services are not meeting the needs of the <b>Carrier</b> <b>people</b> because they are not provided from within a Carrier cultural framework. As a Non-First Nations mental health practitioner working in Carrier communities, the researcher has seen this struggle first hand. In efforts to understand what culturally appropriate mental health services for <b>Carrier</b> <b>people</b> are, the researcher looked to <b>Carrier</b> <b>people.</b> Using an ethnographic framework, the researcher explored Carrier First Nation views of mental health and healing through discussions with seven traditional healers and knowledge holders who live and practice in Carrier communities. The resulting data provides a rich description of Carrier worldviews with respect to health and healing. It also describes the work of traditional Carrier healers, historically, as well as in present day. While this worldview is similar to other First Nations across the country, it is uniquely Carrier. This research has implications for mental health practice in Carrier communities...|$|R

50|$|Some crash types tend to {{have more}} serious consequences. Rollovers have become more common in recent years, perhaps due to {{increased}} popularity of taller SUVs, <b>people</b> <b>carriers,</b> and minivans, which have a higher center of gravity than standard passenger cars. Rollovers can be fatal, especially if the occupants are ejected because they were not wearing seat belts (83% of ejections during rollovers were fatal when the driver did not wear a seat belt, compared to 25% when they did).After a new design of Mercedes Benz notoriously failed a 'moose test' (sudden swerving to avoid an obstacle), some manufacturers enhanced suspension using stability control linked to an anti-lock braking system to reduce the likelihood of rollover. After retrofitting these systems to its models in 1999-2000, Mercedes saw its models involved in fewer crashes.|$|R
