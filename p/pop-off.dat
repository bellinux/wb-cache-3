50|$|Studies {{show that}} male {{external}} catheters /urisheaths combined with urine bags are preferred over absorbent products - in particular {{when it comes}} to ‘limitations to daily activities’. Advantages also include that they are discreet (it is easier to keep a personal matter that you are incontinent), your skin stays dry all the time (avoid skin irritation), and it is convenient to use both day and night. Potential complications can be increase in severity and frequency with long-term use. Up to 40% of condom catheter users will develop a urinary tract infection with long-term use. Additionally, 15% of long term users will develop skin injuries including: inflammation, ulceration, necrosis, gangrene and constriction of the penis. Additionally, sizing can prove difficult for some men, leading to dislodgement of the catheter and urine spillage during voiding (commonly referred to as <b>pop-offs</b> or blow-offs). Additionally, 1.3% of condom catheter users will develop a bladder or renal stone requiring medical treatment.|$|R
40|$|AbstractProblem of the {{research}} on quality of ceramic floor tiles remains still open. Their strength, and as a consequence possible applications, depend both on the constitution of ceramic composite, and on their degree of homogeneity. The method of controlling tile strength should be based on evaluating this feature in various cross-sections. Such measurements are very important because their mechanical properties are often not uniform across the whole surface. Standard control tests are not compliant with this requirement because they anticipate only destructive strength tests in their middle cross section. Application of the ultrasound method allows for the easy homogeneity estimation of ceramic composite in the tile. Transformation of the direct results for the resistance of material requires scaling of the measuring device what considerably expands the scope of research, however resistance parameters are not always necessary. Paper presents {{the research}} on the probe composed of 23 floor tiles with dimensions 600 x 600 and 600 x 300 mm. Tiles has been sampled from the lot of material that had been built in the floor and shown excessive defectiveness (broken edges, <b>pop-offs</b> and breaks). The main purpose of experimental tests was to determine the homogeneity of ceramic material in various cross-sections of each tile. Big variation of ultrasound wave velocity within the range of many tiles shown the cause of quick loss of expected serviceable properties. In addition, has been carried out the measurements of the length, width and deformation of the surface of tiles. Dimensional deviations and deformations didn’t exceed the admissible values...|$|R

50|$|The {{race was}} run {{relatively}} clean, with no major crashes or injuries, {{a sharp contrast}} from the tragic 1973 race a year earlier.

5000|$|A few CART-based teams {{discovered}} {{what they considered}} a [...] "loophole" [...] in the rules. They utilized a larger diameter wastegate pipe, but welded a washer inside of it that had a circular opening of exactly 1.470 inches.

50|$|Pre-season {{testing in}} Rio de Janeiro at the newly named Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet (formerly {{known as the}} Jacarepaguá Circuit) was {{dominated}} by Ferrari seemingly continuing on with the form that saw Gerhard Berger win the final two races of 1987. Both Berger and Michele Alboreto set times during the Rio tests which were significantly faster than anyone else, and faster than had been recorded during the 1987 Brazilian Grand Prix, prompting rumours that the Scuderia had been running their cars without the FIA's mandatory <b>pop-off</b> valve, or had the valve set at 1987's 4.0 bar limit. The rumours seemed to carry weight when just a month later for the opening race at the same circuit when the <b>pop-off</b> valves were to be in use, neither Berger nor Alboreto could get near their testing times from the previous month, and both were well down on top speed compared to the McLaren and Lotus-Hondas.|$|E
50|$|Pole {{qualifying}} {{shifted to}} Sunday, with partly sunny skies and {{temperatures in the}} mid-60s. Due to the new technical rules for 1979, including <b>pop-off</b> valve settings and wastegate regulations, the speeds in time trials were not expected to reach those set in 1977-1978 (over 200 mph). A hectic, non-stop day of qualifying occurred, with no less than 45 cars pulling away for qualifying attempts.|$|E
5000|$|During time trials, all {{cars were}} {{required}} to carry a <b>pop-off</b> valve to control turbocharger [...] "boost." [...] Maximum boost levels were set at 80 inHG. The reduction of boost, reduction of wing sizes, and other technical changes lowered speeds by about 8-10 mph from 1973. As a result, top speeds would be around 190 mph, and the elusive 200 mph barrier would be out-of-reach for 1974.|$|E
5000|$|With [...] {{being the}} final year for the turbos in Formula One (until [...] ), Motori Moderni {{pulled out of the}} sport at the end of 1987 rather than try to adapt the engine for an even lower <b>pop-off</b> valve limit of 2.5 bar and a lower fuel limit of just 150 litres.

5000|$|Ferrari had {{dominated}} the pre-season tests in Rio with times {{that were not}} only faster than everyone else, but faster than had been recorded at the 1987 Brazilian Grand Prix, prompting rumors that the team had either shut off the FIA's mandatory <b>pop-off</b> valve which in 1988 limited turbo boost pressure to just 2.5 Bar, or more likely were running the 1987 valve which had a 4.0 Bar limit (most of the team engineers agreed that in 1988 the turbo engines had lost approximately [...] due to the reduction in boost). The rumors were renewed during qualifying in Brazil when neither Michele Alboreto nor Gerhard Berger could get near their test times from a month earlier and both drivers complained of engines that were down on power, too thirsty and had poor throttle response out of the slower corners. With the 1988 <b>pop-off</b> valve connected, both Ferraris were also significantly slower on the circuits long back straight than either the McLaren or Lotus Hondas which were all timed at over 290 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|Qualifying {{also saw}} the FIA's {{controversial}} <b>pop-off</b> valves used {{for the first time}} on the turbocharged cars. The valves limited turbo boost pressure to 4.0 Bar where previously boost was only limited to what the engineers felt the engines could take. The valves were far from popular with the teams and drivers though with some drivers complaining throughout the weekend that they were cutting in too early and not allowing enough boost. Arrows driver Derek Warwick told that at times his valve was opening at just 2.6 Bar (a loss of approximately [...] ) while Benetton's Thierry Boutsen told that the two valves on his Ford V6 were both opening at different levels and both well below the 4 Bar limit. McLaren got around the <b>pop-off</b> valve problem by limiting turbo boost on their TAG-Porsche engines to just 3.6 Bar of pressure throughout the weekend, thus never allowing the valves to come into play. One unnamed team mechanic was reported to have said that the valves were the only crude piece of engineering on a modern grand prix car ...|$|E

5000|$|Pole-sitter Scott Brayton's day ended ten laps down in 17th place. His car {{was down}} on {{turbocharger}} boost, and after the race he quipped {{that he was so}} slow he felt he [...] "was in the way." [...] Years later, it would be revealed that Brayton (and his teammate Arie Luyendyk), were secretly being penalized by USAC for illegally over-boosting their turbocharger plenums and tampering with the <b>pop-off</b> valves during practice and qualifying.|$|E
50|$|When Buick {{pulled out}} of IndyCar racing in 1993, John Menard {{continued}} developing the engine, now badged as the Menard V-6. Brayton, now without a regular ride in the CART IndyCar series, joined the Indy-only Menards team in 1994. Their belief in the powerplant paid off when Brayton won his first Indy 500 pole position in 1995, at an average speed of 231.604 mi/h km/h. Turbocharger boost and <b>pop-off</b> valve problems relegated him to a 17th-place finish.|$|E
5000|$|For 1987 {{the engines}} were {{fitted with a}} FIA {{approved}} <b>pop-off</b> valve which was mandatory for all turbo engines in the season with turbo boost restricted to 4.0 bar (previously turbo boost was restricted only by what the engineers felt the engines could handle, though most, including the BMW M12, usually went no further than 5.6 Bar). Power from the engine, which always {{had the ability to}} handle high boost settings, was still estimated to be over [...] for qualifying and around [...] for races with the cars also restricted to just 195 litres of fuel per race. During the season the team continually experienced problems with the <b>pop-off</b> valve cutting in well below the 4.0 Bar limit in both qualifying and races, with Warwick reporting at the opening race in Brazil that the valve was restricting boost to 3.5 Bar, and sometimes it was cutting in at 2.6 Bar (a loss of around [...] ), a situation that didn't improve throughout the season. Without the resources and financial backing available to the likes of Ferrari or Honda, it would take Mader until the three quarters of the way through the [...] season to solve the problem.|$|E
50|$|The 1974 USAC Championship Car season {{consisted}} of 14 races, beginning in Ontario, California on March 3 and concluding in Avondale, Arizona on November 2.

Due {{to the events}} of the 1973 Indianapolis 500 significant improvements were made to the cars for safety concerns. Wings were reduced in size, and <b>pop-off</b> valves were added to the turbocharger plenums in order to reduce horsepower and curtail speeds.|$|E
5000|$|During the month, {{a second}} {{controversy}} erupted regarding the technical regulations of the turbocharger wastegate. The specifications called for wastegate exhaust pipes to be {{a minimum of}} 1.470 inches (inside diameter). The standard pipe diameter was typically 2 inches. In addition, the <b>pop-off</b> valves affixed to the cars were to be set at 50 inHG of [...] "boost" [...] for qualifying (down from 80 inHG). USAC issued a last-minute ruling that in-car adjustments of the boost dial would be banned during time trials.|$|E

50|$|The {{third row}} of the grid was a surprise, even at this power circuit. Ever since the item was made {{compulsory}} for turbo powered cars {{at the start of}} the 1987 season, the Arrows team had been experiencing problems with the FIA <b>pop-off</b> valve on their Megatron turbo engines, the problem being that the valve was cutting in too early and the drivers weren't able to exploit the full available power. In 1987 this meant that drivers Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever struggled to keep up with their turbocharged rivals. In 1988 it meant they were often only as fast as the leading atmos, and often they were in fact slower, even on noted power circuits such as Silverstone and Hockenheim which should have suited their turbo power. The team's engine guru Heini Mader had finally solved the <b>pop-off</b> valve problem (which turned out to be the <b>pop-off</b> valve being located too high above the engine, a problem Honda and Ferrari had long since solved), and suddenly with an extra 30-50 bhp at their disposal the Arrows A10B's were actually 5 km/h faster than the Honda-powered McLarens across the start line and by the time the reached the speed trap before the Rettifilo, Cheever was reported to be the only car to hit 200 mph while the McLarens and Ferraris were timed at around 192 mph. This new found power allowed Cheever and Warwick to line up 5th and 6th respectively, one place in front of World Champion Nelson Piquet in his Lotus Honda. This also meant that turbos filled the first seven places on the grid. Piquet's Lotus team mate Satoru Nakajima qualified 10th, with the Lotuses split by the fastest non-turbos, the Benetton-Fords of Thierry Boutsen and Alessandro Nannini in 8th and 9th places on the grid. Due in no small part to their sudden improvement in speed, Arrows were suddenly being seen as a dark horse for the race should McLaren and Ferrari run into problems.|$|E

5000|$|During 1988 Arrows {{were rated}} as {{a good chance to}} pick up points over the {{naturally}} aspirated cars due to having more power with the Megatron turbo, reported have around [...] with the new 2.5 bar turbo limit (down in 1988 from 1987's 4.0 bar limit). The turbos were also restricted to just 150 litres of fuel per race in 1988, while the 'atmo' cars were limited only to what the car designers deemed necessary (the Benetton B188 allegedly had the largest fuel tank at 215 litres). The FIA mandated <b>pop-off</b> valve had a habit of cutting in well before the 2.5 bar limit, which restricted power and often left the cars with plenty of fuel to spare {{at the end of a}} race (the team had experienced exactly the same problem in 1987). Quite often the <b>pop-off</b> valve cut in at 2.3 bar or below in both qualifying and races (F1 engineers estimated that each 0.1 bar was worth approximately 20 bhp) leaving Warwick and Cheever with a hard time fighting off the atmos of Benetton, Williams and March, let alone challenging the other leading turbo teams: McLaren-Honda (who won 15 of the 16 races in 1988), Ferrari (who won the race that McLaren did not) and Lotus-Honda.|$|E
