40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} effect of {{insurance}} type on the relationship between hospital attributes and <b>patient</b> <b>flows,</b> with particular attention to whether HMO enrollees are more or less likely than other patients to receive care at high-quality hospitals and whether HMO enrollees travel farther to receive care. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data on <b>patient</b> <b>flows,</b> taken from discharge abstracts compiled by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. Our sample consists of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) in 1991 who resided in three California markets. Only patients under the age of 65 and insured by HMOs, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, or other commercial insurance were included. Hospital quality is based on hospital-specific measures of excess mortality from CABG. Other hospital attributes were taken from American Hospital Association survey data. STUDY DESIGN: Conditional-choice models were used to estimate the probability that patients would receive care at any given hospital as a function of their insurance type and the hospital's attributes. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients were more likely to receive care from hospitals closer to their residence. However, HMO <b>patient</b> <b>flows</b> were less sensitive to proximity. In general, the likelihood that an HMO enrollee received care at a given hospital was positively related to hospital quality. Moreover, quality had a greater effect on <b>patient</b> <b>flows</b> for HMO enrollees than for non-HMO enrollees. However, the evidence suggests that {{the effect of}} quality on <b>patient</b> <b>flows</b> is neither uniform across markets nor across HMOs. CONCLUSIONS: HMOs do not appear to direct patients to low-quality hospitals. However, heterogeneity among HMOs and across markets suggests that buyers must recognize that choosing an HMO involves greater scrutiny than simply picking a plan labeled "HMO. ...|$|R
40|$|Department of Health staff {{wished to}} use systems {{modelling}} to discuss acute <b>patient</b> <b>flows</b> with groups of NHS staff. The {{aim was to}} assess the usefulness of system dynamics (SD) in a healthcare context and to elicit proposals concerning ways of improving patient experience. Since time restrictions excluded simulation modelling, a hybrid approach using stock/flow symbols from SD was created. Initial interviews and hospital site visits generated a series of stock/flow maps. A ‘Conceptual Framework’ was then created to introduce the mapping symbols and to generate a series of questions about different patient paths and what might speed or slow <b>patient</b> <b>flows.</b> These materials formed the centre of three workshops for NHS staff.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to explore}} the {{involvement}} of middle management in forming strategies tomanage variable acute <b>patient</b> <b>flows</b> at a hospital. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical evidence from a university hospital was gathered viainterviews, internal documents, observation and participation in meetings. The role of middle management inthe development of strategies was analyzed using literature on middle management involvement. Findings – In managing variable acute <b>patient</b> <b>flows,</b> middle management adopts a number of roles andbehavioral characteristics that have been previously described in research. The role of facilitator is the mostprominent, with middle managers prioritizing individual goals and strategies for the clinical departments thatthey manage before their collective responsibility for hospital performance. Unclear responsibilities andmandates within the organization, together {{with a lack of}} hospital-wide strategies concerning how the acutepatient flow should bemanaged, are contributing factors to this behavior. Research limitations/implications – The research is based on an explorative, single case studymethodology. Future research assessing the extent of different middle management roles in health care, inwhich more empirical data and quantitative analysis is conducted, is encouraged. Practical implications – There is a need for top management to establish long-term goals to enhancemiddle management roles when developing strategies for managing variable <b>patient</b> <b>flows.</b> Originality/value – Middle management involvement in developing strategies for managing variablepatient flows is a novel topic for research. The interface and division of tasks between top and middlemanagement is crucial for successful strategies in managing variable <b>patient</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

We describe the process of designing, building and validating the improved model. We briefly discuss an experiment using different combinations of variability of demand and processes, capacity constraints and time of day and day of week demand profiles in three key departments – A&E, diagnostics and inpatient beds. The paper concludes by discussing the potential of generic simulation modelling to identify generalised issues and solutions for hospitals in meeting the four hour A&E target...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of <b>patient</b> <b>flows</b> and interdependency of the emergency department (ED) with other units in hospital, the use of analytical models seems not practical for ED modeling. One effective approach to study the dynamic complexity of ED problems is by developing a computer simulation model {{that could be used}} to understand the structure and behavior of the system. Attempts to build a holistic model using DES only will be too complex while if only using SD will lack the detailed characteristics of the system. This paper discusses the combination of DES and SD in order to get a better representation of the actual system than using either modeling paradigm solely. The model is developed using Any Logic software that will enable us to study <b>patient</b> <b>flows</b> and the complex interactions among hospital resources for ED operations.
