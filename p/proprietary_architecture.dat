40|$|The {{creation}} of the Internet has enabled the modern day technology economy. A critical component of the Internet is the routing and switching products that enable and support the movement of data through the Internet. These routing and switching products have enabled a networking market dominated by vendors of proprietary networking equipment. However, the Internet continues to grow rapidly, and this is putting pressure on the current architecture of these router and switch products. Alternative technologies and business models are being introduced to customers, changing the value proposition of proprietary networking equipment. This thesis provides a holistic analysis {{of the impact of}} the changing technology and business environment on the architecture of the current router and switch products, and the business implications for the vendors of these products. Academic frameworks and scholarly articles are used to analyze the value of the current architecture, and its ability to maintain the dominance of the incumbent vendors of proprietary networking equipment in the new environment. This analysis found that the current router and switch architecture is not flexible enough to support the growing demands of the Internet and corporate intranets. The value components of the <b>proprietary</b> <b>architecture</b> will be replaced by open and common versions of the same components, and then reconfigured to provide a novel and flexible architecture. As a result, the existing proprietary solutions will decrease in significance and a larger open ecosystem of software and hardware vendors will share the profits of the networking market. The vendors of proprietary networking equipment will be forced to adopt less lucrative business strategies to compete effectively in the new environment. A once dominant architecture and a source of tremendous value for these networking equipment vendors and their stakeholders will be replaced by an open architecture, resulting in the networking equipment vendors losing dominance in the market they created. by Richard Joseph Kijewski.

40|$|This {{report is}} the {{presentation}} of a Master Project Degree, part of Master of Science in Telecommunication Engineering at The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden and the Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain. The project was conducted between February and July of 2006 at Imsys Technologies AB “Imsys” in Upplands Väsby, Sweden. The objective of this thesis is to obtain results in benchmarking of different microprocessors with an emphasis of Imsys <b>proprietary</b> <b>architecture</b> and comparison between an older versus a new processor design and with a special reference to power efficient computing. The organization of the report in chapters coincides with the steps that {{have been carried out}} to obtain the results. The previous work and background information is described in the section Background followed by the section of Board Features, where the microprocessors are explained in more detail. The chapter of Benchmarks shows the tests carried out and the different benchmark types that have been carried out using different programming languages (C, Asm and Java), including some generally well known benchmarks (Dhrystone and Whetstone). A specific TCP/IP test program was also included in the test suite. Finally, after having carried out the planning and the execution of the benchmarks to fulfil the thesis, a conclusion with an analysis of the obtained results is made. The objective of this thesis is to obtain results of benchmarking between different boards; RCM 3720 of Rabbit Semiconductor and SNAP and IM 3000 of Imsys Technologies. Three different computer languages have been used: C, Java, and assembler. A set of algorithms have been run on different microprocessors and in one case the processor was simulated using a processor simulator (The IM 3000 True cycle simulator). The tests that have been carried out contain important different aspects of a microprocessor: the execution time of different algorithms, the execution of popular benchmarks (Whetstone and Dhrystone) and TCP/IP performances in SNAP. The analysis of the obtained results concludes that IM 3000, programmed in assembler is the quickest board. The SNAP, programmed in Java, is the slowest. IM 3000 triplicates the SNAP speed. RCM 3720 is around 5 - 10 times execution speed slower than IM 3000. The transfer of data TCP/IP in SNAP is around 4, 7 Mbps (both ways) ...|$|E
