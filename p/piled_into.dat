5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E

25|$|The {{generally}} accepted theory about {{much of the}} earthwork attributes its construction to Offa, King of Mercia from 757 to 796. The structure did not represent a mutually agreed boundary between the Mercians and the Kingdom of Powys. It had a ditch on the Welsh (western) side, with the displaced soil <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> a bank on the Mercian (eastern) side. This suggests that Mercians constructed it as a defensive earthwork, or to demonstrate the power and intent of their kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The {{competition}} {{dates back}} to 1914, when it {{was known as the}} National Challenge Cup. The actual tournament began play following FIFA sanctioning of the American Amateur Football Association (AAFA), which rebranded as United States Football Association (USFA). Following the provisional sanctioning of FIFA in 1913, USFA quickly attempted to earn full sanctioning with the creation of an official national cup competition, which was called the National Challenge Cup, the roots of the modern day Open Cup. In 1914, the USFA overlooked the inaugural National Challenge Cup. In the first final, the Brooklyn Field Club of Brooklyn, New York took on cross-borough rival Brooklyn Celtic. Played at Coates Field in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Field Club defeated Celtic 2–1 thanks to goals from Field Club's Adamson and Ford. In the first ever final, nearly 10,000 fans <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> Coates to watch the match. The winners of the tournament were awarded the Dewar Cup, donated by Sir Thomas Dewar for the promotion of soccer in America in 1912, until it was retired due to poor condition in 1979. It was brought back into use by the United States Adult Soccer Association in 1997, but went back on permanent display at the now closed National Soccer Hall of Fame in Oneonta, New York, and the recent winners of the tournament have been awarded a new, different trophy. Despite this change, the name of each winning club is still added {{to the base of the}} original Dewar Cup.|$|E
500|$|Conan's crucifixion {{was filmed}} in March 1981 among the sand dunes on the southeastern coast of Almería. The Tree of Woe was layers of plaster and Styrofoam applied onto a {{skeleton}} {{of wood and}} steel. It was mounted on a turntable, allowing it to be rotated to ensure {{the angle of the}} shadows remained consistent throughout three days of filming. Schwarzenegger sat on a bicycle seat mounted in the tree while fake nails were affixed to his wrists and feet. The scene in which Valeria and Subotai fought off ghosts to save Conan and the final battle with Doom's forces were filmed in the salt marshes of Almerimar. [...] "Stonehenge-like ruins" [...] were erected and sand <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> mounds that reached [...] The changes to the landscape attracted protests from environmentalists and the producers promised to restore the site after filming was completed.|$|E

DeLonge called clubs constantly in San Diego asking for a spot to play, as well as calling up local high schools convincing them that Blink was a [...] "motivational band with a strong anti-drug message" [...] in hopes to play at an assembly or lunch. The band soon became part of a circuit that also included the likes of Ten Foot Pole and Unwritten Law, and they found their way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at SOMA, a local all-ages venue which they longed to headline. The band's equipment was <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> a blue station wagon for touring purposes and they first began to play shows outside San Diego.|$|E

500|$|The film had broader {{cultural}} repercussions, as well. Similar {{to the way}} {{the pivotal}} scene in 1960's Psycho made showers a new source of anxiety, Jaws led many viewers to fear going into the ocean. Reduced beach attendance in 1975 was attributed to it, as well as an increased number of reported shark sightings. It is still seen as responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior, and for producing the so-called [...] "Jaws effect", which allegedly inspired [...] "legions of fishermen [...] <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> boats and killed thousands of the ocean predators in shark-fishing tournaments." [...] Benchley stated that he would not have written the original novel had he known what sharks are really like in the wild. Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to convince the public that sharks should be protected.|$|E
500|$|In most sources, Ottoman {{losses are}} {{estimated}} at between 5,000–6,000, although Kenan Celik from Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, has placed their losses {{as high as}} 7,164, broken down as 1,520 killed, 4,700 wounded, 760 listed as missing and 134 captured by the Australians. These included the commanding officers of both the 47th and 15th Regiments. Of the Australian force that had launched the attack, almost half became casualties. Australian losses during the battle amounted to 2,277 men killed or wounded, out of the total 4,600 men committed to the fighting {{over the course of}} the battle. These represent some of the highest casualties of the campaign. The toll was particularly heavy amongst the Australian officers; both the commanding officers of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were killed leading their troops. After the battle, the dead were so thick on the ground that one Australian, Captain Harold Jacobs of the 1st Battalion, remarked [...] "he trench is so full of our dead that the only respect that we could show them was not to tread on their faces, the floor of the trench was just one carpet of them, this in addition to the ones we <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> Turkish dugouts." [...] Later, over 1,000 dead were removed from Australian position to be hastily buried.|$|E

He suggests any form of life that invents technology will, if it survives, relatively quickly reach the point of merging with that technology, the same thing he predicts will happen to humans. Therefore, Kurzweil explains if we ever met another civilization, we would really be meeting with its technology. The technology would likely be microscopic in size because that is all that would be necessary for exploration. The civilization would not be looking for anything except knowledge, therefore we would likely never notice it.|$|E

2500|$|Storm surge {{and rough}} tides also caused {{extensive}} damage, especially in Charleston County. The highest storm surge observation was [...] at Seewee Bay near McClellanville. Prior to the storm, residents of McClellanville took {{shelter in the}} cafeteria at Lincoln High School. However, storm surge flooded the room, with some people climbing up to the rafters for safety. A portion of the Ben Sawyer Bridge – linking Mount Pleasant to Sullivan's Island – collapsed due to strong winds and storm surge. On Sullivan's Island, water destroyed two or three rows of beach houses in some areas. At Isle of Palms, boats harbored at the marina were washed ashore and <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> a large heap. Losses at Sullivan's Island and Isle of Palms reached nearly $270million.|$|E
2500|$|Amnesty International also {{reported}} that security forces targeted paramedics helping injured protesters. In multiple incidents, Gaddafi's forces were documented using ambulances in their attacks. Injured demonstrators were sometimes denied access to hospitals and ambulance transport. The government also banned giving blood transfusions to people who had taken part in the demonstrations. Security forces, including members of Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees, stormed hospitals and removed the dead. Injured protesters were either summarily executed or had their oxygen masks, IV drips, and wires connected to the monitors removed. The dead and injured were <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> vehicles and taken away, possibly for cremation. Doctors were prevented from documenting the numbers of dead and wounded, but an orderly in a Tripoli hospital morgue estimated to the BBC that 600–700 protesters were killed in Green Square in Tripoli on 20 February. The orderly said that ambulances brought {{in three or four}} corpses at a time, and that after the ice lockers were filled to capacity, bodies were placed on stretchers or the floor, and that [...] "it was in the same at the other hospitals".|$|E
2500|$|During the Second Empire, Paris {{had five}} main cemeteries: Père Lachaise, Montparnasse, Montmartre, Saint-Ouen, and Ivry-sur-Seine. In addition, {{there were several}} smaller {{communal}} cemeteries. [...] Funeral parlors offered seven different styles of burial, ranging in price from 18 francs to more than 7,000 francs for an elaborate individual monument. [...] Two thirds of Parisians, however, were buried in collective graves {{in a corner of}} the cemeteries, with the cost paid by the city. [...] Before Napoleon III, the corpses of indigents were simply <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> trenches in seven layers, each covered with a thin layer of earth and lime. Napoleon III had the process made somewhat more dignified, with the corpses laid side by side in a single layer in a trench. The city would pay for a priest who, if requested, would provide a short service and scatter holy water on the trench. Indigents who died in hospitals and those whose bodies had been dissected in medical schools continued to be buried in the more crowded trenches. [...] For all indigent burials, the bodies remained in the trenches only long enough for them to decompose, no longer than five years. After that time, all remains were dug up and transferred to an ossuary, so that the space could be used for new burials.|$|E

2500|$|Offa's Dyke is {{a massive}} linear earthwork, up to 65 feet (20m) wide (including its {{surrounding}} ditch) and 8 feet (2.5m) high. It is much larger and longer than Wat's Dyke, but runs roughly parallel to it. The earthwork was generally dug with the displaced soil <b>piled</b> <b>into</b> a bank on the Mercian (eastern) side, providing an open view into Wales and suggesting that it was built by Mercia to guard against attacks or raids from Powys. The late 9th-century writer Asser wrote that Offa [...] "terrified all the neighbouring kings and provinces around him, and ... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea". In the mid-20th century, Sir Cyril Fox completed a major survey of the Dyke and stated that it ran from the Dee to the Severn, as Asser suggested, but with gaps, especially in the Herefordshire area, where natural barriers of strong rivers or dense forests provided sufficient defence. More recent research by David Hill and Margaret Worthington concluded {{that there is little}} evidence for the Dyke stretching [...] "from sea to sea", but that the earthwork built by Offa stretched some 64 miles (103km) between Rushock Hill near Kington in Herefordshire, and Treuddyn in Flintshire. Earthworks in the far north and south, including sections overlooking the Wye valley and east of the Wye at Beachley, may in their view have been built for different purposes at different times, although their conclusions are themselves disputed.|$|E
