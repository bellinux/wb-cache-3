In particular, the <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> was asked to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the current EU requirements against this organism. The <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> created a working group to respond to this request by the end of May 2014. The activity will be conducted in accordance with methodologies developed by the <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> and follow International Plant Protection Convention standards. Since this mandate is the first received by the <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> on an important pest of Vitis sp., the first step will be to identify information gaps and additional expertise which the group might need. A major task of the working group will be to try to determine whether there are aggressive strains of D. vitifoliae outside or inside the EU territory which might pose a risk to EU grapevines...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Plant Health (EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel)</b> was asked to react to a {{document}} entitled “Comments on the European Union Food Safety Authority’s Pest Risk Assessment for Phyllosticta citricarpa”, authored by Hattingh et al., which was posted online in August 2014 on the website of Citrus Research International (Pty) Ltd, South Africa. Citrus black spot (CBS), caused by the fungus Phyllosticta citricarpa (McAlpine) Van der Aa, is a fruit-blemishing and leaf-spotting disease affecting citrus. P. citricarpa is not known {{to occur in the}} EU territory and is regulated as a quarantine organism in citrus (Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC). The Panel assessed the comments by Hattingh et al. {{in the light of the}} content of the EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> Scientific Opinion on CBS and the EFSA report detailing responses to comments received during the public consultation on the draft opinion. The Panel stands by the EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> Scientific Opinion on CBS and considers that the comments by Hattingh et al. have been thoroughly addressed in the EFSA report on the public consultation on the EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> Scientific Opinion on CBS. A detailed point by point reply to the comments by Hattingh et al. is provided in an Appendix of this Panel statement. Since September 2014, EFSA has written to the lead author of the comments trying to engage in a scientific dialogue concerning the sources of uncertainty related to the risks posed by P. citricarpa to plant health in the EU, so as to identify ways to reduce such uncertainties (e. g. with further research and/or data exchange). The EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> also remains open to such constructive dialogue in the future...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Com mission, the EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH) was asked to assess two publications, {{authored}} by Magarey et al. and Martınez-Minaya et al. from 2015, with regard to a need to update the EFSA Scienti ﬁc Opinion from 2014 on the risk of Phyllosticta citricarpa (Guignardia citricarpa) for the EU territory. The EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> was also requested to assess any other relevant scientiﬁc information published after the ﬁnalisation of the EFSA Scientiﬁc Opinion. The fung us P. citricarpa (McAlpine) Van der Aa causes the citrus disease citrus black spot (CBS), and is regulated as quarantine organism in Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. The Panel assessed the two publications in detail {{as well as all}} relevant publications published until 31 March 2016. A comparison with the EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> (2014) was made, survey data on CBS from South Africa used in Magarey et al. (2015) were evaluated, and the citrus production areas in the EU were characterised and compared with results from Magarey et al. (2015). Uncertainty and model sensitivity were discussed. It was concluded that the evidence presented in Magarey et al. from 2015 does not require an updating of EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> (2014). The conclusion in the Opinion that proba bility of CBS establishment in the EU is moderately likely is not affected by the paper by Magarey et al. (2015) predicting establishment in some of the EU locations they selected. The high level of uncertainty regarding the probability of establishment is also unchanged by Magarey et al. (2015). The Panel concluded that Martınez-Minaya et al. (2015) does not provide new evidence requiring an update to EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> (2014), principally because it had already been concluded that global climate zones are based on factors and thresholds that are broad and not necessarily representative of those that are critical for the pathogen and its host...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} by the European Commission, EFSA‟s Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{statement}} to clarify the current scientific knowledge regarding {{the identity of the}} apple snails {{in the context of the}} evaluation of the pest risk analysis prepared by the Spanish Ministry of Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs (EFSA Panel on Plant Health (<b>PLH),</b> 2012). The <b>Panel</b> concludes on the risk to plant health posed by Pomacea species in the „canaliculata complex‟, that out of the around 50 species in the genus of Pomacea, four species P. canaliculata, P. insularum, P. lineata and P. maculata belong to the „canaliculata complex‟, where P. insularum and P. maculata are recently considered to be synonyms. Current methods of identification imply high uncertainty if risk reduction options are applied at the Pomacea single species level. The Spanish pest risk analysis identifies important plant health risks connected to Pomacea species. The available scientific evidence indicates that other Pomacea species may pose similar risks to plant health as identified for P. insularum. The Panel clarifies that risk reduction options should not be targeted to single species of the genus Pomacea considering: (i) the dynamical situation in the current study on the systematics of the Ampullariidae species and the genus Pomacea in particular; (ii) the uncertainties and the possible unexpected evolution of the invasive potential of species of Pomacea other than P. insularum and P. canaliculata; (iii) the poor knowledge on the trophic habits of many species of the genus Pomacea, with possible overlaps in the trophic niche (macrophytes); (iv) the high uncertainty on the identification of the different Pomacea species...|$|R
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{has been}} asked to address the {{comments}} submitted in April 2012 by the US phytosanitary authorities on the EFSA scientific opinion on the US request related to the export of Florida citrus fruit. The EFSA Panel on Plant Health acknowledges the responses provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and considers that the USDA misinterpreted the conclusions made by the Panel in its previous opinion (EFSA Panel on Plant Health (<b>PLH),</b> 2011). The <b>Panel</b> considers that the extrapolations of the data provided by Shiotani et al. (2009) and Gottwald et al. (2009) were not supported by sound evidence. The Panel considers that both the responses provided by Dr Shiotani and by Dr Gottwald and colleagues do not lead to any major change in the set of scientifically sound information related to citrus canker and Xanthomonas citri pv. citri. The Panel, after evaluating the response provided by the USDA regarding the previous EFSA scientific opinion on citrus canker, considers that the removal of mandatory mitigation measures in field and packinghouse facilities increases the risk of contamination of fruit during the growing season and thus the bacterial load and frequency of infected fruit in consignments. Permitting the trade of citrus fruit originating from infected orchards increases the probability of the presence of X. citri pv. citri on fruit in consignments from those sites. The Panel considers that citrus fruit is a pathway for introduction of X. citri pv. citri into the European Union and the related risk is being evaluated in a separate EFSA opinion under preparation on the plant health risk of citrus canker for the E...|$|R
40|$|At EFSA‘s request, the Plant Health <b>Panel</b> (<b>PLH)</b> {{performed}} an {{environmental risk assessment}} (ERA) of the apple snail for the EU and validated the ERA approach presented in the PLH ERA guidance document. Improvements and suggestions for simplification of the ERA are provided. One service-providing unit—shallow fresh water areas—was identified for this ERA. The effects of resistance, resilience and management on snail population dynamics in the short (5 years) and the long term (30 years) were estimated. In line with the PLH ERA guidance rating system, expert judgement {{was used to evaluate}} separately the impacts on (i) ecosystem traits, (ii) ecosystem services and (iii) biodiversity components. Snail biomass values were predicted to be higher in the short term than in the long term. For ecosystem services, moderate risk was estimated for genetic resources, climate regulation, pest and disease regulation and pollination in both the short and long term; for food, risk was assessed as moderate in the short term and major in the long term; for water and erosion regulation, risk was assessed as major both in the short term and in the long term; for fresh water, risk was assessed as massive both in the short term and in the long term; and for nutrient cycling and photosynthesis and primary production of macrophytes, risk was assessed as massive in the short term and as major in the long term. For biodiversity components, risk for genetic diversity and native species diversity was estimated as major in both the short and the long term; risk for native habitats was assessed massive in the short term and major in the long term; and for threatened species and habitats of high conservation value, risk was determined as massive in both the short and the long term...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the EU Commission, the EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> {{conducted}} a scientific opinion on risk analysis and supporting documents provided by APHIS/USDA {{in support of the}} request to remove the Union's plant health import requirement that citrus fruit imported into the EU be sourced from groves where, {{since the beginning of the}} last cycle of vegetation no symptoms of citrus canker were observed, neither in their vicinities. The PHL Panel concluded that the transmission of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) on asymptomatic citrus fruit was more likely when the fruit were collected from infested than from non-infested areas and groves. Symptomatic fruit carries more Xcc cells than asymptomatic fruit and the packinghouse disinfectant treatments do not achieve the eradication of Xcc. The application of management option 2 (i. e. „allow distribution of all types and varieties of commercially packed citrus fruit to all US States, subject to packinghouse treatment with APHIS-approved disinfectant. No packinghouse phytosanitary inspection is required‟) selected by USDA will result in an increase in the Xcc load of citrus fruit consignments and in a subsequent increase in the probability of spread of citrus canker through the fruit pathway. Some data provided in the APHIS-USDA documents support that citrus fruit remain a conceptually possible pathway for transmitting and establishing citrus canker disease. The <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> agrees that transmission of Xcc from infected fruit to a susceptible host is rare. But the withdrawal of the current EU requirement that citrus fruit imported into the EU be sourced from groves where no symptoms of citrus canker have been observed in the field of production and in its immediate vicinity since the beginning of the last cycle of vegetation, will increase the probability of introduction of Xcc into new areas...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of a pest risk assessment, the {{potential}} consequences caused by a harmful organism needs to be estimated including the environmental consequences, besides the evaluation of other risk components. This publication describes a novel approach that was developed by the Panel on Plant Health (Panel) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and used to perform the environmental risk assessment for the apple snails for the EU. Apple snails are considered to be serious rice pests and can cause devastating effects on the flora and fauna of natural wetlands. In 2010 the Island apple snail, Pomacea maculata, started its invasion in the rice fields in the Ebro Delta in Spain where it is currently still spreading. Today, the snail is not only present in rice paddies but also in some nearby wetlands, and it has been found moving upwards along the Ebro riverbeds. In 2012, on the request of the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Plant Health (Panel) evaluated a Spanish pest risk analysis on the apple snail (Spanish Ministry of Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs, 2011) and concluded that the risk posed by the apple snail to the natural environment was not sufficiently addressed and recommended that further study should be performed. Consequently the Panel was requested by EFSA to perform an environmental risk assessment on the apple snail for the EU. The snail population density was identified as the driver of the ecosystem change, and therefore the factor playing the major role in determining the impact of the snail on the environment. The Panel developed a population dynamics model to estimate the potential population densities of snail eggs, juveniles and adults, and to identify the potential snail hot spots in Europe. As a result maps were generated to represent the potential snail density distribution in the EU territory (EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel,</b> 2013). The environmental risk assessment procedure developed by the Panel and presented in its guidance document (EFSA Panel on Plant Health, 2011) was used to assess the negative impact of the snail invasion on the shallow freshwater areas containing macrophytes such as wetlands, shallow lakes, river deltas and the littoral zone of deeper lakes and rivers in Europe (EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel,</b> 2014). This work has been published in two scientific opinions by the EFSA Panel on Plant Health and the key aspectsfrom these scientific opinions are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{requested}} the Panel on Plant Health {{to develop a}} methodology for assessing the environmental risks posed by harmful organisms that may enter, establish and spread in the European Union. To do so, the Panel first reviewed the methods for assessing the environmental risks of plant pests that have previously been used in pest risk assessment. The limitations identified by the review led the Panel to define the new methodology for environmental risk assessment which is described in this guidance document. The guidance is primarily addressed to the EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> and has been conceived as an enhancement of the relevant parts of the “Guidance on a harmonised framework for pest risk assessment and the identification and evaluation of pest risk management options by EFSA”. Emphasizing the importance of assessing the consequences on both the structural (biodiversity) and the functional (ecosystem services) aspects of the environment, this new approach includes methods for assessing both aspects {{for the first time}} in a pest risk assessment scheme. A list of questions has been developed for the assessor to evaluate the consequences for structural biodiversity and for ecosystem services in the current area of invasion and in the risk assessment area. To ensure the consistency and transparency of the assessment, a rating system has also been developed based on a probabilistic approach with an evaluation of the degree of uncertainty. Finally, an overview of the available risk reduction options for pests in natural environments is presented, minimum data requirements are described, and a glossary to support the common understanding of the principles of this opinion is provided...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{biological}} control {{has been successfully}} used in various continents to manage many invasive alien plants originating from Europe, but this approach is still not widely adopted in Europe, despite its advantages (sustainable, effective, efficacious, good safety record) compared to chemical and manual control of weeds. Following the publication in April 2015 of the EFSA PLH Scientific Opinion on the risk posed to plant health in the EU by the intentional release of the bud-galling wasp Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae for {{the control of the}} invasive alien plant Acacia longifolia, the EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> is publishing this statement on the procedure to follow should similar requests be made in future. Ideally what is required for an EFSA Opinion on a risk assessment of a BCA release is: (i) host specificity tests of a plant list agreed in advance by an appropriate body; (ii) a risk assessment for plant health produced using a standardized template for the whole of the EU or at the least for an appropriate bio-climatic area within the EU; and (iii) consideration of benefits. This process could be facilitated by an expert working group that would be available to advise the applicant at regular intervals. The role of EFSA is best suited to providing a peer review of a weed BCA risk assessment for the EU considering that peer review of applications prepared by researchers specialized in a particular BCA is the procedure adopted for BCA risk assessment in the countries that have much experience with using exotic BCAs of weeds. Following the appropriate International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 3 and European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) Phytosanitary Measure (PM) 6 / 1 standards will help the releasing authority manage the process. Post-release, as per EPPO PM 6 / 2, all appropriate safety procedures should be put in place...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from European Commission, the <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> {{examined}} the comments of the Portuguese plant health authorities on a previous EFSA opinion with regard to pine wood nematode (PWN) and Pinus pinea and a report on PWN surveys in Portugal. Regarding the comment, based on behavioural responses of PWN to CO 2 and to ß-myrcene, that Monochamus galloprovincialis can feed on P. pinea without implying PWN infestation, the Panel noted the uncertainties on how chemical attraction influences the exit of PWN from the vector. The Panel agreed that P. pinea is not a preferred breeding host of M. galloprovincialis, but it noted the evidence from Italy of breeding of M. galloprovincialis in fallen woods of P. pinea, suggesting P. pinea to be an occasional host. The Panel agreed that, although pathogenicity of PWN has been recorded on P. pinea in inoculation experiments on small plants, this does not necessarily relate to pathogenicity on larger trees in the field. The additional information on Portuguese PWN surveys {{is not sufficient to}} conclude that P. pinea is resistant to PWN. The Panel also noted that asymptomatic infestations by PWN are well known in other areas, and pine species considered tolerant to PWN could still maintain it at low levels in restricted parts of a tree. The Panel concluded that there is high uncertainty concerning the classification of the risk of spread of PWN with plants and wood of P. pinea, owing to the scarcity of information on the interaction of M. galloprovincialis, PWN and P. pinea, {{as well as on the}} field resistance of P. pinea to PWN. Owing to high uncertainty related to the host potential of P. pinea, more studies on the transmission of PWN at feeding wounds and on its survival in trees and wood of P. pinea are neede...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the EU Commission, the EFSA <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> {{conducted}} a risk assessment for the EU territory of pospiviroids affecting solanaceous crops, identified and evaluated risk reduction options and evaluated the EU provisional emergency measures targeting Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd). The risk assessment included PSTVd, Citrus exocortis viroid, Columnea latent viroid, Mexican papita viroid, Tomato apical stunt viroid, Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid, Tomato planta macho viroid, Chrysanthemum stunt viroid and Pepper chat fruit viroid. Four entry pathways were identified, three involving plant propagation material, with moderate probability of entry, and one involving plant products for human consumption, with low probability of entry. The probability of establishment was considered very high. Spread was considered likely within a crop and moderately likely between crop species, with exception of spread to potato, rated as unlikely. The probability of long distance spread within vegetatively propagated crops was estimated as likely/very likely. The direct consequences {{were expected to be}} major in potato and tomato, moderate in pepper, minimal/minor in other vegetables and minimal in ornamentals. Main risk assessment uncertainties derive from limited knowledge on pospiviroids other than PSTVd, although all pospiviroids are expected to have similar biological properties. Management options to reduce risk of entry, spread and consequences were identified and evaluated. No management options can prevent establishment. Examples of successful PSTVd eradication are linked to timely and strict implementation of measures. Uncertainty exists on the effectiveness of risk reduction strategies targeting only one pathway. The EU provisional emergency measures appeared to have significantly reduced PSTVd incidence in Solanum jasminoides and Brugmansia sp., even though eradication from the EU is so far incomplete. The low PSTVd incidence in food crops did not permit to conclude whether the reduction in PSTVd prevalence in ornamentals led to a reduction in outbreaks in food crops...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Plant Health (<b>PLH)</b> <b>Panel</b> {{performed}} a risk assessment for Ceratocystis platani in the EU with the aim to assess the effectiveness of risk reduction options (RROs) {{on the basis of}} the mechanisms of spread identified in the pest categorisation (natural and human-assisted means, including waterways, root anastomosis, contaminated pruning tools, machinery, insects, contaminated insect frass and sawdust). C. platani is a destructive pathogen of Platanus trees, which is currently present in the EU (in France, Greece and Italy). Three scenarios were considered: the current situation (A 0 scenario); the situation without RROs (A 1); and the application of additional RROs (A 2). The risk of new introductions into the EU of C. platani by means of the main pathways of entry (i. e. plants for planting, wood and machinery, e. g. construction machinery and pruning/cutting tools) is relatively limited, but about 250 times higher for the A 1 scenario compared to the A 2 scenario (median numbers of established populations). The risk of spread from already affected EU regions is higher, but varies depending on the scenario. Machinery is the most important mechanism of long-distance spread. Focusing the additional RROs in A 2 scenario on this mechanism of spread – which is not currently regulated – would be an effective way to reduce the likelihood of further spread and thus impacts of C. platani to not yet affected EU regions. The emergency measures applied by the C. platani-affected EU Member States (France, Greece and Italy) could be harmonised and improved. An enhanced programme could be developed which includes surveillance, early detection of the disease foci, effective eradication measures and planting resistant Platanus clones in new plantations in affected areas. Surveillance could also be intensified in the EU MSs not yet known to be affected by the disease...|$|E
40|$|EFSA {{requested}} the <b>PLH</b> <b>Panel</b> {{to review the}} current state of the art of the biology and ecology of apple snails, reported in this opinion, and to perform an environmental risk assessment for validation of the Plant Health environment guidance document, which will be provided in a second opinion. The Panel presents in this opinion {{the current state of}} the art of the biology of apple snails, and develops and uses a population dynamics model to assess the potential establishment of apple snails in the EU. A thorough review of the literature on the biology of Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculata was performed to collect information and data on life history characteristics related to temperature, which was used in the population dynamics model. Although uncertainties on the systematics and taxonomy of the genus Pomacea remain, it is now acknowledged that Pomacea insularum is a synonym of P. maculata and can be undoubtedly differentiated from P. canaliculata. Natural spread occurs via rivers and canals, in which the snails crawl, drift, float and raft. Flooding increases spread. In addition, attachment to animals (e. g. birds, cattle, horses, deer and aquatic invertebrates) results in spread. Human assistance results in spread through cultivation transport of rice seedlings, aquaculture, aquaria, boats, and agricultural field machinery. The potential distribution of P. canaliculata in Europe was obtained by calculating with the population dynamics model, the average snail abundance per year in each node of a grid of 0. 25 × 0. 25 degrees covering Europe, which resulted in the following conclusions: (1) the area of potential establishment comprises wetlands of southern Europe (i. e. Spain, southern France, most of Italy and Greece) and the Balkans up to the latitude of the Danube river, (2) the potential area of establishment includes the rice production areas in Europ...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{requested}} the Panel on Plant Health (<b>PLH</b> <b>Panel)</b> to provide guidance {{for the evaluation}} of the effectiveness of the options for plants and plant products for reducing the risk of introduction and spread of harmful organisms in the European Union territory. Two operational tools are presented: a checklist for evaluating a proposed risk reduction option (RRO) and a database of references corresponding to published guidance documents or experimental assessments of RROs. The checklist can be used by the Panel or the dossier-submitting parties to verify whether all required information is provided in support of a RRO, to quickly describe information supplied to EFSA and to identify major gaps in the data. Four types of RRO assessments are distinguished in the proposed checklist according to their purposes and characteristics: experimental assessment of the effectiveness of the option to reduce pest infestation in plant material/products under laboratory/controlled conditions; experimental assessment of the effectiveness of the option to reduce pest infestation in plant material/products under operational conditions; analysis of the applicability of the RRO; and assessment of the effectiveness of the option {{to reduce the risk of}} pest entry from an infested area to a pest-free area. The database of references is intended to assist the Panel in (i) identifying potential RROs for a given pest and plant material, and (ii) quickly retrieving relevant experimental data and guidance documents for assessing a proposed RRO. In addition, the current document provides recommendations for assessing RROs, specifically: on experimental design; on the use of statistical methods including approaches for studying uncertainty; on the use of quantitative pathway analysis and spread models describing their advantages and limitations; and on recommendations for general surveillance and specific surveys...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Plant Health (<b>PLH)</b> <b>Panel</b> {{performed}} a risk assessment for Cryphonectria parasitica in the EU with the aim to assess the current EU phytosanitary requirements and identify the risk reduction options (RROs), which would preserve the protected zone (PZ) status {{in some parts of}} the EU, where the pathogen is not known to occur. C. parasitica, a bark-inhabiting fungus causing blight of chestnut trees (Castanea spp.), has a wide distribution in the EU (non-PZs). Three regulatory scenarios were considered for the whole risk assessment (RA) area: the current situation in non-PZs (scenario A 0), the situation in the EU without measures (A 1) and the current situation in PZs with additional RROs (A 2). The Panel considered both the risk of potential spread to PZs of C. parasitica strains currently present in the non-PZs and the risk of introduction from Third Countries and spread in non-PZs of new, virulent strains that would be able to jeopardise the currently effective hypovirulence and cause severe impact. The number of new introductions of C. parasitica into the EU is reduced by approximately a factor 5, 000 (median values) in scenario A 2 compared to scenario A 0. Under the A 0, A 1 and A 2 scenarios, 2, 3. 5 and 0. 5 (median values) EU Member States, respectively, are expected to be affected in the next 10 years due to spread of C. parasitica strains. The estimated relative impact on ecosystem services, due to the introduction and spread in the EU of new, virulent strains, is higher for scenario A 1 compared to scenarios A 0 and A 2. The current EU requirements and the additional RROs considered in scenario A 2 were assessed to be effective in reducing the risk of introduction and spread of C. parasitica, thus preserving the PZ status {{in some parts of the}} EU...|$|E
