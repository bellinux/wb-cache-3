2500|$|In road vehicles, {{the parking}} brake, also called hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. Parking brakes on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a straight <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> located near the steering column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking. Some automobiles have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E
50|$|Security was by padlock and hasp on {{the main}} lid, the rear lower hatch being secured by a pin with a <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> running up the rear inside of the main body.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal <b>pull</b> <b>handles</b> are widespread, {{including}} drawer <b>pulls,</b> <b>handles</b> on latchless {{doors and}} the outside of car doors. The inside controls for opening car doors from inside are usually <b>pull</b> <b>handles,</b> although their function of permitting the door to be pushed open is accomplished by an internal unlatching linkage.|$|R
50|$|One major {{category}} of <b>handles</b> are <b>pull</b> <b>handles,</b> where {{one or more}} hands grip the handle or handles, and exert force to shorten {{the distance between the}} hands and their corresponding shoulders. The three criteria stated above are universal for <b>pull</b> <b>handles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many <b>pull</b> <b>handles</b> are for lifting, {{mostly on}} objects to be carried.|$|R

Sand filler {{now with a}} horizontal, rectangular <b>pull</b> <b>handle.</b> From June 1952, 48 in dynamic brake fans began to be introduced; from October 1952, all dynamic-brake equipped locomotives had them. At that latter date, locomotives {{no longer had a}} rear overhang.|$|E
50|$|A {{choke valve}} is {{sometimes}} {{installed in the}} carburetor of internal combustion engines. Its purpose is to restrict the flow of air, thereby enriching the fuel-air mixture while starting the engine. Depending on engine design and application, the valve can be activated manually by the operator of the engine (via a lever or <b>pull</b> <b>handle)</b> or automatically by a temperature-sensitive mechanism called an autochoke.|$|E
50|$|The {{two-stroke}} Sonett II transmissions had a freewheel {{that could}} be engaged and disengaged while in motion via a <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> down near the throttle pedal. The freewheel was required in the normal (non oil pump engines) SAAB two stroke engines {{but not in the}} Sonett since it had an automatic oiling system fed from a supply tank that obviated the need to add oil to the fuel.|$|E

50|$|The grille {{became more}} massive in 1942, with even fewer bars. Parking lights became round and fog light sockets became {{rectangular}} and {{were included in}} the grille area. A bullet shape appeared on the tops of the bumper guards. The nose on the hood louvers were more rounded.Unlike other Cadillacs the fender treatment remained unchanged. A new fresh air ventilating system with air ducts leading from the grille replaced cowl ventilators. Handbrake control was changed from lever to tee-shaped <b>pull</b> <b>handle.</b> Radiator shutter control of engine temperature was replaced by a blocking type thermostat in the water return fitting in the radiator.|$|E
5000|$|The BMW 003 {{utilized}} {{nearly the}} same starting method as its slightly more powerful Jumo 004 competitor: one of Norbert Riedel's 10 PS flat-twin two-stroke engines, installed within the engine's intake diverter as a mechanical APU, to get the 003's central shaft rotating for operation. An American military-authored post-war review of the BMW 003 stated that an electric starter of some sort was used to [...] "turn over" [...] the Riedel APU, with no existing photos of either wartime or restored BMW 003s showing the [...] "D-shape" [...] <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> so prominent on the noses of many museum-preserved Jumo 004 intake diverters.|$|E
50|$|The third change made to The Legend was an {{extension}} of the station. Adding a second train necessitated that an independent brake zone be added. The track already had a brake zone, but it would have allowed an incoming train to get too close to a train parked in the station to be considered safe. In response, the park extended the station so that a train parked in the station would be have a buffer roughly the size of a full train. The ride operator's controls, air-powered queue gates, exit gate, and even the <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> for the bell were moved further down the newly extended station towards the lift hill.|$|E

50|$|Bop It {{toys are}} {{a line of}} audio games where play {{consists}} of following a series of commands issued through speakers by the toy, which has multiple inputs including <b>pull</b> <b>handles,</b> twisting cranks, spinnable wheels, toggle switches - with pace speeding up as the player progresses.|$|R
5000|$|Porringers {{were also}} {{made out of}} red {{earthenware}} clay in a type of pottery that is called [...] "redware" [...] today but called [...] "earthen" [...] during colonial and Early America. These would have the typical, strap or <b>pulled</b> <b>handle</b> that is familiar on mugs and cups today.|$|R
50|$|The grille {{became more}} massive in 1942, with even fewer bars. Parking lights became round and fog light sockets became {{rectangular}} and {{were included in}} the grille area. A bullet shape appeared on the tops of the bumper guards. Fenders were rounded and longer. Front fenders extended into the front doors. Rear fenders extended forward into the rear doors. The new fenders had heavy moldings along the sides. A new fresh air ventilating system with air ducts leading from the grille replaced cowl ventilators. Handbrake control was changed from lever to tee-shaped <b>pull</b> <b>handle.</b> Radiator shutter control of engine temperature was replaced by a blocking type thermostat in the water return fitting in the radiator.|$|E
50|$|In cars, {{the parking}} brake, also called hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, or e-brake, is a latching brake usually {{used to keep}} the vehicle stationary.Automobile hand brakes usually consist of a cable directly connected to the brake mechanism on one end and to a lever or pedal at the driver's position. The mechanism is often a hand-operated lever (hence the hand brake name), on the floor {{on either side of}} the driver, or a <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> located below and near the steering wheel column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located far apart from the other pedals.In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking.Some cars have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|E
50|$|To {{establish}} {{that this was}} a luxury vehicle, the interior was largely designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau http://www.poltronafrau.com/portal/page/portal/UI/webpages/poltronafrau/home?lang=en of Italy, whom they had previously worked with on the larger Q45. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement from the larger Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door panels, headliner, carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window lockout switch installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed {{at the top of the}} interior door <b>pull</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E

30|$|However, a {{new device}} {{known as a}} silicon ring {{tourniquet}} (SRT) was introduced into clinical practice relatively recently [3 – 6]. This a novel device (marketed as the S-MART or HemaClear, OHK Medical Devices, Haifa, Israel) consists of a silicone ring wrapped within an elastic sleeve (stockinet) and two straps attached to <b>pull</b> <b>handles,</b> and is designed for exsanguination and occlusion of the {{blood flow to the}} limb.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigators}} {{then turned}} to an older interview with Saulin {{and looked at the}} record more closely than before. After the brake was pulled, Saulin went {{to the rear of the}} first car to <b>pull</b> the reset <b>handle,</b> but the handle was sluggish and refused to move. Having been overlooked previously, it was discovered that Saulin had placed his hand on the main brake pipe valve to get more leverage to <b>pull</b> the reset <b>handle.</b> When Saulin finally <b>pulled</b> the <b>handle,</b> the investigators surmise, he must have also accidentally closed the valve.|$|R
50|$|Both {{versions}} of the CIRAS come with a quick-release cable; with a pull of the handle, a steel cable holding the cummerbund and shoulder straps in place is released, allowing rapid removal of the vest. This is utilized for decontamination procedures, medical access needs, and water emergencies where {{the weight of the}} vest can cause the wearer to drown unless removed quickly. This last reason was the primary initiative behind the design of quick release vests as a helicopter crash in 1999 led to several US Marines drowning because they could not remove all their layers of armor and load bearing equipment fast enough. This is also described under the Full Spectrum Battle Equipment Amphibious Assault Vest entry, which the CIRAS was developed from. At the time this vest was introduced, it was a unique feature, but it has since been replicated on a number of other vests. The current vest uses a simplified system to attach and release the vest components, making reassembly quicker and easier. The <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> for the vest is itself secured with a Velcro loop to prevent accidental pulling.|$|E
50|$|To {{establish}} {{that this was}} a luxury vehicle, the plush leather interior was designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau of Italy. The seats were made by Poltrona Frau at a rate of only five a day. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement used in the larger Nissan Infiniti Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door panels, headliner, carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window lockout switch installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed {{at the top of the}} interior door <b>pull</b> <b>handle.</b> This version of the Leopard was the first car sold in Japan to include a passenger-side airbag as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|It was {{equipped}} with ergonomically designed and located window switch {{on the top of}} the door <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> operated by the drivers thumb, and the instrument lighting being much more noticeable at night than during the day, using a reverse effect of white light on the gauges with black numbers. The Q45's use of a Cloisonné insignia instead of a conventional grille also caused buyers to shy away because of its unconventional, bottom breather appearance, and may have been influenced from the first generation Ford Taurus, the 1994 model year update featured a more conventional appearance including a more traditional appearing grille, woodgrain/chrome interior trim and cushy seats, drawing influences from the Nissan Maxima. More sedate performance figures, slower 17:1 steering (except on the Q45t, which retained the original 15.1:1 ratio), lower ratio 1st and 2nd gears, and a dynamically smooth suspension were all added in 1993 to make it a more status-quo luxury sedan. Other changes include thicker glass, keyless remote, auto-dim rear-view mirror, dipping side view mirrors, an improved transmission heat exchanger and external ATF filter, new oval intake ports and revised disc injectors, and fog lights. Metal-backed camshaft timing chain guides were added in 1993 to replace the earlier model's less reliable plastic guides.|$|E

5000|$|The Legends {{station is}} themed after a schoolhouse {{such as the}} one Ichabod Crane taught at in [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow". The station has only one {{accessible}} level, plus an enclosure for a school bell on the roof. Before entering the station, guests first go {{down a flight of stairs}} and under the roller coasters brake run. At the bottom of the stairs, there is a multitude of queue switchbacks, going all the way back to the beginning of the brake run and the final two turns of the ride. After navigating the switchbacks, guests walk up a flight of stairs that is right next to the third-to-last turn of the ride. At the top of the stairs guests enter the station, where more switchbacks must be navigated before continuing on to the loading area of the ride. On loading side of the station, there are twelve air-powered queue gates, one for each row of the train, as well as the <b>pull</b> <b>handle</b> for the bell. On the unloading side of the station there are free shelves and lockers that riders may use to hold their belongings for the duration of the ride. The unloading side is also the location of the ride operators controls and a single swinging exit gate.|$|E
