40|$|After formulating {{a general}} model {{involving}} two populations of microorganisms competing for two nonreproducing, growth-limiting resources in a chemostat, {{we focus on}} <b>perfectly</b> <b>substitutable</b> resources. Leon and Tumpson considered a model of <b>perfectly</b> <b>substitutable</b> resources in which the amount of each resource consumed {{is assumed to be}} independent of the concentration of the other resource. We extend their analysis and then consider a new model involving a class of response functions that takes into consideration the effects that the concentration of each resource has on the amount of the other resource consumed. This new mode 1 includes, as a special case, the model studied by Waltman, Hubbell, and Hsu in which Michaelis-Menten functional response for a single resource is generalized to two <b>perfectly</b> <b>substitutable</b> resources. Analytical methods are used to obtain information about the qualitative behavior of the models. The range of possible dynamics of model I of Leon and Tumpson and our new model is then compared. One surprising difference is that our model predicts that for certain parameter ranges it is possible that one of the species is unable to survive {{in the absence of a}} competitor even though there is a locally asymptotically stable coexistence equilibrium when a competitor is present. The dynamics of these models for <b>perfectly</b> <b>substitutable</b> resources are also com-pared with the dynamics of the classical growth and two-species competition models as well as models involving two perfectly complementary resources. 1...|$|R

This paper concentrates on the fluctuation of foreign exchange reserves by taking monetary policy coordination as given: the sustainability of the fixed exchange rate regime is insured via a cointegration restriction {{on the path of}} money supplies.

The first two types are more traditional models where the cash-in-advance constraint is applied on the goods produced in the two countries.

Once participation decisions are realized, each bidder observes the aggregate number of bidders at the auction, and bidding games unfold. For extreme parameter values {{of the distribution of}} potential-bidders' valuation, it is shown that a unique, symmetric, pure-strategy equilibrium in reserve prices exists.

In a labor market with intermediate levels of mobility costs, segregation is more moderate and wage dispersion arises both within and across firms. For high levels of moving costs, the whole wage dispersion is within the firm and becomes zero when the moving costs are sufficiently high. We show that long-term contracts in the presence of social preferences associate within-firm wage dispersion with novel internal labor market features such as a dynamic form of wage compression, gradual promotions an dwage non-monotonicity.
