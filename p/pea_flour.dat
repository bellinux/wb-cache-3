50|$|Pigeon peas {{are both}} a food crop (dried <b>peas,</b> <b>flour,</b> or green {{vegetable}} peas) and a forage/cover crop. In combination with cereals, pigeon peas make a well-balanced human food. The dried peas may be sprouted briefly, then cooked, for a flavor {{different from the}} green or dried peas. Sprouting also enhances the digestibility of dried pigeon peas via the reduction of indigestible sugars that would otherwise remain in the cooked dried peas.|$|R
50|$|David Anderson was {{responsible}} for the refit of the mill as a roller mill, using the latest equipment in 1896 and had relative success until his death in 1929. His widow then continued the operation, mainly producing oat products, pearl barley and split <b>peas.</b> <b>Flour</b> milling became a minor component after World War Two, along with a brief stint of ricena production, a rice substitute involving polished wheat. However, David Anderson and Co ceased business in 1959 and the mill finally closed with most the machinery being sold for scrap, or to local farmers for grain cleaning.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate changes during cooking and drum drying on the chemical composition, amino acids composition, amino acids scores and digestibility of sorghum-pigeon <b>pea</b> composite <b>flour.</b> Both cooking and drum drying in the presence of 1 % ascorbic acid were found to improve the energy value of the final products and the in-vitro protein digestibility of sorghum-pigeon <b>pea</b> composite <b>flour</b> significantly (p < 0. 05). In fact, drum drying without pre-cooking slightly increased the protein digestibility of the composite flour from 76 - 77 %, while pre-cooking before drum drying of the composite flour increased the protein digestibility of the drum-dried product to about 80 %. Drum drying after pre-cooking reduced lysine and methionine levels by 3. 5 and 22. 5 %, respectively. Also, drum drying significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased the fat content in the two drum dried products (with or without pre-cooking). Moreover, drum drying without pre-cooking increase the ash content while the ash decreased when sorghum-pigeon <b>pea</b> composite <b>flour</b> was drum dried after cooking...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the impact of}} crop genetics and processing in two pea lines (Pisum sativum L.) on starch digestion kinetics. Mutation at the rugosus (r) locus leads to wrinkled pea seeds, a reduction in starch content and a lower extent of in vitro starch digestibility. The Logarithm of Slope (LOS) kinetic model was used to analyse digestion curves obtained using porcine pancreatic α-amylase {{for a range of}} particle size fractions. Changes in starch structure induced by the r mutation led to clear differences in starch digestion kinetics for purified starches and <b>pea</b> <b>flours.</b> Larger particle size fractions showed slowed starch digestion relative to the purified starch, but significant differences still existed between r and wild type pea lines. It is expected that this work will help inform the design of future studies where both starch structure and food structure are important determinants of digestion behavior...|$|R

Around 1860-70, industrial pressed yeast production started to result in more voluminous bread.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the quality}} of bean, chickpea, fava beans, lentil and <b>pea</b> <b>flours</b> from Algeria has been evaluated. Maillard {{reaction}} (MR) indicators, modifications in the carbohydrate and protein fractions, antioxidant activity and α-amylase inhibitor of raw, toasted and stored samples were evaluated. Fava beans, beans and peas showed higher content of raffinose family oligosaccharides while chickpeas and lentils showed higher polyol content. Toasting and storage caused slightly change in pulse quality; MR showed slight losses of lysine but increased antioxidant activity. Moreover, inhibition of α-amylase was slightly augmented during processing; this could increase the undigested carbohydrates that reach the colon, modulating the glycemic response. These results point out the suitability of these flours for preparing high-quality foodstuffs intended for {{a wide spectrum of}} the population, including hyperglycemic and gluten intolerant individuals.
