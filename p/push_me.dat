25|$|The {{man in the}} {{wheelchair}} says he too once {{had the support of}} a woman “to get me out of the chair in the evening and back into it again in the morning and to <b>push</b> <b>me</b> as far as the corner when I went out of my mind.” He also had a son, Billy, and begins calling the blind man by that name. He proposes the two of them join forces to unite sight and mobility in the interests of survival. The blind man is tempted by the other’s offer to locate some tinned food. The prospect of chancing across some “baked beans” especially excites him.|$|E

500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped <b>push</b> <b>me</b> to develop the songs." ...|$|E

Misha Zilberman, who debuted at the London 2012 Olympic Games as Israel's first badminton Olympian, claimed his Olympic spot {{as one of}} the top 34 individual shuttlers in the BWF World Rankings as of 5 May 2016. According to Zilberman, his ambition is [...] "to win a medal at the European or World Championships or the Olympic Games."

500|$|Bodie Chandler {{directed}} {{music for}} Quest, and Gary Lionelli, Thomas Chase, Stephen Rucker, Lawrence H. Brown, Guy Moon, Kevin Kiner, Christophe Beck, and Mark Koval wrote incidental music and cues. Lionelli conceived a new main theme {{based on the}} original 1960s Jonny Quest theme by Hoyt Curtin. Composer Guy Moon considered working for the show the [...] "hardest thing I've done in my life" [...] due to the producers' demands for epic music: [...] "They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig... It's great because they <b>push</b> <b>me</b> so much I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with 'Jonny Quest' music... It's hip and it's current." [...] Stephen Rucker and Thomas Chase (who later composed in The Powerpuff Girls) used MIDI to facilitate composing. Chase appreciated the producers' commitment to scoring, noting, [...] "For many kids, animation music is their first exposure to orchestral music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Singer turned {{producer}} Mario Winans, {{wrote and}} produced a song for the album called [...] "Wish Your Love Away" [...] where Norwood sings with angst for her lover [...] "who played her like a fool".

2500|$|On April 6, Sebastian Coe, {{the head}} of 2012 London Summer Olympics said about the attendants, [...] "Horrible...They tried to <b>push</b> <b>me</b> {{out of the way}} three times. They did not speak English. They were thugs." [...] According to the China News Service, however, the attendants have {{received}} training in five foreign languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Japanese) and the etiquette of various countries before their mission. Konnie Huq reportedly described them as [...] "bloody aggressive" [...] and [...] "robotic". The BBC reported that London's Metropolitan Police criticized the Protection Unit for [...] "getting in the way of officers trying to restore calm". Also in the United Kingdom, Shadow Home Secretary David Davis expressed concerns about the Protection Unit, and asked Home Secretary Jacqui Smith: “Who in the British Government authorized their presence and what checks were made as to their background?” Damian Hockney, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, stated that [...] "there's no way people like that should be allowed on our streets". At a later mayoral debate, the incumbent mayor, Ken Livingstone, admitted that allowing the Chinese secret police to guard the Olympic torch during its London relay was a mistake saying [...] "it was wrong and should not have happened". On April 25, the British government's national security department, the Home Office, passed complaints about Chinese security guards' conduct during the London Olympic torch relay to the Olympic Games organisers. Home Secretary Jacqui Smith stated that the guards had no policing powers and that they could only protect the Olympic flame by [...] "placing themselves between the offender and the torch bearer". She also added, [...] "We are raising concerns that {{have been reported in the}} media and by spectators at the torch relay with the Beijing Organising Committee for the Olympic Games through the event organisers." ...|$|E
