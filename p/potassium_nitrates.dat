40|$|We {{report the}} various {{characteristics}} of Pt-K/MgAl 2 O 4 lean NOx trap (LNT) catalysts including {{the effect of}} K loading on nitrate formation/decomposition, NOx storage activity, and durability. This work provides results aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of this new class of LNT catalysts, which could be good candidates for high temperature engine exhaust NOx removal applications. Upon the adsorption of NO 2 on K/MgAl 2 O 4 samples, <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrates,</b> formed at Mg-related sites on the MgAl 2 O 4 support material surface, are observed {{in addition to the}} two (ionic and bidentate) potassium nitrate species observed to form on Al 2 O 3 -supported samples. Based on NO 2 TPD and FTIR results, the Mg-bound KNO 3 species thermally decompose at higher temperatures than Al-bound KNO 3, implying its superior thermal stability. At a potassium loading of 5 wt% on MgAl 2 O 4, the temperature of maximum NOx uptake (T-max) is 300 degrees C. Increasing the potassium loading from 5 wt% to 10 wt% results in a monotonic shift in the T-max to 450 degrees C, demonstrating an unexpectedly significant dependence of T-max on the potassium loading. Further increases in potassium loading above 10 wt%, however, only give rise to a reduction in the overall NOx storage capacity.

Taking into account these points, several hundred mixtures have been investigated. It appeared that the commonly used mixtures of sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrates</b> are so far the most promising candidates for high-temperature heat storage applications. Nevertheless, due to their weak stability at temperatures exceeding 550 °C, nitrates could be replaced by more stable suitable materials when higher operating temperatures are required (up to 700 °C). Due to their physicochemical and thermal properties and high thermal stability, molten alkali chloride salt mixtures are potential liquids {{to be used for}} sensible thermal energy storage (TES) such as in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants and in fossil fuel powered plants to increase the operation flexibility. However, the application of molten chlorides at high-temperatures involves additional challenges such as increased corrosiveness. In the present work, we focus on the molten salts purity, because it has a direct influence on the corrosion rate of metals.

40|$|We {{present the}} effect of the counterions and the {{proportion}} of ethanol in the preparation of uniform magnetite nanocrystals by oxidative precipitation. In this work we compared the materials produced using iron(II) chloride, bromide and sulfate, sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrates</b> and hydroxides in water and ethanol 25 %–water solution. The process was followed by chemical analysis of the remaining iron(II), and the variation of the pH. The magnetite nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and specific surface area. Although the final product was always magnetite nanocrystals, the morphology and particle size distributions depended significantly {{on the nature of the}} counterions and the ethanol content. The morphologies observed ranged between cubic and octahedral depending on the size. Particle sizes were correlated with the Hofmeister scale that reflects the influence of the cosmotropic or caotropic character of the counterions in water or in water/ethanol mixtures. The Hofmeister effect accounts for the competition that occurs between the counterions and the magnetite precursors for the water molecules. The main conclusion is that cosmotropic counterions in the presence of ethanol favor the nucleation of magnetite and generate smaller nanocrystals. Nanoparticle size variations are greater than 50 %, which is extremely relevant to their magnetic properties and therefore to their biomedical applications.

40|$|AbstractThermal {{energy storage}} {{is a key}} factor for efficiency, dispatchability and {{economic}} sustainability of concentrated solar plants. The latent heat storage systems could ensure {{a significant reduction in}} construction costs and environmental impact, because of its high storage energy density. In LHTES, the heat transfer between the heat transfer fluid and the storage system is strongly limited by the reduced thermal conductivity of the storage media. For operating temperatures between 200 and 600 °C, the most used storage media are salts. In order to evaluate solutions which promote the thermal conductivity, by increasing the exchange surface and/or the addition of nanoparticles to the storage media, Enea set up a small facility to test some storage concepts. In this facility, a diathermic oil flows through three elementary “shell-and-tube” storage systems, connected in series, reaching a maximum temperature of about 280 °C. The elementary storage systems are filled with a mixture of sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrates</b> salts, which melt at about 225 °C. Moreover a small percentage of alumina and silica nanoparticles were added to this mixture. The results of the experiments show an increase of the thermal diffusivity of the medium not only for the presence of fins on the heat transfer tubes but also because of convective flows within the melted fraction were established. These phenomena strongly reduce the charging times of the system (by about 30 %). Instead, the presence of nanoparticles increases the thermal capacity and the thermal conductivity of the storage system but seems not to have a relevant effect on the thermal diffusivity of the mixture. This behavior depends on the type of used nanoparticles, which can significantly change over time some characteristics of the storage medium, in which they are dispersed, leaving other characteristics unchanged, according to mechanisms which are still to be well understood...|$|E

40|$|Inorganic salts {{are very}} {{promising}} as high-temperature heat transfer fluids and {{thermal storage media}} in solar thermal power production. The dual-tank molten salt storage system, for example, has been demonstrated to be effective for continuous operation in solar power tower plants. In this particular storage regime, however, much of the thermal storage potential of the salts is ignored. Most inorganic salts are characterized by high heats of fusion, so their use as phase-change materials (PCMs) allows for substantially higher energy storage density than their use as sensible heat storage alone. For instance, use of molten sodium-potassium eutectic salt over a temperature range of 260 to 560 °C (the approximate operating parameters of a proposed utility-scale storage system) allows for a volumetric energy storage density of 212 kWhth/m 3, whereas the use of pure sodium nitrate (T_m = 307 °C) over the same temperature range (utilizing both sensible and latent heat) yields a storage density of 347 kWhth/m 3. The main downside to these media is their relatively low thermal conductivity (typically {{on the order of}} 1 W/m-K). While low conductivity is not as much an issue with heat transfer fluids, which, owing to convective heat transfer, are not as reliant on conduction as a heat transfer mode, it can become important for PCM storage strategies, in which transient charging behavior will necessarily involve heating the solid-phase material up to and through the process of melting. This investigation seeks to develop new methods of improving heat transfer in inorganic salt latent heat thermal energy storage (TES) media, such as sodium / <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrates</b> and chlorides. These methods include two basic strategies: first, inclusion of conductivity-enhancing additives, and second, incorporation of infrared absorptive additives in otherwise transparent media. Also, in the process, a group of chloride based salts for use as sensible storage media and/or heat transfer fluids has been developed, based on relevant cost and thermophysical properties data. For direct conductivity enhancement, the idea is simple: a PCM with low conductivity can be enhanced by incorporation of nanoparticulate additives at low concentration (5 wt...|$|E
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to determine water and salt distribution patterns in a soil irrigated by pairs of double-chamber, perforated polyethylene tubes. The study consisted of two experiments: a water distribution experiment and a salt distribution experiment. Both experiments were conducted at the same site with experimental plots having two perforated lines 9 m long, spaced 0. 60 m. The tubing had outer orifices 0. 5 mm in diameter spaced 0. 30 m along the tubes. The water distribution experiment consisted of water application to the bare soil for periods of time of 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours. After each test a trench was dug normal to the irrigation tubes and samples were taken to determine soil moisture on a dry weight basis. Moisture profiles are presented for the various tests. The salt distribution experiment was conducted in the Fall of 1973 and repeated in the Spring of 1974. It consisted of four irrigation treatments comprising two irrigation levels and two levels of salt in the irrigation water (327 and 2000 milligrams per liter of salts). Experimental plots were planted with lettuce and soil samples taken after planting and after harvesting the lettuce. Soil samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract, pH, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and nitrates. Saturation extract conductivity profiles in the soil are presented for different treatments. After planting and after harvest concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium, <b>potassium,</b> <b>nitrates</b> and pH values are also shown. Seasonal water application and lettuce yields are presented for both trials Water movement in the soil was 2 to 3 times greater in the horizontal than in the vertical direction. Wetted soil volume showed a high positive correlation with both the volume of water applied and with time of application. Salt accumulation occurred mainly at the soil surface between the irrigation tubes and away from the main root zone of the plants. The surface accumulation was followed by a leached zone. There {{were no significant differences in}} yield among plots receiving different treatments. Seasonal water application was less than half of the seasonal amount of water normally applied for furrow irrigated lettuce in the Tucson area. It was higher than experimental determinations of seasonal consumptive use for lettuce at Mesa, Arizona. The study indicated that trickle irrigation with water of high salt content is likely to cause a high surface concentration of salts. Application of extra amounts of water by the trickle system, or another method, is recommended to leach the salts to a depth below the crop root zone...|$|E
40|$|Irradiated {{nuclear fuel}} {{reprocessing}} to recover 235 U and 80 Kr {{began at the}} INEEL in 1953. The resulting acidic high-level liquid radioactive waste (HLW) was stored in stainless steel tanks in underground concrete vaults. A fluidized-bed calcination process was developed during the 1950 s to form a granular calcine solid from the acidic HLW with a seven-fold volume reduction. An engineering-scale demonstration, the Waste Calcining Facility (WCF) was constructed and operated in 1963. After the successful demonstration of the process, the WCF was continued as a production facility through 1981, Calcining 15, 000 m 3 of HLW to 2, 160 m 3 of calcine. 1 The New Waste Calcining Facility (NWCF) was designed and constructed based on the operating experience of the WCF, and began operation in 1982. With a rated capacity of 3, 000 gallons/day, the NWCF continued waste processing operations through May of 2000, resulting in an additional 2, 226 m 3 of calcine (total current inventory of 4, 386 m 3). 2 During waste processing at the NWCF, sodium-bearing waste (SBW) from decontamination activities was blended with HLW to minimize alkali (sodium and potassium) concentrations in the calciner feed solution. This was necessary due to the propensity of sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrates</b> to melt in the calciner, causing the bed to agglomerate and interfere with fluidization. However, {{near the end of}} HLW processing, work was initiated to modify the calcination process to treat SBW directly, blending it with chemical additives such as aluminum nitrate rather than lower alkali content HLW liquids. The result of this development effort was to increase the operating temperature of the calciner from 500 °C to 600 °C. The 600 °C SBW flowsheet was successfully demonstrated at the NWCF during two separate trials during 1999 and 2000. 3, 4 The conclusion from these demonstrations was that operating the existing NWCF at 600 °C is a viable method for solidifying SBW, and this concept is currently being evaluated as one option for preparing the SBW for disposal. To restart the NWCF for SBW processing, applicable environmental waste processing and/or air permits will be required. It is anticipated that the NWCF will be regulated as an incinerator; thus, compliance with maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limits will be required. To meet these stringent standards, an upgrade to the off-gas treatment train will be required. Specifically, emission of CO, total hydrocarbons (THC), and mercury must be mitigated.
