5|$|The Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601 formalized earlier {{practices}} of poor relief {{contained in the}} Act for the Relief of the Poor 1597 yet is often cited {{as the beginning of}} the Old Poor Law system. It created a system administered at parish level, paid for by levying local rates on rate payers. Relief for those too ill or old to work, the so-called 'impotent poor', was {{in the form of a}} payment or items of food ('the parish loaf') or clothing also known as outdoor relief. Some aged <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> accommodated in parish alms houses, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in Houses of Correction or even subjected to beatings to mend their attitudes. Provision for the many able-bodied poor in the workhouse, was relatively unusual, and most workhouses developed later. The 1601 Law said that parents and children were responsible for each other, elderly parents would live with their children.|$|E

25|$|Marius' biographer, Plutarch, portrays this {{voluntary}} exile {{as a great}} humiliation for the six-time consul: 'considered obnoxious to {{the nobles}} and to the people alike', he was even forced to abandon his candidature for the censorship of 97. Plutarch also reports that while in the East, Marius attempted to goad Mithridates VI of Pontus into declaring war on Rome, so that the Roman <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> forced to rely on Marius' military leadership once more.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the first}} meeting of the Great Sanhedrin on February 4, 1807 was {{ceremonial}} and solemn, the group was largely ineffective as nothing was done during the month they met to ameliorate the conditions on the Jews that would be imposed by the coming decrees. During the eight sessions, the Great Sanhedrin was forced to condone intermarriage between Frenchmen and Jews in order that the Jewish <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> absorbed into France, since Jews were considered substandard citizens and needed to be either absorbed or expelled. The group also had to support other actions to assimilate the Jews by removing their Jewish ties, such as approving military service to attach young Jewish men to France rather than to their religion and ethnic background. Such measures were a prelude to the passing of the three decrees on March 17, 1808.|$|E

500|$|With {{a growing}} fanbase, the xx made {{commitments}} to more concerts and extended their tour for the album. They intermittently toured for 18 months, including most of 2010. That year, they embarked {{on their first}} US tour and played high-profile festivals such as South by Southwest, Coachella, and Bonnaroo. Croft recalled their show at Coachella, where they performed for 30,000 people: [...] "That was the moment when I was, like, Oh, my God, I think <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> into this." [...] They were also a supporting act for fellow English group Florence and the Machine. By touring frequently, the xx broadened their reputation among listeners and the press. In March 2010, they played two consecutive nights at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London to capacity crowds and appeared {{on the cover of}} NME, who proclaimed them [...] "the most underrated band in Britain". In April and May, they toured the southern US and Japan, which Croft said was most demanding part of the tour because [...] "none of us had been away from home continuously for so long." [...] They were accompanied during this six-week period by photographer Jamie-James Medina, who later published his photos of the group in his book The Tourist (2010).|$|E

500|$|A 2005 study led by Margo Lillie, a {{zoologist}} at the University of British Columbia, and her student Tracy Boechler, {{concluded that}} tipping a cow {{would require a}} force of nearly [...] and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person. Her calculations found that it would require more than four people to apply enough force to push over a cow, based on an estimate that a single person could exert [...] of force. However, since a cow can brace itself, Lillie and Boechler suggested that five or six people would, most likely, be needed. Further, cattle {{are well aware of}} their surroundings and are very difficult to surprise, due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing. Lillie and Boechler's analysis found that if a cow did not move, the principles of static physics suggest that two <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to tip a cow if its centre of mass were pushed over its hooves before the cow could react. However, cows are not rigid or unresponsive, and the faster humans have to move, the less force they can exert. Thus Lillie and Boechler concluded that it is unlikely that cows can actually be tipped over in this way. Lillie stated, [...] "It just makes the physics of it all, in my opinion, impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an effort}} to counter the {{fighting}} reputation of pit bull-type dogs, in 1996 the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals renamed pit bull terriers to [...] "St. Francis Terriers", so that <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> more likely to adopt them. 60 temperament-screened dogs were adopted until the program was halted, after several of the newly adopted pit bulls killed cats.

[...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{software}} and electronic systems have become generally more complex, the various common debugging techniques have expanded with more methods to detect anomalies, assess impact, and schedule software patches or full updates to a system. The words [...] "anomaly" [...] and [...] "discrepancy" [...] can be used, {{as being more}} neutral terms, to avoid the words [...] "error" [...] and [...] "defect" [...] or [...] "bug" [...] where {{there might be an}} implication that all so-called errors, defects or bugs must be fixed (at all costs). Instead, an impact assessment can be made to determine if changes to remove an anomaly (or discrepancy) would be cost-effective for the system, or perhaps a scheduled new release might render the change(s) unnecessary. Not all issues are life-critical or mission-critical in a system. Also, it is important to avoid the situation where a change might be more upsetting to users, long-term, than living with the known problem(s) (where the [...] "cure would be worse than the disease"). Basing decisions of the acceptability of some anomalies can avoid a culture of a [...] "zero-defects" [...] mandate, where <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> tempted to deny the existence of problems so that the result would appear as zero defects. Considering the collateral issues, such as the cost-versus-benefit impact assessment, then broader debugging techniques will expand to determine the frequency of anomalies (how often the same [...] "bugs" [...] occur) to help assess their impact to the overall system.|$|E
