A biscuit joiner uses a small circular saw blade to cut a crescent-shaped hole (called the mouth) in the opposite edges of two pieces of wood or wood composite panels. An oval-shaped, highly dried and compressed wooden biscuit (beech or <b>particle</b> <b>wood)</b> is covered with glue, or glue is applied in the slot. The biscuit is immediately placed in the slot, and the two boards are clamped together. The wet glue expands the biscuit, further improving the bond.|$|E

Fluidization is dependent on effective contact between the phases. A three-phase (gas-liquid-solid) fluidized bed is used to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of low density <b>particle</b> (<b>wood)</b> using water as liquid phase and air as the gas phase. The fluidized bed consists of three sections, the test section, the gas-liquid distributor section, and the gas-liquid disengagement section. The hydrodynamic characteristics determined included the bed pressure drop, minimum fluidization velocity and bed expansion ratios. The dependence of these quantities on particle diameter, initial static bed height, liquid velocity and gas velocity has been discussed. Results indicate that the bed pressure drop and minimum fluidization velocity decreases with gas velocity but increases with particle size.

The results reveal that the composites with heat-treated <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> had significantly decreased moisture content, water absorption, and thickness swelling, while no improvements of the flexural properties or the wood screw holding strength were observed, except for the internal bond strength. Additionally, creep tests were conducted at a series of elevated temperatures using the time–temperature superposition principle (TTSP), and the TTSP-predicted creep compliance curves fit well with the experimental data. The creep resistance values of composites with heat-treated <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> were greater than those having untreated <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> due to the hydrophobic character of the treated <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> and improved interfacial compatibility between the <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> and polymer matrix.

40|$|Pyrolysis is {{essentially}} the thermal decomposition of organic matter under inert atmospheric conditions or in a limited supply of air, leading {{to the release of}} volatiles and formation of char. Pyrolysis in wood is typically initiated at 200 °C and lasts till 450 - 500 °C depending on the species of wood. Modeling of pyrolysis implies the representation of the chemical and physical phenomena in a mathematical form. The basic equations are those of chemical kinetics, heat transfer and mass transfer. The actual reaction scheme of pyrolysis of wood is extremely complex because of the formation of over a hundred intermediate products. Models reported in the literature are based on the single particle model and the kinetic parameters proposed by various models cannot be used directly for the modeling of the of pyrolysis zone of the biomass gasifier. The effect of {{the size and shape of}} the particle and the effect of neighboring particles has to be accounted while modeling the pyrolysis zone of the biomass gasifier. A two-step mechanism for the pyrolysis of single <b>particle</b> <b>wood</b> and the corresponding kinetic parameters has been reported in literature. In this study, a generalized kinetic model is presented which can be applied to any size and shape of the particle. The proposed model is simulated and the best values of the kinetic constants are found by minimizing the least square of the error between the experimental data reported and the results of simulated model. This procedure is applied for different values of pyrolysis temperature (573, 623, 673, 773 and 873 K).

After mixing the <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> (recycled <b>wood</b> waste) and the plastic powder, we use a molding and pressing process to make composites with a thickness of 12 mm. By doing so, the <b>wood</b> <b>particle</b> content can be increased to 75 %. This kind of composite provides excellent dimensional stability, its moisture content is under 2. 5 %, and the thickness swelling rate after 24 hr water absorption is under 7. 5 %. The maximum static bending strength of this composite reaches 20. 7 N/mm(2), and is better than that of general commercial particleboards. The composite made of larger sized <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> has better strength properties. In addition, when the plastic content ratio increases, the dimensional stability of the composite will increase as well. After the soaking process in boiling water, the static bending strength of wet composite remained at 50 %; this shows the good weather resistance of the composite. The surface veneer overlaid peeling strength of the composite showed 1. 02 - 1. 63 N/mm. After the evaluation of processing, cost of material and strength properties of the composite, we would suggest that the use of 70 % of <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> and 30 % of plastic powder is practical to produce proper sized composites...|$|R
