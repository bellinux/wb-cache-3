50|$|ACSES also enforces a <b>positive</b> <b>stop</b> at signals {{displaying}} {{an absolute}} Stop indication. The on-board database allows {{the train to}} keep track of when it is approaching an absolute signal and then determine if a <b>positive</b> <b>stop</b> is required depending on cab signal indication and information provided via a local data radio. The system will stop the train in a <b>Positive</b> <b>Stop</b> Zone, extending up to 1000 feet from the absolute stop signal. To pass the stop signal or otherwise move the train in absence of a more favorable signal indication a Stop Release button must be engaged by the engineer before the brakes can be released.|$|E
50|$|To secure {{workpieces}} {{and prevent}} motion during operation, support components primarily use two techniques: positive stops and friction. A <b>positive</b> <b>stop</b> is any immovable component (such as a solid surface or pin) that, by its placement, physically impedes {{the motion of}} the workpiece. Support components {{are more likely to be}} adjustable than locating components, and normally do not press tightly on the workpiece or provide absolute location.|$|E

50|$|Milling {{operations}} tend {{to involve}} large, straight cuts that produce lots of chips and involve varying force. Locating and supporting areas must usually be large and very sturdy {{in order to}} accommodate milling operations; strong clamps are also a requirement. Due to the vibration of the machine, <b>positive</b> <b>stops</b> are preferred over friction for securing the workpiece. For high-volume automated processes, milling fixtures usually involve hydraulic or pneumatic clamps.|$|R
50|$|Although clamp-type collars {{work very}} well under {{relatively}} constant loads, shock loads can cause the collar to shift its position on the shaft. This {{is due to the}} very high forces that can be created by a relatively small mass during impact, compared to a statically or gradually applied load. As an option for applications with this type of loading, an undercut can be made on the shaft and a clamp collar can be used to create a <b>positive</b> <b>stop</b> that is more resistant to shock loads.|$|E
50|$|At {{interlockings}} {{where the}} Data Radio (BCM) is either not installed or not functioning, the train will {{determine if a}} <b>positive</b> <b>stop</b> is necessary via the cab signaling system. If {{it is necessary to}} pass a signal at Stop after receiving authorization from the dispatcher, ACSES will limit the train to 15 mph within the interlocking limits after use of the Stop Release button. The ACSES system also supports direct dispatcher authorization of passing a Stop signal instead of the use of the use of a Stop Release button.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, the cab {{signals are}} {{considered}} a completely independent system that transmits a continuous stream of codes through the rails instead of via wireless transmission. Any fault in the ACSES overlay will not affect the cab signal system and moreover a cab signal failure will not affect the ACSES system.

Speed information acquired in this fashion will be displayed on the ACSES speed readout to supplement any speed {{information provided by the}} cab signaling system. After a <b>positive</b> <b>stop</b> the data radios will also transmit information releasing the train from the stop when track conditions permit. Such information about the status of the track occupancy, switch position, signal indication, {{and a host of other}} vital inputs—is accumulated by wayside encoders, such as a Safetran VIU-ACSES (see photo to the right), before being sent to the BCMs for transmission to locomotives.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} way that ABS systems detect track {{occupancy}} (by a train or obstruction) {{is through the}} use of electrical track circuits. A low-voltage current is sent through the track between the signals and is detected to determine whether the circuit is closed, open, or shorted. A train's metal wheels and axles will pass current from one rail to the other, thereby shorting (shunting) the circuit. If the ABS system detects that the circuit is shorted between two signals, it understands that a train, or obstruction is occupying that block and will [...] "drop" [...] the signals (display a restricting or stop indication) on either side of that block to prevent another train from entering (if the block is governed by a <b>positive</b> <b>stop).</b> In the United Kingdom the system is referred to as track circuit block (TCB) to avoid confusion with the use, in that country, of the acronym AB for absolute block.|$|E
5000|$|The MP5 has {{a hammer}} firing mechanism.

40|$|PMTCT during {{breastfeeding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} public heath challenge confronting researchers. About ~HIV infection in children is acquired through MTCT. Breastfeeding contributes to the overall risk ofMTCT by 14 %. PMTCT has been implemented as the main strategy for preventing transmission of HIV from mother to child in order to save the lives of large numbers of children born to HIV infected mothers. However a number ofPMTCT programmes have experienced a number of challenges during implementation. A crossectional analytical study was done in Ilala district Dar es Salaam Tanzania from June to July 2003 with the obj ective of finding out barriers to implementation ofPMTCT during breastfeeding period. A total of 384 mothers aged 15 - 47 years were interviewed. Information on barriers to implementation ofPMTCT was obtained through quantitative method by using structured interviews and qualitative using focus group discussions (FGD's) method. The results showed that most (92. 4 %) of the respondents were aware of mother to child transmission of HI V, but the level of knowledge on the period of transmission was not as high (54. 3 %). Similarly awareness ofPMTCT of HI V was high (91. 9 %) but the level of knowledge of methods ofPMTCT was poor (62. 6 %). Factors that contributed to the poor knowledge ofPMTCT were low level of education and younger age. VII The prevalence of breast feeding was found to be 97. 9 %(376 / 384). The few who were not breastfeeding were advised to stop breastfeeding by a doctor because their mi lk was bad. Information on MTCT was obtained from clinics 60. 3 % (246 / 408) and media where radio was the commonest. Regarding breastfeeding practice, about 83. 0 % (346 / 417) of mothers would give cow milk or fonnula milk to the young babies. The remaining few said they usually let the baby breastfeed from another woman. Of the four breastfeeding options majority 97. 2 %(67 / 69) of the mothers would prefer to give to their babies formula milk only two mothers favoured exclusive breastfeeding, arguing that even little amount of mother's milk may contain viruses. Asked whether they would advise a friend who is HIV positive to breastfeed or not, majority (90. 4 %) of the mothers said they would advise not to breastfeed to avoid transmission. The few who would advise others to continue breastfeeding argued that formula milk is expensive and the mother's milk is important for the baby. Majority 69. 7 %(267 / 383) of the mothers expressed worries on stigmatisation should a mother who is HIV <b>positive</b> <b>stop</b> breastfeeding. This study found that, mothers were aware ofMTCT, PMTCT and breastfeeding options but their level of knowledge was poor. Stigma was the commonest barrier to p implementation o~MTCT; therefore there is a need to educate mothers on PMTCT, and to develop strategies for reducing stigma...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} pegorming interim sample size reestimation based on the observed treatment difference in clinical trials. The approach combines the advan-tages of the group sequential and sample size reestimation methods and provides an efficient design for clinical trials.

To control the overall type I error level, a method is proposed to adjust the group sequential stopping boundaries adjusted for sample size reestimation and negative stops. The adjusted stopping boundaries are flexible to different rules of sample size reestimation and reuse the alpha values saved by negative stops. The adjustment is based on the exact type 1 error change and, therefore, the penalty for the type I error inflation due to such an interim reestimation is kept to a minimum. The eflciency of sample size reestimation without <b>positive</b> <b>stops</b> is compared with the group sequential method using unconditional power and expected sample size.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a moral hazard problem, {{in which the}} agent after receiving his wage contract but before undertaking the costly effort can borrow on his future wage earnings. The game between the agent and potential lenders is modelled as an in. nite stochastic game with an exogenous stopping probability. We show that the principal cannot design a wage scheme that is robust to hedging by the agent. In particular, we show that, if the exogenous stopping probability is non zero, the principal's wage offer {{will be followed by}} several rounds of borrowing by the agent. This is compared to the recontracting-proofness equilibria which most of the literature has concentrated on, assuming that this stopping probability is zero. Furthermore, we show that the equilibrium of the model with a strictly <b>positive</b> <b>stopping</b> probability does not converge to the equilibrium of the model in which it is zero. We also find that the principal. s profit is lower, the maximum wage payment can be higher and effort is lower. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{tactile display}} device {{utilizes}} an electrorheological fluid to activate {{a plurality of}} tactile dots. A voltage is selectively produced uniformly across an electrorheological fluid flowing between a common ground electrode and a plurality of conductive dot electrodes, thereby producing {{an increase in the}} fluid's viscosity to the extent that fluid flow between the two electrodes is restricted. The flow restriction produces a build-up of electrorheological fluid in a corresponding dot actuator chamber. The resulting pressure increase in the chamber displaces an elastic diaphragm fixed to a display surface to form a lump which can be perceived by the reader as one dot in a Braille character cell. A flow regulation system provides a continually pressurized flow system and provides for free flow of the electrorheological fluid through the plurality of dot actuator chambers when they are not activated.
