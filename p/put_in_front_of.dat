25|$|Family {{names in}} German-speaking {{countries}} are usually positioned last, after all given names. There are exceptions, however: {{in parts of}} Austria and Bavaria and the Alemannic-speaking areas, the family name is regularly <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the first given name. Also in many – especially rural – parts of Germany, to emphasize family affiliation there is often an inversion in colloquial use, in which the family name becomes a possessive: Rüters Erich, for example, would be Erich of the Rüter family.|$|E
25|$|From 1948 until 1961, Israeli {{citizens}} {{required an}} exit visa {{as well as}} a passport to travel overseas even temporarily. Initially the intention was to prevent the departure of Jews who ought to be fighting, but also due to a perception that those leaving harmed national solidarity. After the war the restrictions were eased somewhat but still many administrative hurdles were <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> those wishing to leave. To prevent the outflow of foreign currency, tickets could only be purchased with money sent from abroad. The general need for an exit visa was finally abolished in 1961 after several court cases and Knesset decisions.|$|E
25|$|The city authorities, {{led by the}} Lieutenant General of Police, {{made the}} first serious efforts to improve traffic {{circulation}} in the congested streets of the city, by removing stones and barriers <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> houses and by restricting {{the placement of the}} tables and carts of street merchants. They also tried to improve the bottleneck of traffic created on the ten existing bridges over the Seine. The houses which lined the Pont au Change were pulled down, and a project was launched in 1725 to build a new bridge to connect two of the city's most wealthy new neighborhoods, the Faubourg de rue Saint-Honoré on the right bank and the Faubourg Saint-Germain on the right bank. Construction on the new bridge did not begin until 1788; stones from the demolished Bastille were used to help finish the bridge, which was dedicated in 1791 as the Pont Louis XVI. It was renamed the pont de la Revolution in 1792; then, in 1795, Pont de la Concorde.|$|E

500|$|Richard Elfman {{had never}} gone to film school when {{production}} started, and [...] "I didn't know what I was getting into." [...] The production, {{from its original}} 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members would sleep on the film's stage, wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm. Among the film's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop). Some of the film's cast {{was made up of}} non-professionals cast off the street. In one scene, Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of [...] "Bim Bam Boom", but when he was <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the camera, he stood there as the scene was shot. Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright's lips over the actor's face. Another scene featured homeless men.|$|E

In the behind-the-scenes book Doctor Who: The Inside Story Davies explains that he [...] "always wanted to do a show with someone who was a rubbish companion" [...] and dubs Adam [...] "the companion that couldn't". In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential he characterised Adam as [...] "a little bit ambitious and [...] "a little bit too clever for his own good." [...] Langley added that the character ends up [...] "on {{the wrong side of the}} tracks" [...] because he likes [...] "meddling with things" [...] and that [...] "him thinking he's a genius gets him into bother". Explaining Adam's downfall, Davies states that he [...] "doesn't realize he's out for his own good until he's put in a situation of temptation, where knowledge, information and power are <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him." [...] Davies felt that Adam's story provided [...] "a chance to see someone starting on that path" [...] before the Doctor cuts his ambitions short.|$|E

2500|$|For {{all such}} artists the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition was an {{essential}} platform, reviewed at huge length in the press, which often alternated ridicule and extravagant praise in discussing works. [...] The ultimate, and very rare, accolade was when a rail {{had to be}} <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a painting {{to protect it from}} the eager crowd; up to 1874 this had only happened to Wilkie's Chelsea Pensioners, Frith's The Derby Day and Salon d'Or and Luke Filde's The Casuals (see below). [...] A great number of artists laboured year after year in the hope of a hit there, often working in manners to which their talent was not really suited, a trope exemplified by the suicide in 1846 of Benjamin Haydon, a friend of Keats and Dickens and a better writer than painter, leaving his blood splashed over his unfinished King Alfred and the First British Jury.|$|E

2500|$|In the Roman Empire, the bestowal {{and use of}} clan {{and family}} names waxed and waned with changes in the various subcultures of the realm. (See Roman naming conventions.) The nomen, which was the gens name, was {{inherited}} much like last names are, but their purposes were quite different. [...] In later Europe, last names were developed to distinguish between individuals. [...] The nomen were to identify group kinship. [...] The praenomen was literally the [...] "forename" [...] and was originally used like a first name today. [...] In later times, praenomen became less useful for distinguishing individuals as it was often passed down for boys along with the nomen (like an entire culture where [...] "John Smith, Jr." [...] was the norm), and girls, were often given no praenomen at all or functional names like Major and Minor ("Older" [...] and [...] "Younger") or Maxima, Maio, and Mino ("Biggest," [...] "Middle," [...] "Littlest") or ordinal numbers rather than what we might think of as names: Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, etc. Around this time, the nomen became followed {{by one or more}} additional names called cognomen. [...] It became usual that one of these cognomen was inherited, but as the praenomen and nomen became ever more rigidly used and less useful for identifying individuals, additional personal cognomen were more often used, {{to the point that the}} first the praenomen and then the nomen fell out of use entirely. [...] With the gradual influence of Greek/Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> traditional cognomen, but eventually, people reverted to single names. By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the Eastern Roman Empire. In Western Europe, where Germanic culture dominated the aristocracy, family names were almost non-existent. They would not significantly reappear again in Eastern Roman society until the 10th century, apparently influenced by the familial affiliations of the Armenian military aristocracy. [...] The practice of using family names spread through the Eastern Roman Empire and gradually into Western Europe, although it was not until the modern era that family names came to be explicitly inherited as they are today.|$|E

That was why the sexton had gone to say good-day to the farmer's wife when he knew that her husband was not at home, and the good woman {{therefore}} <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him the best food she had. But when they heard the farmer coming they were frightened, and the farmer's wife begged the sexton to creep into a great empty chest. He did so, as he knew the poor man could not bear to see a sexton. The wife hastily hid all the beautiful food and the wine in her oven; for if her husband had seen it, he would have been sure to ask what it all meant.|$|E

60|$|I used {{to think}} it so dull that I could not believe it was Giotto's. That is partly from its dead colour, which is the boy's way of telling you it is night:--more from the subject being one quite beyond his age, and which he felt no {{pleasure}} in trying at. You may see {{he was still a}} boy, for he not only cannot draw feet yet, in the least, and scrupulously hides them therefore; but is very hard put to it for the hands, being obliged to draw them mostly in the same position,--all the four fingers together. But in the careful bunches of grass and weeds you will see what the fresco foregrounds were before they got spoiled; and there are some things he can understand already, even about that Agony, thinking of it in his own fixed way. Some things,--not altogether to be explained by the old symbol of the angel with the cup. He will try if he cannot explain them better in those two little pictures below; which nobody ever looks at; the great Roman sarcophagus being <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them, and the light glancing on the new varnish so that you must twist about like a lizard to see anything. Nevertheless, you may make out what Giotto meant.|$|E
60|$|Now, poets in our epoch {{will tend}} towards ecclesiastical {{religion}} strictly {{because it is}} just a little more free than anything else. Take, for instance, the case of symbol and ritualism. All reasonable men believe in symbol; but some reasonable men do not believe in ritualism; by which they mean, I imagine, a symbolism too complex, elaborate, and mechanical. But whenever they talk of ritualism they always seem to mean the ritualism of the Church. Why should they not mean the ritual of the world? It is much more ritualistic. The ritual of the Army, the ritual of the Navy, the ritual of the Law Courts, the ritual of Parliament are much more ritualistic. The ritual of a dinner-party is much more ritualistic. Priests may put gold and great jewels on the chalice; but at least there is only one chalice to put them on. When you go to a dinner-party they <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> you five different chalices, of five weird and heraldic shapes, to symbolise five different kinds of wine; an insane extension of ritual from which Mr. Percy Dearmer would fly shrieking. A bishop wears a mitre; but he is not thought more or less of a bishop according to whether you can see the very latest curves in his mitre. But a swell is thought more or less of a swell according to whether you can see the very latest curves in his hat. There is more fuss about symbols in the world than in the Church.|$|E
6000|$|Again, I {{spoke of}} the produce of {{fermentation}} as [...] "spirit of wine." [...] Now what a very curious phrase that is, {{if you come to}} think of it. The old alchemists talked of the finest essence of anything as if it had the same sort of relation to the thing itself as a man's spirit is supposed to have to his body; and so they spoke of this fine essence of the fermented liquid as being the spirit of the liquid. Thus came about that extraordinary ambiguity of language, in virtue of which you apply precisely the same substantive name to the soul of man and to a glass of gin! And then there is still yet one other most curious piece of nomenclature connected with this matter, and that is the word [...] "alcohol" [...] itself, which is now so familiar to everybody. Alcohol originally meant a very fine powder. The women of the Arabs and other Eastern people are in the habit of tingeing their eyelashes with a very fine black powder which is made of antimony, and they call that [...] "kohol;" [...] and the [...] "al" [...] is simply the article <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it, so as to say [...] "the kohol." [...] And up to the 17th century in this country the word alcohol was employed to signify any very fine powder; you find it in Robert Boyle's works that he uses [...] "alcohol" [...] for a very fine subtle powder. But then this name of anything very fine and very subtle came to be specially connected with the fine and subtle spirit obtained from the fermentation of sugar; and I believe that the first person who fairly fixed it as the proper name of what we now commonly call spirits of wine, was the great French chemist Lavoisier, so comparatively recent is {{the use of the word}} alcohol in this specialised sense.|$|E
