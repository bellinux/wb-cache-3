40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{proteins}} Sec 34 p and Sec 35 p are {{components of}} a large cytosolic complex involved in protein transport through the secretory pathway. Characterization of a new secretion mutant led us to identify SEC 36, which encodes a new component of this complex. Sec 36 p binds to Sec 34 p and Sec 35 p, and mutation of SEC 36 disrupts the complex, as determined by gel filtration. Missense mutations of SEC 36 are lethal with mutations in COPI subunits, indicating a functional connection between the Sec 34 p/sec 35 p complex and the COPI vesicle coat. Affinity purification of proteins that bind to Sec 35 p-myc allowed identification of two additional proteins in the complex. We call these two conserved proteins Sec 37 p and Sec 38 p. Disruption of either SEC 37 or SEC 38 affects {{the size of the}} complex that contains Sec 34 p and Sec 35 p. We also examined COD 4, COD 5, and DOR 1, three genes recently reported to encode proteins that bind to Sec 35 p. Each of the eight genes that encode components of the Sec 34 p/sec 35 p complex was tested for its contribution to cell growth, protein transport, and the integrity of the complex.

Weekly water samples were analyzed for pH, N, <b>P,</b> <b>COD,</b> TSS and fecal coliform bacteria from 17 June to 19 August 1992. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected biweekly using a Turtox Indestructible™ Dip Net, and density indices were calculated. Station 1, above the effluent, was a spring habitat. Fecal coliform, N, P, TSS and COD values were higher at this station, while the aquatic macroinvertebrate community was relatively simple. The effluent impact upon Station 2 was most obvious from the persistent presence of foam and filamentous algae.

Using “natural tag” properties of otoliths, we found significant correlations between the extent of Baltic Sea hypoxia and Mn/Ca ratios in regions of cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths corresponding to year 1 of life; this is associated with elevated bottom water dissolved manganese that increases with hypoxia. Elevated Mn/Ca ratios were also found in other years of life but with less frequency.

KoellikerIn 2003, the EPA changed Confined Animal Feedlot Operation (CAFO) {{regulations}} to allow an alternative treatment system for feedlot runoff if a 25 -year simulation can show better {{performance for the}} alternative treatment system when compared to a traditional lagoon system. A continuous computer simulation model written in C was developed to compare the release of water, nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from a Vegetated Treatment Area (VTA) system and a conventional lagoon system in Kansas. The model simulates the transport of water and constituents in a feedlot, settling basin, lagoon, and VTA. The feedlot runoff is based on NRCS unit hydrograph method for the water balance and AnnAgNPS for the constituent runoff concentrations. The settling basin is a simple water balance with sediment, organic-N, <b>P,</b> and <b>COD</b> removed with settling of the solids. The VTA is designed to calculate infiltration with Green-Ampt Equation and overland flow with Manning's Law. The VTA removes organic-N and P with the Kentucky Filtration Model. The lagoon is derived from Koelliker et al. model water balance and pumping schedule with constituent balance from Miner et al. model. VTA portion of the model was analyzed for sensitivity and calibrated with three storms. The sensitivity analysis showed {{that the size of}} the VTA and conductivity of the soil in the VTA causes the greatest variability in the release of N, <b>P,</b> and <b>COD.</b> The calibration of the release of organic-N and P for mean particle diameter showed that a diameter of 1. 5 µm produced the best agreement. The model was used for a lagoon and VTA system at two sites in Kansas with 35 years of weather data. The sites were located in Ottawa and Greenwood Counties, KS. The simulated results showed that the lagoon system performed better for both sites when comparing the mean values of total-N, total-P, and COD released over the 35 years. The VTA system performance was better when median values of total-P and COD were compared at Greenwood County.

40|$|An {{examination}} of {{temporal and spatial}} variation of water quality across the whole watershed is undertook in this research. It is observed that the seasonal variation is apparent {{in all of the}} water quality parameters measured. And the spatial variation of water quality parameters gives us the general ideas that water quality is correlation with the watershed landscape. An integrated approach involving Remote Sensing (RS) technology, Geographic Information System (GIS), Statistical and Spatial Analysis, as well as hydrologic modeling is put forward to perf 0 ll 11 a comprehensive study on the relationship between land use-land cover and water quality in Wenyu River Watershed. Landsat TM data is used to extract land use-land cover information of the study area; while Arc Hydro model is employed to perform the stream network tracing and watershed delineation. Based on an exponential model, separate multiple regression models are developed to estimate the contributions of different land types on six stream water quality variables, including TN, NO 3 - N, TP, PO 4 - <b>P,</b> <b>COD</b> and DO, in Wenyu River watershed. The resulted models are identified to well explain the water quality variables using land use types. And the goodness-of-fit of these modles are reasonably satisfactory. Finally, this research also discusses the future-oriented studies: l) Higher resolution remote sensing imagery and more in-situ water quality data will be employed to improve the models with higher degree of "goodness of fit" in linking land uses and water quality. 2) Except LULC-related variables, other controlling factors will be considered to establish the more rigorous linkage models. 3) Identifying the relationship between the buffer landscape and stream water quality will be another subject of the future study. 4) Estimating the links between land use-land cover and water quality over an extended period is crucially important job in the future works. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) The above results and analysis provide insight into the linkages between land-use practices and stream water quality, and the developed models can help in examining the relative sensitivity of water quality variables to alterations in land use made within a watershed. The predicted values are close to the actual monitored values, which indicates that with little calibration and validation, the regression model can be used in another watershed under a different geographical scale, in a different region with variable landscapes. The results of water quality comparison between different land-use structures tell us that land use types are significantly correlated to water quality variables in Wenyu River Watershed. And the Spearman's rank correlation analyses verify this conclusion, and reveal that urban and village have strong positive relationships with the water quality variables of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), phosphate (PO 4 -P) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). On the contrary, forest land represents the negative correlation with all the above variables and only positively correlates with dissolved oxygen (DO), which demenstrates that forest land is acting as a "sink" or active transformation zone. The study offers supporting evidence for previous studies and can serve as a reference to similar studies estimating the response of water quality to the land use-land cover change. The results also indicate that with the integration of GIS and ecological modeling, a decision-making support system can be developed to manage land development and control non-point sources pollution at the watershed scales. This study also suggests that if we pursue a sustainable development, the land management with respect to its development must consider the further erosion on water quality in this area. Wang, Yufei.

The methane yields of co-digestion substrates mixed at different ratios were determined by bio-methane potential tests. The highest methane yield, which was 114 % higher than the baseline, was observed when dairy manure was mixed with kitchen waste and chicken fat at the ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 (volatile solids based). The mixed substrates were then fed to a lab-scale continuous stirred-tank reactor.

The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effects of plants harvesting on nutrients removal (N, <b>P,</b> and <b>COD)</b> in constructed wetlands. This is a literature review and experimental based thesis. The literature review involved reviewing 5 studies about effect of harvesting plants in constructed wetlands. The experiment part involved data analysis from 6 experimental wetlands, with 3 wetlands that have been harvested in 2015 and 2016, another 3 wetlands that have never been harvested. Results from literature review indicated that plant harvesting in wetland has a significant effect in nutrients removal. Experiment results indicated that there was significant difference between these wetlands in TN and NO 3 -N removed when the entire operation period was considered (P= 0. 005). But when each season was considered separately statistical differences were only observed during first summer after harvesting for TN removal. For NO 3 -N, differences between wetlands were observed in first summer and winter only. For summer, harvested wetland performed better than non-harvested wetland, but in winter non-harvested wetland performed better than harvested in terms of NO 3 -N removal. For winter, the reason to this could be that, some of plants parts decay and provided denitriﬁcation bacteria with a carbon source which accelerates denitrification process. According to this study, plants harvesting in wetland generally has a positive effect on nutrient removal such as TN, TP, COD, and BOD. Therefore, this practice could be recommended as the best wetland plants management to improve and maintain nutrient removal in constructed wetlands...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} and interest towards {{the use of}} constructed floating wetlands for (waste) water treatment is emerging as more treatment opportunities are marked out, and the technique is applied more often. To evaluate {{the effect of a}} floating macrophyte mat and the influence of temperature and season on physico-chemical changes and removal, two constructed floating wetlands (CFWs), including a floating macrophyte mat, and a control, without emergent vegetation, were built. Raw domestic wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant was added on day 0. Removal of total nitrogen, NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N, P, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon and heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) was studied during 17 batch-fed testing periods with a retention time of 11 days (February-March 2007 and August 2007 -September 2008). In general, the CFWs performed better than the control. Average removal efficiencies for NH 4 -N, total nitrogen, <b>P</b> and <b>COD</b> were respectively 35 %, 42 %, 22 % and 53 % for the CFWs, and 3 %, 15 %, 6 % and 33 % for the control. The pH was significantly lower in the CFWs (7. 08 +/- 0. 21) than in the control (7. 48 +/- 0. 26) after 11 days. The removal efficiencies of NH 4 -N, total nitrogen and COD were significantly higher in the CFWs as the presence of the floating macrophyte mat influenced positively their removal. Total nitrogen, NH 4 -N and P removal was significantly influenced by temperature with the highest removal between 5 A degrees C and 15 A degrees C. At lower and higher temperatures, removal relapsed. In general, temperature seemed to be the steering factor rather than season. The presence of the floating macrophyte mat restrained the increase of the water temperature when air temperature was > 15 A degrees C. Although the mat hampered oxygen diffusion from the air towards the water column, the redox potential measured in the rootmat was higher than the value obtained in the control at the same depth, indicating that the release of oxygen from the roots could stimulate oxygen consuming reactions within the root mat, and root oxygen release was higher than oxygen diffusion from the air...|$|R

A peroral immunization with an antigen, which gives rise to a mucosal immune response, may increase the levels of circulating cytokine-producing cells, and we wanted to obtain a better picture of an eventual emergence of activated circulating T cells in the peripheral blood in children with CoD. The cytokine expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IL- 4, IL- 6 and IL- 10 was measured at the single-cell level by an ELISPOT method in 38 children with CoD. The numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells in the peripheral blood was increased in children with untreated <b>CoD</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 01) and after gluten challenge (P < 0. 05) compared with healthy controls. Also, the numbers of IL- 6 -producing cells were increased (P < 0. 05) after gluten challenge compared with the healthy controls. A paired comparison showed that the numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells increased after gluten challenge (P < 0. 05), whereas no such change was seen for IL- 4 - or IL- 10 -producing cells. There were no differences in the numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells between the group of children with treated CoD and the groups of untreated or challenged CoD children. IL- 4 production correlated with serum levels of total IgE.

In this study, efficacy and side effects of vaccination against atypical furunculosis in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) were studied in an experimental trial by using different adjuvants. The different adjuvanted vaccines were administered by intraperitoneal injection (i. <b>p.)</b> to Atlantic <b>cod.</b> The adjuvants used were CpG DNA, Aluminium hydroxide (Alhydrogel), and Freunds incomplete adjuvant (FIA). Efficacy of the vaccines and side effects were determined 12 weeks post vaccination, whereas serum antibodies were measured 15 weeks post vaccination. Vaccination of Atlantic cod against atypical furunculosis protects the fish and elicits specific antibody responses to experimental infection with atypical A. salmonicida. The atypical A. salmonicida bacterin alone resulted in very good protection (RPS= 75 %), and addition of adjuvant alone or in combination did not improve the protection significantly. This indicates that Atlantic cod can be protected against atypical furunculosis through non-adjuvanted vaccines. The injection of FIA alone gave non-specific protection, while the adjuvants CpG DNA and Aluminium hydroxide did not give any non-specific protection. The group, which received CPG DNA alone, had a higher mortality (57 %) than the saline control group (53 %). High specific antibody responses were demonstrated in all groups vaccinated with A. salmonicida bacterin. The responses were strongest in the groups, which received A. salmonicida in FIA. The study also assessed the side-effects 12 weeks vaccination. The vaccines containing FIA showed the most sever side-effects among the vaccinated group. Aluminium hydroxide showed a less degree of the intraabdominal side effects compared to FIA, but a delay in fish growth was observed...|$|R

However, there are other COD techniques which have not been investigated Therefore, the main {{aim of this study}} was to compare the performance of SS maneuver and a “By-Pass” (BP) COD maneuver (multiple short steps to avoid reduction in running speed by performing longer distance and wider angle of COD compared to SS) over several angles of COD. Seventy-three male soccer players (from U 15 and U 18 categories) competing at youth level participated in the study. Each age-category was divided into Starters Players (SP) and Non-Starters Players (NSP). Players performed a total of 26 sprints of 10 -m, either in straight-line or with a COD (5 m straight ahead and the other 5 m with a turn of 45 °, 90 °, and 135 °) using the two different maneuvers separately: SS and BP. Sprint performance was significantly better at 45 °, 90 ° and 135 ° <b>CODs</b> (<b>p</b> 3 ̆c 0. 001) when players performed a BP maneuver compared to SS. Significant age-group effects were revealed, with U 18 players demonstrating better performances (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) than U 15 players in all COD angles. Further analysis revealed a significant effect of playing-level, with SP having better performances (p 3 ̆c 0. 002) compared to NSP in all COD angles.

Correlation between natural food and carp growth was analyzed as well. The investigations revealed negative correlation between the amount of natural food per kilogram of ichthyomass and pH (p < 0. 001, r =- 0. 875), electroconductivity (p = 0. 0294, r =- 0. 673), <b>COD</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 0052, r =- 0. 782), total water hardness (p = 0. 0186, r =- 0. 709), and carbonate water hardness (p = 0. 0087, r =- 0. 758). However, statistically significant positive correlation was found between the biomass of natural food (g/kg of ichthyomass) and concentration of nitrates (p < 0. 01, r = 0. 841) and phosphates (p = 0. 0427, r = 0. 640).

40|$|Inconsistent {{experimental}} results of fatigue crack closure studies {{over the past}} 15 years have caused recent investigators {{to conclude that the}} fundamental phenomena controlling the crack driving mechanisms are not understood. A major contributor to this misunderstanding is an inadequate understanding of the complex three-dimensional nature of closure. This is true for two-dimensional thru-the-thickness cracks as well as for three-dimensional part-thru surface cracks. ^ To assess the three-dimensional influence of fatigue crack closure on the growth rate of surface flaws, an experimental investigation was conducted using a rectangular plate of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) material loaded in four-point bending. The use of transparent PMMA material and a Newton optical interferometer system with a laser light source provided the capability to simultaneously measure three-dimensional crack opening displacement (COD) profiles and closure loads (P cl). Experimental results are presented for a constant load test, a variable block loading test, and two constant stress intensity factor tests controlled along the crack free-surface and into the specimen thickness. ^ The formation of a 2 ̆ 2 void 2 ̆ 2 area internal to the crack surfaces was found to be a major factor in defining three crack types which directly influenced <b>COD,</b> <b>P</b> cl and fatigue crack growth. The three experimentally determined crack types and three distinct closure loads are used to establish corresponding definitions of effective stress intensity factor (ΔK eff). In the closure load region, current prediction models are hypothesized to underestimate K along most of the crack tip boundary due to the different crack types. The crack P cl, P cl/P max and fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) data are presented as a function of crack length. ^ FCGR data are compared using applied ΔK and several definitions of ΔK eff. Selection from several effective load ranges definitions for calculating ΔK eff is based on the best correlation of FCGR data. The use of ΔK eff for predicting fatigue cycles was found to be of superior accuracy over applied ΔK. ^ COD predictions for surface cracks using the weight function approach were found to underestimate displacement amplitude and to not adequately model profile distributions away from the crack tip. ...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to investigate: a) the {{potential}} involvement of the fish lateral line system in hearing at 250 Hz and b) the possible regeneration of the inner ear hair cells in the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The inner ear and lateral line system of the Atlantic cod were inactivated using ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotics by injection (gentamicin) or bath (gentamicin and streptomycin), respectively. Hearing thresholds were measured in the fish using the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) technique at 10, respectively 17 - 20 days following antibiotic treatment. Results were compared between groups of individuals i) with inner ear damage, ii) with lateral line system altered, iii) placebo (immersion in fresh sea water) and iv) control. The sound stimuli applied were series of 2000 five-cycle (2 - 1 - 2) 250 Hz tone bursts delivered using a Brüel & Kjær (Nærum, Denmark) loudspeaker. ABRs were measured using a filter set at 30 - 3000 Hz, a gain of 100 000 and visual interpretation using the Bio-Logic AEP software. Sound stimulus level was reduced until threshold was attained. To check the tissue status of the inner ear and lateral line system, hair cells from sensory maculae were visualized using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Ten days after treatment, hearing thresholds of placebo and lateral line damaged cods did not differ from controls fish (p = 0. 387 and p = 0. 095, respectively), whereas the fish that received intravenous gentamicin injection had significantly elevated hearing thresholds compared to controls (p < 0. 0001). SEM analyses further demonstrated that, 10 days following antibiotic treatment, cod inner ear hair cells were damaged, as well as lateral line hair cells and more particularly in the case of canal neuromasts. There was no hearing effect or microscopic tissue damage in untreated fish. From the 17 th day after treatment, ABR measurements showed that some of the gentamicin treated fish had regained hearing thresholds comparable to the control <b>cods</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 535), and this was associated with an apparent regeneration of hair cells in the sensory maculae of their inner ear. This study indicates a capacity for inner ear hair cell regeneration in Atlantic cod, and illustrates the advantages of the ABR-method for investigation of fish hearing after intervention on the inner ear, and during the hair cell regeneration process. The present work further suggests that the lateral line system is not involved in cod hearing at 250 Hz. Peer reviewe...|$|R
