In October 2003, the director of Battambang Airport, Prum Chantha, reported that Royal Phnom Penh Airways had accumulated $1million in unpaid taxes. Chakrapong suspended domestic flights between Phnom Penh and Battambang as foreign tourists opted for land transport options to provincial capitals which were cheaper than air transport. Royal Phnom Penh Airways had already become bankrupt by March 2006 when the government presented Chakrapong a bill of $1.36 million in unpaid taxes, navigation, and landing fees.

The empirical results show that social security retirement benefits depress <b>personal</b> <b>saving</b> by approximately 13. 5 thousand yen per capita in real terms from 1951 to 1982. However, declining labor force participation of the elderly (i. e., earlier retirement), stimulates <b>personal</b> <b>saving</b> by an estimated. 5 thousand yen over the same period.

In addition this study has identified a negative interdependency between the <b>personal</b> <b>saving</b> and labor retirement behaviors; that is, an individual saves more before retirement if he expects to stay a shorter time in the labor market, and vice versa.

Two major factors suggest the decline in the <b>personal</b> <b>saving</b> rate may not be as alarming as it is sometimes made out to be. First, various measurement problems with the <b>personal</b> <b>saving</b> rate from the national income and product accounts suggest household saving may not have declined as much as the statistics suggest.
