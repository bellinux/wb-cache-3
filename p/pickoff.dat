5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a <b>pickoff,</b> a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. <b>Pickoff</b> attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the <b>pickoff</b> attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1998, Young was {{involved}} in a combined no-hitter when he pitched into the fifth inning against Moisés E. Molina High School and was relieved by Mike Matthews. Highland Park won this game, which was the clinching Region II best-of-3 bi-district series game, by the 10-run rule. Young displayed home run power as a senior, and in some games, he played designated hitter. Later that month, Young pitched another no-hitter in another 10-run rule victory, this time against Carthage High School. Young was the starting pitcher at UFCU Disch-Falk Field during the Texas state 4A championship game victory against Calallen High School, and he clinched the game with a successful <b>pickoff</b> move. He was selected to the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association 1998 All-State baseball team as well as The Texas Sports Writers Association third-team Class 4A all-state baseball.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2008 season, he led {{the majors}} in <b>pickoffs</b> with 15, tying the Major League record since the stat was first tracked in 1987.http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-basesituation-pitching.shtml ...|$|R
5000|$|Garvin {{began his}} {{pitching}} career with four wins {{by the end}} of April, the first rookie to do so in baseball history. He was battling influenza when he was defeated by the Yankees on June 30, his fourth consecutive loss. [...] He finished the season with a record of 10-18, and became known for his ability to pick off runners at first. In fact, Garvin established an unofficial Major League record of 26 <b>pickoffs</b> in the 1977 season, although this was not recognized in the record books; official statistics had never distinguished between <b>pickoffs</b> and runners caught stealing by any other method.|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, he was 0–2 with a 3.79 ERA in 67 {{games in}} which he pitched 59.1 innings. [...] He led all relief {{pitchers}} with 5 <b>pickoffs,</b> and led American League relievers with 7 caught stealing.|$|R
5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch <b>pickoff</b> throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{scoreless}} {{through the first}} two innings. Detroit took a three-run lead {{in the third inning}} which started when Curtis Granderson walked, advanced on a ground out, and scored on a single by Magglio Ordóñez to center field. Ordóñez was then brought home via a two-run home run by Tigers' first baseman Miguel Cabrera. The Twins responded {{in the bottom of the}} inning, with Matt Tolbert singling to lead off the inning, advancing to second base on a single by Denard Span, and then moving to third on a flyball out. Tigers' starter Rick Porcello attempted a <b>pickoff</b> throw to first which hit the baserunner Span and went past the first baseman Cabrera. Span was out but Tolbert was able to score on Porcello's throwing error.|$|E
5|$|Game 3 {{matched the}} Giants' Juan Marichal against Johnny Podres, though Dodgers' manager Walt Alston had {{considered}} starting reliever Larry Sherry. The pair kept the game scoreless through two innings before the Giants opened the scoring {{in the top}} of the third. José Pagán singled to lead off the inning, Marichal reached on a throwing error by the pitcher on a throw to second base which allowed Pagán to move to third, and Pagán scored on a Harvey Kuenn single. Then, while Chuck Hiller was batting, John Roseboro made an error in attempting to <b>pickoff</b> Marichal on second base, allowing him to advance to third. Hiller hit a fly ball to shallow left field and Marichal held at third base. Left fielder Duke Snider threw home but the ball was cut off by the third baseman, who threw to second to try to catch Kuenn in a rundown between first and second. However, the second baseman's throw to first hit Kuenn in the back, leaving him safe at first and allowing Marichal to score, to make the game 2–0. Felipe Alou then singled, Kuenn went to third, and Alou advanced to second on the throw. Podres intentionally walked Willie Mays to load the bases with one out, and induced a double play from Orlando Cepeda to end the inning.|$|E
50|$|Rogers {{is second}} all-time in <b>pickoffs</b> with 93 in his career. On May 9, 2008 against the New York Yankees, Rogers picked off Wilson Betemit {{in the second}} inning for his 92nd pick-off, passing Mark Langston.|$|R

5000|$|In game 1 South Africa were {{overpowered}} {{by international}} powerhouse Cuba, giving up 6 {{home runs in}} an 8-1 loss. The South African defence was a bright point in the match however, turning three double plays and 2 <b>pickoffs.</b>|$|R
25|$|A special type of integrator, used at a {{point where}} only {{moderate}} accuracy was needed, was based on a steel ball, instead of a disc. It had two inputs, one to rotate the ball, and the other to define the angle of the ball's rotating axis. That axis was always in a plane that contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball computer mouse (in this mechanism, the <b>pickoff</b> rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The <b>pickoff</b> roller axes were at right angles.|$|E
25|$|While most {{throws a}} first baseman must make {{go to the}} right, which a {{left-hander}} can generally accomplish with greater speed and fluency, this is a relatively small factor {{to the advantage of}} a left-handed first baseman. More important advantages are related to the position of a left-handed first baseman with respect to the base. First, a left-handed first baseman has an advantage over his right-handed counterpart when catching a <b>pickoff</b> throw from the pitcher—when a first baseman is in <b>pickoff</b> position, {{standing in front of the}} bag, the left-hander can catch the ball and make a tag without having to move his arm across his body. (See the picture in the Strategy over the course of the game section below for the standard <b>pickoff</b> position with a right-handed first baseman.) Second, because the first baseman starts most plays with his left leg closer to the base, the left-hander does not have to make a half-pivot to get into the correct position to stretch out for a throw. For these reasons, left-handed throwers are far more common at first base than in the general population of baseball players. In contrast, cricket is fielded in the round: the handedness of the fielder in any given position is of far less consequence due to the priority being placed on catching rather than throwing, coupled with the fact that the batsmen are running in opposite directions and both left-handed and right-handed throwers are found in all parts of the field.|$|E
25|$|Brock {{remained}} {{best known}} for base-stealing and starting Cardinals rallies. He {{was said to have}} disdained Maury Wills' method of base-stealing, instead shortening his leads and going hard. He was also an early student of game films. He used an 8mm movie camera from the dugout to film opposing pitchers and study their windups and <b>pickoff</b> moves to detect weaknesses he could exploit.|$|E
25|$|Pettitte went 14–13 with a 4.20 ERA {{during the}} 2006 {{season as the}} Astros missed the playoffs. He led the NL in starts (35), tied for seventh in <b>pickoffs</b> (4), and was eighth in double plays induced (26), and tenth in strikeouts (178) and batters faced (929).|$|R
50|$|Kentucky's defense, {{particularly}} {{defensive back}} Marcus McWilson, A.J. Stamps and Ashely Lowery, kept the Commodores from scoring again with timely <b>pickoffs.</b> The Wildcats held the Commodores to just 57 second-half yards and 139 total, the fewest total yards Kentucky {{has given up}} to an SEC opponent since Vanderbilt had 91 in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Jerry Garvin of the Toronto Blue Jays {{successfully}} {{picked off}} 23 runners in 1977, the single-season MLB record. Garvin (1977, vs Oakland) shares the single game record with Bill Wight (1956, for Baltimore vs the New York Yankees), each having picked off four opposing baserunners. The all-time record holder is Steve Carlton, who had 146 <b>pickoffs</b> during his career.|$|R
25|$|Pettitte's {{pitching}} repertoire {{included a}} four-seam and cut fastball and several off-speed pitches {{such as a}} slider, curveball, and changeup. A left-handed pitcher, he had an exceptional <b>pickoff</b> move to first base, which allowed him to record 98 career pickoffs. Among Yankees pitchers, Pettitte ranks first in strikeouts (2,020), third in wins (219), and tied for first in games started (438). He won the most games of any pitcher in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Pettitte {{throws a}} four-seam fastball, a cutter a curveball, a sinker, a changeup to {{right-handed}} batters, and a slider. His out pitch is a cutter at 84–88mph with good inside break on right-handed batters, {{resulting in a}} lot of ground ball outs and double plays. Before his original 2011 retirement, his fastball was measured in the lower 90s and his curveball was about 74–76mph. As a left-handed pitcher, Pettitte has an exceptional <b>pickoff</b> move to first base, allowing him to record 100 career pickoffs.|$|E
25|$|In Game 2, it was James Shields who got {{the start}} against C. J. Wilson. With runners on the corners in the 3rd inning, Shields went to 1st base for a <b>pickoff</b> attempt, but the throw over was errant, {{allowing}} the runner to score from 3rd base. Ian Kinsler launched a solo homer to left in the 4th, putting Texas up 2–0. In the 5th, Shields {{was removed from the}} game with two on and one out, being replaced by Chad Qualls to face Michael Young. With a 2–2 count, Young checked his swing on a pitch that was called a ball. The Rays appealed to first base umpire Jerry Meals, but Meals ruled that Young held up in time, drawing the ire of the Rays dugout. Replays showed that Young may not have checked in time, and had the ruling been made that he did not, it would have resulted in a strikeout. Instead, Young went deep to center on the very next pitch for a 3-run home run, putting the Rangers up 5–0. Rays manager Joe Maddon went out to the mound to talk to his pitcher after the home run, but began arguing with home plate umpire Jim Wolf about the check swing, which led to Wolf ejecting Maddon from the game. Texas added another run in the 6th inning, and held the Rays scoreless, winning 6–0 and taking a commanding 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series.|$|E
50|$|On August 17, he was {{recalled}} {{and recorded}} the loss in season debut that night against the Minnesota Twins allowing six runs on ten hits in three innings.

500|$|Davis {{started the}} season slowly, but then began hitting, getting one homer {{in each of}} three games of a four-game span in mid-April. On May 24, he had the second-lowest batting average (.159) of all {{qualified}} major leaguers. As of June 15, he had raised his batting average to [...]188. On June 18, Davis hit his first career grand slam against Jake Arrieta of the Orioles. The grand slam also extended his hitting streak to 9 games, and Davis hit [...]462 (12-for-26) during the span. After the hot streak Davis cooled and again struggled. Davis was ejected from a Major League game {{for the first time}} in his career on June 26, when he argued with umpire Manny Gonzalez after Steve Clevenger was ruled safe at first on a <b>pickoff</b> attempt. In June, he had 10 consecutive extra-base hits (five home runs and five doubles), the second-longest such streak in Mets history.|$|E
500|$|Day was {{discovered}} by Herbert [...] "Rap" [...] Dixon, a former Negro leagues baseball player and manager of the Black Sox, who took notice of his exceptional fielding and pitching abilities. In early 1934, Day was signed to a professional baseball contract worth $60 per month, gaining valuable insight during the season from his teammate Lamon Yokeley. However, due to the financial instability of the organization, the Black Sox disbanded {{at the end of}} the year. Day, Dixon, Yokeley, and other high-profile teammates subsequently signed with the Brooklyn Eagles in 1935. There, Day was mentored on his <b>pickoff</b> move by pitcher Ted [...] "Double Duty" [...] Radcliffe. The Eagles' general manager, Ben Taylor, sensed potential in the promising prospect and incorporated Day into the starting rotation. His first regular season on the mound, Day finished with a 9–2 record, highlighted by a one-hitter, and earned his first of seven East–West All-Star Game appearances.|$|E
500|$|What was not {{publicly}} known {{during the regular}} season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres.
