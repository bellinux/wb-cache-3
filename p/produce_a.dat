5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} {{encoding}} and decoding data words including an anti-analysis encoder unit for receiving an original plaintext and <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> recoded data, a data compression unit for receiving the recoded data and <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> compressed recoded data, and an encryption unit for receiving the compressed recoded data and <b>producing</b> <b>an</b> encrypted data. The recoded data has an increased non-correlatable data redundancy {{compared with the}} original plaintext in order to mask the statistical distribution of characters in the plaintext data. The system of the present invention further includes a decryption unit for receiving the encrypted data and <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> decrypted data, a data decompression unit for receiving the decrypted data and <b>producing</b> <b>an</b> uncompressed recoded data, and an anti-analysis decoder unit for receiving the uncompressed recoded data and <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> recovered plaintext that corresponds with the original plaintext...|$|R
25|$|The {{statistical}} {{likelihood of}} <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> living, frame-patterned foal by crossing two frames is 50%, the same odds of <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> living, frame-patterned foal from a frame-to-non-frame breeding which carries no risk of <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> lethal white syndrome foal. Therefore, breeding two frame overos conveys no benefit to breeders hoping to produce another frame overo.|$|R
