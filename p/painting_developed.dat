5|$|The {{region is}} well known for its Golconda and Hyderabad {{painting}} styles which are branches of Deccani <b>painting.</b> <b>Developed</b> during the 16th century, the Golconda style is a native style blending foreign techniques and bears some similarity to the Vijayanagara paintings of neighbouring Mysore. A significant use of luminous gold and white colours is generally found in the Golconda style. The Hyderabad style originated in the 17th century under the Nizams. Highly influenced by Mughal painting, this style makes use of bright colours and mostly depicts regional landscape, culture, costumes and jewellery.|$|E
5|$|Architecture, {{sculpture}} and <b>painting</b> <b>developed</b> also under Italian influence {{from the beginning}} of the 16th century. A number of professionals from Tuscany arrived and worked as royal artists in Kraków. Francesco Fiorentino worked on the tomb of Jan Olbracht already from 1502, and then together with Bartolommeo Berrecci and Benedykt from Sandomierz rebuilt the royal castle, which was accomplished between 1507 and 1536. Berrecci also built Sigismund's Chapel at Wawel Cathedral. Polish magnates, Silesian Piast princes in Brzeg, and even Kraków merchants (by the mid 16th century their class economically gained strength nationwide) built or rebuilt their residencies to make them resemble the Wawel Castle. Kraków's Sukiennice and Poznań City Hall are among numerous buildings rebuilt in the Renaissance manner, but Gothic construction continued alongside for a number of decades.|$|E

25|$|Abstract {{expressionism}} is a post–World War II art {{movement in}} American <b>painting,</b> <b>developed</b> in New York in the 1940s. It {{was the first}} specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York City {{at the center of}} the western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term abstract expressionism was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates, it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine Der Sturm, regarding German Expressionism. In the United States, Alfred Barr was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by Wassily Kandinsky.|$|E

Though criticized for their conventionalism by the young avant-garde painters and critics, the most talented of the Academic painters renewed the historical genre, drawing inspiration from multiple cultures and techniques, like the Orient and the new framings made possible by the invention of photography ...|$|E

5000|$|Mehring's {{early work}} is a [...] "Washington version" [...] of {{abstract}} expressionism, with the loose handling of paint on a surface but a much more transparent use of magna paint, an acrylic <b>paint</b> <b>developed</b> by Leonard Bocour. The stylistic resemblance to Mountains and Sea by Helen Frankenthaler is obvious.|$|R
2500|$|Elements in this {{vocabulary}} {{include the}} geometrical meander or [...] "Greek key", egg-and-dart, bead and reel, Vitruvian scroll, guilloche, {{and from the}} plant world the stylized acanthus leaves, volute, palmette and half-palmette, plant scrolls of various kinds, rosette, lotus flower, and papyrus flower. Originally used prominently on Archaic vases, as figurative <b>painting</b> <b>developed</b> these were usually relegated to serve as borders demarcating edges of the vase or different zones of decoration. Greek architecture was notable for developing sophisticated conventions for using mouldings and other architectural ornamental elements, which used these motifs in a harmoniously integrated whole.|$|E
2500|$|Victorian <b>painting</b> <b>developed</b> the Hogarthian social subject, {{packed with}} moralizing detail, and the {{tradition}} of illustrating scenes from literature, into a range of types of genre painting, many {{with only a few}} figures, others large and crowded scenes like Frith's best-known works. [...] Holman Hunt's The Awakening Conscience (1853) and Augustus Egg's set of Past and Present (1858) are of the first type, both dealing with [...] "fallen women", a perennial Victorian concern. [...] As Peter Conrad points out, these were paintings designed to be read like novels, whose meaning emerged after the viewer had done the work of deciphering it. [...] Other [...] "anecdotal" [...] scenes were lighter in mood, tending towards being captionless Punch cartoons.|$|E

Patiño Díaz {{was the director of}} the old Academia de Dibujo y Pintura de San Fernando, which trained more artists {{in the state}} such as Agustín Rivera Ugalde.

In an interview with Geoform, Harwood stated, [...] "In nature most shapes {{can be reduced to}} geometric forms.

40|$|A mineral {{silicate}} <b>paint</b> {{has been}} <b>developed</b> for architectural heritage. To enhance durability, {{any type of}} organic additive has been avoided. Potassium silicate was the binder agent intended to give strong adherence and durability to stone and concretes. Incorporation of mainly anatase titanium dioxide was intended to act both as a white, bright pigment and as a photocatalyst. Reflectivity analyses on the paint in the visible-to-near infrared wavelength region show high solar heat reflection. The self-cleaning activity of the mineral paint was evaluated by the degradation of organic dyes under solar light irradiation. Anatase titania was effective in decomposing organic and airborne pollutants with the solar radiation. The optical properties and self-cleaning activity were compared with the organic binder-based paints and commercial <b>paints.</b> <b>Developed</b> <b>paints</b> possess high stability: since they contain only inorganic components that do not fade with exposure to solar radiation, photocatalytic self-cleaning capability further enhances such stability...|$|R

The paint lasts for about one week after use, but is easily washed off without damaging the surface to which it was applied. Although initially developed {{for the use of}} cyclists, it could also protect pedestrians.|$|R
