5|$|The second {{version of}} The Wounded Montenegrin was {{composed}} in 1891. It was initially owned by Arthur Toot & Sons, a London art dealer, before {{coming into the}} possession of the Salon. Afterwards, it entered into a <b>private</b> <b>collection,</b> and remained in private ownership until 1989, when it was auctioned off at Sotheby's. Between 1989 and 1997, it was housed at a museum in Rome, but sold again thereafter. It is currently in a <b>private</b> <b>collection.</b>|$|E
5|$|The third version, {{composed}} after 1900, {{is part of}} a <b>private</b> <b>collection.</b> The fourth, {{painted in}} the 1920s, was in a <b>private</b> <b>collection</b> until World War II. After the war, it was confiscated by the communists. Following the death of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, it was put on display at Tito's mausoleum, the House of Flowers. It is currently on display at the Museum of Yugoslav History, and catalogued under the inventory code 59 R.|$|E

5|$|In April 1766 {{parts of}} the town were {{destroyed}} by a fire and the Linnean <b>private</b> <b>collection</b> was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the <b>private</b> <b>collection</b> to the museum.|$|E
5|$|A <b>private</b> <b>collection</b> of Lyon's papers, {{along with}} those of his wife, is held at the University of Notre Dame Archives. It {{comprises}} correspondence, papers, notes, manuscripts, letters, articles, and speeches, as well as articles collected by Lyon and a scrapbook of his wife's college life and more.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the <b>private</b> <b>collection</b> was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the <b>private</b> <b>collection</b> rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E

5|$|In 1784 the {{botanist}} James Edward Smith purchased {{nearly all}} of the Linnean private scientific effects from the widow and daughter of Carl Linnaeus and transferred them to London. Not all material in Linné's <b>private</b> <b>collection</b> was transported to England. Thirty-three fish specimens preserved in alcohol were not sent and were later lost.|$|E
5|$|The artwork took an {{estimated}} {{three months to}} paint, and it was greatly admired at the time. It was also bought for the highest price Millais had received from dealer and publisher Ernest Gambart - the lucrative sum of 100 guineas. Later, in 1898, William Hesketh Lever purchased the work for his <b>private</b> <b>collection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although The Wrestlers was {{probably}} exhibited {{as part of}} a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went into a <b>private</b> <b>collection</b> and was not publicly exhibited again for almost a century. In 1947 it was put on sale; with little interest from commercial galleries owing to its subject, it was bought for the bargain price of 30guineas by the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.|$|E

5|$|Another {{strikingly similar}} portrait, {{depicting}} a woman also credited as Jane– although the costume differs slightly– was {{once owned by}} Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, but is now in an undisclosed <b>private</b> <b>collection.</b> Owing to similarities between the two works, Edwards suggests they are both copies of a lost original, perhaps completed by the same studio. A third copy, once owned by the English costume designer Herbert Norris, is known through records, although its whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, Sullivan {{scholars}} Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry {{announced that}} they had discovered a nearly complete orchestration – lacking only the second violin part – in a <b>private</b> <b>collection</b> of early band parts. These materials, with a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part, were later published and professionally recorded. This piece has now been performed {{a number of times}} by amateur and professional companies, although it has not become a standard addition to the traditional scores or recordings.|$|E

The museum also has a sculptured garden, an ice café and a teddy bear shop. Special events are arranged at Easter and Christmas.|$|E
