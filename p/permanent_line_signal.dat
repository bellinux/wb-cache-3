50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is a {{class of}} {{telecommunications}} <b>signaling</b> protocols. <b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from calling party to called party and vice versa. After an off-hook, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the calling party as well. While register <b>signaling</b> occurs, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> remains quiescent unless the calling party goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|R

25|$|As most cave diving {{is done in}} an {{environment}} where there is no free surface with breathable air allowing an above-water exit, it is critically important {{to be able to find}} the way out before the breathing gas runs out. This is ensured by the use of a continuous guideline between the dive team and outside of the flooded cave, and diligent planning and monitoring of gas supplies. Two basic types of guideline are used: <b>permanent</b> <b>lines,</b> and temporary <b>lines.</b> <b>Permanent</b> <b>lines</b> may include a main line starting near the entrance/exit, and side lines or branch lines, and are marked to indicate the direction to the nearest exit. Temporary lines include exploration lines and jump lines.|$|R
40|$|There are {{two reasons}} for {{studying}} the possible role of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in relation to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The first is the recent demonstration by Alspaugh and co-workers that EBV infection of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes induces the development in these cells of a nuclear antigen against which most patients with RA have precipitating antibodies (I). The second reason is that EBV is a naturally occurring, polyclonal activator of antibody production by human B lymphocytes (2, 3). In the present experiments, we have asked to what extent RA and normal subjects have B lymphoeytes which can be induced by EBV to secrete anti-IgG antibodies. At the same time, we have determined {{the degree to which}} lymphoeytes from RA patients spontaneously transform in the absence of EBV infection. EBV nucleic acid can be detected in most <b>permanent</b> <b>lines</b> of human B cells (4). In most cases, therefore, EBV plays an essential role in the in vitro transformation of human B cells to <b>permanent</b> <b>lines.</b> If RA lymphocytes undergo morphologic transformation and become <b>permanent</b> <b>lines</b> more readily than do normal lymphocytes, one might wonde...|$|R
