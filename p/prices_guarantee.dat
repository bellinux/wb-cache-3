We use techniques drawn from the theory of complex networks to show how contagion can propagate under different scenarios when the topology of the financial system, {{the characteristics of the}} financial institutions, and the regulations on capital are let vary. First, we benchmark our results using a simple model of contagion as the one that has been popularized by Gai and Kapadia (2010). Then, we provide a richer model in which both short- and long-term interbank markets exist. By doing so, we study how liquidity shocks (de) stabilize the system under different market conditions. Our results demonstrate how connectivity, the topology of the markets and the characteristics of the financial institutions interact in determining the stability of the system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{analysis}} investigates how Cournot competition {{operates in}} an economy in which a graph describes the set of feasible trading relationships. A general equilibrium model is presented in which individuals choose how much to sell to each player {{to which they are}} directly connected to. <b>Prices</b> <b>guarantee</b> that at each node the net-demand of goods clears such supply. In such markets the primitives dictate whether a person buys, sells or retails. This paper: (1) provides su ¢ cient conditions for pure strategy equilibrium existence; (2) characterizes equilibrium prices, ows and markups; (3) studies the welfare e¤ects of changes in the network structure; and (4) provides necessary and su ¢ cient conditions for such an economy to become competitive as the trading network grows large. The main results show that: (a) linked players with di¤erent marginal rates of substitution may not trade; (b) adding trading relationships may have negative consequences on individual and social welfare; and (c) no economy in which a positive amount of goods is resold can ever be competitive. The consequences of individuals choosing how much to buy are also explored...|$|E
40|$|Type of this {{research}} is survey research, which is done in Hypermart located in the base floor of Malang Town Square (MATOS) at Jl. Veteran No. 2 Malang Jawa-Timur under the title “Analysis of Factors Influencing Consumers’ Decision to Shopping in Hypermart of Malang”. The purpose of {{this research}} is to know what kinds of factors influencing consumers to shopping in Hypermart of Malang are and which the dominant factor influencing consumers’ decision to shopping in Hypermart of Malang is. Typically, The research significance to be reached by the company is it can be applied as informational and consideration materials to develop its business to deal with the competition and as the fundamental to make a decision in accordance with the consumers attracting strategy for shopping in Hypermart of Malang. The analysis instrument used in this research is factors analysis means, that is an analysis used to reduce and to resume multiple variables into one or some factor only. This process is identical with the factor excavation from the available sets of variables. Based on the result of factor analysis, which has been done, hence it can be produced 7 core factors that influencing consumers’ decision to shopping in Hypermart of Malang. Those seven factors include preference group, support facilities and advertisement, motivation, promotion, product guarantee, location and price, and also beliefs on products. Preference group factor is the dominant factor influencing consumers’ decision to shopping in Hypermart of Malang. Some suggestions can be given in this research are it is expected that the company willing to try harder to give guarantee to product quality and the given service, so that it can create good image for the consumers over the existence of Hypermart of Malang. Therefore, consumers can communicate the positive information to the other consumers’ candidates. The steps is done in order to grow public beliefs and used as the reference of consideration for the consumers’ candidate to shopping in it with the consideration of good quality guarantee and concerning to its service and the fullness of the offered products. So that, it can make Hypermart of Malang to be the bigger shopping center in Malang City. It is expected that the company will increase its progressed advertisement activities by using the available media and will provide the secure parking area facility, so that it gives pleasure on the consumers’ when they are shopping. It is expected to be more motivate the consumers to shopping in Hypermart of Malang through the applied price police, such as giving discount on some certain products and the cheaper <b>prices</b> <b>guarantee...</b>|$|E

40|$|Offers by {{retailers}} to match or beat a competitor's lower price are ubiquitous in both consumer and industrial markets. The conventional {{understanding of these}} practices is that such firms are attempting to be as competitive as possible by selling at the lowest price in the market. Numerous game theoretic models have shown however that, on the contrary, low <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> may be anti-competitive devices which facilitate cartel pricing. Knowing that any attempts to undercut will be instantaneously matched, sellers have no incentive to compete on price. This research project is the first, to my knowledge, that empirically examines the role of low <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> in markets with low search costs. This dissertation employs a number of tests to explore areas of <b>price</b> <b>guarantee</b> behaviour {{that have yet to}} be examined in the published literature, such as price position, seller service quality and price dispersion.

40|$|The {{globalization}} hazard hypothesis {{maintains that}} the current account reversals and asset price collapses observed during 'Sudden Stops' are caused by global capital market frictions. A policy implication of this view is that Sudden Stops can be prevented by offering global investors <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> on emerging markets assets. These guarantees, however, introduce a moral hazard incentive for global investors, thus creating a tradeoff by which <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> weaken globalization hazard but strengthen international moral hazard. This paper studies the quantitative implications of this tradeoff using a dynamic stochastic equilibrium asset-pricing model. Without guarantees, distortions induced by margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by Fisher's debt-deflation mechanism. <b>Price</b> <b>guarantees</b> prevent this deflation by introducing a distortion that props up foreign demand for assets. Non-state-contingent guarantees contain Sudden Stops but they are executed often and induce persistent asset overvaluation. Guarantees offered only in high-debt states are executed rarely and prevent Sudden Stops without persistent asset overvaluation. If the elasticity of foreign asset demand is low, <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> can still contain Sudden Stops but domestic agents obtain smaller welfare gains at Sudden Stop states and suffer welfare losses on average in the stochastic steady state. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Sudden Stops to capital inflows in emerging economies {{may be caused}} by global capital market frictions, such as collateral constraints and trading costs, suggests that Sudden Stops could be prevented by offering <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> on the emerging-markets asset class. Providing these guarantees is a risky endeavor, however, because they introduce a moral-hazard-like incentive similar to those that are also viewed as a cause of emerging markets crises. This paper studies this financial frictions-moral hazard tradeoff using an equilibrium asset-pricing model in which margin constraints, trading costs, and ex-ante <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> interact in the determination of asset prices and macroeconomic dynamics. In the absence of guarantees, margin calls and trading costs create distortions that produce Sudden Stops driven by occasionally binding credit constraints and Irving Fisher’s debt-deflation mechanism. <b>Price</b> <b>guarantees</b> contain the asset deflation by creating another distortion that props up the foreign investors’ demand for emerging markets assets. Quantitative simulation analysis shows the strong interaction of these two distortions in driving the dynamics of asset prices, consumption and the current account. <b>Price</b> <b>guarantees</b> are found to be effective for containing Sudden Stops but at the cost of introducing potentially large distortions that could lead to ‘overvaluation’ of emerging markets assets.

40|$|Capital {{markets have}} {{witnessed}} {{a rash of}} `Sudden Stops' during the last decade. Policy proposals to prevent these crises include creating indexed bond markets and providing <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> for emerging market assets. Chapter 1 explores the macroeconomic implications of indexed bonds with a return indexed to the key variables driving emerging market economies such as terms of trade or productivity. We employ a quantitative model of a small open economy in which Sudden Stops are driven by the financial frictions inherent to world capital markets. While indexed bonds provide a hedge to income fluctuations and can undo the effects of financial frictions, they lead to interest rate fluctuations. Due to this tradeoff, there exists a non-monotonic relation between the "degree of indexation" (i. e., {{the percentage of the}} shock reflected in the return) and the overall effects of these bonds on macroe- conomic fluctuations. Therefore, indexation can improve macroeconomic conditions only if the degree of indexation is less than a critical value. When the degree of indexation is higher than this threshold, it strengthens the precautionary savings motive, increases consumption volatility and impact effect of Sudden Stops. The threshold degree of indexation depends on the volatility and persistence of income shocks as well as the relative openness of the economy. Chapter 2 explores the implications of asset <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> provided by an international financial organization on the emerging market assets. This policy is motivated by the globalization hazard hypothesis, which suggest that Sudden Stops caused by global financial frictions could be prevented by offering foreign investors <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> on emerging markets assets. These guarantees create a trade- off, however, because they weaken globalization hazard while creating international moral hazard. We study this tradeoff using a quantitative, equilibrium asset-pricing model. Without guarantees, margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by a Fisherian deflation. <b>Price</b> <b>guarantees</b> prevent this deflation by propping up foreign demand for assets. The effectiveness of <b>price</b> <b>guarantees,</b> their distor- tions on asset markets, and their welfare implications depend critically on whether the guarantees are contingent on debt levels and on the price elasticity of foreign demand for domestic assets...|$|R
