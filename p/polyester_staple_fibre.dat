The crimp introduced is not stable and is gradually lost in the ensuing stages of processing. Textured <b>polyester</b> <b>staple</b> <b>fibres</b> are blended with cotton, and their processing behaviour {{with respect to the}} surfacegeometry components throughout the whole process is studied. The helicoidal waviness of the textured fibres favours hooking with other fibres of the blend or among themselves.

There are states that export material of <b>Polyester</b> <b>Staple</b> Fiber to Indonesia like China, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia and India. Among those states, dumping practices was found in Indonesian International trade which is implementing by the exporters. Dumping occur when a foreign company sells a product to the another state at less than fairmarket value. Loss caused to states who imports goods which contain dumping, therefor dumping is prohibited in International trade which have been mentioned by World Trade Organization (WTO). Dumping was done by China in the exporting activity of <b>Polyester</b> <b>Staple</b> Fiber. The lower price that is provided of China 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Polyester</b> <b>Staple</b> Fiber {{is the reason that}} makes the Indonesian consumer interested of buying it more than the inland production. That thing decrease the market share of the inland producers company and caused loss. To anticipate the increasing of loss, Indonesian Fiber Synthetic Producer Association (APSYFI) made a petition to the Indonesian Antidumping Committee. The petition of Indonesian Fiber Synthetic Producer Association (APSYFI) that was represented by two national <b>Polyester</b> <b>Staple</b> Fiber company which are PT.

The experiment control was acquired from the right contralateral member of each animal. The immobilization of the left posterior member was done by adapted orthesis.

50|$|In {{core type}} {{friction}} spinning, the core, {{made of a}} filament or a bundle of <b>staple</b> <b>fibres,</b> is false twisted by the spinning drum. The sheath fibres are deposited on the false twisted core surface and are wrapped helically over the core with varying helix angles. It is believed that the false twist in the core gets removed once the yarn is emerged from the spinning drums, so that this yarn has a virtually twist-less core. However, {{it is quite possible}} for some amount of false twist to remain {{in the fact that the}} sheath entraps it during yarn formation in the spinning zone.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} fibre volume {{fraction}} {{on the physical}} and tensile properties of aligned plant fibre composites (PFCs) produced via vacuum infusion has been investigated. There is no clear correlation between fibre volume fraction and porosity. However, low fibre content PFCs are prone to intra-yarn voids, while high fibre content PFCs are prone to inter-yarn voids. This is due to changing resin flow dynamics with increasing fibre content. The tensile behaviour of PFCs with increasing fibre content {{is similar to that}} of conventional fibre reinforced plastics (FRPs). Interestingly, the non-linear stress–strain response of plant fibres has been transferred to the composites. Fibre content and tensile properties are found to be linearly related, as per the rule of mixtures. A void content of up to 4 % is found to have minimal effect on the tensile properties of PFCs. The minimum and critical (vf,crit) fibre volume fractions for aligned flax and jute–polyester composites are found to be substantially higher than conventional aligned FRPs; vf,crit for jute–polyester and carbon–polyester is 8. 1 % and 2. 4 %, respectively. A simple model has also been developed to approximate the theoretical maximum obtainable fibre volume fraction of PFCs reinforced with <b>staple</b> <b>fibre</b> yarns. The absolute theoretical maximum fibre content is found to be 58. 9 %, which agrees with experimental values in literature. A high vf,crit (∼ 10 %) and low vf,max (∼ 45 %) implies that the range of useful fibre volume fractions for PFCs containing <b>staple</b> <b>fibre</b> twisted yarns is only 35 %...|$|R
