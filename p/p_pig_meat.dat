40|$|The {{microbiological}} quality of food {{of animal origin}} is receiving widespread scrutiny as outbreaks of food-borne disease are increasingly reported in developed countries. In Australia, the pig industry has embarked on a national program to define and enhance the quality, including {{microbiological quality}}, of <b>pig</b> <b>meat.</b> The National <b>Pig</b> <b>Meat</b> Hygiene Program (PMHP) is part of this initiative, and aims to develop baseline data for microorganisms on <b>pig</b> <b>meat,</b> including public health pathogens, and to develop and implement management strategies to enhance the microbial quality of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> production.

40|$|The <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> {{market in}} Australia is {{characterized}} by generic (fresh pork, bacon etc.) advertising. These advertising expenditures are funded from collective levies from pig producers. At the same time, there are extensive brand advertising activities in the <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> market. Whether or not {{there has been an}} impact of advertising on <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> consumption has been a long-standing argument. Moreover, producers are concerned about the levies they have paid. So far, there have been several studies done on the effectiveness of generic <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> advertising in Australia and pig producers welfare. However, the previous studies only looked at generic advertising and didn't account for other media information such as brand advertising and fast food advertising effects on meat consumption. As well, the previous studies are contradictory about the historical effects of generic <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> advertising. In this study, a simultaneous model that links the production and marketing of <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> is established to estimate the relationship between advertising, consumption of <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> and welfare of pig producers for the period of 1985 - 1997. The model consists of a two-stage demand system derived from a translog indirect utility function for five meats: beef, lamb, chicken, pork and bacon and ham, a single supply equation and a single demand equation for <b>pigs,</b> a <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> trade equation and a retail farm price linkage equation. The simultaneous results show that current advertising on pork is more effective than the current advertising on bacon & ham. In terms of the Australian pig industry's marketing strategies, the study suggests that more money should be invested m pork advertising, but less money should be invested in bacon & ham advertising.

40|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>meat</b> {{off-flavor}} {{is attributed}} to trimethylamine (TMA) concentration, and it is considered as the precursor of the fishy off-flavor problems. In this study, TMA concentrations in <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> were determined, and the interactions with breed and gender effects were discussed. In addition, the TMA threshold for <b>meat</b> off-flavor and <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> natural quality was measured in relation to meat storage and movement, and the influential factors including the pig breed and storage time were discussed. The results indicated positive effects on the precursor of the fishy off-flavor and the TMA threshold. Native breeds {{were found to have}} lower TMA concentrations than European breeds (P< 0. 01), and females and castrated males had significantly lower TMA concentration than males (P< 0. 01), The threshold concentration of TMA when meat was classed as off-flavored was 25 μg·g - 1, and this occurred after 35 – 38 h of storage. The natural qualities, such as appearance, flavor, color and overall acceptable scores declined significantly after 4 days in storage (P< 0. 01). It is concluded that <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> off-flavor, breed and gender were essential factors affecting flavor for meat breeding programs, and storage time is important for <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> natural quality...|$|R

40|$|The Australian <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> {{industry}} today competes in {{a global}} market environment, with significant quantities of both pork exports and pork imports for further processing. In March 2003 Australian Pork Limited (APL) launched a advertising campaign to raise domestic per capita consumption of pork, and increase consumer awareness and preference for identified Australian <b>pig</b> <b>meat.</b> This is funded from producer levies. Over the period 2003 to 2005, APL advertising expenditure is forecast {{to be at least}} 15 per cent above 2001 - 02 domestic advertising expenditure levels.

The economic opportunity of livestock is determined by their ability to produce lots of meat, while short time. With the increasing requirements for <b>pig</b> <b>meat</b> are also increased demands from production quality. Thus, lean meat (most requested) must come from young animals, fattened.
