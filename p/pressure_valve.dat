5|$|Shunt surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.|$|E
25|$|To reduce fuel {{vaporisation}} at {{the high}} altitudes of photographic reconnaissance variants, the central and inner wing tanks were pressurised. The pressure venting cock located behind the pilot's seat controlled the <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> As the altitude increased, the valve increased the volume applied by a pump. This system was extended to include field modifications of the fuel tank system.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve lifter shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E

50|$|In the {{petroleum}} refining, petrochemical, chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing, power generation, food, drinks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries, the term safety valve {{is associated with}} the terms <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> (PRV), <b>pressure</b> safety <b>valve</b> (PSV) and relief valve.The generic term is <b>Pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> (PRV) or <b>pressure</b> safety <b>valve</b> (PSV) It should be noted that PRVs and PSVs are not the same thing, despite what many people think; the difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to open the valve in case of emergency.|$|R

25|$|The {{stall warning}} and stall {{recovery}} systems {{were at the}} centre of the inquiry, which examined in some detail their operation and why the flight crew might have over-ridden them. A three-way air <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> (part of the stall recovery system) was found to have been one-sixth of a turn out of position, and the locking wire which secured it was missing. Calculations carried out by Hawker Siddeley determined that if the valve was in this position during the flight then the reduction in engine power for the noise abatement procedure could have activated the warning light that indicated low air pressure in the system. The failure indications might have appeared just prior to take-off and could have accounted for the two-minute delay {{at the end of the}} runway. A captain who had flown Papa India on the morning of the accident flight noted no technical problems, and the public inquiry found that the position of the valve had no significant effect on the system.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group, a USAF expert panel, {{recommended}} several {{changes to}} deal with the oxygen supply issues. In October 2011, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $24M contract to investigate the breathing difficulties. In July 2012, the Pentagon concluded that a <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> on flight vests worn during high-altitude flights and a carbon air filter were likely sources of at least some hypoxia-like symptoms. Long-distance flights were resumed, but were limited to lower altitudes until corrections had been made. The carbon filters were changed to a different model to reduce lung exposure to carbon particulates. The breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve, used to inflate the pilot's vest during high G maneuvers, was found to be defective, inflating the vest at unintended intervals and restricting the pilot's breathing. The on-board oxygen generating system (OBOGS) also unexpectedly reduced oxygen levels during high-G maneuvers. [...] In late 2012, Lockheed Martin was awarded contracts to install a supplemental automatic oxygen backup system, in addition to the primary and manual backup. Changes recommended by the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group in 2005 received further consideration in 2012; the USAF reportedly considered installing EEG brain wave monitors on the pilot's helmets for inflight monitoring.|$|E

2500|$|A {{downstream}} {{demand valve}} {{serves as a}} fail safe for over-pressurization: if a first stage with a demand valve malfunctions and jams in the open position, the demand valve will be over-pressurized and will [...] "free flow". Although it presents the diver with an imminent [...] "out of air" [...] crisis, this failure mode lets gas escape directly into the water without inflating buoyancy devices. The effect of unintentional inflation might be to carry the diver quickly to the surface causing the various injuries that can result from an over-fast ascent. There are circumstances where regulators are connected to inflatable equipment such as a rebreather's breathing bag, a buoyancy compensator, or a drysuit, but {{without the need for}} demand valves. Examples of this are argon suit inflation sets and [...] "off board" [...] or secondary diluent cylinders for closed-circuit rebreathers. When no demand valve is connected to a regulator, it should be equipped with a pressure relief valve, unless it has a built in over <b>pressure</b> <b>valve,</b> so that over-pressurization does not inflate any buoyancy devices connected to the regulator.|$|E

40|$|Risk-based {{inspection}} methods enable {{estimation of}} the probability of failure on demand for spring-operated <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valves</b> at the United States Department of Energy&#x 27;s Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina. This paper presents a statistical performance evaluation of soft seat spring operated <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valves.</b> These <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valves</b> are typically smaller and of lower cost than hard seat (metal to metal) <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valves</b> and can provide substantial cost savings in fluid service applications (air, gas, liquid, and steam) providing that probability of failure on demand (the probability that the <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> fails to perform its intended safety function during a potentially dangerous over pressurization) {{is at least as}} good as that for hard seat valves. The research in this paper shows that the proportion of soft seat spring operated <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valves</b> failing is the same or less than that of hard seat valves, and that for failed valves, soft seat valves typically have failure ratios of proof test pressure to set pressure less than that of hard seat valves...|$|R

40|$|Proportional {{pressure}} regulators are usually used in different automation processes where continuous pressure or force control is required.

A simplified dynamic model of the process has been derived, followed by a design of the PD controller for the system control.

50|$|Open-circuit {{industrial}} breathing {{sets are}} filled with filtered, compressed air, rather than pure oxygen.
