50|$|Proteins are {{biological}} macromolecules {{and function}} {{in an aqueous}} environment, so protein crystallization is predominantly carried out in water. Protein crystallization is generally considered challenging due to the restrictions of the aqueous environment, difficulties in obtaining high-quality protein samples, as well as sensitivity of protein samples to temperature, pH, ionic strength, and other factors. Proteins vary greatly in their <b>physicochemical</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and so crystallization of a particular protein is rarely predictable. Determination of appropriate crystallization conditions for a given protein often requires empirical testing of many conditions before a successful crystallization condition is found.|$|E

50|$|As above mentioned, {{combinatorial}} chemistry {{was a key}} technology enabling the efficient generation of large screening libraries {{for the needs of}} high-throughput screening. However, now, after two decades of {{combinatorial chemistry}}, it has been pointed out that despite the increased efficiency in chemical synthesis, no increase in lead or drug candidates has been reached. This has led to analysis of chemical characteristics of combinatorial chemistry products, compared to existing drugs or natural products. The chemoinformatics concept chemical diversity, depicted as distribution of compounds in the chemical space based on their <b>physicochemical</b> <b>characteristics,</b> is often used to describe the difference between the combinatorial chemistry libraries and natural products. The synthetic, combinatorial library compounds seem to cover only a limited and quite uniform chemical space, whereas existing drugs and particularly natural products, exhibit much greater chemical diversity, distributing more evenly to the chemical space. The most prominent differences between natural products and compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries is the number of chiral centers (much higher in natural compounds), structure rigidity (higher in natural compounds) and number of aromatic moieties (higher in combinatorial chemistry libraries). Other chemical differences between these two groups include the nature of heteroatoms (O and N enriched in natural products, and S and halogen atoms more often present in synthetic compounds), as well as level of non-aromatic unsaturation (higher in natural products). As both structure rigidity and chirality are both well-established factors in medicinal chemistry known to enhance compounds specificity and efficacy as a drug, {{it has been suggested that}} natural products compare favourable to today's combinatorial chemistry libraries as potential lead molecules.|$|E

50|$|Although {{inflammation}} is {{an integral}} part of granulation tissue formation, for normal tissue repair to proceed, inflammation needs to be moderated. The initial granulation tissue formed is highly inflammatory with a high rate of tissue turnover mediated by matrix degrading enzymes and reactive oxygen metabolites that are products of inflammatory cells. Stabilization of granulation tissue matrix can be achieved by moderating inflammation. HA functions as an important moderator in this moderation process, which contradicts its role in inflammatory stimulation, as described above. HA can protect against free-radical damage to cells. This may attribute to its free-radical scavenging property, a <b>physicochemical</b> <b>characteristic</b> shared by large polyionic polymers. In a rat model of free-radical scavenging property, HA has been shown to reduce damage to the granulation tissue.|$|R
