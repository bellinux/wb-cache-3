The CIA officers had a separate side {{entrance to the}} building in which the operations took place, {{in order to maintain}} the image that the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair. The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of <b>printed</b> <b>material</b> were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of every document was to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave the highest priority to the documents seized from the PGT.|$|E

5|$|Until this point, all the <b>printed</b> <b>material</b> (mostly just charts of the {{alphabet}} and its standard orthography equivalents) had been produced with large wooden type, which was not suitable for printing at small sizes. Because {{the alphabet}} was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 {{the board of regents}} appointed Erastus Snow to procure metal type from St. Louis-based font foundry Ladew & Peer. However, in May 1857 the Utah War began, and Snow left St. Louis to support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew & Peer kept working on the type, and the punches and matrices were delivered in the winter of 1858. The first use of the new type was to make a business card for George A. Smith, an early Mormon historian.|$|E

Although there were eight attempts to force a new Licensing Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded.

From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of Junius were published in the Public Advertiser, a London newspaper run by Henry Sampson Woodfall. In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including Lord Granby and Mansfield. As his letters were wildly popular, the circulation of the Public Advertiser doubled in just five months.|$|E
5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other <b>printed</b> <b>material</b> on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.|$|E
40|$|THISARTICLE EXAMINES THE multidimensionality of <b>print</b> <b>materials</b> {{in order}} to discuss utility versus value of <b>print</b> <b>materials</b> as they age. Studies of {{changing}} uses of <b>print</b> <b>materials</b> over time have shown a bias on the part of researchers in favor of the hypothesis of obsolescence, although studies have failed to conclusively support that hypothesis. Based on issues raised in previously conducted obsolescence studies, this article presents a schema of parameters (superordinate classes of contextual variables) that affect all studies of changing uses of <b>print</b> <b>materials</b> over time. Recent studies have concentrated on the age-date relationship rather than on other parameters (especially the “use ” and “users ” parameters) or they have relegated concern about these parameters to other researchers. This article argues that only by incorporating what can be learned about all the parameters of the seamless web of co-occurring events surrounding the changing uses of <b>print</b> <b>materials</b> will researchers and librarians be able {{to make use of the}} quantitative data on the declining numbers of uses of <b>print</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
