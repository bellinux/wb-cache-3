5|$|Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Mizuho Miyanokouji, a male high school student. After Mizuho's grandfather dies, his will is reviewed, which explains his desire to have his grandson transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho cross-dresses to attend the school. The headmistress, the deputy head teacher (visual novel only), Mizuho's homeroom teacher Hisako Kajiura and Mariya Mikado initially know his secret; Shion Jujo and Ichiko Takashima also eventually find this out. Mizuho is very popular among the other students, who often talk about how <b>pretty,</b> <b>nice,</b> and athletic Mizuho is. This rampant popularity escalates to him even being nominated against his will to join in on the Elder election. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, runs against Mizuho.|$|E
500|$|The {{race was}} met by anti-Trump protests in the first-stage {{finishing}} town of New Paltz, New York, where demonstrators held placards reading [...] "Fight Trumpism", [...] "Die Yuppie $cum", [...] "The Art of the Deal = The Rich Get Richer" [...] and [...] "Trump = Lord of the Flies". The 1989 race was won by the Norwegian rider Dag Otto Lauritzen of the American team 7-Eleven, although there was some controversy about the result as Belgian rider Eric Vanderaerden, who had won four stages and was expected {{to take the lead}} in the general classification in the final stage time trial in Atlantic City but took a wrong turn following a race motorbike. The Soviet rider Viatcheslav Ekimov, who took part as an amateur, won the first stage of the race (following a prologue time trial). Articles published the following year reported that Ekimov [...] "had had the nerve to win a stage as an amateur... and some pros reportedly rewarded him by jamming a feed bag into his wheel", and that he [...] "threatened to win the Tour de Trump last year as an amateur before the pros banded together to eliminate any chance he had of winning". Nonetheless, the first edition of the race was described as [...] "a smashing success" [...] in Sports Illustrated, which noted: [...] "If you could get past the name, the Tour de Trump, without losing your lunch, and if you could somehow divorce the sporting event from the excess baggage that went with it... what you had was a <b>pretty</b> <b>nice</b> bicycle race".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, the song {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. UKMIX described the song as [...] "quite blissful {{with a smooth}} vocal delivery and some <b>pretty</b> <b>nice</b> lyrics," [...] but despite {{not being able to}} fault the song, the reviewer was unsure that the song was the right choice for the Eurovision Song Contest and predicted that Tyler would suffer the same criticism that Engelbert Humperdinck received the previous year. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the song two stars out of five, stating that the song is a [...] "polar opposite to the slew of Euro-club bangers entering this year's contest," [...] but applaud Tyler for entering the Eurovision Song Contest with the contrasting song. The Guardian held a poll on their website asking the public if they expected Tyler to be successful at Eurovision. The results were fairly even with 46% predicting that Tyler would win and 54% voting that they didn't expect Tyler to win. Ann Gripper from the Daily Mirror described the song as [...] "heartfelt," [...] and {{went on to say that}} Tyler [...] "can still sing." [...] She criticised the songwriters' choice of [...] "above" [...] and [...] "stuff" [...] as the first rhyming lyrics, but noted the line [...] "you never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain" [...] as an improvement, and an opportunity to [...] "have some fun with the staging on finals night in Malmo." [...] Gripper concluded by saying that it [...] "doesn't get into your head like (2012 Sweden winning song) [...] "Euphoria"," [...] and stated that unless the staging is [...] "spectacular", the song won't be remembered by voting time.|$|E

500|$|Entering the 2005â€“06 season, Horton {{stated in}} {{response}} to a question about his shoulders, [...] "I feel better. I feel stronger, bigger." [...] In the season opener against the Atlanta Thrashers, Horton scored the first goal for the Panthers. Through the first games of the season, Horton was tied for the team lead in goals. On November 8, 2005, Horton was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury. He was activated on December 1 and scored in his first game back against the Washington Capitals to help the Panthers win 32. Horton added 2 goals against the Chicago Blackhawks in the Panthers' next game to bring his season total to 10 in 17 games. Against the Nashville Predators on December 13, Horton recorded his first career hat trick and stated after the game that, [...] "It's a <b>pretty</b> <b>nice</b> feeling. I felt like there was no one on me. I just tried to get it to the net and it went in every time." [...] Despite missing 10 games to injury, Horton was tied with teammate Olli Jokinen for the team lead in goals with 16 after 38 games. Against Washington on January 9, Horton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored a goal in the shootout to help the Panthers win 43. Two days after his shootout goal, Horton was promoted to the Panthers' first line. Despite his promotion to the first line, Horton's name was mentioned in a potential trade with the Vancouver Canucks; however, nothing materialized. [...] In a 62 win over the Ottawa Senators, Horton scored 2 goals including one on a rebound, after which he said, [...] "It just popped right out to me. It was a long time coming for goals for me. I got lucky tonight and hopefully they keep going in." [...] In March, Horton began playing in penalty kill situations for the first time in his career. Also against the Lightning, Horton scored the Panthers' only goal with his 27th goal of the season. Horton completed the season playing 71 games, scoring 28 goals and adding 19 assists.|$|E
