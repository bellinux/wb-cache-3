40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the factors that}} support the hypothesis in favor that <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> might progress into vitiligo. Patients and methodsThis observational case series study was done in Department of Dermatology-Baghdad Hospital during January 2008 –September 2009. History and examination were done. Koebner’s phenomenon was carried out for all patients on the hidden areas by blunt object, and watched for 1 – 3 months to observe the appearance of leukoderma. ResultsOne hundred thirty-four patients with <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> were included, their ages ranged from 2 to 15 (7. 9 ± 3. 3) years, family history for vitiligo was positive in 26 (19. 4 %) patients. Nineteen (14. 17 %) patients had coexistence of <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> and vitiligo lesions and showed positive wood’s light examination for vitiligo, 11 of 19 (57. 89 %) patients had positive family history for vitiligo. Only 32 (23. 88 %) of 134 patients had continued the study and follow-up, 14 (43. 75 %) patients, showed progression of their original <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> lesion into vitiligo.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> affects 1 % of {{the world}} {{population}} and about 9. 9 % {{of the children in}} Brazil. However, its etiology remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the immunoexpression of factor XIIIa in dermal dendrocytes of skin lesions of <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba.</b> METHOD: Twenty patients with <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> and 20 patients with atopic dermatitis underwent biopsy.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> is {{a common}} hypomelanosis which is {{generally}} seen in young children.

Results: The frequency of hypopigmentary disorders among children was 3. 28 per 1000 children attending the dermatology out patient department. The mean age of the children was 7. 2 years. The mean of age of onset was 7. 36 years. Most common hypopigmentary disorder in our study was <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> (24. 7 %), followed by vitiligo (20. 4 %), leprosy (11. 5 %), nevus depigmentosus (10. 18 %), and tinea versicolor (6. 2 %).

40|$|Progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH) is {{a common}} skin {{disorder}} that is often misdiagnosed. Various authors have written about similar skin disorders, referring to them by different names, but we believe that all these similar disorders {{are part of the}} same entity. PMH is characterized by ill-defined nummular, non-scaly hypopigmented spots on the trunk, often confluent in and around the midline, and rarely extending to the proximal extremities and neck/head region. There is no itch, pain, or preceding inflammation. PMH has a worldwide distribution; however, it is more often identified in Black people living in or originating from tropical countries. It is also more often seen in young females. The natural history of PMH is stable disease or perhaps slow progression over decades, with spontaneous disappearance after mid-life. Extensive <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> is probably identical with PMH and we suggest discontinuation of use of the former term on the grounds that extensive <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> is histologically and clinically different from classical <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba,</b> which is basically an eczematous type of disorder. PMH is characterized histologically by diminished pigment in the epidermis and a normal-looking dermis. Electron microscopy shows a shift from large melanosomes in normal-looking skin to small aggregated, membrane-bound melanosomes in hypopigmented skin. PMH should be differentiated from other disorders with hypopigmentation on the trunk such as pityriasis versicolor. We propose that Propionibacterium acnes bacteria living in hair follicles are the cause of PMH as a result of production of a hypothetical depigmenting factor. This hypothesis is based on: (i) the presence of a red follicular fluorescence in the hypopigmented spots and the absence of this phenomenon in normal skin when examined under a Wood's light in a dark room; (ii) cultivation of P. acnes from the follicles in the hypopigmented spots but not from follicles in normal-looking skin; and (iii) improvement of the disorder after elimination of these micro-organisms with topical antimicrobial treatment in combination with UVA light. Currently, the treatment of choice of PMH is application of 1 % clindamycin lotion during the daytime, 5 % benzoyl peroxide gel at night-time, and UVA light irradiation three times a week for a period of 12 weeks.

40|$|Background: Progressive macular hypomelanosis is {{a common}} {{hypopigmentation}} mainly on the central parts of the trunk, predominantly in young adults, especially women. It is often mistaken for pityriasis versicolor and <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba.</b> It occurs in all races and has been described {{in many parts of}} the world. We discovered follicular red fluorescence restricted to lesional skin. We suspected a relation with a porphyrin-producing bacteria residing in sebum of the pilosebaceous duct, and we therefore performed a study in 8 patients. Observation: In all biopsy specimens taken from lesional skin of 8 women, we could demonstrate gram-positive bacteria in the pilosebaceous duct, and a mild peri-follicular lymphocytic infiltrate was seen. In all but 1 patient, Propionibacterium acnes was yielded from cultured biopsy specimens taken from follicular lesional skin. Healthy follicular skin did not show bacteria in histological sections, and cultures did not yield anaerobic bacteria. Conclusions: There seems to be a relation between the presence of P acnes and the hypopigmented macules.

It involved 1, 957 students from five randomly selected primary and secondary schools. Each student was interviewed for age, gender, and family history, and a dermatologic examination was performed by a dermatologist. Data were coded and analyzed. Results :Of the students, 79. 9 % revealed at least one dermatosis. The most common disease was benign neoplasms (76 %), followed by pigmentary disorders (26. 8 %), and xerosis (5. 8 %). In primary schools, the acquired melanocytic nevus, hypopigmented macule, and xerosis; in secondary school the acne was statistically significantly more common.

40|$|Background Children up to 15 {{years of}} age {{constitute}} {{a major portion of}} our population and do suffer {{from a wide variety of}} skin diseases. Pediatric dermatology is a separate subspecialty by itself hitherto non-existing in Pakistan. The current work focuses on the audit of pediatric dermatological cases presenting in the outpatient department of Dermatology and Pediatrics, Hamdard University Hospital, Karachi, during the calendar year 2005. Objective To determine frequency of dermatoses amongst children in a hospital in Karachi. Patients and methods All patients aged below 15 years, belonging to both sexes suffering from dermatological diseases were included in the study. After a detailed history and clinical examination, a clinical diagnosis was made in each case. The patients enrolled were investigated, as well. Results A total of 830 cases of pediatric dermatology, 539 males (65 %) and 291 females (35 %) were seen during the calendar year 2005, accounting for 27. 2 % of all dermatological patients. The age range was 0. 1 - 15 years with a mean age of 8. 1 years. Scabies (21. 7 %) was the most common dermatosis reported followed by atopic eczema (21. 4 %), fungal infections (15. 7 %), urticaria (12. 1 %) and bacterial infections (8. 2 %).

Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and 2 spectrophotometric methods were used: the indirect thiobarbituric acid test and the direct N,N-diethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene-diammonium sulfate (DEPD) test. The coupling of the DEPD test with the TLC technique performed by different eluent systems allowed the detection of the specific lipoperoxides deriving from the oxidation of the different lipid classes. In the cultures, Pityrosporum was capable of peroxidating not only unsaturated free fatty acids, but also unsaturated triglycerides, cholesterol, and squalene. A similar lipid peroxidation was observed in patients with pityriasis versicolor in skin lipids from areas positive for fungal hyphae and spores and fluorescent under the UV lamp (366 nm). The lipoperoxide values were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) than in skin lipids from normal controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{has been}} divided into the "extrinsic" and "intrinsic" type, in which "intrinsic AD" {{is characterized by}} the absence of allergen-specific IgE. Still, there is no consensus whether this "intrinsic type" of AD, which we denominate as atopiform dermatitis (AFD), is a distinct entity. OBJECTIVE: A case-control study was performed to compare the clinical and diagnostic features of AD and AFD. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD were selected. Cases did not have demonstrable allergen-specific IgE. Matched control subjects were tested positive for allergen-specific IgE. Patients were evaluated for medical history, quality of life, disease severity, and Hanifin and Rajka, U. K. and Millennium diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Eight percent (n = 34) of the selected patients had, in fact, AFD. Female predominance, absence of atopic diseases, later onset of disease, and milder disease severity were observed in AFD. A history of atopy, recurrent conjunctivitis, palmar hyperlinearity, keratosis pilaris, <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba,</b> and hand and/or food eczema were significantly less present in AFD. Dennie-Morgan fold was positively associated with AFD. LIMITATIONS: Not all patients with negative allergen-specific IgE participated and {{a relatively small number of}} AFD patients were studied. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the absence of allergen-specific IgE, our findings support that AFD is an entity distinct from AD. With a distinction shown between AFD and AD, patient groups will be better defined and more homogeneous.

It is generally based on the guideline proposed by Hanifin and Rajka. Many {{studies have shown that}} some criteria are probably not all that significant in making the diagnosis. This study was designed to evaluate the frequency and diagnostic significance of clinical features of AD in Thai children. The authors studied 108 patients with AD and 103 controls including patients with other skin diseases. The AD group consisted of 60 girls and 48 boys. The mean age was 60. 3 + 36. 1 months. All previously proposed features were evaluated and the difference in frequency was tested with the chi-square test. History of pruritus, rash on typical distribution, chronically relapsing course, duration more than 6 months, personal or family history of atopy, age of onset before 2 years, recurrent conjunctivitis, itch when sweating, intolerance to rough textile, food and milk intolerance, history of dry skin, seasonal variation, visible dermatitis, dermatitis of a typical distribution, xerosis, ichthyosis vulgaris, foot dermatitis, Dennie-Morgan infraorbital fold, orbital darkening, periorbital dermatitis, <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba,</b> peri-auricular dermatitis, anterior neck fold, truncal dermatitis, perifollicular accentuation, white dermographism and diffuse scaling of scalp were all significantly more frequent in AD (p < 0. 05). A minimum set of diagnostic criteria for AD was derived by using multiple stepwise logistic regression technique. It consisted of history of itchy rash, history of flexural dermatitis, chronicity more than 6 months, and visible xerosis, periorbital dermatitis and perifollicular accentuation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dermatologic {{conditions}} have different presentation and management in pediatric age group {{from that in}} adult; this to be studied separately for statistical and population based analysis. Objective: To study the pattern of various dermatoses in infants and children in tertiary health care center in South Gujarat region. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study; various dermatoses were studied in pediatric patients up to 14 years of age attending the Dermatology OPD of New Civil Hospital, Surat, Gujarat {{over a period of}} 12 months from June 2009 to June 2010. All patients were divided into four different study groups: 1 to 6 years and 7 to 14 years. Results: There were 596 boys and 425 girls in total 1021 study populations. Majority of the skin conditions in neonates were erythema toxicum neonatorum (12. 97 %), scabies (9. 92 %), mongolian spot (9. 16 %), and seborrheic dermatitis (7. 63 %). In > 1 month to 14 years age group of children among infectious disorder, children were found to be affected most by scabies (24. 49 %), impetigo (5. 96 %), pyoderma (5. 62 %), molluscum contagiosum (5. 39 %), tinea capitis (4. 49 %), leprosy (2. 02 %), and viral warts (1. 35 %) while among non-infectious disorders, they were affected by atopic dermatitis (4. 27 %), <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> (4. 16 %), seborrheic dermatitis (3. 60 %), pityriasis rosea (3. 15 %), others (3. 01 %), phrynoderma (2. 70 %), lichen planus (2. 58 %), contact dermatitis (1. 57 %) and ichthyosis (1. 45 %). Conclusion: There is a need to emphasize on training the management of common pediatric dermatoses to dermatologists, general practitioners and pediatricians for early treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite {{having been}} {{declared}} eliminated in December 2005 from India {{as a public}} health problem, the prevalence of leprosy exceeds 1 / 10, 000 population in certain districts/states of India. A spurt in its prevalence by 60 % - from 0. 74 to 1. 18 within 1 -year from 2012 to 2013 in the area under Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) of Pune district of Maharashtra, wherein our institution is located, motivated us to carry out this study. Aims and Objectives: This prospective study entailed recording of the epidemiological data of cases of leprosy and carrying out correlation of their clinical and histopathological diagnoses as per Ridley–Jopling scale along with inclusion of indeterminate and pure neuritic types. Materials and Methods: Eighty fresh untreated patients hailing from areas under PCMC–in whom leprosy was clinically considered to be either the diagnosis or the differential diagnosis-reporting to the department of dermatology of our tertiary care hospital were enrolled. Their age, sex, and clinical findings were recorded on a proforma. Slit skin and scrape smear were stained by the Ziehl–Neelsen method. Punch biopsies–processed and stained by hematoxylin and eosin and Fite-Faraco method for morphological assessment and identification of the lepra bacilli, respectively–were evaluated histopathologically and a clinico-histopathological correlation, attempted. Results: Male to female ratio of the study patients was 2. 3 : 1; their age ranged from 14 to 74 (mean, 36. 67) years. The overall clinico-histopathological concordance observed was 70 %. Five cases of indeterminate leprosy (IL) emerged on histopathological examination from among the nine skin biopsies on patients of dermatoses mimicking leprosy (<b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba,</b> postinflammatory hypopigmentation, nevus depigmentosus, etc.). Conclusion: This study enabled us to detect additional cases of IL (from among dermatoses mimicking leprosy) and led to more accurate typing, thereby underscoring the importance of clinico-histopathological correlation as an important diagnostic aid...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of various irritant dermatitis involves {{the elimination of}} the casual or favoring factor, the control of aggravating factors, and administration of topical agents. Even though corticosteroids are extensively used in these conditions to reduce the inflammation, it can also result in undesirable side effects. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a non steroidal topical agent to be used in these conditions. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of repairing cream "RV 2427 B" in children and adults in irritant dermatitis care. Materials and Methods: In this phase III open labeled, multicenter, non-controlled, non-randomized trial, irritant dermatitis in children and adults either due to diaper rash, <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> and irritant dermatitis (eczema), perioral dermatitis, perleche or intertrigo were administered; repairing cream RV 2427 B containing a) 4 % zinc oxide, b) 2. 5 % dry colloidal oat extract, (c) 0. 5 % oat oil, (d) 0. 2 % copper sulfate, and (e) 0. 1 % zinc sulfate to be applied twice-daily in the affected area. The subjects were evaluated on day 7 and day 21 for both efficacy and tolerance and last visit for cosmetic acceptability. The trial was conducted in accordance with the good clinical practices (GCP) after obtaining ethical clearance from respective Institutional Review Boards. Statistical evaluation was by variance analysis and student test for the quantitative variables, chi-square test for the qualitative variables. Results: Of the 136 enrolled subjects, 95 completed the study. After 21 days of treatment, 84 % of the subjects assessed by the investigator and 76 % by the self-assessment for the cream found effective. Investigational product was considered to be safe after 7 and 21 days of use. Conclusion: Repairing cream "RV 2427 B" is effective and safe in the management of irritant dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{determine}} the incidence and {{demographic characteristics of}} skin diseases presenting with hyperpigmentation in children applying to the dermatology department. Methods: A total of 2815 {{children between the ages}} of 0 to 16 who applied to the dermatology clinic with the complaints of hyperpigmentation disorders were evaluated. The age, gender, socioeconomic status, place of residence and demographic characteristics of children with abnormal pigmentation skin lesions were investigated. Results: A total of 2815 children applied to the dermatology clinic during the study period. Of these patients 1491 were female (53 %) and 1324 were male (47 %). Of these 266 (9. 4 %) were diagnosed with skin disorders presenting with hyperpigmention. The causes of hyperpigmentation in these patients were was follows; <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> (2. 6 %), melanocytic nevus (2. 1 %), vitiligo (1. 8 %) postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (0. 5 %), and postinflammatory hypopigmentation (0. 5 %). According to the gender, p. alba, vitiligo, Becker nevus, acanthosis nigricans, tuberosclerosis and albinism were seen more in boys and nevus depigmentosus ephelis, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation and melanocytic nevus were seen more in the girls. Pitriyazis versicolor was seen equally in both genders. According to age groups, melanocytis nevus were found to be more frequent between the ages of 0 - 2 and 12 - 16, whereas pityrsasis versicolor was more frequent in ages 12 - 16 and P. alba in the 3 - 11 age group. Conclusions: There are quite a substantial number of pigmentation diseases occurring in children. Early diagnosis and treatment are important because although these diseases mainly cause cosmetic problems, they can decrease the quality of life. Here, we attempted to define the demographic characteristics of diseases presenting with disorders in pigmentation in children...|$|E

OBJETIVOS: Realização de uma análise investigativa para apontar a prevalência de dermatoses em indivíduos de 714 anos, assim como para verificar se estas estão diretamente ligadas ou não a suas respectivas situações socioeconômicas. MÉTODOS: Analisaram-se 200 crianças e adolescentes com idades de 7 - 14 anos, entre os meses de agosto e novembro de 2006, sendo 100 crianças em duas escolas públicas localizadas na periferia e 100 em duas escolas particulares localizadas em bairro de classe média alta na cidade de Santo André, Grande São Paulo. Para tanto, utilizou-se o método investigativo, com exame clínico de toda a superfície corpórea, de mucosas e de gânglios palpáveis, sendo a amostra populacional analisada de acordo com o teste qui-quadrado. RESULTADOS: 87, 5 % das crianças apresentaram algum tipo de dermatose; encontraram-se 46 dermatoses, destacando-se: a) nevos melânicos (p BACKGROUND: Literature {{shows that}} prevalence of skin diseases {{in children and}} adolescents aged 7 - 14 years is very significant, as well as lack of treatment worsening the situation. OBJECTIVES: An investigative analysis was conducted to determine the prevalence of skin diseases in individuals 714 years and focus on {{whether or not they are}} related directly to their respective socio-economic status. METHODS: 200 children and adolescents were examined aged 7 - 14 years,between August and November 2006, 100 children in two public schools located in the periphery and 100 in two private schools located in upper middleclass neighborhood in Santo André,located in São Paulo. Investigative method used was the clinical examination of the whole skin, mucous areas and palpable ganglia,and the population sample analyzed according to the chi-square. RESULTS: 87. 5 % of children had some skin disease. 46 dermatoses were found,the most important:a) melanocytic nevi (p < 0. 001);b) acne grade II (p = 0. 004);c) <b>pityriasis</b> <b>alba</b> (p < 0. 001);d) livedo reticularis (p = 0. 025); e) pediculosis (p < 0. 001);f) asteatosis (p < 0. 001);g) frictional dermatitis (p = 0. 007).
