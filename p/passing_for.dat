5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the real world {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between the real world and the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time <b>passing</b> <b>for</b> players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the Tar Heel {{fans that}} watched {{the game on}} the {{television}} flooded Franklin Street after the victory over the Jayhawks.

This has since turned into a tradition where people overrun Franklin Street following a win over the Duke Blue Devils or whenever the Tar Heels have won a National Championship.|$|E

Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury during the preseason in 2013; he was released after the season concluded and was subsequently signed by the Philadelphia Eagles. When Philadelphia's starter Nick Foles went down with an injury, Sanchez started the second half of the season for the Eagles, where he set career highs in completion percentage and passer rating, while also <b>passing</b> <b>for</b> 2,418 yards despite only starting 8 games.|$|E
