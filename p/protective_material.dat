40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>protective</b> <b>materials</b> on poplar (Populus spp.) wood modifications as consequence of artificial photo-degradation in controlled environment. Starting from previous results [1 - 4], this study tried to understand what happens to wood surface under the protective layer. As <b>protective</b> <b>materials,</b> shellac, beeswax and Linfoil® were tested to compare traditional and novel products generally used for wood. The samples covered by these protective layers were artificially aged in Solar Box for 1064 hours. As comparison, also uncovered samples were tested. At chosen times, the samples were investigated by reflectance spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging in order to study the colour and chemical modification occurred to wood both covered and uncovered with the protective products. The obtained data were statistically elaborated in order to verify their significance. Colour measurements highlighted that the <b>protective</b> <b>materials</b> reduced the wood colour changes in respect to un-protected samples. FT-IR spectroscopy demonstrated that photo-degradation caused mainly lignin decomposition with the production of new chromophore groups on wood surface. Also in this case un-covered wood underwent greater modifications in respect to protected one. Hyperspectral imaging in the SWIR range (1000 - 2500 nm), coupled with chemometric methods, clearly showed the variation between the spectral behavior of poplar wood for ageing time 0 and 1064 hours, with different protective layers. It {{is interesting to note}} that <b>protective</b> <b>materials</b> have a partial effect on wood photo-degradation by little reducing the changes. Such results can contribute to evaluate the effect of <b>protective</b> <b>materials</b> on wood during sun exposure...|$|R
30|$|In this work, some <b>protective</b> <b>materials</b> {{prepared}} via a biocontrolled approach {{were selected}} as objects for studying [9].

Another approach is to invert the scanner, so the bed is above the subject and not quite in contact with it.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{building}} is primarily known for housing members of Los Angeles' homeless population, it is also notable for its unique construction method—it {{is thought to be}} the first multi-unit residential building to utilize entirely pre-fabricated construction. Each of the 102 apartment units were pre-fabricated as self-contained wood-frame units in Boise, Idaho, by Guerdon Enterprises. The interim construction, including plumbing, appliances, and cabinetry, was then shipped to Los Angeles, where it was maneuvered into place by crane before being permanently adjoined to {{the building}} superstructure. All of the units were then covered in <b>protective</b> <b>material,</b> and visually unified with a stucco-style coating.|$|E
50|$|In {{electronics}} non-corrosive fluxes {{are often}} used. Therefore, cleaning flux off may merely {{be a matter}} of aesthetics or to make visual inspection of joints easier in specialised 'mission critical' applications such as medical devices, military and aerospace. For satellites, this will also reduce weight, slightly but usefully. In high humidity, even non-corrosive flux might remain slightly active, therefore the flux may be removed to reduce corrosion over time. In some applications, the PCB might also be coated in some form of <b>protective</b> <b>material</b> such as a lacquer to protect it and exposed solder joints from the environment.|$|E
