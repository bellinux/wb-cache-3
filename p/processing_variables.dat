50|$|In {{ion plating}} the energy, flux and {{mass of the}} bombarding species along with the ratio of bombarding {{particles}} to depositing particles are important <b>processing</b> <b>variables.</b> The depositing material may be vaporized either by evaporation, sputtering (bias sputtering), arc vaporization or by decomposition of a chemical vapor precursor chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The energetic particles used for bombardment are usually ions of an inert or reactive gas, or, in some cases, ions of the condensing film material (“film ions”). Ion plating {{can be done in}} a plasma environment where ions for bombardment are extracted from the plasma or it may be done in a vacuum environment where ions for bombardment are formed in a separate ion gun. The latter ion plating configuration is often called Ion Beam Assisted Deposition (IBAD). By using a reactive gas or vapor in the plasma, films of compound materials can be deposited.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of CNH-reinforced nanocomposites are studied both experimentally [...] and using theoretical calculations. [...] During the experimental studies, ranges of experimental <b>processing</b> <b>variables</b> (PAN- based solution concentration, amount of nanohorns in suspension, ultrasounds frequency and power, sonication time) have been studied. It is shown that increasing sonication time {{is in favor}} of reducing the agglomerate size, while increasing the polymer has an adverse effect. Furthermore, adding surfactant enhances the dispersion of the agglomerates. The processing method used for making the nanocomposite affects distribution of CNH agglomerates which consequently affects the mechanical {{properties of}} the manufactured nanocomposite. For example, the tensile strength of a poorly made nanocomposite falls 30% to 35% compared to the pure polymer matrix. Effect of concentration of CNHs has also studied which shows that while increase in the concentration of CNHs does not affect the elastic modulus of the material, it changes the failure strain of the nanocomposite.Theoretical studies show that the variation of stress along the CNHs is a function of their geometrical properties such as cone angle. For example, location of maximum axial normal stress becomes closer to the tip of CNH as the cone angle increases (Figure on the right). Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} the variation of shear stress in the CNH/matrix surface is non-symmetric which is in contrast to symmetric distribution of shear stress in the CNT/matrix interface.|$|E
