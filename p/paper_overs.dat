40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{economic}} geographers {{have drawn}} extensively upon notions of ‘cultural embeddedness ’ {{to explore how}} spatially vari-able sets of cultural conventions, norms, values and beliefs shape Wrms ’ innovative performance in dynamic regional economies. However, {{our understanding of the}}se causal links remains partial, reinforced by an ‘over-territorialised ’ conception of cultural embeddedness which sidelines the role of institutional actors operating outside and across the boundaries of ‘the local’. So motivated, this <b>paper</b> <b>oVers</b> a theo-retically-informed – and theoretically informing – empirical analysis of the high tech regional economy in Salt Lake City, Utah to explore the everyday causal mechanisms, practices and processes – both local and extra-local – through which Wrms ’ cultural embedding within the region is manifested, performed and (un) intentionally (re) produced. In so doing, this paper aims to further our understanding of the constitutive entanglement and complex interweaving of cultural/economic practices, and to {{contribute to the development of}} an in-depth empirical corpus of work which compliments the exciting conceptual developments that have largely dominated cultural economic geog-raphy over the last decade...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} are {{presented}} the oldest written records on Natural History, {{and especially the}} Earth Sciences concerning the [alek valley and surroundings, and that are of exceptionalcultural heritage value. We translated from archaic German a text by Hacquet from 1784 that discusses the Dobrna hot springs, and supplied it with explanations and comments. Added is the copy of a part of Hacquet’s lithohydrographic map with Šalek valley in its centre, and with our geologic explanations. Among the first geologists(geognosts) who studied the Šalek valley the German Keferstein should be mentioned, also author of the first geologic map of Germany,Studer,thewell-known Swiss geologist {{and founder of the}} Swiss Geologic Survey, and Ami Boué, one of founders of the French Geologic Society. The first modern geologic map of most of the [alek valley and Dobrna depression was elaborated between 1854 and 1856 by Marko Vincenc Lipold, the first geologist of Slovene origin and for many years the general manager of the Idrija mercury mine. The <b>paper</b> <b>overs</b> also the year 1875 when by drilling through the main lignite seam the rich Velenje coal deposit was recognized. This is considered the starting year of exploitation of the Velenje colliery...|$|E
