50|$|During its {{original}} release, House of Wax used the two-strip Natural Vision 3-D format, which employed separate 35 mm film prints for the left-eye and right-eye images, projected by two separate but interlocked projectors. This required making substantial alterations to the theater's projectors. In 1971, House of Wax was re-released in the convenient 35 mm StereoVision single-strip format, which squeezed both images onto one strip {{of film and}} required only an external <b>projector</b> <b>attachment</b> and a non-depolarizing screen. StereoVision's deluxe 70 mm version of their format, which made possible a clearer and brighter image, was used for engagements at large and prestigious venues such as Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood and the 4300-seat Metropolitan Theatre in Boston. After the initial heavily advertised 1971 re-release, StereoVision prints remained available for theatrical rental {{for several years and}} were occasionally shown later in the 1970s. A new wave of 3-D films in the early 1980s, which resulted in many theaters being equipped with the correct type of screen, increased interest in the 3-D films of the 1950s and prompted another re-release of House of Wax in 1982.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{analyses}} the distinctiveness of {{the coming}} of permanent sound (the talkies) to the Australian cinema in the late 1920 s and early 1930 s. The coming of sound resulted in fundamental, but not uniform, change in all countries and in all languages. During this global transformation, substantial capital was spent on developing and adopting modern technology. Hundreds of new cinemas were built; tens of thousands were wired with sound equipmentthat is, two film <b>projectors</b> with sound <b>attachments,</b> amplifiers, speakers and electrical motorsand some closed in financial ruin during the Great Depression. The silent period ended and sound became projected {{as a symbol of}} progress in the metropolis and beyond. As Nowell-Smith and Ricci (1998) and Higson and Maltby (1999) point out, this incredible shift was driven principally by Westernin other words, American and Europeanfilm producer-distributors who retained a dominant influence because of their individual, and at times common, efforts to modernise their production, distribution and exhibition methods. The coming of sound, however, also gave rise to the development of local responses to these technological trends. It is the aim of this study to show how the global transition was more local than previously thought, challenging conventional assumptions about global and local business interests in the cinema industry...|$|R
