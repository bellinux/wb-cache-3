5|$|A stone coffin {{found during}} the 2012 {{excavation}} was opened {{for the first}} time, revealing a lead coffin inside. An investigation with an endoscope revealed {{the presence of a}} skeleton along with some head hair and fragments of a shroud and cord. The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> of a knight called Sir William de Moton who was known to have been buried there, but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E
5|$|Both Calakmul and Tikal were {{sizeable}} Preclassic {{cities that}} survived into the Classic Period. Early hieroglyphic texts from stelae found in Structure 2 record the probable enthronement {{of a king}} of Calakmul in AD 411 and also records a non-royal site ruler in 514. After this there is {{a gap in the}} hieroglyphic records that lasts over a century, although the Kaan dynasty experienced a major expansion of its power at this time. The lack of inscriptions recording the events of this period may be either {{due to the fact that}} the Kaan dynasty was located elsewhere during this time or <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> the monuments were later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|From the 740s {{until the}} end of the Northumbrian kingdom, coins were issued by most kings, {{although}} in variable quantities. Until recently no coins from Eardwulf's reign were known, which suggested that it may have been a time of instability, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> the kingdom was impoverished by the payment of tribute to Offa and Coenwulf of Mercia. It is now known that the issue of new coins continued during Eardwulf's reign, as two of his coins were identified in the 1990s. Issues of new currency appear to have been limited under Eardwulf, and significant numbers of Northumbrian coins are not again attested until the reign of Eardwulf's son Eanred.|$|E

5|$|First, Frederick {{had assumed}} {{he could use}} his trade-mark oblique order attack, but his {{reconnaissance}} had been incomplete. The Russians {{had been there for}} two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick's arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason for him not to have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, except, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>that</b> his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the oblique battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of redans; the Russians were able to shape abutments from which to fire down upon the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite the murderous fire, Frederick's troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5D-43 is {{an unusual}} radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a {{pre-existing}} twin pyramid complex. It {{is built into the}} end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.|$|E

25|$|In Islamic literature, their {{earliest}} mention as the Tubu {{people is}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> {{along with the}} Zaghawa people in an 8th century text by Arabic scholar Ibn Qutaybah. The 9th century al-Kuwarizmi's mentions the Daza people (southern Toubou).|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, in 1238 King Alexander II distrusted him {{sufficiently}} {{to remove the}} Castle of Dumbarton from his control, giving the Scottish king an important foothold in the Mormaerdom. As {{part of the same}} act, Alexander II regranted the Mormaerdom to Maol Domhnaich as a military fief, indicating <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> the Mormaerdom's prior status was ambiguous.|$|E
25|$|The {{capital city}} of Shashanka, the great king of Gauḍa region (comprising most of Bengal) {{in the seventh century}} AD and <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> of Mahipala, one of the later Pala kings of Bengal, were in this district. The {{earliest}} evidences {{of the history of the}} district date back to the pre-historic days, perhaps as early as circa 1500 BCE.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, {{psychological}} and textual criticism had outrun strictly rhetorical criticism; one still sees occasional critiques of metaphors viewed as inappropriate or barbarous, but by and large the neoclassical critique of Shakespeare's language had become moribund. The most extended critique of the play's language from {{the end of the}} century is <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> of Hugh Blair.|$|E

25|$|Some {{a hundred}} of castellieri have been {{discovered}} in Istria, Friuli and Venezia Giulia, {{such as that of}} Leme, in the central-western Istria, of the Jelarji, near Muggia, of Monte Giove near Prosecco (Trieste) and San Polo, not far from Monfalcone. However, the largest castelliere was <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> of Nesactium, in the southern Istria, not far from Pula.|$|E
25|$|Sikorski, {{whose own}} {{military}} and political career in Poland had been stymied while the Piłsudskiites held sway after the May 1926 coup d'état, now sidelined many officers deemed to have been close to the Piłsudskiites. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> was why an officer as experienced in clandestine warfare as Charaszkiewicz, then only 44 years old, apparently was never again entrusted with such operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{effort to}} document the fauna of India was <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> of Thomas Hardwicke (1755–1835), a military officer in India who hired local artists to produce a huge collection of illustrations of Indian animals. This was subsequently studied by John Edward Gray (1800–1875) {{and led to the}} publication of Illustrations of Indian zoology: chiefly selected from the collection of Major-General Hardwicke and consisted of 202 colour plates.|$|E

25|$|The {{onset of}} the Great Famine coincided {{with the end of}} the Medieval Warm Period. Between 1310 and 1330, {{northern}} Europe saw some of the worst and most sustained periods of bad weather in the entire Middle Ages, characterized by severe winters and rainy and cold summers. The Great Famine may have been precipitated by a volcanic event, <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> of Mount Tarawera, New Zealand, which lasted about five years.|$|E
25|$|Another temple {{stood near}} the circus Flaminius, vowed by consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 187BC during {{the war against the}} Ligures and {{dedicated}} by himself as censor in 179 on December 23. It was connected by a porch with a temple of Fortuna, <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> of Fortuna Equestris. Its probable site according to Platner is just south of the porticus Pompeiana on the west end of circus Flaminius.|$|E
25|$|If molecules, or atoms, or electrons, are {{emitted from}} a {{material}} and their velocities are measured, {{the spectrum of}} their velocities often nearly obeys a theoretical law called the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, which gives a well-founded measurement of temperatures for which the law holds.
