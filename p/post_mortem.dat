5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> could not be sure how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E
5|$|Because Lynott {{had worked}} {{alongside}} Smith at the Rainbow Pub, West Midlands Police wished to re-examine {{the cause of}} her death. In early 2001, investigators asked the Irish authorities for a new <b>post</b> <b>mortem,</b> and on 8 March Lynott's body was exhumed by Gardai from a cemetery in Athlone and taken to Dublin City Morgue for further examination by Ireland's State Pathologist, Dr John Harbison. However, {{the results of this}} autopsy also proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|When Storm's father died, he {{returned}} from Amsterdam to Liverpool {{to be with his}} mother at Stormsville, at 54 Broad Green Road, Broadgreen, Liverpool. On 27 September 1972, Storm developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. The next day Storm and his mother were both found dead. A <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> determined that Storm had not taken enough pills to kill himself, but it was suspected that, after finding her son's body, his mother had died.|$|E

5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, 120â€“130 tammar {{wallabies}} {{died suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. <b>Post</b> <b>mortem</b> examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. No treatment has been attempted due to the rapid progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|John de Vere was {{the only}} son of Alphonse de Vere, and Jane, {{daughter}} of Sir Richard Foliot. Alphonse was a younger son of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford and apparently died shortly before 20 December 1328, when a writ was issued for inquisitions <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> into the land that he held direct from the King. These hearings established that Alphonse's next heir was his son John, then aged 15 years and more. The manors concerned were Aston Sandford, Buckinghamshire, Westwick by St Albans and Great Hormead, Hertfordshire, as well as property at Beaumont and Althorne in Essex.|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} 179 autopsies was {{undertaken}} over a 1 -year period {{to determine if}} clinically useful information was obtainable from coroners <b>post</b> <b>mortems</b> performed on patients referred from the A&E department. Fifty-six patients had undergone unsuccessful resuscitation. The leading causes of death were heart disease and trauma. Discrepancies between the diagnosis made during resuscitation {{and the cause of}} death found at autopsy were revealed especially in those dying from non-cardiac causes. latrogenic trauma from resuscitation attempts occurred in a sig-nificant number of cases. It is suggested that review of selected Coroners <b>post</b> <b>mortems</b> should be part of departmental audit, with a view to improving clinical skills...|$|R

50|$|In most cases, Eckert strangled the women, {{performed}} amateur <b>post</b> <b>mortems</b> on them, {{and finally}} photographed them. In addition, he {{cut off the}} hair or dressed the dead bodies, and kept them in the cab of his truck or in his apartment.|$|R
5|$|On 8 November 2000, Smith met 21-year-old Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict from Alum Rock, Birmingham, at the Rainbow public house, {{and they were}} seen leaving together. He {{took her to a}} hospital appointment and later killed her. Prosecutors believed that he strangled her at his flat and dumped her body near a recreation ground near Golden Hillock Road in Sparkbrook, where he set it alight. The still-smouldering remains were discovered at 6:15am next morning (9 November) by two patrolling police officers. The body was barely recognisable and had to be identified using fingerprints. A subsequent <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> concluded that she had been strangled before being rolled up in a carpet and set on fire.|$|E
5|$|After {{removing}} her corpse {{from the}} canvas sack and beginning the <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examination, pathologist Keith Simpson told Ranson {{he was certain}} that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the sack, and that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon. Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.|$|E
5|$|A new Baroque {{building}} was constructed on {{site of the}} first Castellania by the same Grand Master, creating significant employment as Pinto had hoped for, with works commencing in 1757. Throughout the course of construction, prisoners were held in a torre near Valletta's Porta Reale, probably the tower of Saint James Cavalier. The new Castellania was built to a design by the architect Francesco Zerafa, but he died before its completion, so he was substituted by the architect Giuseppe Bonici. Zerafa is accredited for the main design, and for the subjected building he has <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> {{established himself as a}} respected architect. The edifice was completed in 1760, with its chapel being consecrated on 15 November of that year. As a general rule, buildings in Valletta were required to be ready within three-years period from start to completion. The prisoners were transferred to the new prison three days later, on 18 November 1760.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} <b>post</b> <b>mortems</b> {{were conducted}} by the Government Medical Officer Dr. Von Lossberg, with Sergeant Arrell supervising. From interviews with people who had seen the bodies, Chief Inspector Stuart determined that Michael may have {{been shot in the}} head, but this was not found by Dr. Von Lossberg, despite claims that he had been asked to look for a bullet. Stuart ordered that all three bodies be exhumed and {{it was found that the}} original <b>post</b> <b>mortems</b> were no more than superficial examinations. Although decomposition was advanced, it was now found that Michael had indeed been shot in the right side of his head then subsequently struck on the same spot with a blunt instrument, so that the later wound partially obscured the bullet hole. The bullet was recovered from the skull.|$|R
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24â€‘to48â€‘hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{at the age}} of 26, O'Brien {{collapsed}} on stage during a performance, and later died due to complications after an appendicitis operation. Storm disbanded the Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades Ice Rink in Liverpool, in Benidorm (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in Jersey and Amsterdam. When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother. He developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at Stormsville. The <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> revealed that Storm had alcohol and sleeping pills in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental. Although it could not be proven, it is thought that his mother had committed suicide after finding Storm's body.|$|E
5|$|The ballad Master McGrath {{concerns}} a greyhound {{of that name}} from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero. The dog was bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family, and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow, {{referred to in the}} lyrics as Lord Lurgan. Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition three times in 1868, 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high-profile sport. A <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> found that he had a heart twice the size of what is normal for a dog of his size. He is remembered all over the town, including in its coat of arms. The dog was named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its care. A statue of him was unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993, over 120 years after his last glory in 1871. The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath, although it has been renamed in recent years.|$|E

Following a review of the closure order by the Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd, edited versions of some of the documents were released to the public in October 2005. Four files containing <b>post</b> <b>mortems,</b> medical records and profiles on the victims, as well as Hamilton's autopsy, remained sealed under the 100-year order to avoid distressing the relatives and survivors.|$|R

Although attracted to Stone, the recurring theme includes her grudge against him {{when he did not}} call her after a date. As a favour, Stone sets up Annie with fellow doctor Simon Dunne, labeling them as the 'Posh and Becks' of pathology. However, after they hit it off after the first date, Stone finds himself becoming increasingly jealous, a fact which Annie is clearly aware of and plays upon to her advantage. Annie deals more with the physical side of pathology, performing <b>post</b> <b>mortems</b> and collecting evidence for the labs to test. In the second series, her role within the team is expanded by using her as a criminal profiler.|$|R
