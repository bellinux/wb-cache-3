Abe's decision to delay the consumption tax increase in November 2014 and his push for a large fiscal deficit in the 2015 budget without social security cuts was interpreted as a victory for this faction within the LDP. The government did however, commit to a primary surplus by 2020, and pledged to review its strategy in 2018 if the <b>primary</b> <b>deficit</b> had not fallen to 1 percent of GDP by that time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an econometric {{investigation}} of the macroeconomic and political factors that contributed to Greece’s excessive debt accumulation and its failure to adequately address its fiscal imbalances, from the restoration of democracy in 1974 till the crisis of 2009. The econometric investigation {{is based on a}} model in which two political parties alternate in power, and in which governments choose primary expenditure and taxes to minimize deviations from politically determined expenditure and tax targets, subject to a debt accumulation equation. The model predicts a political equilibrium in which primary expenditure and taxes follow feedback rules which go in the direction of stabilizing the debt to GDP ratio. However, this stabilization incentive is weaker in election years. The model also predicts potential partisan differences in the evolution of primary expenditure and taxes, due to the different preferences of political parties. Estimates of government reaction functions to public debt for the period 1975 - 2009 suggest a rather weak stabilizing reaction of <b>primary</b> <b>deficits</b> to public debt. This stabilizing reaction disappears in election years, which are characterized by strong fiscal expansions. We find no evidence of partisan differences in the reaction of <b>primary</b> <b>deficits</b> to inherited debt, but we do find evidence of lower <b>primary</b> <b>deficits</b> in the post- 1992 Maastricht treaty period. Overall the model accounts for the accumulation of Greece’s government debt in terms of the trend increase in primary expenditure, the positive shocks to primary expenditure in election years and the weak stabilizing reaction of government revenue, due to tax smoothing...|$|R

The figure was measured to 27.6% in 2009 and 27.7% in 2010 (and only slightly worse than the EU27-average at 23.4%), but for 2011 the estimated figure rose sharply above 33%. According to an IMF official, austerity measures have helped Greece bring down its <b>primary</b> <b>deficit</b> before interest payments, from €24.7bn (10.6% of GDP) in 2009 to just €5.2bn (2.4% of GDP) in 2011, but as a side-effect they also contributed to a worsening of the Greek recession, which began in October 2008 and only became worse in 2010 and 2011.

50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} references {{to the topic of}} autism and memory date back to the 1960s and 70s when several studies appeared proposing that autism should be classified as an amnesic disorder. What is now diagnosed as autism, was formerly diagnosed as developmental amnesia. Subsequent studies had mixed results; some found support for impaired memory, others found evidence of relatively intactmemory function. Even though the view of autism as an amnesic disorder of memory has now been rejected, there are still many studies done on the deficits in memory function that are associated with autism. Furthermore, in the memory studies there were observations of memory dysfunctions in autism that were consistent with a deficit in executive functions. Theories have been developed stating that the memory deficits are a reflection of primary deficits in executive function, or of a <b>primary</b> <b>deficit</b> in the processing of complex information.|$|E
40|$|Autism now {{occurs in}} 1 out of 150 births in the United States (Centers for Disease Control, 2008). Increasing numbers and {{complexity}} of the disorder make the need for identifying effective interventions critical. DSM-IVTR identifies core characteristics of autism as significant deficits in communication, social interaction, and symbolic play. Neither intellectual ability nor academic achievement, two variables frequently used for measuring intervention effectiveness, are included as diagnostic criteria. Yet IQ scores are often used as entry criteria for treatment studies (Tsakiris, 2000). Therefore, intervention effectiveness has utilized variables other than the <b>primary</b> <b>deficits</b> and cannot be applied to the wider range (and truer representation) of children with autism. ...|$|R

50|$|There {{has also}} been a growing {{interest}} in e-learning as a beneficial educational method for students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). With the growing popularity in e-learning among K-12 and higher education, the opportunity to take online classes is becoming increasingly important for students of all ages. However, students with ADHD and special needs face different learning demands compared to the typical developing learner. This is especially significant considering the dramatic rise in ADHD diagnoses in the last decade among both children and adults. Compared to the traditional face-to-face classroom, e-learning and virtual classrooms require a higher level of executive functions, which is the <b>primary</b> <b>deficit</b> associated with ADHD. Although ADHD is not specifically named in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, students with ADHD who have symptoms that interfere with their learning or ability may be eligible for assistive technology. Some examples of the resources that may help interest students and adults with ADHD consist of, computer software, brain games, timers, calendars, voice recognition devices, screen magnifiers, and talking books.|$|E

40|$|The basic aim of {{this article}} is to {{consider}} the effect of the current financial crisis on the movements and sustainability of the public debt in the period up to 2013. It is shown that changes in the public debt come from the effect of the <b>primary</b> <b>deficit</b> created, stockflow adjustment, the real growth of the GDP and real interest rates. On the basis of results of the European Communities (2009) a statistical estimate is given of the trends in the <b>primary</b> <b>deficit</b> for EU- 12, after which the model is adjusted to Croatian figures. The projection of stock-flow adjustment is undertaken from a projection of the <b>primary</b> <b>deficit,</b> due to the relatively strong negative correlation between those two variables in the past, whilst the projection of the real growth rate of the GDP and real interest rates is significantly simplified. The main hypothesis tested is that the ratio of the public debt in the GDP up to 2013 does not exceed the margin of sustainability prescribed in the Maastricht criterion of 60 %, which is finally confirmed by this analysis.

40|$|The intertemporal budget {{constraint}} {{of the government}} implies a relationship between a ratio of current liabilities to the <b>primary</b> <b>deficit</b> with future values of inflation, interest rates, GDP and narrow money growth {{and changes in the}} <b>primary</b> <b>deficit.</b> This relationship defines a natural measure of fiscal balance and can be used as an accounting identity to examine the channels through which governments achieve fiscal sustainability. We evaluate the ability of this framework to account for the fiscal behaviour of six industrialised nations since 1960. We show how fiscal imbalances are mainly removed through adjustments in the <b>primary</b> <b>deficit</b> (80 - 100 %), with less substantial roles being played by inflation (0 - 10 %) and GDP growth (0 - 20 %). Focusing on the relation between fiscal imbalances and inflation suggests extremely modest interactions.

Using a series of econometric specifications that nest Ricardian and non-Ricardian models, we obtain evidence of strong non-Ricardian behavior in aggregate consumption. Consistent with several recent studies, we find that projected future deficits affect long-term interest rates, but current deficits do not. Our estimates suggest that each percent-of-GDP in current deficits reduces national saving by 0. 5 to 0. 8 percent of GDP. Each percent-of-GDP in projected future unified deficits raises forward long-term interest rates by 25 to 35 basis points, and each percent-of-GDP in projected future <b>primary</b> <b>deficits</b> raises interest rates by 40 to 70 basis points...|$|R
