5|$|Following his {{pit lane}} entry {{violation}} during the race, which {{handed him a}} five-second time penalty, Kimi Räikkönen was furthermore given two penalty <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> licence, bringing him to five overall.|$|E
5|$|For {{his last}} lap {{collision}} with teammate Jolyon Palmer, Kevin Magnussen received a ten-second time penalty, dropping him {{one place to}} 15th. He also received two penalty <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> licence. Carlos Sainz received a reprimand from the stewards for leaving the pit lane one minute before it was allowed. He escaped a more severe penalty because he stopped shortly afterwards, thereby not gaining an advantage. Upon his return to Toro Rosso, Daniil Kvyat recorded the first fastest lap of his career, and the first for the Italian team in their 190th Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E

5|$|Selänne {{was named}} to the Finnish team for the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which marked his sixth {{appearance}} at the tournament. In the quarterfinals, Selänne scored a goal and an assist as the Finns ousted the host Russians from the tournament, then added two goals in the bronze medal match in a 5–0 victory over the United States. The 43-year-old Selänne became the oldest player to win a medal in Olympic hockey. He was named most valuable player of the Olympic tournament as selected by the media, and added six <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Olympic record career total of 43.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{began his}} career with McLaren (being run by Teddy Mayer) in 1980 {{alongside}} Ulsterman John Watson. On his debut in Buenos Aires he finished in sixth place earning one point, something achieved by {{only a handful of}} drivers. Prost added four more <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> tally during the season, scoring points at Interlagos, Brands Hatch and Zandvoort. Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the Canadian round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State Seminoles are {{coached by}} Bobby Bowden, father of Tommy Bowden. Their 2001 matchup marked {{only the second}} time that a father and son had faced each other as {{opposing}} head football coaches. The only other meeting had been the previous year, when Tommy lost by three <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father. In the 2001 meeting, No. 4 Florida State dominated No. 10 Clemson {{from the start of the}} game. In an effort to impress BCS voters, Florida State ran up the score and the game ended with the Seminoles on top, 527. The Seminoles' win gave them the ACC football championship and dropped Clemson to a No. 16 ranking. With its spot as the No. 2 ACC team assured, Clemson accepted a bid to the Gator Bowl on November 14, prior to its annual in-state rivalry game against South Carolina. In that game, South Carolina took a one-point lead with 59 seconds remaining, but Clemson drove the length of the field and kicked a field goal as time expired, giving the Tigers a 1614 win to end the regular season.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{successful}} medical practice, Starkey emigrated at age 22 to London, England, in November 1650 with his wife, Susanna Stoughton, {{whom he had}} married earlier that year. Susanna {{is believed to be}} the eldest daughter of Colonel Israel Stoughton, and sister of William Stoughton, a future governor of Massachusetts. It is not entirely known why Starkey decided to leave New England. One clue <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> interest in alchemy and chemical technology. It is known that Starkey was acquiring great skill at building ovens to facilitate alchemical experiments. However, he complained that the region offered unsuitable material needed for their operation, and therefore believed that relocating to England could provide access to better material and higher quality laboratory implements as well. Around this same time he changed his surname to Starkey for reasons that are unknown.|$|E
25|$|Gyges {{asks the}} Queen {{to join in}} the dancing. She takes a cup and empties it as if to drown her thoughts. She dances in a trance and empties another cup, which is filled by the ghost of Candaules, who {{suddenly}} tears the crown from her head. Terrified, she swoons and Gyges hurries to her side and endeavours to lead her to her throne, but again, the ghost appears. Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly pallor steals over her features and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.|$|E
25|$|Waltrip {{took his}} Bill Davis <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own then-new Toyota Camry {{team for the}} 2007 season with sponsor NAPA Auto Parts in the Nextel Cup Series. It was a dismal first year for the No. 55 Toyota Camry in NASCAR top series competition, as Waltrip's team faced stiff {{penalties}} for using illegal fuel additives during qualifying for the Daytona 500. The team rebounded to qualify 15th via the Gatorade Duels, but finished 30th, leaving Daytona with negative driver and owner points (the team's finish in the Daytona 500 earned them 73 points, but the 100 point penalty they received from NASCAR left them last in the standings at −27 points). Waltrip proceeded to fail to qualify for 11 consecutive races before qualifying for his second race at Dover International Speedway on June 2. Making just his third {{start of the season}} at Michigan International Speedway on June 18, Waltrip posted the team's first top-10 finish and Toyota's third by finishing 10th and leading a lap. In order {{to take advantage of the}} champions provisional, Terry Labonte drove the No. 55 in 2007 at Infineon, Indianapolis, and Watkins Glen. Waltrip gave Toyota its second pole in Cup competition at Talladega on October 7 and grabbed another top-10 finish at Lowe's the following week, bringing his team barely inside the top 43 in points by the end of the season.|$|E

25|$|As {{the race}} was heading into the closing stages, Hamilton {{seemed to be on}} a charge to try to catch the leading Brawn but in reality it looked only a mistake would stop the Brazilian winning. As Button was lapping a second off the pace just making sure his car got to the end. Kubica was {{catching}} Button at a high rate of knots but it seemed a long shot if Button was going to lose them two points. Barrichello took the chequered flag to win his first grand prix since the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in , and record the 100th win by a Brazilian driver in Formula One (including the victories of Emerson Fittipaldi, José Carlos Pace, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, Felipe Massa and Barrichello). Hamilton came second, while Finn Räikkönen came home in third. Kovalainen came fourth, while Nico Rosberg had a reasonably quiet race as he came home in fifth. Fernando Alonso came sixth in his home race, championship leader Jenson Button came seventh, while Robert Kubica came eighth, only his second points scoring finish so far this season. Neither Red Bull's Vettel or Webber scored a point, while Barrichello moved into second place in the drivers championship. Button kept his lead although he only added two <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> tally. Brawn edged further ahead in the constructors' championship by scoring 12 points with Red Bull not scoring a single point this weekend.|$|E
25|$|The new McLaren-Honda package {{started out}} to be {{unreliable}} and problematic after a 29 January launch. In the three pre-season tests Button, teammate Alonso and reserve driver Kevin Magnussen only had a single day over one hundred laps, which was completed by Button. Arriving in Australia Button qualified 17th (out of 18) and finished 11th and last in the detuned McLaren to ensure the team and new power unit supplier, Honda Racing F1 would compile decent mileage because of energy recovery issues. This continued into Malaysia where Button had to retire from the race. In China, Button collided with Lotus racer Pastor Maldonado in the latter stages of the Grand Prix. Button received a five-second time penalty dropping him one spot to 14th and two penalty <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> super licence which was previously clean for which the points will last twelve months. Button described the crash as 'just a misjudgement'. Button had a horrible weekend in Sakhir where {{he had to stop}} on track three times, once in FP1, another time in FP2 and again in Q1 where he was unable to set a time and had to line up 20th and last on the grid. After an energy recovery issue Button could not even start the race. In Monaco, he scored his first points of the season, finishing in 8th place. At his home Grand Prix in Great Britain, Button retired on the first lap after contact with his teammate Alonso. At the Hungarian Grand Prix, Button finished in ninth place. Button also finished ninth at Sochi and in the next Grand Prix at Austin he finished an incredible sixth place out of 12 finishing drivers, with his teammate Alonso finishing eleventh.|$|E
500|$|Following their intra-team collision, Sauber's team {{principal}} Monisha Kaltenborn put {{blame on}} both drivers. The stewards penalised Ericsson for the incident, handing him a three-place grid penalty {{for the following}} race in Canada as well as three penalty <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> licence. Felipe Nasr was adamant that the team orders he had received prior to the accident had been uncalled for, since his slower pace was due to low tyre temperatures. He also claimed that Ericsson had ignored team orders himself on two occasions in the previous season. Ericsson in turn had a different view {{and said that the}} team had told him for [...] "seven or eight laps" [...] that they would swap the positions of the drivers before he decided to go for the pass himself. Valtteri Bottas and Pascal Wehrlein also received penalties during and after the race. Bottas was handed a ten-second time penalty and two penalty points on his licence for causing a collision with Gutiérrez, while Wehrlein received two separate ten-second penalties: the first for exceeding the allowed lap time under VSC conditions and the second for ignoring blue flags. He was also given two penalty points each for both incidents.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{scholars}} like D. D. Kosambi, Kapphina {{was of a}} Kshatriya varna but according to Alexander Cunningham, Kapphina was of a Brahman varna. But these conflicting views are least problematic here since Kambojas in ancient times [...] were given to both Kshatrya as well as Brahmanical pursuits. Pali texts' legend of Maha Kapphina however, does not specify anywhere that Kapphina was a Brahmin or a Kshatriya. But internal evidence of Kapphina legend <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> belonging to the Kshatriya varna.|$|E

2500|$|Ivan III tripled the {{territory}} of his state, ended {{the dominance of the}} Golden Horde over the Rus', renovated the Moscow Kremlin, and laid the foundations of the Russian state. Biographer Fennell concludes that his reign was [...] "militarily glorious and economically sound," [...] and especially <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> territorial annexations and his centralized control over local rulers. However, Fennell, the leading British specialist on Ivan III, argues that his reign was also [...] "a period of cultural depression and spiritual barrenness. Freedom was stamped out within the Russian lands. By his bigoted anti-Catholicism Ivan brought down the curtain between Russia and the west. For the sake of territorial aggrandizement he deprived his country of the fruits of Western learning and civilization." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that, {{although}} he died a staunch Lancastrian, he never showed any personal dislike of York or the Nevilles in the 1450s, and that his personal motivation throughout the decade was loyalty to the Crown and keeping the peace between his peers.

[...] On his latter quality, Rawcliffe <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> reputation as a harsh taskmaster on his estates and his [...] "offensive behaviour" [...] towards Joan of Arc. Further, she says, his political judgement was [...] "clouded" [...] by this attitude. His temper, she says, was [...] "ungovernable." ...|$|E
