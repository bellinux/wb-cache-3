5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces <b>pulses</b> far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant <b>pulses</b> was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant <b>pulses</b> {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant <b>pulses</b> of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single <b>pulses</b> of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the <b>pulses</b> were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant <b>pulses</b> have been found. These giant <b>pulses</b> have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant <b>pulses</b> is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed <b>pulses</b> is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the <b>pulses</b> of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio <b>pulses</b> observed, <b>pulses</b> have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E

Over a year later, in October 1945, WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes. Voice announcements started on January 1, 1950, and were broadcast every five minutes. Frequencies of 600Hz and 440Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes. By this time, WWV was broadcasting on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35MHz. The 30 and 35MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The <b>pulses</b> allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current <b>pulses</b> with a frequency between 30 and 400 <b>pulses</b> per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E

The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E

5|$|When the helium is exhausted, the Sun {{will repeat}} the {{expansion}} it followed when the hydrogen {{in the core}} was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell.

The thermal <b>pulses</b> become larger each time, with the later <b>pulses</b> pushing the luminosity {{to as much as}} 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU.
