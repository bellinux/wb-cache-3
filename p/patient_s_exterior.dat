40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with understanding the nature of meaningful architectural appearances which contribute to the fulfillment of emotional needs when judging architecture. It is more narrowly focused on the visual relationship [...] the formal correlation [...] between a building 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>exterior</b> and interior. For understanding and analysing this relationship, semiology here proves to provide an effective means. ^ To explore the general problem of a building 2 ̆ 7 s appearance and its meaning, a semiological coding scheme is developed. The bases of this scheme are the theoretical notions of Umberto Eco 2 ̆ 7 s semiotics, Juan Bonta 2 ̆ 7 s semiotics, and the Gestalt theory of perception. This scheme explains and orders how features (the appearance 2 ̆ 7 s components) and visual qualities (the meaning 2 ̆ 7 s components) {{relate to each other}} by means of codes (the scheme 2 ̆ 7 s subsystems). ^ To understand the formal correlation between a building 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>exterior</b> and interior, the semiological coding scheme is used in a study in which one main exterior and three alternatives of the main interior of each of six public buildings are compared. All exteriors and interiors are presented graphically in perspective. The purpose is to determine which of the interiors has a formal correlation with the exterior, so that the concept of 2 ̆ 2 formal correlation 2 ̆ 2 can be understood. ^ Formal correlation between a building 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>exterior</b> and interior, as a meaningful relationship, is supported by testing a group of laymen 2 ̆ 7 s intuitive judgments concerning the same cases used in the semiological comparison study. ^ Although this dissertation is limited to the study of one kind of relationship between a building 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>exterior</b> and interior, it contributes largely to composing buildings 2 ̆ 7 appearances. By developing a semiological coding scheme, the designer can better understand how features of buildings relate to visual qualities, thus he/she becomes able to compose meaningful buildings 2 ̆ 7 appearances. Also, by using a semiological coding scheme, the designer can attain similar meanings through different appearances. The supported semiological notion, however, is not limited to judging or designing architectural appearances, but to all visual patterns such as paintings and sculptures. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHuman face {{perception}} {{requires a}} network of brain regions distributed throughout the occipital and temporal lobes with a right hemisphere advantage. Present theories consider this network as either a processing hierarchy beginning with the inferior occipital gyrus (occipital face area; IOG-faces/OFA) or a multiple-route network with nonhierarchical components. The former predicts that removing IOG-faces/OFA will detrimentally affect downstream stages, whereas the latter does not. We tested this prediction in a human <b>patient</b> (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P.) requiring removal of the right inferior occipital cortex, including IOG-faces/OFA. We acquired multiple fMRI measurements in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before and after a preplanned surgery and multiple measurements in typical controls, enabling both within-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before resection vs <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after resection) and between-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. vs controls). We found that the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream ipsilateral face-selective regions were stable 1 and 8 month(s) after surgery. Additionally, the reliability of distributed patterns of face selectivity in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before versus after resection was not different from across-session reliability in controls. Nevertheless, postoperatively, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1 of the resected hemisphere. Diffusion weighted imaging in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. and controls identifies white matter tracts connecting retinotopic areas to downstream face-selective regions, which {{may contribute to the}} stable and plastic features of the face network in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after surgery. Together, our results support a multiple-route network of face processing with nonhierarchical components and shed light on stable and plastic features of high-level visual cortex following focal brain damage. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Brain networks consist of interconnected functional regions commonly organized in processing hierarchies. Prevailing theories predict that damage to the input of the hierarchy will detrimentally affect later stages. We tested this prediction with multiple brain measurements in a rare human patient requiring surgical removal of the putative input to a network processing faces. Surprisingly, the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream face-selective regions are stable after surgery. Nevertheless, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1. White matter connections from outside the face network may support these stable and plastic features. As processing hierarchies are ubiquitous in biological and nonbiological systems, our results have pervasive implications for understanding the construction of resilient networks...|$|R

Much evidence {{has shown that}} carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can restrain bone resorption. We had detected increased expression of carbonic anhydrase I (CA 1) in synovium of patients with AS. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of methazolamide, an anti-carbonic anhydrase drug, for treating patients with AS. Methods: Two <b>patients,</b> called as <b>S</b> and L, were diagnosed with active AS based on BASDAI and BASFI assessments, radiographic data and other clinical indices. They took methazolamide tablets at a dose of 25 mg twice every day. Results : <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASDAI score fell from 5. 4 to 4. 4, while patient L's BASDAI fell from 2. 4 to 2. <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASFI score change from 2. 7 to 2. 9, while patient L's BASFI score fell from 1. 2 to 0. 2. The ESR values of <b>patient</b> <b>S</b> were considerably reduced, while the ESR value of patient L remained unchanged and in the normal range. The calcium concentration of <b>patient</b> <b>S</b> decreased from 3. 05 mmol/L to 2. 39 mmol/L. The CT evidence indicates that the articular surfaces of the erosive sacroiliac joints became clearer and the area of the calcium deposits began decreased. No significant systemic side effects were observed in either patient. Conclusions: The above results indicate that methazolamide was effective for active AS. Methazolamide may improve AS symptoms by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase activity during the processes of bone reporption and new bone formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the geographical divergence of delta virus RNA sequences, 868 nucleotides (nt), including the delta antigen-coding region, were determined in isolates from two Japanese <b>patients,</b> M and <b>S,</b> by {{polymerase chain reaction}} and direct sequencing and compared with three previously reported nucleotide sequences.

Some general questions which might be addressed when assessing decision-making capacity are discussed. Some examples on open issues not clearly solved by the legal guidelines are pointed out, with suggestions on how to solve these. These examples include the assessment of decision-making capacity for persons under guardianship, children, adolescence and adults. The results identify the need for health-care professionals to be sufficiently educated. The need for quality assurance systems in healthcare is also pointed out. Such systems might be assessment instruments, general guidelines, ethics committees or advocates services...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{function}} of conflict prevention performed by keywords and key-expressions within medical consultations. Doctor-patient interaction within medical consultations {{can be interpreted as}} a problem-solving discussion, as it is oriented to the solution of a certain health problem. As such, medical consultations are based on an argumentative discussion, in which, roughly speaking, both parties try to reason together in order to find a solution for the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health problem. In this sense, a non-mixed dispute (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 2004) often arises, in which doctor and patient discuss a standpoint, normally advanced by the doctor, about the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> diagnosis or therapy. Problem-solving, however, is not the only possible interaction scheme (Rigotti and Rocci 2006) that can be involved in doctor-patient consultations. Indeed, other more confrontational interaction schemes are possible, which may also tend to real controversies; these cases are often triggered by the asymmetry of competences and knowledge which is typical of the relationship between doctors and patients. Such situations, of course, affect the quality of the consultation, because the issue at stake ceases to be the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health, and becomes the relationship between the patient and the doctor (in terms of trust, reliability, etc.). Ultimately, this may have negative effects on the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health and, thus, more in general, may contradict the raison d être of the health system. Thus during the medical consultation conflicts need to be avoided both by doctor and patient. The choice of keywords and key-expressions appears to be a crucial step within a strategy of conflict prevention. In fact, thanks to their close link to the relevant endoxa, their ability to trigger inferences, and their centrality within the argumentative structure of persuasive texts, keywords can be very important tools in the creation of emotive arguments and the prevention of conflict. Relying on examples from real-life consultations, this paper shows how keywords and key-expressions realize this function...|$|R

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of clinical and subclinical thyroid disorders in <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> vs gender-matched and age-matched control subjects. METHODS:Thyroid hormones and antithyroid antibodies, thyroid ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration were performed in 111 <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> who had been consecutively referred to the Respiratory Pathophysiology Section of the University of Pisa, and the results were compared to 333 gender-matched and age-matched control subjects from the same geographic area. RESULTS:The odds ratio for subclinical hypothyroidism for female <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> vs control subjects was 2. 7 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 3 to 5. 9); for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody titer (AbTPO) positivity, 2. 2 (95 % CI, 1. 2 to 3. 9); and for thyroid autoimmunity, 1. 9 (95 % CI, 1. 1 to 3. 2). The mean values of thyroid-stimulating hormone and AbTPO were higher in female <b>S</b> <b>patients</b> than in control subjects (p < 0. 01). A significantly higher prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism (four patients) and Graves disease (three patients) was observed in female <b>S</b> <b>patients</b> than in control subjects (none; p = 0. 005 and 0. 0026, respectively).

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} whether physicians find non-treatment decisions ethically challenging in their practice and what their intentions behind such decisions are. If physicians find non-treatment ethically challenging, then to explore how exactly do they find it challenging. Furthermore, how do physicians analyze their actions in light of the concepts of hastening, causing, and intending the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> death? Do they find these ethical terms at all relevant for their non-treatment decision-making? Methods A qualitative analysis framework according to Malterud was used to analyze sixteen Norwegian physicians from relevant specialties' interviews. Interviews were divided in two parts. In part one the physician told their story where they performed non- treatment decision-making. In part two the interviewers asked the physician questions regarding the concepts of hastening, causing, and intending the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> death, applied to the stories they had related. Results When analyzing the interviews, it became very clear that none of the physicians used ethical terms when describing their non-treatment decisions. Concepts such as hastening, causing and intending the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> death seemed almost foreign to most of them in their practical considerations. There was almost a consensus amongst physicians in finding such concepts irrelevant to the moral assessment of their end- of-life practices. Physicians were always attempting to achieve the proper balance of the level of treatment at life s end; this was also their main dilemma. When framing their dilemmas, physicians did so not in ethical terms but medical terms. Conclusion Through the study, it became clear that the core concepts of traditional medico- ethical analyses of end-of-life decision-making (intending, causing and hastening death) do not match up with the practical landscape.
