40|$|The use of {{sandwich}} panels as {{roof and}} wall claddings has increased considerably in recent times. For the designers {{to take advantage}} of the diaphragm action of stronger sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>systems</b> under in-plane shear forces due to wind loading, appropriate data on shear strength and stiffness of these systems is required. An experimental investigation was therefore conducted to investigate the shear behaviour of commonly used crest-fixed sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>systems.</b> An improved fastening system was developed which resulted in approximately 2. 5 times greater shear strength, and improved ductility. Shear strength and stiffness data were developed for sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>systems</b> with the improved fastening system for varying aspect ratio. Analytical formulae were also developed to predict the shear strength of sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>systems</b> using the basic tearing loads obtained from simple connection tests. This paper presents the details of both experimental and analytical studies on the shear behaviour of sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>systems</b> and the results...|$|R

5|$|Since {{the style}} of the Renaissance was {{generally}} regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was also used for augmenting Poland's Socialist national format. However, in the course of incorporating the principles of Socialist realism, there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists. One of these was to more closely reflect Soviet architecture, which resulted in the majority of works blending into one another. From 1953, critical opinions in the Party were increasingly frequent, and the doctrine was given up in 1956 marking the end of Stalinism. Currently the soc-realist centre of Nowa Huta {{is considered to be a}} meritorious monument of the times. This period in postwar architecture was followed by the mass-construction of large <b>Panel</b> <b>System</b> apartment blocks, most of which were built outside the city centre and thus do not encroach upon the beauty of the old or new towns. Some examples of the new style (e.g., Hotel Cracovia) recently listed as heritage monuments were built during the later half of the 20th century in Kraków.|$|E

25|$|The <b>panel</b> <b>system</b> was {{designed}} to interconnect the offices of a city or a local calling area. Each office was assigned a two- (later three) digit office code. Callers dialed the office code followed by the station number. In most situations this led to six-digit (later seven) numbers. But from the beginning the <b>panel</b> <b>system</b> handled seven-digit numbers (later eight), for two reasons. Party line numbers were listed {{with one of the}} letters J, M, R, and W following the line number. The caller dialed the office code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. The <b>panel</b> <b>system</b> {{was designed}} to work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. To call a line in a manual office, callers dialed the office code followed by the line number, just as they would when calling a number in a fully automatic office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore dialed the office code and a five-digit line number.|$|E

These systems improved the performance of solar <b>panel</b> <b>systems</b> to produced maximum power efficiency. The response of this controlled system showed sluggish performance. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} introduce proportional derivative integral (PID) controller and (Lead-Lag) phase compensator to improve the dynamic response of the system. The required specifications are to obtain faster response with the minimum peak overshoot (Mp). The closed- loop system is initially built in Simulink/Matlab package and the (PID) controller and (Lead-Lag) phase compensator has been build into special subsystem. The components of control system have been dragged directly from Simulink library. Results showed that when compensator is properly designed the response would be acceptable in the sense of required specifications...|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{its service}} time, the <b>Panel</b> <b>system</b> was {{upgraded}} as new features became available or necessary. Starting in the mid-1920s, such upgrades improved the initial design. Major attention was initially focused on improving the sender. Early two- and three-digit type senders stored dialed digits on rotary selector switches. The senders employed translators {{to convert the}} dialed digits into the appropriate brush and group selections needed to complete the call. As better technology became available, Panel senders were upgraded to the all-relay type. These were more reliable, and in addition, replaced the translator equipment with decoders, which also operated entirely with relays, rather than with motor-driven apparatus, which yielded faster call completion.|$|E
