The instrument permits the operator to adjust a proper ground speed to keep grain loss within an acceptable range.

The recent practice by a large scale commercial Dyster aquafarm of using hand punched scallop shells strung on a 1 / 8 " nylon cord has resulted in estimated losses of 25 - 30 % due to 3 hell fracture and cord breakage. Drilling was investigated as a possible means of increasing useful shell processing and decreasing post-stringing losses. Based on laboratory experiments, a 1 / 8 " steel drill bit operated at 1328 rpm was found to be more efficient than either 1 / 4 " or 7 / 8 " drill bits operated at any speed. A net processing time of 20 shells per ninute with a <b>processing</b> <b>loss</b> of 6. 3 % was possible using the 1 / 8 " bit and drilling the shells one at a time.

Through {{the use of a}} phenomenological research process, that results in the production of filmworks, the value of using film as a way of managing and <b>processing</b> <b>loss</b> is considered. The notion of a self-reflexive pilgrimage is adopted as a mode of engagement with the liminal experience of grief. The effects of grief have the potential to develop into a pathological condition, identified in the discipline of psychoanalysis as melancholia, however, the value of using artmaking as a way of <b>processing</b> <b>loss</b> has been given little consideration.

Here, we uncover a role of Hbs in Notch (N) {{signaling}} and γ-secretase <b>processing.</b> <b>Loss</b> of hbs results in classical N-signaling-associated phenotypes in Drosophila, including eye patterning, wing margin, and sensory organ specification defects. In particular, hbs mutant larvae display altered γ-secretase-dependent Notch proteolytic processing. Hbs also interacts molecularly and genetically with Presenilin (Psn) and other components of the γ-secretase complex. This Hbs function appears conserved, as mammalian Nephrin also promotes N signaling in mammalian cells. Our data suggest that Hbs is required for Psn maturation. Consistent with its role in Psn processing, Hbs genetically interacts with the Drosophila β-amyloid protein precursor-like (Appl) protein, the homolog of mammalian APP, the cleavage of which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Thus, Hbs/Nephrin appear to share a general requirement in Psn/γ-secretase regulation and associated processes...|$|E

For example, milk can lose 30-70% of its vitamin B6 content when dried.

40|$|This {{bibliography}} is {{a companion}} to G 110, 'A bibliography on post-harvest losses in cereals and pulses with particular reference to tropical and sub-tropical countries', by J. M. Adams (TPI, 1977). Whereas G 110 covered storage, the present bibliography deals with the post-harvest processes from threshing to milling, with some abstracts on the secondary processes (cooking, baking, fermentation etc). The present world food situation has led technologists to look critically at all aspects of food production {{in order to increase}} the world's food resources. One aspect only recently studied with any great seriousness is the assessment and reduction of food <b>processing</b> <b>losses.</b> Losses occur at all stages of the food chain. Moreover, some losses made manifest at one point are caused earlier in the chain. Some obvious examples come to mind: failure to apply fertilizer leads to low yields; over-ripeness leads to threshing losses; bad threshing or drying techniques with paddy lead to broken rice at the mill, and so on. lt is always possible to reduce loss empirically, without prior assessment of the loss. However, to justify the necessary inputs of finance, labour etc, to reduce loss it is wise to assess the loss and measure its cost. In assessing loss two basic methods are available: (a) measurement of whole system, and (b) comparison of one process with a standard or optimal process. In (a) the loss itself is weighed. For example, by removing and weighing grain left on the stalk after threshing. In (b) the process is compared, in terms of yields and values, with an optimized, usually laboratory, process. All other unit operations in the processing chain are carried out in an identical way. For example, identical samples of maize cobs are dried to different moisture levels and then shelled: kernel damage is then compared.

Some areas are much better covered_than others, and it is hoped that this bibliography will spur researchers to concentrate on neglected areas.
