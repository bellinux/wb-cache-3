5|$|The {{scene in}} the {{courtroom}} where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton {{is seen as a}} reference to the 1920s Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, which dealt with issues of {{separation of church and state}} and the debate between creationism and evolution. The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant and the Piltdown Man. When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, Chief Wiggum is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a <b>Pottery</b> <b>Barn</b> in the new Heavenly Hills mall. A shot of the diggers in silhouette against the sunset is modeled after Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).|$|E

25|$|Once {{established}} at Harmony, Pennsylvania, the Society planned {{to replace the}} log dwellings with brick structures, but the group moved to the Indiana Territory before the plan was completed. In Indiana, log homes were soon replaced with one- or two-story houses of timber frame or brick construction in addition to four large rooming houses (dormitories) for its growing membership. The new town also included shops, schools, mills, a granary, a hotel, library, distilleries, breweries, a brick kiln, <b>pottery</b> ovens, <b>barn,</b> stables, storehouses, and two churches, {{one of which was}} brick.|$|R
5000|$|When France surrendered, {{with the}} threat of a German invasion, the school was moved inland to Yarkhill Court near Hereford, and stayed there {{until the end of the}} war. Yarkhill Court was a small Victorian manor house {{attached}} to a working mixed farm, and next to the river Frome. Accommodation was on three floors, but there was only one bathroom. Pupils could volunteer to cultivate the kitchen garden, they could go hop-picking, and there were <b>pottery</b> classes. The <b>barn</b> was used to stage school plays in French and German. Pupils were allowed to camp [...] "wild" [...] on the local common at half-term weekends. Mr Paul, in London, joined the Home Guard.|$|R

25|$|The most {{underdeveloped}} mass ceramics area is in tableware, porcelain and stoneware. Mexico {{has only}} two major tableware manufacturers, Anfora and Santa Anita, which produce porcelain and stoneware respectively. Anfora {{is the only one}} that has been successful in exporting its goods to US companies including Panera Bread, <b>Pottery</b> <b>Barn</b> and Starbucks. Most of these ceramics are imported from other countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany despite its ability to produce it itself. However, the lack of certain raw materials may partially explain this. Another problem is the continued production of lead glazed ware, which cannot be exported. While lead free and low lead glazes have been developed for use with low temperature firing, the most traditional, only about half of artisans use it.|$|E
