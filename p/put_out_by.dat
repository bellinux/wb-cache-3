5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E

This was designed as an instruction to the beginning coin collector, and also contained information to protect the new collector from fraud. Gale then in 1709 published his father's work on the Antonine Itinerary, which Gale supplemented with his own notes and commentary.

5|$|During {{these early}} {{performances}} Verdi made substantial {{changes to the}} score. For some of these he altered his manuscript, but for others musicologists have {{had to rely on}} the numerous full and piano scores <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Ricordi. Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894, which are also inadequately documented. Ricordi attempted {{to keep up with the}} changes, issuing new edition after new edition, but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory. The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible, leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety of options. In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees, believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source, augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} impacts from Igor {{were attributed to}} torrential rains, which led to excessive runoff and flash flooding. Several rivers rose to record levels across the Bonavista and Burin Peninsulas where many roads were washed out. Entire bridges, homes and portions of roads were destroyed. In some instances, flood waters were higher than entire homes. In response to the widespread floods, Newfoundland Power Inc. warned residents who still had power by the afternoon of September21 to turn off their main electrical panel if water enters their basement. Parts of St. Bernard's – Jacques Fontaine had to be evacuated by boat during the storm as rising water flooded {{some areas of the}} small town. Portions of Clarenville had to be evacuated under similar circumstances after a state of emergency was declared for the town. Water and sewage lines in Sunnyside broke due to flooding. In Glovertown, downed power lines sparked two fires during the storm, both of which were <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> firefighters without injuries.|$|E
5|$|Yet most American movie theaters, {{especially}} {{outside of}} urban areas, were still not equipped for sound: {{while the number}} of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929, they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters, which had actually grown in number as well, from 22,204 to 22,544. The studios, in parallel, were still not entirely convinced of the talkies' universal appeal—through mid-1930, the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions, silent as well as talking. Though few in the industry predicted it, silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory. Points West, a Hoot Gibson Western released by Universal Pictures in August 1929, was the last purely silent mainstream feature <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> a major Hollywood studio.|$|E
5|$|After {{the team}} split, Nitro, {{alongside}} Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice.

At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon {{as part of a}} four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure {{one or both of the}} Hardys, even going so far as to attack and perform a Snapshot on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud.|$|E

5|$|The Queen's Park Oval Cricket Club leased the Queen's Park Oval in 1896, moving {{there from}} its first {{home at the}} Queen's Park Savannah, where it had existed since its {{founding}} in 1891. The natural soil at the ground prevented turf wickets from being laid down, due to the damage caused by the mole crickets that inhabited it, so when the club moved to its new ground the groundsmen laid a pitch of clay with a wicket made of matting prepared on top. A popular venue due to its capacity (7,000 when first constructed, the highest in the Caribbean) the ground was very profitable for the owning cricket club. The first match recorded by Cricket Archive, CricInfo and Wisden took place on 29 January 1897, between Lord Hawke's touring party and a team <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the Queen's Park Oval Club. The match, which was a draw but saw the ground's first century—119 by Plum Warner—was not counted as first-class. Only a few days later on February 1 the ground's maiden first-class fixture took place between Trinidad and the same Lord Hawke's XI. The home team won by 137 runs. The two teams met at the Oval again on 5 February, when Trinidad were victorious once more. Arthur Priestley's touring eleven then played a Queen's Park XI on February 12, with the game drawn.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} the other Big Five studios, RKO relied on B {{pictures}} to fill up its schedule. Of the thirty-one features released by RKO in 1944, for instance, ten were budgeted below $200,000, twelve were in the $200,000 to $500,000 range, and only nine cost more. In contrast, a clear majority of the features <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the other top four studios were budgeted at over a half a million dollars. A focus on B pictures limited the studio's financial risk; while it also limited the potential for reward (Dmytryk's extraordinary coups aside), RKO had a history of making better profits with its run-of-the-mill and low-cost product than with its A movies. The studio's low-budget films offered training opportunities for new directors, as well, among them Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson, Robert Wise, and Anthony Mann. Robson and Wise received their first directing assignments with producer Val Lewton, whose specialized B horror unit also included the more experienced director Jacques Tourneur. The Lewton unit's moody, atmospheric work—represented by films such as Cat People (1942), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Body Snatcher (1945)—is now highly regarded. Richard Dix concluded his lengthy RKO career with the 1943 Lewton production The Ghost Ship. Tim Holt was RKO's cowboy star of the era, appearing in forty-six B Westerns and more than fifty movies altogether for the studio. In 1940, Chester Lauck and Norris Goff brought their famous comic characters Lum and Abner from radio to RKO for a six-film run. The Falcon detective series began in 1941; the Saint and the Falcon were so similar that Saint creator Leslie Charteris sued RKO. The Falcon was first played by George Sanders, who had appeared five times as the Saint. He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother, Tom Conway. Conway had a nine-film run in the part before the series ended in 1946. Johnny Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan pictures for RKO between 1943 and 1948 before being replaced by Lex Barker.|$|E
