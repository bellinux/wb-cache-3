When using a gas jet geometry, focusing the laser into the Mach disk can increase the efficiency of harmonic generation.|$|E
50|$|Two-pulse system (or {{skeleton}} photoperiod)To {{test the}} effect of Photoperiodism (i.e. varying the length of daytime), Pittendrigh and Daan invented the two-pulse system, with one flash at dawn, and another flash at dusk, and changing the interval between the 2 light pulses to mimic changing photoperiods. Interestingly, when photoperiod (i.e. daytime) gets longer than 12hr, a <b>Phase</b> <b>Jump</b> (also called ψ Jump, where ψ is the phase angle of entrainment) occurs, where the original nocturnal activity jumps to the now longer daytime, and ψ changes abruptly since the clock now treats the second light pulse as light onset {{and the start of}} the day. Nonetheless, in nature where photoperiod is complete (i.e. light is constantly shone throughout the daytime), ψ jump is not observed. This supports Aschoff's model of the parametric effect of light.|$|E
40|$|Burst-mode interferograms {{result in}} <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> between bursts in the {{presence}} of azimuthal motion. Such jumps occur due to the sudden change in the line-of-sight (LOS) vector (or, equivalently, the Doppler centroid) between consecutive bursts {{as a consequence of the}} burst mode operation. While the <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> might look like a nuisance, they are indeed the result of a legitimate measurement, namely, the azimuthal motion projected into the LOS vector. The <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> might complicate the phase unwrapping process and the exploitation and interpretation of the differential phase. While it is not always possible to handle the <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> with 1 -look data, the use of 2 -look acquisitions can considerably help in the proper decoupling of the range and azimuthal components of the motion. This paper presents the rationale to exploit 2 -look data for that purpose.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a free-electron laser {{can be enhanced}} by sustaining {{the growth of the}} radiation power beyond the initial saturation. One notable method is undulator tapering, which involves the variation of the gap height and/or the period along the undulator.

In this article, we develop a physics model of this <b>phase</b> <b>jump</b> method, and verify it with numerical simulations.
