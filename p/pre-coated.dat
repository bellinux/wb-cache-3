50|$|NAPPA uses DNA {{template}} {{that has}} already been immobilized onto the same protein capture surface. The DNA template is biotinylated and is bound to avidin that is <b>pre-coated</b> onto the protein capture surface. Newly synthesized proteins which are tagged with GST are then immobilized next to the template DNA by binding to the adjacent polyclonal anti-GST capture antibody that is also <b>pre-coated</b> onto the capture surface. The main drawback of this method is the extra and tedious preparation steps {{at the beginning of the}} process: (1) the cloning of cDNAs in an expression-ready vector; and (2) the need to biotinylate the plasmid DNA but not to interfere with transcription. Moreover, the resulting protein array is not ‘pure’ because the proteins are co-localized with their DNA templates and capture antibodies.|$|E
5000|$|Overjacketing {{extrusion}} is a coating process, {{in which}} individual bare wires or bundles of <b>pre-coated</b> wires are {{coated with a}} layer of insulating polymer. A wide variety of materials may be used, depending on the specific application. For many applications, such as [...] insulated cables, the polymer should be a good insulator, flexible, and wear resistant.|$|E
50|$|B.B. Chemical {{supplied}} shoe manufacturers, {{for use in}} reinforcing insoles, <b>pre-coated</b> {{fabric that}} it had slit into strips of suitable width. If the manufacturer desired, B.B. Chemical supplied the fabric, <b>pre-coated</b> it, and slit it. B.B. Chemical also supplied adhesive, {{to be applied to}} the <b>pre-coated</b> fabric at the shoe factory immediately prior to the application of the reinforcing material to the insole, and also provided machines suitable for use in applying the adhesive to the strips, the machines being and remaining the property of B.B. Chemical. These machines were covered by patents that B.B. Chemical owned. B.B. Chemical, in addition, gave instructions to operators, serviced the machines and advised and assisted in the reinforcing operation. As compensation for the foregoing, B.B. Chemical made a single charge to the shoe manufacturers at a rate per web yard of fabric supplied. If the manufacturer did not furnish the fabric, the price of that material was added to the charge. The adhesives used by B.B. Chemical in pre-coating the fabric have all had a large rubber content but were made according to different formulae, developed from time to time by B.B. Chemical with special reference to the patent. B.B. Chemical did not grant written licenses to shoe manufacturers, nor was any such license ever requested. Neither by notice or by agreement in any form with its customers did it require them to use only B.B. Chemical's material.|$|E

However, the RAD52 protein has distinctly different functions in HRR of yeast and humans. In S. cerevisae, Rad52 protein, acting alone, facilitates the loading of Rad51 protein onto single-stranded DNA <b>pre-coated</b> with replication protein A in the presynaptic phase of recombination.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plate is}} visualized. As some plates are <b>pre-coated</b> with a {{phosphor}} such as zinc sulfide, allowing many compounds to be visualized by using ultraviolet light; dark spots appear where the compounds block the UV light from striking the plate. Alternatively, plates can be sprayed or immersed in chemicals after elution. Various visualising agents react with the spots to produce visible results.|$|E

50|$|Building {{envelope}} {{made from}} metal sheet provide builders and architects with products, which meet {{all of the}} highest demand regarding construction characteristics and design. The steel from which profiled cladding sheets are made is available <b>pre-coated</b> {{in a wide range}} of colors and textures, allowing architects to choose a finish that best suits the location and function of the building. Profile shape is also a characteristic that can be adapted to the demand of the architects.|$|E
50|$|In the in situ method, protein {{synthesis}} {{is carried out}} on a protein array surface that is <b>pre-coated</b> with a protein-capturing reagent or antibody. Once the newly synthesized proteins are released from the ribosome, the tag sequence that is also synthesized at the N- or C-terminus of each nascent protein will be bound by the capture reagent or antibody, thus immobilizing the proteins to form an array. Commonly used tags include polyhistidine (His)6 and glutathione s-transferase (GST).|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} {{is separated from}} the ore by methods such as filtration (e.g. horizontal leaf type clarifiers) and counter current decantation (CCD). Afterwards a very clear {{solution is}} achieved by using <b>pre-coated</b> filters applying diatomaceous earth. Oxygen is then removed by passing the solution through a vacuum de-aeration column. Zinc dust {{is added to the}} clarified, de-aerated solution which precipitates the gold; zinc having a higher affinity for the cyanide ion than gold. Other precious metals, silver, and base metals, like copper, will also precipitate, if present.|$|E
5000|$|The {{district}} {{court found that}} B.B. Chemical's method of doing business brought it within the prohibition of Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Development Corp. and Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co. B.B. Chemical stressed {{that it did not}} require its customers to agree to buy the <b>pre-coated</b> fabric from it or grant licenses on that condition. It also stressed that the <b>pre-coated</b> fabric, although unpatented, was not a staple but was specially adapted for use in practicing the patented process. Moreover, as the court agreed, B.B. Chemical could not practicably practice the patent in its own factory. The {{district court}} dismissed these arguments. The Leitch case held that a [...] "method of doing business which leads to such suppression of competition in unpatented commodities will be enough" [...] to [...] "prevent success in a suit against a competitor for contributory infringement." [...] Also, [...] "the rule was not to be limited to efforts of a patentee to control the use of staple materials." [...] Finally: [...] "The fact that plaintiff's method of conducting its business is the most practical method is not a controlling factor. The question cannot be decided as a matter of convenience to either plaintiff or defendant." ...|$|E
50|$|During the 1870s photographers {{used the}} common wet-plate, which {{required}} {{a lot of}} on-the-spot preparation for immediate exposure. Although not a new idea, photography was still {{in its early stages}} of experimentation. Berkeley experimented with the <b>pre-coated,</b> semi-dry collodion plates which were commercially available at that time. He discovered that with the addition of sulfite to Samman's developing solution, in order to absorb the sulphur dioxide, which was given off by the chemical dithionite, that dithionite was no longer required in the developing process. Berkeley published his discovery in 1881.|$|E
5000|$|Ellis {{invented a}} method {{in which he}} coated a fabric with a rubber composition. After heating and drying, the non-tacky web was then cut into strips and wound into rolls. The {{next step in the}} process was to apply a coating of rubber cement to the <b>pre-coated</b> {{material}} just before the strip was applied to the insole. This application is made by the shoe manufacturer. The fabric thus coated is then at once applied to the insole and [...] "formed in" [...] around the lip, usually with a hand tool. This process does not require heat when it is inserted into the shoe.|$|E
50|$|DNA array to {{protein array}} (DAPA) {{is a method}} {{developed}} in 2007 to repeatedly produce protein arrays by ‘printing’ them from a single DNA template array, on demand (Figure 5). It starts with the spotting and immobilization of an array of DNA templates onto a glass slide. The slide is then assembled face-to-face with a second slide <b>pre-coated</b> with a protein-capturing reagent, and a membrane soaked with cell extract is placed between the two slides for transcription and translation to take place. The newly synthesized his-tagged proteins are then immobilized onto the slide to form the array. In the publication in 18 of 20 replications a protein microarray copy could be generated. Potentially the process can be repeated as often as needed, {{as long as the}} DNA is unharmed by DNAses, degradation or mechanical abrasion.|$|E
50|$|This {{method is}} an {{adaptation}} of mRNA display technology. PCR DNA is first transcribed to mRNA, and a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide modified with biotin and puromycin on each end is then hybridized to the 3’-end of the mRNA. The mRNAs are then arrayed on a slide and immobilized by the binding of biotin to streptavidin that is <b>pre-coated</b> on the slide. Cell extract is then dispensed on the slide for in situ translation to take place. When the ribosome reaches the hybridized oligonucleotide, it stalls and incorporates the puromycin molecule to the nascent polypeptide chain, thereby attaching the newly synthesized protein to the microarray via the DNA oligonucleotide. A pure protein array is obtained after the mRNA is digested with RNase. The protein spots generated by this method are very sharply defined and can be produced at a high density.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{is well suited}} to slurries, and liquids with a high solid content, which could clog other forms of filter. The drum is <b>pre-coated</b> with a filter aid, typically of diatomaceous earth (DE) or Perlite. After pre-coat has been applied, the liquid to be filtered {{is sent to the}} tub below the drum. The drum rotates through the liquid and the vacuum sucks liquid and solids onto the drum pre-coat surface, the liquid portion is [...] "sucked" [...] by the vacuum through the filter media to the internal portion of the drum, and the filtrate pumped away. The solids adhere to the outside of the drum, which then passes a knife, cutting off the solids and {{a small portion of the}} filter media to reveal a fresh media surface that will enter the liquid as the drum rotates. The knife advances automatically as the surface is removed.|$|E
5000|$|By {{varying the}} amount of {{platinum}} versus palladium {{and the addition of}} oxidizing chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and potassium dichromate or potassium chlorate, the contrast and [...] "color" [...] of the final image can be modified. Because of the non-uniformity of the coating and mixing phases of the process, no two prints are exactly the same. The inherent low sensitivity of the process occurs because the ferric oxalate is sensitive to ultra-violet light only, thus specialized light sources must be used and exposure times are many times greater than those used in silver-based photographic processes. Due to the unavailability of <b>pre-coated</b> sensitized paper, all platinum/palladium printing is done on paper coated by the printer. The light sensitive chemicals are mixed from powdered basic chemicals, or some commercially available solutions, then hand applied with a brush or a cylindrical [...] "pusher". Many artists achieve varying effects by choosing different papers for different surface characteristics, including vellum, rag, silk, and rice, among others. On the collecting market, platinum prints often sell for many times what a similar silver-gelatin print would bring.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was not one}} {{bottleneck}} to faster casting production {{but rather}} several. Improvements were made in molding speed, molding sand preparation, sand mixing, core manufacturing processes, and the slow metal melting rate in cupola furnaces. In 1912, the sand slinger was invented by the American company Beardsley & Piper. In 1912, the first sand mixer with individually mounted revolving plows was marketed by the Simpson Company. In 1915, the first experiments started with bentonite clay instead of simple fire clay as the bonding additive to the molding sand. This increased tremendously the green and dry strength of the molds. In 1918, the first fully automated foundry for fabricating hand grenades for the U.S. Army went into production. In the 1930s the first high-frequency coreless electric furnace was installed in the U.S. In 1943, ductile iron was invented by adding magnesium to the widely used grey iron. In 1940, thermal sand reclamation was applied for molding and core sands. In 1952, the [...] "D-process" [...] was developed for making shell molds with fine, <b>pre-coated</b> sand. In 1953, the hotbox core sand {{process in which the}} cores are thermally cured was invented. In 1954, a new core binder—water glass (sodium silicate), hardened with CO2 from ambient air, came into use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a Vertical Damp Proof Barrier is to prevent the ingress of damp and water into {{subterranean}} structures such as basements, cellars, tunnels and earth shielded buildings. (Also known as Earth sheltered buildings).Traditionally, this {{took the form of}} several coats of bitumous paint or tar. This, though cheap, has the disadvantage that any movement in the structure or joints is likely to rupture the paint so allowing water to enter. Modern solutions {{take the form of a}} plastic membrane, often <b>pre-coated</b> with adhesive and a [...] "peel off" [...] paper that is applied to the outside of the structure before it is buried. Usually, a [...] "priming coat" [...] of bitumous paint has to be applied first. It often comes in one metre wide rolls and is installed with a 100 mm overlap. The membrane has a high modulous of elasticity (that is, it stretches a lot, often by a factor of ten before it ruptures) Precautions have to be taken that sharp objects in the backfill do not pierce it. Sometimes fine sand is used to backfill but more often insulation boards are laid against it before backfilling, particularly in an inhabited room.As a further precaution against water ingress, it is recommended that land drains be installed behind the protected wall at its base to prevent the buildup of hydrostatic pressure in wet weather.|$|E
5000|$|The same {{conduction}} {{that works}} against the spot vaporization of metal is an asset if {{the objective is}} to vaporize some other coating away from the metal. Laser engraving metal plates are manufactured with a finely polished metal, coated with an enamel paint made to be [...] "burned off". At levels of 10-30 watts, excellent engravings are made as the enamel is removed quite cleanly. Much laser engraving is sold as exposed brass or silver-coated steel lettering on a black or dark-enamelled background. A wide variety of finishes are now available, including screen-printed marble effects on the enamel. Anodized aluminum is commonly engraved or etched with CO2 laser machines. With power less than 40W this metal can easily be engraved with clean, impressive detail. The laser bleaches the color exposing the white or silver aluminum substrate. Although it comes in various colors, laser engraving black anodized aluminum provides the best contrast of all colors. Unlike most materials engraving anodize aluminum does not leave any smoke or residue.Spray coatings can be obtained for the specific use of laser engraving metals, these sprays apply a coating that is visible to the laser light which fuses the coating to the substrate where the laser passed over. Typically, these sprays {{can also be used to}} engrave other optically invisible or reflective substances such as glass and are available in a variety of colours. Besides spray coatings, some laser-markable metals come <b>pre-coated</b> for imaging. Products such as this transform the surface of the metal to a different color (often black, brown or grey).|$|E
