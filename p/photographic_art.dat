The Media Museum of Odense documents the history of the freedom of speech in Denmark since 1849, and the development of the printing press and the history of Danish broadsheet Berlingske.|$|E
5|$|As his curios {{business}} developed, with {{branches in}} Rangoon, Mandalay {{but also in}} Colombo and London, he also acquired the <b>Photographic</b> <b>Art</b> Gallery in Mandalay in 1903, another photographic studio.

5|$|Due to {{the appeal}} of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury {{commissioned}} a second line of editions in an 'adult' style. These initially used black-and-white <b>photographic</b> <b>art</b> for the covers showing objects from the books (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting people, but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin's locket {{on the cover of the}} final book.|$|E
25|$|In photography: Eric Kroll and Irving Klaw (with Bettie Page, {{the first}} {{well-known}} bondage model), and Japanese photographer Araki Nobuyoshi, whose works are exhibited in several major art museums, galleries and private collections, {{such as the}} Baroness Marion Lambert, the world's largest holder of contemporary <b>photographic</b> <b>art.</b> Also Robert Mapplethorpe, whose most controversial work {{is that of the}} underground BDSM scene in the late 1960s and early 1970s of New York. The homoeroticism of this work fuelled a national debate over the public funding of controversial artwork.|$|E
25|$|Downtown La Jolla {{is noted}} for jewelry stores, boutiques, {{upmarket}} restaurants and hotels. Prospect Street and Girard Avenue are also shopping and dining districts.

500|$|Polish-born artist Ania Bien {{produced}} a <b>photographic</b> <b>art</b> installation in 1986 called [...] "Hotel Polen". [...] She fabricated 18 {{replicas of the}} hotel's menu stands, and used them to display photographs alluding to the Holocaust. [...] David Levi-Strauss wrote that Bien's art piece is a [...] "polysemous work of absence, in which what happens between images is the most important." [...] The work was displayed at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1987 and at the Amsterdams Historisch Museum in 1988.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the post-war}} period and {{particularly}} in Switzerland a revival in Akzidenz-Grotesk's popularity took hold, in {{what became known as}} the [...] "Swiss International Style" [...] of graphic design. This style often contrasted Akzidenz-Grotesk with <b>photographic</b> <b>art,</b> and did not use all caps as much as many older posters. Graphic designers of this style such as Karl Gerstner found the sans-serifs of the nineteenth-century more [...] "neutral" [...] and even than the more [...] "personal" [...] recent sans-serifs of the previous decades. Eskilson's Graphic Design: A New History comments that they [...] "conveyed the functionalist ethos without appearing too stylised...in the manner of the more geometrically pure types." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jay Dearborn Edwards (1831–1900), a New Hampshire native, {{was born}} Jay Dearborn Moody, on July 14, 1831. After {{the death of}} his father in 1842, young Jay was sent to St. Louis to live with an aunt, at which time his surname was changed to Edwards. By age 17, he was a {{lecturer}} on the pseudoscience phrenology, and apparently also began his photographic career, operating a daguerreian studio at 92-1/2 Fourth Street. In 1851, he and his aunt moved to New Orleans, and Jay quickly established himself at 19 Royal Street. He preferred working outdoors in his [...] "queer-looking wagon." [...] The new art of wet-plate photography enabled Edwards to distribute his stereoscopic views images throughout New Orleans. Because his stereo cards had a P.O. box number imprinted on the backs, historians have concluded he did not operate his own gallery in New Orleans. However, that changed when he and E. H. Newton Jr. formed a partnership and opened the Gallery of <b>Photographic</b> <b>Art,</b> located at 19 Royal Street. The gallery specialized in [...] "stereoscopic views of any part of the world," [...] and was assisted by New York publisher Edward Anthony and the London Stereoscopic Company. Their diverse inventory included an array of photographic equipment, photographs, ambrotypes, melainotypes, portrait enlargements, pastel, oil, and watercolor prints. Edwards undertook one of the earliest wartime photo expeditions by venturing into the field in April 1861. He followed Confederate units from New Orleans to Pensacola, Fl., as they mobilized against Fort Pickens. Edwards advertised 39 views at [...] "$1 per copy." [...] Two were reproduced as woodcuts in Harper's Weekly in June, though Edwards received no credit. Afterwards, Edward was apparently out of business.|$|E

60|$|One of {{the best}} and happiest of the many likenesses of Mr. Carlyle that {{appeared}} during the last decade of his life was a sketch by Mrs. Allingham--a picture as well as a portrait--representing the venerable philosopher in a long and picturesque dressing-gown, seated on a chair and poring over a folio, in the garden {{at the back of the}} quaint old house at Chelsea, which will henceforth, as long as it stands, be associated with his memory. Beside him on the grass lies a long clay pipe (a churchwarden) which he has been smoking in the sweet morning air. So that altogether, as far as pictorial, graphic, and <b>photographic</b> <b>art</b> can go, the features, form, and bodily semblance of Carlyle will be as well known to future generations as they are to our own.|$|E
