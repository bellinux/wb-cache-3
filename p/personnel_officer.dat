25|$|The {{implications}} of teacher representation by four unions had several serious consequences. Any issue raised by one {{union with the}} Chief <b>Personnel</b> <b>Officer</b> (CPO) had to be discussed with each union separately. This resulted in the presentation of conflicting arguments to the CPO and his advisor's by the different unions, a situation which acted to the disadvantage of teachers. Additionally, negotiations were often lengthy with a consequently longer period for settlement. The relationship between the three unions was thus described as one involving {{a great deal of}} “inter-union rivalry and fragmentation” which was seen as “the biggest disadvantage when negotiating a collective agreement,”.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the perceptions held by Chief Student <b>Personnel</b> <b>Officers</b> in selected community colleges {{on the extent to}} which twenty-five student services functions are being performed and should be performed. ^ The general proposition underlying the study was that there is a concentration on the functions which are actually performed by student services divisions and limited information regarding the functions which Chief Student <b>Personnel</b> <b>Officers</b> think should be performed. ^ In general, it can be concluded from this study that significant relationships do exist between what is being done and should be done for certain functions in student services in community colleges. While a majority of the respondents (89 percent) perceived that evaluation Should be done to a considerable or great extent, less than half (49 percent) of the respondents reported that evaluation was being done to the same degree. ^ In the majority of the functions investigated by this study, there were no significant differences between which functions the respondents perceive as being provided and those functions the respondents thought should be provided. Of the significant differences found in this study, all but two of these occurred when comparing the differences between the small and large groups on both institutional size and professional staff size. ^ During the analysis of the data, the group means did indicate that although the functions were being provided and should be provided, they were not perceived to be at a high priority. Five functions were consistently ranked high, but the other functions tended to cluster in the mid-range or lower in rated importance. ^ Other trends observed from this study were that: there are extensive offerings of student personnel functions on the community college campuses in the five state area; the Chief Student <b>Personnel</b> <b>Officers</b> perceive most functions as being offered to a considerable or great extent; and it is clear that the Chief Student <b>Personnel</b> <b>Officers</b> hold more similar views than dissimilar views regarding the various functions. ...|$|R
