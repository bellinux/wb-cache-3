25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

500|$|Clooney cast Julia Roberts as {{the mysterious}} CIA agent Patricia Watson {{due to their}} {{positive}} working relationship in Ocean's Eleven (2001). Her role was originally set for Nicole Kidman, who dropped out over scheduling conflicts with The Hours. After Rockwell's casting, Confessions was once again briefly postponed; Miramax did not greenlight the film until Roberts signed on. Clooney commented, [...] "Julia really helped me. Her doing the part made it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to cast Sam Rockwell. He can't drive a $28 million film, but Julia certainly can." [...] Renée Zellweger and Gwyneth Paltrow were considered for the Penny Pacino role, which eventually went to Drew Barrymore.|$|E

500|$|In the Georgia game Bomar had a brain {{hemorrhage}} {{after he}} was kicked in the chin, and half his body was paralyzed for two days. It was thought {{that he would never}} play football again: [...] "Not a player on the team could talk of Bomar's injury without tears coming to his eyes", and Bomar sat on the bench {{for the rest of the}} season's games. Known as a devastating blocker and [...] "lightning fast," [...] he was the first Commodore football player elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956. At his induction Bomar said, [...] "I just wish all the men who played with me at Vanderbilt between 1921 and 1924 could also receive this coveted award. They deserve it more than I do. After all, they made it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to be chosen." ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 June, {{the launch}} cleared Cape York, the extreme {{northern}} {{point of the}} Australian continent. Bligh turned south-west, and steered {{through a maze of}} shoals, reefs, sandbanks, and small islands. The route taken was not the Endeavour Strait, but a narrower southerly passage later known as the Prince of Wales Channel. At 20:00 that evening, they reached the open Arafura Sea, still [...] from Coupang. The following eight days encompassed some of the toughest travel of the entire journey and, by 11 June, many were close to collapse. The next day, the coast of Timor was sighted: [...] "It is not <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to describe the pleasure which the blessing of the sight of this land diffused among us", Bligh wrote. On 14 June, with a makeshift Union Jack hoisted, they sailed into Coupang harbour.|$|E

2500|$|While Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936 {{before his}} coronation, it was {{initially}} envisaged that his successor George VI would ultimately visit India and {{have his own}} Durbar. [...] The Indian National Congress passed a motion weeks after his accession calling for a boycott of any such visit, and in February 1937 Communist MP Willie Gallacher decried expenditure on such festivities {{in a country of}} such poverty. [...] The King's Speech of October 1937 included [...] "I am looking forward with interest and pleasure to the time when it will be <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> to visit My Indian Empire"; however, the onset of World War II and the movement towards Indian independence meant this visit never happened.|$|E

2500|$|Monica's career {{came to a}} {{slow down}} in 1999 due to {{relationship}} problems with her ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?'

In 2011, another Filipino artist, Gary Valenciano during his visit in Malaysia has expressed her admiration of Siti's vocal ability. He commented, [...] "Based on what I've been told by the local media, I believe the best Malay song and the best vocal I've ever heard has to be Siti Nurhaliza's.

2500|$|Roberto {{opted for}} {{surgery at the}} end of 1975 in order to prolong his life. Casali said: [...] "We were talking about Christmas {{presents}} and I told Roberto I didn't want another diamond ring, I wanted another baby." [...] They decided [...] "...that we would store some sperm just in case I didn't get pregnant before Roberto died. I knew he had only a few months to live, so we stored some sperm immediately." [...] Roberto died in March 1976, aged 31. Despite initial opposition from the medical profession she underwent several treatments of artificial insemination at a Cambridge clinic, and gave birth to son Milo Roberto Andrea sixteen months later, on 10 July 1977. She said at the time: [...] "Roberto and I were very anxious to provide a brother or sister to our two sons. Now, thanks to the care and patience of the doctors, it has been made <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to have another reminder of my wonderful husband." [...] British newspapers called Milo the [...] "miracle baby". The birth announcement consisted of a simple card drawn by Casali with the Love is... girl pushing a pram on the front, with the inscription inside: [...] "Proudly presenting Milo Roberto. Parents: Kim and the late Roberto (posthumously by artificial insemination)".|$|E
2500|$|At King's College, Wilkins pursued, {{among other}} things, X-ray {{diffraction}} work on ram sperm and DNA {{that had been}} obtained from calf thymus by the Swiss scientist Rudolf Signer. The DNA from Signer's lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated. Wilkins discovered {{that it was possible}} to produce thin threads from this concentrated DNA solution that contained highly ordered arrays of DNA suitable for the production of X-ray diffraction patterns. Using a carefully bundled group of these DNA threads and keeping them hydrated, Wilkins and a graduate student Raymond Gosling obtained X-ray photographs of DNA that showed that the long, thin DNA molecule in the sample from Signer had a regular, crystal-like structure in these threads. Gosling later said [...] "When... I first saw all those discrete diffraction spots ...emerging on the film in the developing dish was a truly eureka moment....we realised that if DNA was the gene material then we had just shown that genes could crystallize!" [...] This initial X-ray diffraction work at King's College was done in May or June 1950. It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked James Watson’s interest in DNA causing him to write [...] "suddenly I was excited about chemistry.....I began to wonder whether it would be <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to join Wilkins in working on DNA". At that time Wilkins also introduced Francis Crick to the importance of DNA. Crick advised him to work on proteins telling Wilkins [...] "what you ought to do is find yourself a good protein". Wilkins knew that proper experiments on the threads of purified DNA would require better X-ray equipment. Wilkins ordered a new X-ray tube and a new microcamera. He also suggested to Randall that the soon-to-be-appointed Rosalind Franklin should be reassigned from work on protein solutions to join the DNA effort.|$|E
