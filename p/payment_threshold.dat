40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} collective action and financial dimensions of rural waterpoint sustainability in sub-Saharan Africa. Four interlinking papers empirically evaluate {{the nature and}} drivers of financial risks, and how they in turn impact the operational performance of community water supplies. The research is grounded in conceptual and theoretical frameworks pertaining to collective action and common-pool resource management, in particular Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework (Ostrom, 2007), Musgrave & Musgrave's economic good framework (Musgrave & Musgrave, 1973), and Marwell & Oliverâs critical mass theory (Marwell & Oliver, 1993). The first paper analyses data extracted from national waterpoint inventories in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. The remaining three papers draw on primary data from rural Kenya comprising 229 years' worth of water committee financial records, a census of 571 waterpoints, and a survey of 3, 361 households. These data were collected during extensive field work campaigns in Kwale, Kenya. Quantitative analyses were carried out by way of advanced statistical techniques, including logistic regression, linear mixed (repeated measure) models, and generalised estimating equations. Results suggest collection of user fees is a significant determinant of waterpoint sustainability, alongside other institutional, technical, geographical and environmental variables. However, monthly payment arrangements are beset by non-payment and late payment, particularly if rainfall levels are high, group size is large, households are far away, and water is aggressive and unpalatable. Although monthly contribution levels remain relatively stable above a collective payment rate of 60 %, {{there is little evidence}} of self-sustaining growth beyond this point, and revenue collection is prone to collapse below this collective <b>payment</b> <b>threshold.</b> In comparison, pay-as-you-fetch fees are associated with increased revenue and improved operational performance, but result in a higher proportion of households opting for an unimproved water source. If the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to safe water supplies is to be achieved in rural sub-Saharan Africa, strategies are needed to strengthen revenue collection systems and bolster payment incentives. External support and professionalised service delivery models present potential pathways to advance these goals. Policymakers may also need to introduce carefully designed subsidies, or promote self-supply approaches that realign lifecycle costs with usersâ willingness-to-pay. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Malaysian {{health system}} has evolved {{significantly}} from the public sector dominated delivery system in the 1950 ’s to a more balanced public private health care system found today. Rapid expansion of the private health sector occurred from the 1990 ’s and as a consequence, private shares of health financing {{have been on the}} increase. This thesis on fair financing of health is motivated by welfare concerns arising from consumption of private health care by the poor, specifically the impact on household welfare caused by household out-of-pocket (OOP) health payments. The concept of fair financing generally holds that society has a moral obligation to ensure that the health needs of the poor can be met without requiring them to fully pay for the health care needed and consumed which they may not otherwise be able to afford. Fair financing for health is examined using data from three comparable nationally representative household expenditure surveys conducted in 1993 / 94, 1998 / 99 and 2004 / 05. The first part of the study, assessment of financial risk protection for health, looks at the distribution of household OOP health payments as well as comparing household OOP payments to two payment thresholds - a catastrophic <b>payment</b> <b>threshold</b> which is set at a predetermined share of household consumption and official Malaysian household poverty lines. In essence this part of the study measures extent to which distributions of OOP payments are favouring richer or poorer persons, levels of catastrophic health payments and medical impoverishment. Availability of data allowed financial risk protection to be assessed for the years 1993, 1998 and 2004. Financial risk protection for health has also been examined by geographical regions in Malaysia (Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak), urban rural strata and ethnicity. Distributions of OOP payments have also been examined by public private sector providers and categories of health care services. The second part of the study assesses the progressivity of entire health financing system by measuring the progressivity of six health financing sources, namely personal income tax, sales tax, non-tax Federal Government revenues, social security funds from the Employee Provident Fund and Social Security Organisation, private health insurance payments and OOP health payments, singly and in combination. Availability of data and information allowed progressivity to be assessed for the years 1998 and 2004. This study has found evidence of fair financing in Malaysia which included small OOP payment burdens for the average person with distributions favouring richer persons, low levels of catastrophic health payments and medical impoverishment as well as an overall progressive health financing system, mainly made up of four progressive financing sources namely personal income tax, social security funds, OOP health payments and private health insurance payments. As expected, this study has found that OOP payments have been predominantly for the purchase of private health care, mainly for non-hospital based care and pharmaceuticals. Financial risk protection was higher among some sub-populations in the country including those living in Sarawak, rural areas and the Chinese. However, over time from 1993 to 2004, some features of fair financing appeared to have diminished where the distribution of OOP payments and households incurring catastrophic health payments became less concentrated among the rich. The overall health financing system was found to be progressive in 1998 and 2004. Changes in progressivity were too small to make a definite conclusion of the trends over time. Declining fairness in health financing in Malaysia may be explained by increasing OOP payments for private care and increasing uptake of private health insurance by poorer households. This in turn may be due in part to declining quality of care provided by the public health system which may have been partially caused by the rapidly expanding private health sector. If so, the situation is likely to worsen further if remedial actions are not taken. This study has provided two main health policy lessons with regards to private provision and private financing of health care. The first is that extensive taxation-based funding of health care can ensure fair financing despite high OOP health payment shares of total health financing in a country. The second is that a situation of fair financing can co-exist with a large private health sector financed mainly from OOP payments. The main message {{is that it is not}} so much the quantum of payments that matters but rather the distribution of payments...|$|E

40|$|Pay-for-performance {{programs}} are often aimed {{to improve the}} management of chronic diseases. We evaluate {{the impact of a}} local pay for performance programme (QOF+), which rewarded financially more ambitious quality targets (‘stretch targets’) than those used nationally in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). We focus on targets for intermediate outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. A difference-in-difference approach is used to compare practice level achievements before and after the introduction of the local pay for performance program. In addition, we analysed patient-level data on exception reporting and intermediate outcomes utilizing an interrupted time series analysis. The local pay for performance program led to significantly higher target achievements (hypertension: p-value < 0. 001, coronary heart disease: p-values < 0. 001, diabetes: p-values < 0. 061, stroke: p-values < 0. 003). However, the increase was driven by higher rates of exception reporting (hypertension: p-value < 0. 001, coronary heart disease: p-values < 0. 03, diabetes: p-values < 0. 05) in patients with all conditions except for stroke. Exception reporting allows practitioners to exclude patients from target calculations if certain criteria are met, e. g. informed dissent of the patient for treatment. There were no statistically significant improvements in mean blood pressure, cholesterol or HbA 1 c levels. Thus, achievement of higher <b>payment</b> <b>thresholds</b> in the local pay for performance scheme was mainly attributed to increased exception reporting by practices with no discernable improvements in overall clinical quality. Hence, active monitoring of exception reporting should be considered when setting more ambitious quality targets.

The data on the efficacy and safety of therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors were obtained from the analysis of the results of clinical trials selected during an information search. The pharmacoeconomic analysis used the following methods: cost analysis, budget impact analysis, cost miniminization analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Results. The performed investigation demonstrated that the use of pazopanib in patients with disseminated renal cell carcinoma was expedient from an economic standpoint and less effective than that of sunitinib. The cost of an annual cycle of pazopanib treatment in Russia was not found to be greater than the <b>payment</b> readiness <b>threshold.</b> Analysis of the purchase amount of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma in 2014 demonstrated that the use of pazopanib could reduce government spending by 290. 2 million (21. 6 %) rubles per year. This saving of budgetary funds provides a way of treating additional 375 people per 1, 000 patients when using pazopanib. The administration of pazopanib with its existing purchase amount for the treatment of disseminated renal cell carcinoma will be able to reduce government spending by 1. 4 milliard rubles during 5 years, which corresponds to the current annual costs of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Conclusion. The use of pazopanib makes it possible to reduce government spending on 1 st line targeted therapy of advanced RCC in comparison with sunitinib with comparable efficacy of both agents. </p...|$|R

The effect of ignorance of such managerial flexibilities can be potentially substantial, {{with the possibility of}} producing biased decisions. Real options analysis provides the insights that business investment projects can be conceptually compared to financial options and is therefore able to seize the value of managerial flexibilities. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a theoretical model based on option pricing theory to evaluate the managerial flexibilities arising in a variety of mergers and acquisitions, which vary in payment forms. The thesis shows how transactions can be structured as a real exchange options, given the share price of each participating firm is subject to a specified degree of uncertainty. The takeover decisions of bidder or target, i. e., the takeover threshold to bid or to accept the bid, is obtained through the analysis. In addition, the thesis provides valuable theoretical insights into the following aspects: The impact of the form of payment on the decision making process for each participant and corresponding merger terms The payment form that minimizes the threshold to trigger a transaction The allocating rule of mergers and acquisitions synergy when <b>payment</b> form <b>threshold</b> is employed In the latter part of thesis, an empirical study is conducted on mergers and acquisitions completed by US public bidders between January 1985 and April 2004 excluding all financial institutions deals.

We study simple output-agreement mechanisms that pay an agent in the case she agrees with the report of another, and potentially penalizes for disagreement through a negative payment. Assuming access to a quality oracle, able to determine whether an agent’s quality is above a given threshold, we design a payment scheme that aligns incentives so that agents whose quality is above this threshold participate and invest effort. Precluding negative payments leads the expected cost of this quality-oracle mechanism to increase {{by a factor of}} 2 to 5 relative to allowing both positive and negative payments. Dropping the assumption about access to a quality oracle, we further show that negative payments {{can be used to make}} agents with quality lower than the quality threshold choose to not to participate, while those above continue to participate and invest effort.

The study augments the existing evidence by analysing the dynamics of such payments over different years and the weight that informal payments have in the total out-of-pocket health spending.

We find that out-of-pocket and informal payments have increased in real value throughout the years. Even though their catastrophic effect has gone down (due also to declining trends in absolute poverty), the effect for the poorest expenditure quintiles remains high. Out-of-pocket payments deepen the poverty headcount and also enlarge the poverty gap and again the effect is larger for the poorest quintiles. Future policy interventions should provide better protection mechanisms for the poor by providing exemption criteria or subsidised transport and should seek to address the widespread informal payments in the country. informal payments, out-of-pocket payments, health care expenditure, impoverishment, Albania LSMS, Albania, living standard, poverty...|$|R
40|$|EWEB envisions the {{development}} of an investment mechanism that makes payments for ecosystem services (PES) as a way to maintain and improve water quality within the McKenzie River Watershed, Eugene’s sole source of drinking water. The public name for this concept is the Voluntary Incentives Program. Under the envisioned Voluntary Incentives Program (VIP), EWEB will provide annual dividend payments to landowners for the valuable services their properties provide including water filtration and purification. These dividends recognize the value of the natural capital provided by these lands and their downstream benefits to the residents of Eugene. A fund with sustainable financing will be established to support the dividend payments and the infrastructure necessary to operate the Voluntary Incentives Program. Financing will come {{from a variety of sources}} but could be initially endowed through existing water funds (under existing rate structure) or another utility funding mechanism. Additional possible financing sources other than EWEB include corporations, a voter approved bond measure, development impact fees, and state and federal mitigation programs. EWEB will establish a stewardship boundary identifying riparian forests and floodplains that are eligible to enroll in the VIP. Participation is open to private landowners, local governments, and non-profit organizations that own land within the designated boundary. Based on EWEB’s preliminary analysis, an estimated 6, 500 acres of riparian and floodplain areas along the McKenzie and major tributaries are eligible to enroll. Land within the stewardship boundary will need to meet a threshold in order to receive <b>payments.</b> This <b>threshold</b> will be determined by adapting existing riparian forest and wetland habitat standards and definitions from NRCS, USFS, Defenders of Wildlife and other entities to establish the criteria for participation in the VIP.

Average expenditures do not represent the poor because they spend less on treatment compared to other economic groups. Thus, the extent to which TB expenditures risk sending households into, or further into, poverty and its determinants, is unknown. We assessed the incidence and determinants of household catastrophic payments for TB care in rural Nigeria. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Data used were obtained from a survey of 452 pulmonary TB patients sampled from three rural health facilities in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. Using household direct costs and income data, we analyzed the incidence of household catastrophic <b>payments</b> using, as <b>thresholds,</b> the traditional > 10 % of household income and the &# 8805; 40 % of non-food income, as recommended by the World Health Organization.

Results 					Average direct household costs for TB were US$ 157 or 14 % of average annual incomes. The incidence catastrophic payment was 44 %; with 69 % and 15 % of the poorest and richest household income-quartiles experiencing catastrophic activity, respectively. Independent determinants of catastrophic payments were: age > 40 &# 160;years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 0, 7. 8), male gender (aOR 3. 0; CI 1. 8, 5. 2), urban residence (aOR 3. 8; CI 1. 9, 7. 7), formal education (aOR 4. 7; CI 2. 5, 8. 9), care at a private facility (aOR 2. 9; 1. 5, 5. 9), poor household (aOR 6. 7; CI 3. 7, 12), household where the patient is the primary earner (aOR 3. 8; CI 2. 2, 6. 6]), and HIV co-infection (aOR 3. 1; CI 1. 7, 5. 6). 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Current cost-lowering strategies are not enough to prevent households from incurring catastrophic out-of-pocket payments for TB care. Financial and social protection interventions are needed for identified at-risk groups, and community-level interventions may reduce inefficiencies in the care-seeking pathway. These observations should inform post- 2015 &# 160;TB strategies and influence policy-making on health services that are meant to be free of charge...|$|R
40|$|Background: The catastrophic health {{expenditure}}, {{which could}} result in impoverishment, is defined asthe health expenditure exceeds some fraction of “capacity to pay”. In order to protect households fromcatastrophic health spending, the Chinese government has implemented three basic health insuranceschemes (UEMS, URMS and NCMS) in the last decade. However, as only parts of residents’ medicalexpense are reimbursed by these health insurance schemes, the insured households might still have highchance of suffering catastrophic health expenditure. Aim & Objectives: The purpose of our study is to investigate the extent of catastrophic healthexpenditure for the households enrolled in UEMS, URMS and NCMS, and to identify factors associatedwith catastrophic health expenditure. Methods: The data came from China’s National Health Service Survey conducted in 2008 in Shaanxiprovince. In this survey, a four-stage stratified random sampling procedure was used to samplehouseholds in urban and rural areas. By using a questionnaire designed by the Health Ministry of China, 5960 households were interviewed, from which 1215 households covered by UEMS or URMS and 2875 households covered by NCMS were chosen. The indicators of incidence and intensity of catastrophicexpenditure were employed to measure catastrophic health expenditure with different thresholds levels(10, 15, 25 and 40 %), and two logistic regression models were used to estimate the factors of theprobability of catastrophic expenditure for the households enrolled in urban and rural health insuranceschemes. Results: There were 16. 87 to 68. 07 % households covered by UEMS or URMS that suffered catastrophichealth expenditure and the average degree by which <b>payment</b> exceeds the <b>thresholds</b> varied from 2. 68 to 13. 36 %. For the households covered by NCMS, the incidence and intensity of catastrophic expenditurewere 19. 62 to 75. 86 % and 3. 12 to 15. 51 % respectively. Poor health, families comprised of seniors, smallfamily size and low economic status were significantly led to catastrophic health expenditure forhouseholds enrolled in both of urban and rural health insurance schemes. Study Limitations: As indirect costs {{of health care and}} the patients’ earnings losses were not included inthe health expenditure, the catastrophic health expenditure might be under-estimated in this study. Conclusion: In order to reduce catastrophic expenditure, we recommend the Chinese government toexpand the health insurance schemes for covering outpatient service as well as improve thereimbursement rates, meanwhile, strengthen illness prevention and subsidize low-income households...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} direct {{payments}} in the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is being criticised {{with respect to}} the level, unequal distribution and allocation effects on production. Besides the decoupling of direct payments a modulation and a partial transmission to the second pillar of CAP are proposed. Modulation on a voluntary basis was already introduced in Agenda 2000. In its Mid-term Review of the Agenda the Commission proposes an obligatory dynamic modulation scheme including the capping of direct <b>payments</b> beyond a <b>threshold</b> of 300 000 â‚¬. Possible impacts of the Commission's proposal are assessed with simulations based on farm accounting data of EU-FADN. Distribution effects between farm sizes and member states are unveiled. Alternate options with regard to capping and progressive reductions of direct payments are analysed. Due to the different distribution of direct payments, farms of EU Member states will be affected differently by the proposal of the Commission: The franchise of 5 000 â‚¬ will exempt from modulation about tw -thirds of farms being represented by FADN respectively 15 % of the premium volume. About 80 % of the volume are subject to proportional reductions and 5 % fall off due to capping. More than four fifths of the capping affects Eastern Germany alone. The capping measurement leads to large distributional effects between farm sizes and between member states: In the first step of the dynamic modulation, premia beyond the franchise are reduced by 3 % while they are totally taken away beyond the capping <b>threshold.</b> Direct <b>payments</b> to large farms in Eastern Germany would be reduced by more than half. Due to drastic income shortfalls farm adaptations by splitting-up the farm enterprises or reducing the number of hired workers would be induced. An alternate scheme of modulation based on a progressive reduction of direct payments has been proposed. Elements of this system are a franchise, dynamic progressive reductions of direct payments within a progressive zone and proportional premia reductions beyond the upper limit of the progressive zone. There is no capping and with regard to administration purposes no other factors than the level of direct payments are included. With the determination of a few parameters â€” the franchise, the progression zone and the minimum and maximum rates of reduction â€” the system can be handled flexibly in view of social and budgetary objectives. Compared to the Commission's proposal farms entitled to less than 100 000 â‚¬ of direct payments would forfeit less money under the progressive reductions system. Farms entitled to 100 000 to 300 000 â‚¬ of direct payments would lose moderately more. Among the large farms however, premia reductions would be distributed more evenly and never exceed the maximum rate of e. g. 35 % while by the capping as proposed by the Commission affected farms could lose much more with the average loss increasing from 35 to 42 % of original entitlements. midterm-review, modulation, farm accounting data network, direct payments, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Peter McDonald {{outlines}} a {{new program}} of government assistance THE Prime Minister has stated that providing a better balance of work and family life is {{a high priority for}} this term of office. Famously, he has described the issue as a ‘barbecue stopper’, but, so far, no reforms have emerged. There is widespread recognition of an urgent need for reform, but what are the main problems? First, as measured by the level of financial support from government, the social value of children, particularly the majority of children who live in middle-income families, has been whittled away over the past 25 years. In Australia, Robert Menzies established the principle that government should recognise that parents who are raising the society’s next generation should receive financial recognition for the additional costs this entails. But since 1976, compared with average wages, the values of standard child payments have been eroded, payments have been increasingly tested against income leading to sharp reductions as family income rises above (a very low) $ 30, 000 a year, and the additional costs for middle-income families with children were inadequately recognised when the GST was introduced (compensation was 90 cents a child a week). Second, the parent at home with a child wanting to return to paid work is faced with such large losses of government payments and such large costs of working that the transition is often not worthwhile. For example, a woman whose husband earns $ 600 a week who wants to return to work herself for $ 300 a week would effectively make just $ 1. 88 an hour. This is because existing payments are contingent upon workforce participation and income, arrangements that grossly impede choice. The existing family support system is a $ 17 billion mish-mash of new and amended policies bolted together over five decades. It has become an illogical, inefficient, complex jumble of conflicting principles. Here, the solution is obvious. Payments should be determined by the age of the child, not by the work circumstances of the parents or by their income (except at the extremes). Third, there is now substantial recognition {{of the importance of the}} early years in child development. However, unfairly, geographic and financial access to early childhood education varies across Australia. This is due largely to the inefficient, dual system of early childhood education and care consisting of child care on one side and preschools on the other side. Reform in this area must deal with difficult federal-state relationships, the shoal upon which much good social policy in Australia founders. Cost-shifting games played by state and federal governments in this area of policy are a gross indignity to Australian children. Fourth, the reforms that have already been made in relation to work-place arrangements for parents with children need to be enhanced. This applies in particular to leave arrangements (including paid maternity leave) and access to part-time work. What needs to be done? Applying a cost-neutral restructuring of existing payments, we could have: 1. A new universal cash payment for all children aged 0 - 2 of $ 6500 a year. Part of the payment at age 0 would be contingent upon the mother remaining out of the labour force for three months after the birth (to fulfil the health criterion of maternity leave) and part of the payment at age 1 would be the Child Immunisation Allowance. 2. A non-contingent cash payment of $ 2500 a year for all children aged 3 and 4, plus allocation by the Commonwealth of $ 4000 a child aged 3 - 4 to a new, early childhood education and care scheme. States and territories would contribute matching funds. All 3 and 4 -year-olds would have a right of free access for 20 hours a week to early childhood education provided by this scheme. The new system would also deliver child care to 3 to 4 -year-olds beyond the free hours and to children of other ages upon payment by parents. 3. The payments described would be available equally to all families with children up to a threshold of about $ 100, 000. Low-income families (incomes under about $ 30, 000) would receive higher payments, as at present. 4. To prevent future erosion, all <b>payments</b> and <b>thresholds</b> in the family payments system would be indexed to changes in wages rather than to changes in prices. 5. Development of an enhanced, universally accessible, out-of-school-hours care program for primary school children funded jointly by the Commonwealth and the states and territories. 6. Negotiation of a right to part-time work in their own job (80 per cent) for all parents of children of primary school age or lower, including both fathers and mothers. 7. Extension of the existing unpaid leave entitlement of each parent after the birth of a child to 18 months. 8. Extension of incentives for employers to provide family-friendly workplaces and additional parental leave entitlements, especially wage-related paid maternity leave. 9. Provision of incentives that in all areas of life promote a child-friendly society. Professor Peter McDonald is head of the demography and sociology program at the Australian National University.
