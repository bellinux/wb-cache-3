40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} the {{anesthesia}} and liver biopsy techniques used in adult and nestling <b>pigeon</b> <b>guillemots</b> (Cepphus columba) to test for continued exposure to residual crude oil in the marine environment. Populations of <b>pigeon</b> <b>guillemots</b> have declined significantly in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA, possibly because of residual effects of crude oil in the environment after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March 1989. Measurement of hepatic cytochrome P 450 1 A (CYP 1 A) is currently {{the best way to}} assess crude oil exposure from food sources; however, lethal sampling to obtain adequate liver tissue was not desirable in this declining population of birds. As part of a larger study to identify factors limiting the recovery of <b>pigeon</b> <b>guillemots</b> and other seabird populations, we surgically collected liver samples from adult and nestling guillemots to provide samples for measurement of hepatic CYP 1 A concentrations. Results from the larger study were reported elsewhere. Liver samples were taken from 26 nestling (1998) and 24 adult (1999) guillemots from a previously oiled site (Naked Island; 12 chicks, 13 adults) and from a nonoiled site (Jackpot Island/Icy Bay; 14 chicks, 11 adults). The birds were anesthetized with isoflurane. No surgical complications occurred with any of the birds and all adult and nestling birds survived after surgery to the point of release or return to the nest. Thirteen out of 14 chicks from the Jackpot Island/Icy Bay and 8 out of 12 chicks from Naked Island fledged. Four chick...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Pigeon</b> <b>guillemots</b> form {{long-term}} pair bonds, {{the pairs}} usually reuniting each year, although occasionally pairs divorce. The {{formation of the}} pair bond is poorly understood. It is thought that form of play known as [...] "water games", which involves chasing of birds on and under the water at sea, and duet-trilling may have a function in maintaining the pair bond or act {{as a prelude to}} copulation. The red colour of the mouth may also be a sexual signal.|$|R
50|$|This species {{feeds on}} small fish and marine invertebrates, mostly near the sea floor, that it catches by pursuit diving. <b>Pigeon</b> <b>guillemots</b> are monogamous breeders, nesting in small colonies {{close to the}} shore. They defend small territories around a nesting cavity, in which they lay one or two eggs. Both parents {{incubate}} the eggs and feed the chicks. After leaving the nest the young bird is completely independent of its parents. Several birds and other animals prey on the eggs and chicks.|$|R
50|$|The {{spotted ratfish}} swims slowly above the {{seafloor}} {{in search of}} food. Location of food is done by smell. Their usual hunting period is at nighttime, when they move to shallow water to feed. Spotted ratfish are particularly drawn to crunchy foods like crabs and clams. Besides crabs and clams, the spotted ratfish also feeds on shrimp, worms, small fish, small crustaceans, and sea stars. Species known to prey on the spotted ratfish include soupfin sharks, dogfish sharks, Pacific halibut, pinnipeds and <b>pigeon</b> <b>guillemots.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>pigeon</b> <b>{{guillemot}}</b> is one {{of three}} species of auk in the genus Cepphus, the other two being the black guillemot of the Atlantic Ocean and the spectacled guillemot from the Eastern Pacific. It was described in 1811 by Peter Simon Pallas in the second volume of his Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica. A 1996 study looking at the mitochondrial DNA of the auk family found that the genus Cepphus is most closely related to the murrelets from the genus Synthliboramphus. [...] An alternative arrangement, proposed in 2001 using genetic and morphological comparisons, found them as a sister clade to the murres, razorbill, little auk and great auk. Within the genus, the <b>pigeon</b> <b>guillemot</b> and spectacled guillemot are sister species, and the black guillemot is basal within the genus. The <b>pigeon</b> <b>guillemot</b> and the black guillemot form a superspecies.|$|E

50|$|Pacific sandfish {{are mostly}} shrimp eaters, feeding by waiting for small fish, shrimp or krill {{to come into}} range and then sucking the prey up with its unusually large upturned mouth. The sandfish's teeth are needle-sharp for {{grasping}} prey. Most shrimp eaten are between 1 and 3 inches long. The sandfish waits for prey by burying itself in sand or mud and using is upturned eyes to watch passing prey. Sandfish themselves are preyed upon by Pacific cod and Pacific halibut. Seabirds such as <b>pigeon</b> <b>guillemots,</b> gulls, and puffins will also prey on sandfishes.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 During 1969 - 1971 I studied {{patterns}} of resource allocation and behavioral interaction among Brandt's Cormorants, Pelagic Cormorants, Common Murres and <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Guillemots</b> {{in the area}} of a breeding colony on Yaquina Head on the central Oregon coast. Extensive studies of the breeding colony were combined with detailed observations of the distribution, abundance and behavior of these birds at sea. The nesting areas differed considerably among the four species. Brandt's Cormorants and Common Murres were the most similar, both nesting in colonies on flat or gently sloping, unvegetated surfaces of the same offshore rock. In contrast, Pelagic Cormorants nested on the face of precipitous cliffs on the mainland and offshore rocks, singly or in loose aggregations; <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Guillemots</b> also nested singly or in loose aggregations in nooks, crevices and sometimes burrows on mainland and offshore cliffs. Breeding phenologies overlapped almost completely, with egg laying beginning in late May and the first young fledging in mid-July. Murres initiated egg laying as early as May 6 and had an abbreviated nestling period. At an age of 2 - 3 weeks, chicks left the breeding rock, and were accompanied at sea by the adult male. Dispersal from the breeding colony was primarily longshore rather than offshore. The energetic and competitive advantages of this type of parental care pattern in murres and other alcids are discussed. I suggest that precociality has evolved in some alcids {{as the result of a}} gain in subaqueous flight capabilities at the expense of aerial flight. The greater underwater maneuverability permits those species with precocial young to exploit highly mobile midwater fish populations at great distances from the breeding colony. However, their decreased ability to ferry food from the offshore feeding areas to the breeding colony has resulted in selection for early abandonment of the colony by adult and chick. The four species differed in the average length and range of dive times. The ratio of dive time/rest time, however, was very similar when all dive times or a specific dive time were considered. Pelagic Cormorants had the lowest average dive time, while Brandt's Cormorants, <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Guillemots</b> and Common Murres took increasingly longer dives. The same ranking of species was observed for offshore distribution, with Pelagic Cormorants foraging closest to the beach and Brandt's Cormorants slightly further offshore, followed by <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Guillemots</b> with Common Murres being the most pelagic in their foraging distribution. <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Guillemots</b> fed exclusively on bottom-dwelling species while Common Murres took primarily midwater fish. The cormorants fed upon prey occurring in both areas. In addition, both species of cormorants and the murres as well as Western Gulls fed together in mixed-species feeding flocks. These flocks foraged primarily upon schooling fish of the families Engraulidae and Osmeridae, which represent a patchily distributed but locally abundant food source. The three diving species which participate in mixed species flocks thus differed in their offshore distribution and took slightly different prey items, although overlapping extensively in their utilization of the more abundant species, such as anchovies and juvenile rockfish. This zonation results in less predation pressure per unit area on the less common and more predictably distributed prey species, but allows the entire offshore area to be searched effectively for abundant but patchily distributed fish schools. The behavioral interactions between members of the mixed species flocks allow rapid communication of prey school locations and permit each species to maintain contact with the school for a much longer time. The temporal and spatial overlap in the occurrence of breeding activities may contribute to a more effective coverage of the area surrounding the colony during the time of year at which food supplies are abundant...|$|R
