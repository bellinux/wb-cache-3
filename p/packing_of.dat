5|$|Crystals, though long {{admired for}} their {{regularity}} and symmetry, were not investigated scientifically until the 17th century. Johannes Kepler hypothesized {{in his work}} Strena seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow) (1611) that the hexagonal symmetry of snowflake crystals was due to a regular <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> spherical water particles.|$|E
5|$|Differences in {{wettability}} between surfaces {{that are}} similar in structure are {{due to differences in}} the <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> the atoms. For instance, if a surface has branched chains, it will have poorer packing than a surface with straight chains.|$|E
5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> the nasal cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of the fragile vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E

5|$|Due to its short {{lifespan}} after harvest, lettuce {{was originally}} sold relatively {{close to where}} it was grown. The early 20th century saw the development of new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of lettuce and resulted in a significant increase in availability. During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.|$|E
5|$|The {{system is}} among the most compact known; the orbits of planets b - f would easily fit inside the orbit of Mercury, with g only {{slightly}} outside it. Despite this close <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> the orbits, dynamical integrations indicate the system {{has the potential to be}} stable on a time scale of billions of years.|$|E
5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E
5000|$|The Camel pack is {{featured}} prominently in Tom Robbins' 1980 novel Still Life with Woodpecker, billed as [...] "a love story that happens inside a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> cigarettes". The book's artwork is modeled after a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> Camels, and the package artwork and history are discussed {{extensively in the}} book. It is also mentioned that a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> Camels is the best friend you have in prison.|$|R

5|$|The U.S. was {{expanding}} westwards and, in Ohio, Hiram Joy {{began to}} exploit Crystal Lake, near Chicago, which was soon {{linked to the}} city by the Chicago, St Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad company. The ice was used to allow goods {{to be brought to}} market. Cincinnati and Chicago began to use ice to help the <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> pork in the summer, John L. Schooley developing the first refrigerated packing room. Fruit began to be stored in the central Illinois using refrigerators, for consumption in later seasons. By the 1860s, ice was being used to allow the brewing of the increasingly popular lager beer all year round. Improved railroad links helped the growth in business across the region and to the east.|$|E
25|$|For equal spheres {{in three}} {{dimensions}} the densest packing uses approximately 74% of the volume. A random <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> equal spheres generally has a density around 64%.|$|E
25|$|Dodecahedral conjecture: The {{volume of}} the Voronoi {{polyhedron}} of a sphere in a <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> equal spheres is at least the volume of a regular dodecahedron with inradius 1. , for which he received the 1999 Morgan Prize.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "trencher-fed pack" [...] is a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> foxhounds or {{harriers}} {{in which}} the hounds are kept individually by hunt members and only assembled as a pack to hunt. Usually, a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> hounds are maintained together as a pack in kennels.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th Century there were many more <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> {{harriers}} in the UK than beagles. The proportions are now exactly reversed, largely because many <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> harriers have changed to hunting foxes over the last 80 years or so. In the south west <b>of</b> England some <b>packs</b> still hunt with West Country Harriers although they hunted foxes rather than hares prior to the ban, while many current <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> foxhounds started off as hare hunting harrier packs.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> Ace Trumps {{is based}} on a theme, such as cars, aircraft, animals or boats. Unlike the modern Top Trumps, Ace Trumps didn't release any packs {{requiring}} a license, such as TV and Film shows. One exception though is a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> Muppet Show Quartets.|$|R
25|$|An {{application}} of Euclidean solid geometry is {{the determination of}} packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> spheres in n dimensions. This problem has applications in error detection and correction.|$|E
25|$|To form an A-B-A-B-... {{hexagonal}} close <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> spheres, the coordinate {{points of}} the lattice will be the spheres' centers. Suppose, {{the goal is to}} fill a box with spheres according to hcp. The box would be placed on the x-y-z coordinate space.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the unit balls inscribed in the 24-cells of the above tessellation give rise to the densest lattice <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> hyperspheres in 4 dimensions. The vertex configuration of the 24-cell has also been shown to give the highest possible kissing number in 4 dimensions.|$|E
50|$|The Center {{is home to}} a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> Rocky Mountain gray {{wolves and}} several <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> Mexican gray wolves, some of whom may be reintroduced into the southwestern United States. These wolves {{experience}} very limited human contact to avoid habituation and to preserve their wild behaviors.|$|R

25|$|In 1852, Frederick joined John Plankinton {{to form a}} {{partnership}} for the <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> pork and beef {{under the name of}} Layton & Plankinton. With a loan of $3,000 from Samuel Marshall and Charles Ilsley of Marshall and Ilsley Bank, the two built a slaughter and packinghouse in the Menominee Valley of Milwaukee.|$|E
25|$|William Edge, another {{reviewer}} of Regular Figures, cites Fejes TÃ³th's earlier work, Lagerungen in der Ebene, auf der Kugel und im Raum, as {{the foundation}} of his second chapter in Regular Figures. He emphasized that, {{at the time of this}} work, the problem of the upper bound for the density of a <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> equal spheres was still unsolved.|$|E
25|$|Counterfeit pu'er is common. The {{practices}} including {{claiming the}} tea {{is older than}} it actually is, misidentifying {{the origin of the}} leaf as Yunnan instead of a non-Yunnan region, labeling terrace tea as forest tea, selling green tea instead or raw pu'er. The interpretation of the <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> pu'er is usually dependent on the consumer's knowledge and negotiation between the consumer and trader.|$|E

50|$|The {{game will}} {{periodically}} award the player <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> cards. The <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> cards typically include {{small amounts of}} mutagen, pizza points, T-coins and DNA cards (usually one to three, but on rare occasions more). Free card packs are distributed at set times throughout each day (with a timer indicating when the next free pack will be available), while other card packs can be purchased in the shop. Certain specially-marked action figures from Playmates Toys include codes that, when entered in the game's shop, will award the player with a card <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> random items.|$|R

25|$|Oil {{may account}} for 75% {{or more of the}} total volume. This means that the oil {{droplets}} become distorted from their normal, spherical shape. The close <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> the droplets also allow them to interact very strongly with one another. A combination of these factors gives traditional mayonnaise its high viscosity. The viscoelasticity of mayonnaise made with egg yolk reaches a maximum very quickly after preparation.|$|E
25|$|Despite this difficulty, K. BÃ¶rÃ¶czky gives a {{universal}} upper {{bound for the}} density of sphere packings of hyperbolic n-space where nâ¥2. In three dimensions the BÃ¶rÃ¶czky bound is approximately 85.327613%, and is realized by the horosphere <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> the order-6 tetrahedral honeycomb with SchlÃ¤fli symbol {3,3,6}. In addition to this configuration {{at least three other}} horosphere packings are known to exist in hyperbolic 3-space that realize the density upper bound.|$|E
25|$|If {{we attempt}} to build a densely packed {{collection}} of spheres, we will be tempted to always place the next sphere in a hollow between three packed spheres. If five spheres are assembled in this way, they will be consistent {{with one of the}} regularly packed arrangements described above. However, the sixth sphere placed in this way will render the structure inconsistent with any regular arrangement. This results in the possibility of a random close <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> spheres which is stable against compression.|$|E
