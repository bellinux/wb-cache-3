40|$|Methods of {{selection}} {{of candidates for}} training in surgery has long been regarded as lacking explicit criteria and objectivity. Our purpose was to discover the aptitudes and personality types of applicants for <b>surgical</b> <b>posts</b> at the outset, in order to discover which {{were most likely to}} result in a satisfactory progression through training and which were associated with career difficulties. This longitudinal predictive validation study has been undertaken in a London Teaching Hospital since 1994. After short-listing, but immediately before interview, all candidates for senior house officer <b>posts</b> in basic <b>surgical</b> <b>training</b> and in geriatric medicine were asked to undertake psychometric tests of numerical (GMA) and spatial (SIT 7) reasoning, personality type (MBTI), and self-rating of competency. There were no differences in ability scores between surgeons or geriatricians. Personality differences were revealed between the surgeons and the geriatricians, and between male and female surgeons. This study suggests that while there are no differences in ability between surgeons and geriatricians at the start of training, there are differences in personality. Long-term follow-up of the career development of this cohort of surgical SHOs is required to determine whether the psychometric measures described correlate with achievements of milestones in their surgical careers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Neoadjuvant cancer {{treatment}} decreases physical fitness. Low levels {{of physical fitness}} are associated with poor <b>surgical</b> outcome. <b>Exercise</b> <b>training</b> can stimulate skeletal muscle adaptations, such as increased mitochondrial content and improved oxygen uptake capacity that may contribute to improving physical fitness. This systematic review evaluates the {{evidence in support of}} <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> in people with cancer undergoing the “dual hit” of neoadjuvant {{cancer treatment}} and surgery. Methods: We conducted a systematic database search of Embase Ovid, Ovid Medline without Revisions, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Library and ClinicalTrials. gov to identify trials addressing the effect of <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> in people scheduled for neoadjuvant cancer treatment and surgery. Data extraction and analysis were based on a pre-defined plan. Results: The database search yielded 6489 candidate abstracts. Ninety-four references included the required terms. Four studies were eligible for inclusion (breast cancer, locally advanced rectal cancer). All studies reported that <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> was safe and feasible and that adherence rates were acceptable (66 – 96 %). In-hospital <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> improves physical fitness however the impact on HRQoL and other clinical important outcomes was uncertain. Conclusion: This is the first systematic review of the effects of <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> in people scheduled for “dual-hit” treatment. This evidence synthesis indicates that this approach is safe and feasible but that there are insufficient controlled trials in this area to draw reliable conclusions about the efficacy of such an intervention, the optimal characteristics of the intervention, or the impact on clinical or patient reported outcomes...|$|R

Methods: The study design was open label studies total of 100 <b>post</b> <b>surgical</b> mitral valve disease individuals patients from the age group of 20 - 60 years were recruited from SVIMS hospital.

40|$|Quality {{assessment}} in healthcare {{is an essential}} part of governance culture. Clinical outcomes and research output are routinely assessed with national and global comparisons commonplace in a bid to continually drive up standards. While the subject of <b>surgical</b> <b>training</b> has received greater exposure in recent years, there remains no rigorous assessment of <b>surgical</b> <b>training</b> quality in the same way as clinical and research outcomes. To improve <b>surgical</b> <b>training</b> quality, high quality training must first be defined to permit evaluation of training and facilitate identification of methods to raise standards. Variability of global <b>surgical</b> <b>training</b> programs is first identified by comparing the national surgical curricula of a sample of countries against defined standards for curricula. A questionnaire study further explores the variations between the two nations with the most contrasting surgical curricula. Qualitative methodologies, including semi-structured interviews and a global Delphi consensus study, are subsequently employed to define high quality <b>surgical</b> <b>training.</b> The results have enabled the development of a <b>surgical</b> <b>training</b> quality assessment tool (S-QAT). The S-QAT has been piloted in the North West London training region where variability in <b>surgical</b> <b>training</b> quality has been confirmed. Defining high quality training has facilitated the development and piloting of interventions to improve <b>surgical</b> <b>training</b> quality. The first intervention employs video-based coaching to improve surgical skills. The second intervention is an intensive, immersive week of simulation training to ease the transition from medical student to Foundation Doctor. These interventions demonstrate that improvements in training quality can be made without the need to rely on increasing the quantity or time in training. The foundations for robust evaluation of <b>surgical</b> <b>training</b> quality have been constructed. Evidence-based medicine is the gold standard for patients; evidence-based training of surgeons will ensure standards are maintained for the next generation of patients.  Open Acces...|$|R
