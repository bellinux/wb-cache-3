The unit consists of four two-degrees-of-freedom (TDOF) tuned-rotor gyros, and four TDOF <b>pendulous</b> <b>accelerometers</b> in a skewed and separable semi-octahedron array.

40|$|An {{adaptive}} {{load relief}} control {{system for a}} SATURN type vehicle which significantly reduces aerodynamically induced structural loads without incurring excessive velocity dispersions has been studied. This control system utilizes <b>pendulous</b> <b>accelerometers</b> to measure the angle between the total vehicle acceleration vector and the vehicle body. This measurement is used to fly the vehicle along the nominal trajectory to minimize velocity dispersions. However, if unusually high values of wind velocity are encountered, the system will cause the vehicle to turn into the wind to reduce the lateral structural loads. Results of an anal 6 g computer study show that the adaptive system can reduce aerodynam 3 cally induced peak structural loads as much as 50 percent under those encountered using conventional control techniques. relief is used only when required, velocity dispersions are held to a minimum...|$|R
40|$|Several {{generations of}} micromechanical gyros and accelerometers have been {{developed}} at Draper. Current design effort centers on tuning-fork gyro design and <b>pendulous</b> <b>accelerometer</b> configurations. Over 200 gyros of different generations have been packaged and tested. These units have successfully performed across a temperature range of - 40 to 85 degrees C, and have survived 30, 000 -g shock tests along all axes. Draper is currently under contract to develop an integrated micro-mechanical inertial sensor assembly (MMISA) and global positioning system (GPS) receiver configuration. The ultimate projections for size, weight, and power for an MMISA, after electronic design of the {{application specific integrated circuit}} (ASIC) is completed, are 2 x 2 x 0. 5 cm, 5 gm, and less than 1 W, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new type}} of strapdown north finder. A simplified configuration is proposed, including three parts: a <b>pendulous</b> force-feedback <b>accelerometer,</b> a ring laser gyroscope, and a single-axis rotating platform. The dynamic northfinding scheme of continuous rotation is adopted to eliminate the lock-in region of the laser gyroscope and to modulate the weak attitude signals; meanwhile the complex leveling process is avoided in this proposed configuration. To suppress the drift noises of the accelerometer and gyroscope, two digital lock-in amplifiers are used to extract the weak attitude signals. Simulation results show that the north finder can determine the heading angle in 72 [*]s, when the rotating rate is /s with the maximum heading error less than 1. 0 ′; meanwhile the horizontal attitude angles as well as the constant drift noises of the inertial components could also be obtained...|$|R
50|$|A PIGA (<b>Pendulous</b> Integrating Gyroscopic <b>Accelerometer)</b> {{is a type}} of {{accelerometer}} {{that can}} measure acceleration and simultaneously integrates this acceleration against time to produce a speed measure as well. The PIGA's main use is in Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for guidance of aircraft and most particularly for ballistic missile guidance. It is valued for its extremely high sensitivity and accuracy in conjunction with operation over a wide acceleration range. The PIGA is still considered the premier instrument for strategic grade missile guidance, though systems based on MEMS technology are attractive for lower performance requirements.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{studying}} Multidisciplinary Object Compatibility Design Optimization {{method for}} non-hierarchic system, Simulated Annealing algorithm is introduced {{to establish system}} level model, and the basic ideas and working principle is given. In the optimization of system level, the coupling relationship between different subsystems is improved by state accepting function which is embedded in constraint. In this way, abnormal program termination and premature convergence will be avoided and ideal global optimal solution will be achieved effectually. Then the method is proved by used in the optimization design of <b>pendulous</b> micromechanical <b>accelerometer.</b> Intorduction Multidisciplinary Design Optimization(MDO) [1 - 4] is an effective design optimization strategy {{for the design of}} complex systems where the interaction between several disciplines must be considered, and the aim of which is to more effectively solve complex systems and get global optimum by integrates the concepts of concurrent engineering. A multidisciplinary complex system can be decomposed to several subsystems belong to different disciplines. If the flow of information starts at system level and goes to subsystems which have no coupling relationships between each others, we call it hierarchic system; if these subsystems coupled each others and at the same level, w...|$|R
40|$|The {{intercontinental}} {{ballistic missiles}} (ICBM) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) {{developed over the}} past 50 years have employed successive generations of increasingly accurate inertial guidance systems. The comparatively short time of guided flight and high acceleration levels characteristic of the ballistic missile application place a premium on accelerometer performance to achieve desired weapon system accuracy. To date, the accelerometer design of choice for strategic missiles has been the <b>Pendulous</b> Integrating Gyroscopic <b>Accelerometer</b> (PIGA) instrument, an accelerometer whose origins trace back to the German V 2 rocket, and has been refined through several generations of development to achieve unsurpassed performance. The specialized technologies of PIGA accelerometers, such as gas bearing wheels, ultra-stable ball bearings, precision electromagnetic components, and "designer chemical " flotation fluids require a costly support infrastructure for production and system life-cycle maintenance.
