40|$|The {{theme of}} this work is the {{examining}} {{of one of the}} key genetic principles in domestication traits in pea pod dehiscence. First, this work was preceded by the employment of the method called MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends). The method analyzed the mRNA which was isolated from pod sutures. The two parental lines were used JI 64 (<b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> ssp. elatius <b>L.)</b> wild field pea with dehiscent pods, JI 92 (<b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> ssp. <b>sativum</b> <b>L.)</b> landrace with indehiscent pods and RILs (Recombinant inbred lines) of reciprocal hybridization of both. As a result of the MACE analysis ten million reads were generated and seven thousand genes were identified only seventy seven genes differed with statistical significance in the samples with dehiscent and indehiscent pods. For the purpose of this work only three of them were used. Expression of these three candidate genes were assigned using Real-Time qRT-PCR for pod dehiscence. Base on qRT-PCR process the Ct values were calculated. The result of this work is the graphical view of expression volume of these candidate genes for both field pea lines during pod maturation...|$|R

40|$|Phosphoenolpyruvate {{carboxylase}} (EC 4. 1. 1. 31; PEPC) {{is one of}} {{the carbon}} dioxide- fixing enzymes, which yields oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate and bicarbonate. Regulation of PEPC activity occurs at many levels. In addition to pH and concentration of activators and inhibitors, it is phosphorylation as well. Phosphorylation of PEPC causes a change of kinetic parameters, such as maximal reaction rate, sensitivity to activation or inhibition. Considering that, there is still little information like this about C 3 plants and that regulation is in various plant species different, I have dealt with monitoring of the kinetic parameters and regulation possibilities of PEPC isolated from C 3 plant sources (Cannabis sativa L., Chenopodium quinoa, <b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> <b>L.,</b> Lens culinaris). While the activity of PEPC from leaves of Cannabis sativa L. was decreased by alkaline phosphatase, the activity of PEPC from seeds of Chenopodium quinoa, <b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> <b>L.,</b> Lens culinaris was not affected by alkaline phosphatase. The affinity of PEPC from seeds Chenopodium quinoa, <b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> <b>L.,</b> Lens culinaris to the substrate PEP was higher than in the case of PEPC from leaves of Cannabis sativa L [...] For PEPC from Cannabis sativa L. was found that the apparent dephosphorylation leads to decrease of sensitivity to the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of sous vide packaging on the shelf life of maple pea (<b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> var. arvense <b>L.)</b> spread. Pea spreads were made of ground re-hydrated cooked maple peas ‘Bruno’ (<b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> var. arvense <b>L.),</b> to which salt, citric acid, oil, and spices were added. Pea spread was stored in polyamide/polyethylene (PA/PE) film pouches, packaged in vacuum and hermetically sealed. Pea spread pouches were heat treated in a water bath, then rapidly cooled in ice-water and stored at 4. 0 ± 0. 5 °C. Sous vide was applied in three different heat regimens +(65. 0; 80. 0 and 100. 0) ± 0. 5 °C with cooking times 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min at a constant temperature. Total plate count was determined according to ISO 4833 - 1 : 2014 on Plate Count Agar and Enterobacteriaceae determination was performed in accordance with ISO 21528 - 2 : 2004 on Violet Red Bile Glucose Agar. Total plate count in pea spread without thermal treatment was 3. 41 log 10 CFU g− 1, in all sous vide packaged pea spread samples microbial contamination was significantly lower (p < 0. 05).
