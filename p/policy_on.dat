40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{theoretical}} and methodological aspects {{account for the}} ambiguous results of investigations into the effects of family <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> fertility. Theoretically we employ approaches of comparative welfare-state research, of the sociology of “constructed categories”, and of the “new institutionalism” to demonstrate that investigations into the effects of <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> fertility need to contextualize policies and reduce their complexities by focusing on “critical junctures”, “space”, and “usage”. As regards methods we argue that the policy effects can only be assessed properly if we study the impact of <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> individual behavior, event-history models applied to individual-level data being the state-of-theart of such an approach. We present studies {{on the impact of}} family <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> Swedish childbearing behavior to demonstrate that an analytical and methodological approach as we advocate prevents us from drawing misleading conclusions about the effects of family <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> childbearing and fertility.

40|$|The {{relative}} effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies is an on-going debate among macroeconomists. Our {{study is the}} first to examine the effect of monetary and fiscal <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> confidence. We provide a theoretical framework which highlights the role of confidence in business cycles as well as the effect of monetary and fiscal <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> confidence. Moreover, we discuss how monetary and fiscal policies restore confidence, which helps to lead to economic recovery from recessions/slowdowns. Furthermore, we test the effect of monetary and fiscal <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> confidence {{as well as on the}} real GDP. </p...|$|R

5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} the cause of the explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{government}} service, Matlock has occasionally {{joined with}} other experts to criticize U.S. government <b>policy.</b> <b>On</b> June 26, 1997, he signed an Open Letter to Bill Clinton criticizing plans for NATO expansion. His reason for opposition, as given {{in his testimony}} before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, {{is the belief that}} NATO expansion will preclude significant nuclear arms reduction with Russia, and consequently increase the risk of a terrorist nuclear attack.|$|E
5|$|After the War of the Oranges, Portugal {{adopted a}} double <b>policy.</b> <b>On</b> {{the one hand}} John, Prince of Brazil, as regent of Portugal, signed the Treaty of Badajoz with France and Spain by which he assumed the duty to close the ports to British trade. On the other hand, not wanting to breach the Treaty of Windsor (1386) with Portugal's oldest ally, Britain, he allowed for such trade to {{continue}} and maintained secret diplomatic relations with them. However, after the Franco-Spanish defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar, John grew bold and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E

5|$|Although the DPP {{passed a}} {{resolution}} to ban all factions within the party in 2006, the dissent between former members of different factions was still present and {{was thought to be}} one of the factors that led to DPP's loss in the presidential election.

5|$|Another {{question}} of contention was the Progress Party's <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> Norwegian {{membership in the}} European Union. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone a decision on European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June. Others were {{not in favor of}} this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other. He stated an indifference towards EU membership, and that if accessing the Union, Norway could always use a veto against EU policies when needed. Central board member Terje Sæbø submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership.|$|E

The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> the senator; no insurance on his wife or children.

Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Benítez's squad rotation <b>policy.</b> <b>On</b> 25 October 2006 Fowler was named as Liverpool's captain {{for the first time since}} his return in a League Cup tie against Reading, scoring just before half-time in a 4–3 win.|$|E
