5|$|The {{commander}} of the <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> force in the Southwest Pacific, Commander Morton C. Mumma, opposed building extensive <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> facilities at Arawe as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of New Britain. Mumma took his concerns to Carpender and Barbey, who eventually agreed {{that he would not}} be required to establish a base there if he thought it unnecessary. Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at Dreger Harbor in New Guinea and Kiriwina Island to operate along the south coast of New Britain east of Arawe each night, and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at Arawe.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{activities}} {{were taken in}} hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a runway, {{and some of the}} buildings at the <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern end of the island.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} obtain {{information}} for Operation Dexterity, the attack on New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy reconnaissance team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering hydrographic data rather than information {{on the state of}} the Japanese defenders. Because of a breakdown in communications, the <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> that was supposed to collect the team was unable to rendezvous with it, and the team had to spend eleven more days on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force headquarters on what had occurred.|$|E
500|$|Eleven U.S. <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> awaited Hashimoto's destroyers between Guadalcanal and Savo Island. Beginning at 22:45, Hashimoto's {{warships}} and the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> {{engaged in}} a series of running battles over the next three hours. Hashimoto's destroyers, with help from [...] "R" [...] Area aircraft, sank three of the <b>PT</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 5 March two <b>PT</b> <b>boats,</b> PT-143 and PT-150, {{discovered}} I-17 {{with three}} lifeboats full of survivors from the Bismarck Sea battle. The submarine was taking them on board. I-17 crash dived as the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> strafed and fired torpedoes at her. The <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> then sank the lifeboats with machine gun fire and depth charges. Several hours later, I-17 resurfaced {{and picked up}} 33 surviving soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} [...] "At Close Quarters: <b>PT</b> <b>Boats</b> in the United States Navy" [...] 99 of the 531 <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> that served during World War II were lost to various causes.|$|R
5|$|Coggins {{served as}} an artist for British YANK in London until August 2, 1945 and was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army on November 3, 1945. While in Britain, Coggins spent time on a Royal Navy convoy in the North Sea, witnessed the bombing of Saint-Lô, and flew over Berlin in a Lancaster bomber. He also spent time on a U.S. <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> patrolling the beaches and made a trip into Brittany with an armored column. Events from all of these sorties were illustrated in YANK magazine in double page spreads. During his time in Britain, Coggins wrote articles on war rockets and the German Navy which were also published in YANK.|$|E
5|$|Morotai was {{the scene}} of a number of {{surrender}} ceremonies following the surrender of Japan. About 660 Japanese troops on Morotai capitulated to Allied forces after 15 August. The 93rd Division also accepted the surrender of the 40,000 Japanese troops at Halmahera on 26 August after the Japanese commander there was brought to Morotai on a US Navy <b>PT</b> <b>boat.</b> On 9 September 1945, Australian General Thomas Blamey accepted the surrender of the Japanese Second Army at a ceremony held on the I Corps' sports ground at Morotai. Private Teruo Nakamura, the last confirmed Japanese holdout on Morotai or elsewhere, was captured by Indonesian Air Force personnel on 18 December 1974.|$|E
5|$|The IJN {{continued}} to suffer losses and damage to its ships {{in attempting to}} keep the Japanese on Guadalcanal resupplied. One destroyer was sunk by American warships at the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November. Another destroyer plus a submarine were sunk and two destroyers damaged by American <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> and CAF air attacks during subsequent resupply missions from 3–12 December. Compounding the navy's frustration, {{very few of the}} supplies carried on these missions actually reached Japanese army forces on the island. Combined Fleet leaders began telling their army counterparts the losses and damage to warships engaged in the resupply effort threatened future strategic plans for protecting the Japanese Empire.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese destroyers {{landed the}} 920 troops and {{supplies}} and embarked 700 Navy aviation personnel being withdrawn as Allied bombing had rendered the airfield at Buka non operational. The Japanese force {{was returning to}} Rabaul when Farrow's <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> spotted four of the Japanese ships on their radar just after midnight; however, the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> mistook the Japanese vessels for friendly forces and hove to further ashore. Two of the Japanese ships subsequently attacked the <b>PT</b> <b>boats,</b> firing on them and attempting to ram PT-318. They were unsuccessful in scoring any hits, though, while one of the <b>PT</b> <b>boats,</b> PT-64, fired a torpedo which missed its target. Afterwards, the Japanese destroyers steamed west towards Cape St. George.|$|R
50|$|On that day, Willoughby, {{in company}} with {{motor torpedo boat}} tenders USS Oyster Bay (AGP-6) (Commander Bowling's flagship) and USS Wachapreague (AGP-8), {{seaplane}} tender USS Half Moon (AVP-26), two United States Army craft, and 45 <b>PT</b> <b>boats,</b> sailed for the Palaus on {{the first leg of}} their monumental voyage of 1,200 nautical miles (2,222 kilometers). At Kossol Roads, the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> fueled from the tenders, while the tenders in turn fueled from accompanying oilers. On the second leg of the trip, the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> fueled at sea from the tenders, a difficult task but a necessary one if the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> were to arrive off Leyte with their fuel tanks full and ready to go.|$|R
5000|$|... 20 October 1967: Squadron {{aircraft}} sighted six North Vietnamese <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> near Thanh Hoa {{and engaged}} the boats. Four of the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> were sunk, one was damaged and the sixth escaped, seeking {{refuge in the}} mouth of the river near Thanh Hoa.|$|R
5|$|The <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> {{force at}} Morotai {{was reduced to}} a single {{squadron}} by February 1945 but remained active {{until the end of the}} war. As well as patrolling around Morotai, the boats operated in the eastern NEI to raid Japanese positions and support Australian and Dutch scouting parties. In May 1945 PT boats and the Australian Z Special Unit rescued the Sultan of Ternate along with his court and harem during an operation codenamed Project Opossum after he was mistreated by the Japanese. By the end of the war the PT boats had conducted nearly 1,300 patrols and destroyed 50 barges and 150 small craft off Morotai and Halmahera.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, General Douglas MacArthur {{requested}} Casey's {{services as}} his chief engineer. Casey arrived in Manila in October, {{shortly before the}} outbreak of war between the United States and Japan. He acquired construction equipment from the National Power Corporation that was being used on the Caliraya project. Casey supervised demolitions as MacArthur's troops retreated to Bataan, {{for which he was}} awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Unlike the rest of MacArthur's headquarters, Casey, who was promoted to colonel on 19 December 1941 and brigadier general on 25 January 1942, did not relocate to Corregidor but remained on Bataan with a small staff of five officers. However, he joined MacArthur and sixteen other members of his staff in their escape from Corregidor by <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> in March 1942. For his service in the 1942 campaign in the Philippines, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|On 22September 1943, MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) {{directed}} Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Alamo Force {{to secure}} western New Britain {{and the surrounding}} islands. This operation had two goals, {{the first of which}} was to establish air and <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> bases to attack the Japanese forces at Rabaul. The second objective was to secure the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits between New Guinea and New Britain so that convoys could safely pass through them en route to conduct further landings along New Guinea's north coast and beyond. To this end, GHQ directed that both Cape Gloucester and Gasmata on New Britain's south coast be captured. This offensive was code-named Operation Dexterity. The 1stMarine Division was selected for the Cape Gloucester operation, and the heavily reinforced 126thRegimental Combat Team from the 32nd Infantry Division was to attack Gasmata.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, Shafer {{entered the}} United States Navy as a naval {{intelligence}} officer and later served on <b>PT</b> <b>boats.</b> He would participate in over 80 combat missions during World War II on <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> as {{commanding officer of}} PT-359 and later as executive officer of Squadron 27. As Squadron XO, Shafer sailed aboard PT-375, {{one of the first}} <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> to penetrate the defenses of Manila Bay. Shafer earned the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart during his tour in the Pacific theater.|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of these operations, the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> sought out and {{destroyed}} Japanese shipping at Tawao, Cowie Harbor, and Noneokan, Dutch North Borneo, shelling and rocketing shore installations. As the Japanese later attempted evacuation by small boats and rafts, the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> netted some 30 prisoners-of-war. In addition to these tasks, the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> assisted tank landing ship tank (LST) retractions from the beachheads by speeding across the water astern of the landing ships and creating swells which enabled the LSTs to back off the beach and float free.|$|R
500|$|By December, the pitiful {{condition}} of Japanese prisoners confirmed for the Australians that [...] "the Japanese logistic system {{was in the}} final stages of breakdown". Between 9 and 13 December, <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> sank 23 barges, most of them south of Sio. On 7 January, the <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> also attacked a submarine. No less than twelve barges were destroyed on the night of 8 January, one of which was loaded with ammunition and another with around 70 troops. On 9 January, <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> attacked a group of six barges, which attempted to fight back. One barge was seen to sink. Another patrol engaged eight barges and destroyed two. A third patrol found six barges on a beach and destroyed them. Then on 10 January, three <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> sank three troop-carrying barges, taking one Japanese prisoner. The same night, two barges were also sunk north of Sio Island. When General Berryman saw Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, the commander of the Allied Naval Forces, on 14 December, he made a point of congratulating him on the work his <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> were doing.|$|R
5|$|Initial Allied {{goals for}} the landing at Arawe {{included}} securing a base for American PT boats and diverting Japanese forces away from Cape Gloucester. The <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> base was subsequently deemed unnecessary and was never built. Only a small Japanese force was stationed at Arawe at the time, although reinforcements were en route. The main Allied landing on 15December was successful, despite a failed subsidiary landing and problems coordinating the landing craft. American forces quickly secured a beachhead and dug in. Japanese air units made large-scale raids against the Arawe area {{in the days after}} the landing, and in late December Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) troops unsuccessfully counterattacked the American force. In mid-January 1944 the American force, reinforced with additional infantry and tanks, launched a brief offensive that pushed the Japanese back. The Japanese units at Arawe withdrew from the area towards the end of February as part of a general retreat from western New Britain.|$|E
25|$|After Harvard, Killam {{returned}} to Laredo {{to work with}} his father. In 1942, he enlisted in the United States Navy. He served first in the Atlantic and then was the commanding officer of a <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> in the Pacific. He left the Navy in 1945 with the rank of lieutenant commander.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} prior to the assault, Royal Australian Air Force Bristol Beaufort {{aircraft}} flew numerous sorties from their base on Kiriwina softening up the defenses around the landing beach. On 3 March, the landing was preceded by a small reconnaissance patrol, consisting of an Australian officer– Marshland– an American and two indigenous scouts, which was put ashore by <b>PT</b> <b>boat.</b> After determining contacting friendly local inhabitants and ascertaining the strength and dispositions of the Japanese in the vicinity, the patrol had departed the peninsula and returned to Iboki around midnight on 3 March by <b>PT</b> <b>boat.</b> The following couple of days were used for battle preparation, after which the US force set off for the overnight journey on, embarking from the 5th Marines' base at the Iboki Plantation at 13:00 on 5 March 1944 upon a fleet of 60 assorted types of landing craft escorted by five PT boats. On board one of the landing craft were four medium tanks.|$|E
25|$|A {{party of}} coastwatchers {{consisting}} of three Australians from the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB) and four natives, were landed on Long Island by a <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> on 6 October 1943. Their {{role was to}} watch for and report on aircraft coming from Madang. At {{the time of their}} arrival, there were at least two Japanese parties on the island, but in November they reported that the Japanese had left. The mission commander, Major Leonard Kaplan, flew to Finschhafen on 22 December with two amphibian scouts. At 18:00 the following day they boarded a <b>PT</b> <b>boat</b> that took them to Long Island. They landed on the island at 23:45, guided by lights set up by the AIB. Reassured that there were no Japanese on the island, Kaplan re-embarked and returned to Finschhafen, leaving the two amphibian scouts behind to reconnoitre the island, and to set up lights to guide landing craft during the landing.|$|E

They took part in fleet actions and they worked in smaller groups and singly to harry enemy supply lines. Late in the Pacific War when large targets became scarce, many <b>PT</b> <b>boats</b> replaced two or all four of their torpedo tubes with additional guns for engaging enemy coastal supply boats and barges, isolating enemy-held islands from supply, reinforcement or evacuation.|$|R
