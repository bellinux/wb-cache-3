40|$|Former Title : GSIM working papersFormer No. : IM- 2010 - 01 Despite all the {{security}} measures {{to build a}} safely networked world there are innumerable loopholes for malicious activity. One of the countermeasures to fight such malicious activities is to issue <b>security</b> <b>alerts.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is to see if there is significant impact by these security alerts; to best of our knowledge, this is the first statistical study to understand such impact of Internet <b>security</b> <b>alerts.</b> For the analysis, this paper looks at two of the most malicious <b>security</b> <b>alerts,</b> the Phishing and Spam, issued by two well-known sources. The statistical analysis concludes that for Phishing, the <b>security</b> <b>alerts</b> indeed has a significant positive impact at ccTLD 2 level. For Spam, the <b>security</b> <b>alert</b> data issued by reputed organizations is less frequent. As such, the available data is limited; and, our statistical analysis concludes that Spam is still out of control at ccTDL level. However, considering the significant positive impact on Phishing due to <b>security</b> <b>alerts,</b> it seems reasonable to suggest that the agencies issuing <b>security</b> <b>alerts</b> must be more serious and regular in publishing the rankings than at present...|$|R

40|$|The cloud {{computing}} paradigm has become really popular, and its adoption is constantly increasing. Hence, also network activities and <b>security</b> <b>alerts</b> related to cloud services are increasing {{and are likely}} to become even more relevant in the upcoming years. In this paper, we propose the first characterization of real <b>security</b> <b>alerts</b> related to cloud activities and generated by a network sensor {{at the edge of a}} large network environment over several months. Results show that the characteristics of cloud <b>security</b> <b>alerts</b> differ from those that are not related to cloud activities. Moreover, alerts related to different cloud providers exhibit peculiar and different behaviors that can be identified through temporal analyses. The methods and results proposed in this paper are useful as a basis for the design of novel algorithms for the automatic analysis of cloud <b>security</b> <b>alerts,</b> that can be aimed at forecasting, prioritization, anomaly and state-change detection...|$|R
