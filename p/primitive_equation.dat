5000|$|Molecular {{friction}} rarely upsets {{the dominant}} balances (geostrophic and hydrostatic) in the ocean. With kinematic viscosities of v=10−6m 2 s−1 [...] the Ekman number is several {{orders of magnitude}} smaller than unity; therefore, molecular frictional forces are certainly negligible for large-scale oceanic motions. Similar argument holds for the tracer equations, where the molecular thermodiffusivity and salt diffusivity lead to Reynolds number of negligible magnitude, which means the molecular diffusive time scales are much longer than advective time scale. So we can thus safely conclude that the direct effects of molecular processes are insignificant for large-scale. Yet the molecular friction is essential somewhere. The point is that large-scale motions in the ocean interacted with other scales by the nonlinearities in <b>primitive</b> <b>equation.</b> We can show that by Reynolds approach, which will leads to the closure problem. That means new variables arise at each level in the Reynolds averaging procedure. This leads to the need of parameterization scheme to account for those sub grid scale effects.|$|E

However, {{the timing of the}} cycles is imperfect: could a different model initialization improve this fundamental aspect of the phenomenon? Ensemble simulations stemming from many initial conditions should be carried out to answer this question, but doing that with a <b>primitive</b> <b>equation</b> model is highly computationally expensive. A preliminary analysis is therefore performed here with a nonlinear low-order ocean model, which identifies a significant paradigm of intrinsic oceanic double-gyre low-frequency variability.

Two parameters are then introduced to analyze the topological structure of the pullback attractors {{as a function of the}} forcing period; their joint use allows one to identify four forms of sensitivity to initialization corresponding to different system behaviors.

40|$|Two-dimensional, <b>primitive</b> <b>equation</b> model {{studies of}} wind-forced flow over a {{continental}} shelf Show that, under upwelling conditions, {{high levels of}} near-inertial wave energy {{are found in the}} interior over the shelf. The regions of elevated wave energy, with maximum wave amplitudes of around ± 0. 2 m s⁻¹, persist for up to two weeks and have spatial scales of 20 – 40 m vertically and 5 – 20 km horizontally. Relatively high dissipation levels are associated with these concentrations of wave energy. When forced with downwelling-favorable winds, model results show very little subsurface inertial energy on the shelf. A comparison of inertial wave propagation using the <b>primitive</b> <b>equation</b> model and a linearized version of the model demonstrates strong dependence on the background flow field. The behavior of inertial waves using the linearized model is completely different: very little subsurface inertial energy is seen on the shelf in either upwelling or downwelling conditions, except where the bottom slope is near the critical angle of reflection for incoming waves. In the <b>primitive</b> <b>equation</b> model, regions of elevated inertial wave energy occur where group velocities for near-inertial waves are reduced due to variations in the horizontal and vertical shear of the subinertial background flow. Critical angle reflection is a useful indicator of inertial energy concentration in the linearized model. In the <b>primitive</b> <b>equation</b> model, however, wave refraction by the spatially varying horizontal and vertical shear of the background flow complicates the interpretation of a near-bottom critical angle. The crucial factor governing the formation of wave energy concentrations seems to be the presence of an alongshore current with negative relative vorticity on the offshore side of the jet (southward jet on a west coast). Current meter measurements from the 1975 Winter-Spring Transition Experiment on the Oregon shelf show higher levels of subsurface inertial energy during upwelling than during downwelling, in agreement with the model results...|$|E
