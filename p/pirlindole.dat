40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <b>pirlindole</b> [75 mg b. i. d. ], a reversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A [RIMA] in the treatment of primary fibromyalgia syndrome [FMS]. Methods: One hundred patients were included in a four-week double- blind placebo-controlled study. The safety analysis was based on 89 patients [45 <b>pirlindole</b> and 44 placebo] and the efficacy analysis on 61 patients [33 <b>pirlindole</b> and 28 placebo]. The evaluation of the outcome of therapy was based on the results obtained on eight characteristic parameters [pain, morning stiffness, tender pain score, psychological evaluation using the Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised, fatigue, sleep disturbance, global evaluation by the patient, global evaluation by the investigator]. Results: When compared with baseline evaluation a significant improvement [P 0. 05]. Conclusion: This four-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial suggests that <b>pirlindole</b> [75 mg b. i. d. ] might be a well-tolerated and beneficial treatment for FMS patients.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that <b>pirlindole</b> and dehydropirlindole, two monoamine oxidase type-A inhibitors, protect cultured brain cells against iron-induced toxicity through a mechanism unrelated to monoamine oxidase type-A inhibition. The {{current study was}} performed to test whether the protective effect of <b>pirlindole</b> and dehydropirlindole could be extended to a nitric oxide (NO) -induced insult. A comparison with other monoamine oxidase inhibitors (brofaromine, moclobemide and deprenyl) and with trolox was made. In a first series of experiments, rat hippocampal or cortical cultured cells were exposed to a drug for 3 h, then 5 muM sodium nitroprusside, a NO donor, was added and the incubation was continued for 16 h. Cell survival assessment showed that <b>pirlindole,</b> dehydropirlindole and trolox significantly protected cultures against NO-induced toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner with respective EC 50 's of 7, 3 and 17 muM. Similarly, <b>pirlindole,</b> dehydropirlindole or trolox, at a concentration of 50 muM, significantly decreased both intracellular peroxide production and lipoperoxidation. Other drugs were ineffective. In a post-hoc treatment protocol (3 - or 6 -h pre-incubation {{in the presence of}} sodium nitroprusside, then addition of one of the above mentioned compounds), only <b>pirlindole</b> and dehydropirlindole significantly improved cell survival in a concentration-dependent manner with respective EC 50 'S of 9 and 4 muM. The maximal protection in terms of cell survival was 90 % and 78 % after 3 and 6 h, respectively. They also reduced the production of both lipoperoxides and endoperoxides. Our results show that <b>pirlindole</b> and dehydropirlindole protect neurons against NO-induced toxicity at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Moreover, their protective effect is still apparent when they are applied after the start of the insult. Therefore, our preclinical study suggests a new strategy that may be efficient to reduce NO-induced damage in the central nervous system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The enantioseparation of <b>pirlindole</b> by liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) was investigated using three different chiral stationary phases (CSPs) containing either cellulose tris-(3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate) (Chiralcel OD-R), ovomucoid (OVM) or beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). The {{effects of the}} mobile phase pH on retention, enantioselectivity and resolution were studied. Methanol and acetonitrile were tested as organic modifiers while {{the influence of the}} addition to the mobile phase of sodium alkanesulfonates or sodium perchlorate was also investigated. Sodium perchlorate was only used on the Chiralcel OD-R column while sodium alkanesulfonates were tested as mobile phase additives on the three kinds of CSPs. The enantioseparation of <b>pirlindole</b> could be obtained on all CSPs tested, the best results with respect to chiral resolution being achieved on the Chiralcel OD-R and the OVM columns. The use of sodium octanesulfonate (NaOS) was found to improve the enantioseparation of <b>pirlindole</b> on the OVM column while enantioselectivity was considerably enhanced by addition of sodium perchlorate on the Chiralcel OD-R column.

40|$|Enteroviruses (EV) {{represent}} {{many important}} pathogens of humans. Unfortunately, no antiviral compounds currently exist to treat infections with these viruses. We screened the Prestwick Chemical LibraryÂ®, {{a library of}} approved drugs, for inhibitors of coxsackievirus B 3 and identified <b>pirlindole</b> as potent novel inhibitor and confirmed the inhibitory action of dibucaine, zuclopenthixol, fluoxetine and formoterol. Upon testing viruses of several EV species, we found that dibucaine and <b>pirlindole</b> inhibited EV-B and EV-D, and that dibucaine also inhibited EV-A, {{but none of them}} inhibited EV-C or rhinoviruses (RV). In contrast, formoterol inhibited all enteroviruses and rhinoviruses tested. All compounds acted through inhibition of genome replication. Mutations in the coding sequence of the CVB 3 2 C protein conferred resistance to dibucaine, <b>pirlindole</b> and zuclopenthixol - but not formoterol - suggesting that 2 C is the target for this set of compounds. Importantly, dibucaine bound to CVB 3 protein 2 C in vitro whereas binding to a 2 C protein carrying the resistance mutations was reduced, providing an explanation of how resistance is acquired...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} {{was employed}} for {{the determination of}} <b>pirlindole</b> enantiomers and its oxidation product dehydropirlindole (DHP). The direct separation of <b>pirlindole</b> enantiomers and DHP was achieved on a cellulose tris-(3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phase (Chiralcel OD-R). Acetonitrile {{was used as the}} organic modifier and sodium perchlorate was used as an ionic additive in the mobile phase. The influence of acetonitrile and sodium perchlorate concentrations on enantioselectivity and achiral selectivity towards DHP was investigated in order to find suitable conditions for the determination of low amounts of each analyte. The mobile phase selected consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (pH 5. 0) containing sodium perchlorate (0. 05 M) (35 : 65, v/v) and the UV detector was set at 220 nm. The method developed was validated and was found to be linear in the 0. 1 - 5 microg ml(- 1) range (r 2 = 0. 999 for the three compounds). Repeatability and the intermediate precision for the three analytes at a concentration of 0. 1 microg ml(- 1) were about 3 and 4 %, respectively. This concentration corresponds to the quantification of 0. 1 % for the minor enantiomer. Actual determinations of enantiomeric purity for single enantiomers of <b>pirlindole</b> were performed.

40|$|<b>Pirlindole</b> is a tetracyclic {{compound}} {{that has been}} characterized as a potential antidepressant drug. It has pharmacological characteristics in common with both tricyclic antidepressants and classical irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Its main mechanism of action consists of a selective and reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase A. Secondarily, it exerts an inhibitory effect on noradrenaline and 5 -hydroxytryptamine reuptakes. It {{has no effect on}} the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. It has only a low potential for amplifying tyramine and noradrenaline pressor effect, which makes one expect that it will not be at the basis of a 'cheese effect'. <b>Pirlindole</b> has an absolute bioavailability of between 20 and 30 % due to an extensive first-pass effect. Orally, the Tmax varies between 2. 5 and 6 h in the rat and 0. 8 and 2 h in the dog. Two phases of elimination (7. 5 and 34 - 70 h) are measured in the rat and three phases in the dog (1. 3, 10. 8 and 185 h); it is extensively metabolized. The rat eliminates mainly unconjugated products while the dog eliminates mostly conjugated products. Acute and chronic toxicological studies have not revealed potentially dangerous effects of the drug at the usual doses. It does not present measurable mutagenic, clastogenic or carcinogenic properties. Thus, <b>pirlindole</b> shows pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties which make it suitable for the management of depression. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A fully {{automated}} liquid chromatographic method {{has been developed}} for {{the determination of the}} enantiomers of <b>pirlindole,</b> an antidepressant drug, in human plasma. The method is based on the use of a pre-column packed with restricted access material (RAM) (LiChrospher ADS RP- 4) for sample clean-up coupled to a column containing a cellulose tris-(3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate) based chiral stationary phase (Chiralcel OD-R) for the separation and quantitative analysis of <b>pirlindole</b> enantiomers. A 50 -microl plasma volume was injected directly onto the pre-column using a mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 5. 0) and methanol (97 : 3; v/v) as washing liquid. By rotation of a switching valve, the analytes were then eluted in the back-flush mode with the LC mobile phase. A complete separation of <b>pirlindole</b> enantiomers was obtained in 22 min on the Chiralcel OD-R column, using a mobile phase made of a mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 5. 0) containing 50 mM sodium perchlorate and acetonitrile (65 : 35; v/v). The flow-rate was 0. 6 ml/min and the analytes were detected fluorometrically using 295 and 340 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The method was then validated and was found to be linear in the 2. 5 - 200 ng/ml range. The limit of detection was lower than 1 ng/ml. Repeatability and intermediate precision at a concentration of 50 ng/ml were about 1. 5 and 3. 5 %, respectively. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Online {{first version}} - Oct 14, 2014 There is accumulating {{evidence}} that adult neurogenesis and dendritic plasticity in the hippocampus are neuroplastic phenomena, highly {{sensitive to the}} effects of chronic stress and treatment with most classes of antidepressant drugs, being involved in the onset and recovery from depression. However, the effects of antidepressants that act through the selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase subtype A (MAO-A) in these phenomena are still largely unknown. In the present study, adult neurogenesis and neuronal morphology were examined in the hippocampus of rats exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS) and treated with the selective reversible MAO-A inhibitor (RIMA) drug, <b>pirlindole</b> and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine. The results provide the first demonstration that selective MAO-A inhibition with <b>pirlindole</b> is able to revert the behavioural effects of stress exposure while promoting hippocampal adult neurogenesis and rescuing the stress-induced dendritic atrophy of granule neurons.

40|$|The {{interaction}} with monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and B {{has been shown}} to be sensitive to the absolute configuration of molecules. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of the racemic <b>pirlindole</b> (a selective and reversible MAO-A inhibitor) and its two enantiomers using biochemical techniques (in vitro and ex vivo determination of rat brain MAO-A and MAO-B activity) and behavioural models (forced swimming test and reserpine-induced hypothermia and palpebral ptosis test). In vitro, the MAO-A IC 50 of (+/-) -pirlindole, R-(-) -pirlindole and S-(+) -pirlindole were 0. 24, 0. 43 and 0. 18 microM, respectively. Ex vivo, their ID 50 were 24. 4, 37. 8 and 18. 7 mg/kg i. p. The differences between the three compounds were not significant, with a ratio between the two enantiomers [R-(-) /S-(+) ] of 2. 2 in vitro and 2. 0 ex vivo. MAO-B was only slightly inhibited. In the forced swimming test and the reserpine-induced hypothermia and ptosis model, the three compounds had an antidepressant profile. In the forced swimming test, the minimal effective dose ratio between the R-(-) and the S-(+) was again around 2. 0. The behavioural observations were thus clearly in accordance with the biochemical data. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the MAO (monoamine oxidase) -B {{inhibitor}} deprenyl (DPR, selegiline) protects some cell types against oxidative stress. By decreasing H 2 O 2 production, MAO-A inhibitors could also reduce oxidative stress. This study reports the effect of the MAO-A inhibitors, <b>pirlindole</b> (PIR), dehydropirlindole (DHP), brofaromine (BRO) and moclobemide (MCL) on primary-cultured brain cells exposed to iron-mediated toxicity. A comparison with trolox (TRO), a hydrosoluble vitamin-E analogue that protects against such an induced stress, was performed. Rat hippocampal or cortical cultured cells were exposed either to 2 [*]Î¼M FeSO 4 alone or in the presence of PIR, DHP, BRO, DPR, MCL or TRO. Cell survival (lactate-dehydrogenase measurements, 16 [*]h incubation), intracellular peroxide production (DCF-fluorescence, 1 [*]h incubation), lipoperoxidation (TBARS-fluorescence, 6 [*]h incubation) and mitochondrial function (MTT-test, 16 [*]h incubation) were assessed. PIR, DHP and TRO significantly protected cultures (P< 0. 05) against Fe 2 +-induced toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC 50 s of these compounds were 6, 12 and 19 [*]Î¼M, respectively, in hippocampal cells. For cortical cell cultures incubated in the presence of iron and PIR or DHP, EC 50 s were 5 and 6 [*]Î¼M respectively. All Hill coefficients were close to unity. BRO, MCL and DPR were not protective in any type of culture. The IC 50 s for the inhibition of MAO-A were 2, 2 and 0. 2 [*]Î¼M for PIR, DHP and BRO, respectively. PIR, DHP and TRO, but not DPR, induced a significant decrease in both intracellular peroxide production and lipoperoxidation. They also improved mitochondrial function. These experiments show that PIR and DHP can protect hippocampal and cortical neurons against oxidative stress at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. This protective effect seems unrelated to inhibition of MAO-A, but possibly involves free radical scavenging...|$|E
