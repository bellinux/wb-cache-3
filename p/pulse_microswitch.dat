40|$|MnO. sub. 2 -x {{thin films}} (12) exhibit {{irreversible}} memory switching (28) with an OFF/ON resistance ratio {{of at least}} about 10. sup. 3 and the tailorability of ON state (20) resistance. Such films are potentially extremely useful as a connection element {{in a variety of}} microelectronic circuits and arrays (24). Such films provide a pre-tailored, finite, non-volatile resistive element at a desired place in an electric circuit, which can be electrically turned OFF (22) or disconnected as desired, by application of an electrical <b>pulse.</b> <b>Microswitch</b> structures (10) constitute the thin film element, contacted by a pair of separate electrodes (16 a, 16 b) and have a finite, pre-selected ON resistance which is ideally suited, for example, as a programmable binary synaptic connection for electronic implementation of neural network architectures. The MnO. sub. 2 -x microswitch is non-volatile, patternable, insensitive to ultraviolet light, and adherent to a variety of insulating substrates (14), such as glass and silicon dioxide-coated silicon substrates...|$|E
