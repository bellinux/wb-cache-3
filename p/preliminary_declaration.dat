60|$|If {{we proceed}} in this business, under this <b>preliminary</b> <b>declaration,</b> {{it seems to}} me that we admit, (now for the third time,) by {{something}} a great deal stronger than words, the truth of the charges of every kind which they make upon the British ministry, and the grounds of those foul imputations. The language used by us, which in other circumstances would not be exceptionable, in this case tends very strongly to confirm and realize the suspicion of our enemy: I mean the declaration, that, if we do not obtain such terms of peace as suits our opinion of what our interests require, then, and in that case, we shall continue the war with vigor. This offer, so reasoned, plainly implies, that, without it, our leaders themselves entertain great doubts of the opinion and good affections of the British people; otherwise there does not appear any cause why we should proceed, under the scandalous construction of our enemy, upon the former offer made by Mr. Wickham, and on the new offer made directly at Paris. It is not, therefore, from a sense of dignity, but from the danger of radicating that false sentiment in the breasts of the enemy, that I think, under the auspices of this declaration, we cannot, with the least hope of a good event, or, indeed, with any regard to the common safety, proceed in the train of this negotiation. I wish ministry would seriously consider the importance of their seeming to confirm the enemy in an opinion that his frequent use of appeals to the people against their government has not been without its effect. If it puts an end to this war, it will render another impracticable.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} motivations stemmed from the 12th Seminar of the International Association for the Development of Intercultural Communication of 1987, held in Recife, Brazil, which also recommended the introduction of a declaration for linguistic rights. The Seminar then adopted a <b>preliminary</b> <b>declaration</b> that indexed some fundamental types of linguistic rights.|$|E
40|$|REPRESENTATION The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{institute}} of representation in general. It provides an explanation of basic attributes of representation and it's resolution methods. Given the scope of the thesis {{it was not possible to}} cover discourse about all forms of representation and therefore it is mainly focused on direct representation in substantive law. The work is based on current regulation contained in Law No. 89 / 2012 Coll., The Civil Code and it highlights the most significant changes which has occurred since the date of effectiveness of this Code in regulation of representation. It also refers to consequences of these changes and contentious issues which arise with the application of individual provisions. This work deals with contractual and statutory representation including representation of an entrepreneur and representation of legal entities, briefly describes representation in family law. There is also an elaborated issue of guardianship that has been affected by significant changes. It refers to guardian council and guardianship of legal entities that are newly adjusted in Czech legal order. There is also included characterization of <b>preliminary</b> <b>declaration,</b> supported decision making, representation by the member of the household...|$|E

60|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>declarations</b> of this sort, {{thrown out}} at random, and sown, as it wore, broadcast, were {{never to be}} found in the mode of our {{proceeding}} with France and Spain, whilst the great monarchies of France and Spain existed. I do not say that a diplomatic measure ought to be, like a parliamentary or a judicial proceeding, according to strict precedent: I hope I am far from that pedantry. But this I know: that a great state ought to have some regard to its ancient maxims, especially where they indicate its dignity, where they concur with the rules of prudence, and, above all, where the circumstances of the time require that a spirit of innovation should be resisted which leads to the humiliation of sovereign powers. It would be ridiculous to assert that those powers have suffered nothing in their estimation. I admit that the greater interests of state will for a moment supersede all other considerations; but if there was a rule, that a sovereign never should let down his dignity without a sure payment to his interest, the dignity of kings would be held high enough. At present, however, fashion governs in more serious things than furniture and dress. It looks as if sovereigns abroad were emulous in bidding against their estimation. It seems as if the preëminence of regicide was acknowledged,--and that kings tacitly ranked themselves below their sacrilegious murderers, as natural magistrates and judges over them. It appears as if dignity were the prerogative of crime, and a temporizing humiliation the proper part for venerable authority. If the vilest of mankind are resolved to be the most wicked, they lose all the baseness of their origin, and take their place above kings. This example in foreign princes I trust will not spread. It is the concern of mankind, that the destruction of order should not, be a claim to rank, that crimes should not be the only title to preëminence and honor.|$|R
60|$|Whilst I {{look over}} this paper {{to have it}} copied, I see a {{manifesto}} of the Assembly, as a <b>preliminary</b> to a <b>declaration</b> of war against the German princes on the Rhine. This manifesto contains the whole substance of the French politics with regard to foreign states. They have ordered it to be circulated amongst the people in every country of Europe,--even previously to its acceptance by the king, and his new privy council, the club of the Feuillants. Therefore, as a summary of their policy avowed by themselves, let us consider some of the circumstances attending that piece, {{as well as the}} spirit and temper of the piece itself.|$|R

Wydanie publikacji dofinansowane przez Komitet Badań NaukowychThree constitutions, the American (1787 - 1789), the French (1791) and the Polish (3 May 1791) have {{a similar}} ancestry. They {{were born in the}} {{atmosphere}} of changes and revolutions, whose inspirations was the political thought of the European Enlightenment (from Locke and Montesquieu to Jean Jacques Rousseau) and the ideas of the rights of man, which were already partly realized in England. The author notes the theoretical foundations, and the appeal to the will of society (in „We, the Poeple”) in the preambles and <b>preliminary</b> <b>declarations</b> of these constitutions. The passing of all three constitutions was accompanied by a veritable pamphlet and propaganda war. The constitution of the United States, as the first of the three, and first in the world, influenced the concepts of the other two, and inspired the national liberation movements in South America and Europe against foreign rule. The American example was always lively in Poland. The constitutions sanctioned breaks with the old regime, considered to be the accumulated evil of centuries. They created societies of citizens, and proclaimed religions toleration and the rights of the individual. No less important, however, are the differences between the constitutions arising from varying international situations and social expectations. The United States, having won independence as 13 free republics, built the structure of a federal state. As a result of revolution, France created a new system of power based on the equality and liberty of all citizens. Poland, threatened after the first partition, tried to save the state through a constitution which redefined the stage as the common property of all its inhabitants by breaking in some way the social banners of estates. The Poles attempted to rescue their independence. All the constitutions were met by reaction and criticism, which in France and Poland led to foreign intervention. France saved itself but at the price of the terror. After military defeat, the Polish constitution fell, but it left a legand, and contributed to the rebirth o f the Polish nation in the nieneteenth century. Zadanie pt.

40|$|International audienceReading {{is still}} often {{perceived}} as the decoding of a message, as if the message {{were meant to be}} merely " received ", as if the code were supposed to be known and invariable, and as if the meaning were determined solely by the sender. Since the 1960 s at least, however, theories of interpretation have constructed (literary) reading in a more elaborate and inventive fashion: while each author was supposed to re-invent a singular language against the background of the common language, each interpreter necessarily had to recreate something new, even though reading exactly the same text, because each interpreter understood this text and its singular language within an ever-changing context of actualization. The model of interpretation, however, remained indebted to the activity of deciphering: the ever-changing meaning was to be found within the text itself. Both the CCSI initiative and, in Europe, the guidelines periodically imposed upon teachers by ministries of Education register this evolution from decoding to interpretation. Whether in the form of ambitious (although often hollow) <b>preliminary</b> <b>declarations</b> about " critical-thinking ", or in the form of more precise assessment criteria, most of these administrative documents recognize that reading involves more than merely deciphering an unequivocal message. The CCSSI displays insight when it asks students to " determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including analyzing how an author uses and refines the meaning of a key term {{over the course of a}} text (e. g., how Madison defines faction in Federalist No. 10) " (CCSSI Standards 40). In such statements, literacy is clearly defined in terms of interpretation rather than reading: the student cannot simply apply a proper knowledge of " the " English language on a text in order to extract its proper meaning; s/he must (re) construct a singular version of the language drafted by this singular author in order to make sense of its potential signification. The presence of such formulations in these types of regulatory documents should be celebrated by literary scholars, since they imply that there can be no real literacy that is not literary. The quasi-obsessive insistence of the CCSS on " cit[ing] strong and thorough textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says " (CCSSI Standards 36, 38, 39, 40) should also be welcome, given the significance of close reading for literary studies. As we enter the digital age, however, a new " post-interpretive " configuration seems to emerge, not to replace but rather to supplement our traditional conceptions of reading and interpretation. As Lev Manovich, Lawrence Lessig and many others have shown, variability, modularity, hybridization, recombination, remix are crucial properties of " new media ". Their main consequence is to explode the very notion of " the text ". Through the extensive use of the " copy ", " search ", " cut-and-paste " functions, through the practices of sampling, inserting, transferring, syndicating, re-editing, it is not only the integrity and the borders of " the text " that are altered and need to be reassessed: it is the reader's relation to the readable data that is mutating. " Data " (texts, slogans, keywords, tags, tweets, images, icons, logos, sounds, videos) are given only to be reprocessed: to read is no longer only to decipher, nor merely to reconstruct or de-construct, but also to re-use, 2 reshape and over-code. The re-contextualization which, in the age of interpretation, altered the meaning of the text (its " content "), now reconfigures its signs themselves (its " form "). In this digital context, it is significant to see literary scholars describe literary interpretation by emphasizing the notion of " use " (Rita Felski), by adding " distant reading " (Franco Moretti), " hyper-reading " (N. Katherine Hayles) to the traditional practice of close reading, or by valorizing (rather than stigmatizing) the practice of " continuous partial attention " as " a digital survival skill ", against the dogma of attentiveness equated with focalization (Cathy Davidson). In the digital age, learning to read means learning to properly and inventively use the (overwhelming) context of whatever is accessible through search engines, i. e., of whatever resonates through the dense and unpredictable web of hyperlinks...|$|R
