Some source gases are expected to be more damaging to the ozone layer than others, so that scientific guidance regarding their relative impacts is needed for regulatory purposes. Parameters used for this purpose include the steady-state and time-dependent <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> potential (CLP) and the ozone depletion potential (ODP). <b>Chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> potentials depend upon the estimated value and accuracy of atmospheric lifetimes and are subject to significant (approximately 20 - 50 percent) uncertainties for many gases.

40|$|The {{impact of}} climate change and stratospheric <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> on the stratospheric ozone layer is {{estimated}} by evaluating three multi-annual simulations of the interactively coupled global chemistry-climate model ECUAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM. Two experiments of the near past were carried out representing the early 1980 s and 1990 s, respectively. An additional scenario was conducted which is characterised by increased greenhouse gas concentrations and a slightly reduced stratospheric <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> with respect to its value measured in the year 1990, according to current projections. The model is able to describe dynamic and chemical processes of the 1980 s and 1990 s realistically, and it is capable in reproducing the observed stratospheric temperature, water vapour, and ozone temperature trends of this time period. With increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, the model produces an enhancing stratospheric cooling for the years 1980 to 2015. Despite the reduced stratospheric <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> in 2015, the decreased stratospheric temperatures will cause a continued reduction of stratospheric ozone in the southern hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere, tropospheric warming results in a changed excitation of planetary waves. Their vertical propagation and breaking in the stratosphere causes the polar vortex to become more unstable in 2015. This overcompensates the radiative stratospheric cooling so that stratospheric ozone recovers. (orig.)

40|$|This study {{presents}} a sensitivity analysis of multivariate regressions of recent springtime Antarctic vortex ozone trends using a "big data" ensemble approach. Our {{results indicate that}} the poleward heat flux (Eliassen–Palm flux) and the effective <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> respectively explain most of the short-term and long-term variability in different Antarctic springtime total ozone records. The inclusion in the regression of stratospheric volcanic aerosols, solar variability and the quasi-biennial oscillation is shown to increase rather than decrease the overall uncertainty in the attribution of Antarctic springtime ozone because of large uncertainties in their respective records. Calculating the trend significance for the ozone record from the late 1990 s onwards solely based on the fit of the effective <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> is not recommended, as this does not take fit residuals into account, resulting in too narrow uncertainty intervals, while the fixed temporal change of the effective <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> does not allow for any flexibility in the trends. When taking fit residuals into account in a piecewise linear trend fit, we find that approximately 30 – 60 % of the regressions in the full ensemble result in a statistically significant positive springtime ozone trend over Antarctica from the late 1990 s onwards. Analysis of choices and uncertainties in time series show that, depending on choices in time series and parameters, the fraction of statistically significant trends in parts of the ensemble can range from negligible to a complete 100 % significance.

The Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation for Aviation Safety (NAIRAS) computation of the GCR-caused ionization rates are used in these simulations. GCR-caused maximum NO x increases of 4 – 15  % are computed in the Southern polar troposphere with associated ozone increases of 1 – 2  %. NO x increases of [*]∼[*] 1 – 6  % are calculated for the lower stratosphere with associated ozone decreases of 0. 2 – 1  %. The primary impact of GCRs on ozone was due to their production of NO x. The impact of GCRs varies with the atmospheric <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading,</b> sulfate aerosol loading, and solar cycle variation. Because of the interference between the NO x and ClO x ozone loss cycles (e. g., the ClO + NO 2 + M [*]→[*] ClONO 2 + M reaction) and {{the change in the}} importance of ClO x in the ozone budget, GCRs cause larger atmospheric impacts with less <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading.</b> GCRs also cause larger atmospheric impacts with less sulfate aerosol loading and for years closer to solar minimum. GCR-caused decreases of annual average global total ozone (AAGTO) were computed to be 0. 2  % or less with GCR-caused column ozone increases between 1000 and 100  hPa of 0. 08  % or less and GCR-caused column ozone decreases between 100 and 1  hPa of 0. 23  % or less. Although these computed ozone impacts are small, GCRs provide a natural influence on ozone and need to be quantified over long time periods.

40|$|Long-lived chlorine-containing source gases, such as {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFCs), are transported {{into the}} stratosphere where they decompose and cause ozone depletion. Increases in chlorine during the 1970 s- 1990 s resulted in long-term ozone decreases, especially in the polar regions. Following {{the implementation of the}} Montreal Protocol, the near-surface <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> was observed to peak in 1993 and, since then, to decrease in line with expectations. After release from source gases in the stratosphere, chlorine mainly forms the reservoir HCl, providing an alternative method for monitoring the progress of the Montreal Protocol. A maximum in stratospheric HCl was observed around 1996, followed by decay at a rate close to 1 %/year, consistent with the tropospheric <b>chlorine</b> <b>peak</b> and known transport timescales. However, we will present total column observations from ground-based FTIR instruments which show an unexpected and significant upturn in stratospheric HCl around 2007 in the northern hemisphere. Height-resolved observations from satellite instruments (HALOE, MLS, ACE) confirm this increase and show that it occurs in the lower stratosphere. These observations contrast with the ongoing monotonic decrease of near-surface chlorine source gases. Using 3 -D model simulations (TOMCAT/SLIMCAT and KASIMA) we attribute this trend anomaly to a slowdown in the NH atmospheric circulation, causing air in the lower stratosphere to become more aged with a larger relative conversion of source gases to HCl. An important conclusion is that the Montreal Protocol is still on track and will still lead to long-term decreases in stratospheric chlorine. This dynamical variability could also significantly affect the evolution of stratospheric ozone and must be accounted for when searching for signs of ozone recovery...|$|R

Following the formation of the enhanced aerosol layer, observations have shown a reduction in the amount of direct radiation reaching the ground and a concomitant increase in diffuse radiation. This is associated with an increase in stratospheric temperature and a decrease in global mean surface temperature (although the spatial pattern of temperature changes is complex). In addition, the enhanced aerosol layer increases heterogeneous processing, and this reduces the levels of active nitrogen in the lower stratosphere.

Multi-variate regression methods {{are widely used}} for studying the variability and detection of ozone trends. Based on multi-variate regression analysis of total Antarctic springtime vortex ozone {{it has been suggested}} that the observed increase of ozone since the late 1990 s is statistically significant and can be attributed to decreasing stratospheric halogens (Salby et al., 2011, 2012; Kuttippurath et al., 2013). We find that, when considering uncertainties that have not been addressed in these studies, this conclusion on ozone recovery is not warranted. An ensemble of regressions is constructed based on the analysis of uncertainties in the applied ozone record as well as of uncertainties in the various applied regressors. The presented combination of ensemble members spans up the uncertainty range with about 35 million different regressions. The poleward heat flux (Eliassen–Palm Flux) and the effective <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> explain, respectively, most of the short-term and long-term variability in different Antarctic springtime total ozone records. The inclusion in the regression of stratospheric volcanic aerosols, solar variability, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode is shown to increase rather than to decrease the overall uncertainty in the attribution of Antarctic springtime ozone because of large uncertainties in their respective records.

For most conditions, the conversion of NO 2 to HNO 3 is saturated for reaction probability in the range of laboratory measurements, but is only absolutely saturated following major volcanic eruptions when the heterogeneous loss dominates the losses of N 2 O 5. The ozone loss due to this heterogeneous reaction increases with the increasing <b>chlorine</b> <b>load.</b> Total ozone losses calculated are comparable to ozone losses reported from TOMS and Dobson data...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} steady {{decrease}} in the upper stratospheric and lower mesospheric abundances of hydrogen chloride (HCl) from August 2004 through January 2006, {{as measured by the}} Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) aboard the Aura satellite. For 60 (deg) S to 60 (deg) N zonal means, the average yearly change in the 0. 7 to 0. 1 hPa (approx. 50 to 65 km) region is - 27 +/- 3 pptv/year, or - 0. 78 +/- 0. 08 percent/year. This is consistent with surface abundance decrease rates (about 6 to 7 years earlier) in chlorine source gases. The MLS data confirm that international agreements to reduce global emissions of ozone-depleting industrial gases are leading to global decreases in the total gaseous chlorine burden. Tracking stratospheric HCl variations on a seasonal basis is now possible with MLS data. Inferred stratospheric total chlorine (CITOT) has a value of 3. 60 ppbv at the beginning of 2006, with a (2 -sigma) accuracy estimate of 7 %; the stratospheric <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> has decreased by about 43 pptv in the 18 -month period studied here. We discuss the MLS HCl measurements in the context of other satellite-based HCl data, as well as expectations from surface chlorine data. A mean age of air of approx. 5. 5 years and an age spectrum width of 2 years or less provide a fairly good fit to the ensemble of measurements...|$|R
40|$|Chemistry {{climate models}} (CCMs) {{have a common}} {{conceptual}} basis. Differences in implementation lead to differences in the stratospheric ozone response to changes in composition and climate. Although evaluation by CCMVal- 2 identified {{strengths and weaknesses of}} participant models, the evaluation results were not used to discriminate among projections for future ozone evolution, at least in part because the overall diagnostic evaluation did not cleanly relate to the differences in CCM response. Here we use a subset of CCMVal diagnostics and additional analysis to understand the differences in response. In the upper stratosphere, differences in simulated temperature and total odd nitrogen prior to increases in <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> explain the large differences in CCM sensitivity. In the lower atmosphere, there are two principle contributions to differences in CCM sensitivity to chlorine and climate change. First, differences in the lower stratospheric ClO affect simulated sensitivity to chlorine. CCMs with best transport performance match NDACC column HCl measurements at a broad range of latitudes. Other CCMs disagree with observations due to differences in total inorganic chlorine, partitioning between HCl and ClONO 2, or both. Differences in ClONO 2 are directly related to differences in simulated ClO. Second, although all CCMs predict increased tropical upwelling, the rate of increase varies and contributes to differences in tropical ozone and the 60 N- 60 S column average...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{ozone loss}} {{process in the}} cold polar lower {{stratosphere}} hinges on chlorine monoxide (ClO) {{and one of its}} dimers, chlorine peroxide (ClOOCl). Recently, analyses of atmospheric observations have suggested that the equilibrium constant, Keq, governing the balance between ClOOCl formation and thermal decomposition in darkness is lower than that in the current evaluation of kinetics data. Measurements of ClO at night, when ClOOCl is unaffected by photolysis, provide a useful means of testing quantitative understanding of the ClO/ClOOCl relationship. Here we analyze nighttime ClO measurements from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) to infer an expression for Keq. Although the observed temperature dependence of the nighttime ClO is in line with the theoretical ClO/ClOOCl equilibrium relationship, none of the previously published expressions for Keq consistently produces ClO abundances that match the MLS observations well under all conditions. Employing a standard expression for Keq, A × exp(B/T), we constrain the parameter A to currently recommended values and estimate B using a nonlinear weighted least squares analysis of nighttime MLS ClO data. ClO measurements at multiple pressure levels throughout the periods of <b>peak</b> <b>chlorine</b> activation in three Arctic and four Antarctic winters are used to estimate B. Our derived B leads to values of Keq that are ∼ 1. 4 times smaller at stratospherically relevant temperatures than currently recommended, consistent with earlier studies. Our results are in better agreement with the newly updated (2009) kinetics evaluation than with the previous (2006) recommendation...|$|R

We present two balloon-borne in situ measurements of ClO conducted in northern hemisphere midlatitudes during the period of the maximum of total inorganic <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> in the atmosphere. Both ClO measurements were conducted on board the TRIPLE balloon payload, launched in November 1996 in León, Spain, and in May 1999 in Aire sur l’Adour, France. For both flights a ClO daylight and night-time vertical profile was derived over an altitude range of approximately 15 – 35 km. ClO mixing ratios are compared to model simulations performed with the photochemical box model version of the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). Simulations along 24 -hour backward trajectories were performed to study the diurnal variation of ClO in the midlatitude lower stratosphere. Model simulations for the flight launched in Aire sur l’Adour 1999 show an excellent agreement with the ClO measurements. For the flight launched in León 1996, an overall good agreement is found, whereas the flight is characterized by a more complex dynamical situation due to a possible mixture of vortex and non-vortex air. We note that for both flights at solar zenith angles greater than 86 ◦ – 87 ◦ simulated ClO mixing ratios are higher than observed ClO mixing ratios. However, the present findings indicate that no substantial uncertainties exist in midlatitude chlorine chemistry of the stratosphere...|$|R

The ozone hole arises from ozone destruction driven by elevated levelsof ozone destroying (“active”) chlorine in Antarctic spring. The established picture ofthe development of the ozone hole is that high levels of active chlorine are maintainedin Antarctic spring by a competition between chlorine deactivation through gas-phaseformation of ClONO 2 and HCl and activation of ClONO 2 and HCl by heterogeneousreactions (Solomon et al., 2014, 2015). In the core of vortex for ozone hole conditionsin the lower stratosphere (i. e. 16 - 18 km or 100 - 70 hPa) formation of ClONO 2 isof minor importance and the formation of HCl by reaction of Cl with CH 4 and CH 2 Ocannot lead to deactivation because it is balanced by immediate reactivation in effectivereaction cycles involving the heterogeneous reaction HCl+HOCl. For the (observed) complete activation of stratospheric chlorine the production of HOCl via HO 2 + ClO,with the HO 2 resulting from CH 2 O photolysis, is essential. These results are key forassessing the impact of changes of the future stratospheric composition on the recoveryof Antarctic ozone. Our simulations indicate that future increased methane concentrationswill not lead to enhanced chlorine deactivation and that extreme ozone destructionto levels below 0. 1 ppm will occur until mid-century. Besides the reactions involvedin the activation and rapid deactivation of chlorine are analysed here thoroughl...|$|R

We present two balloonborne in situ measurements of ClO conducted in northern hemisphere midlatitudes during the period of the maximum of total inorganic <b>chlorine</b> <b>loading</b> in the atmosphere. Both ClO measurements were conducted on board the TRIPLE balloon payload, launched in November 1996 in Le&# 243;n, Spain, and in May 1999 in Aire sur l'Adour, France. For both flights a ClO daylight and night time vertical profile could be derived over an altitude range of approximately 15 &ndash; 31 km. ClO mixing ratios are compared to model simulations performed with the photochemical box model version of the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). Simulations along 24 -h backward trajectories were performed to study the diurnal variation of ClO in the midlatitude lower stratosphere. Model simulations for the flight launched in Aire sur l'Adour 1999 show a good agreement with the ClO measurements. For the flight launched in Le&# 243;n 1996, a similar good agreement is found, except at around &asymp; 650 K potential temperature (&asymp; 26 km altitude). However, a tendency is found that for solar zenith angles greater than 86 &deg;&ndash; 87 &deg; the simulated ClO mixing ratios substantially overestimate measured ClO by approximately a factor of 2. 5 or more for both flights. Therefore we conclude that no indication can be deduced from the presented ClO measurements that substantial uncertainties exist in midlatitude chlorine chemistry of the stratosphere. An exception is the situation at solar zenith angles greater than 86 &deg;&ndash; 87 &deg; where model simulations substantial overestimate ClO observations. ...|$|R

This situation affects to the ozone and climate change which the model predicts that for 5 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) of bromine contributed by VSLS on average about 1.3% of global total column ozone is destroyed. The ozone loss and because of VSLS in the stratosphere, which can estimate as 25%. This makes the ozone hole - occurs naturally due to extremely cold and human. Even the VSLS has a short life time, if they still increase dramatically, it can damage the ozone because it’s not only the VSLS, but also collaborate with CFCs at the same time, this makes the global warming and weather problems. VSLS has more powerful even if less than six months, but Very Short - lived Substances try to exert indirectly cooling impact through the ozone loss.
