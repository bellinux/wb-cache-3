25|$|Antipolis {{became the}} seat of a bishopric in the 5th century. After the {{disintegration}} of the Western Roman Empire, various barbarian tribes seized Antibes. This resulted in destruction and a long period of instability. In the 10th century, Antibes found a protector in Seigneur Rodoart, who built extensive fortified walls around the town and a castle in which to live. For the next 200 years, the town experienced a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>renewal.</b> Prosperity was short-lived, as the whole region fell into disarray for several centuries. The inhabitants of Antibes stayed behind their strong city walls as a succession of wars and epidemics ravaged the countryside. In the 1244, Antibes's bishop moved his see to Grasse. By the end of the 15th century, the region was under the protection and control of King Louis XI of France. Relative stability returned, but the small port of Antibes fell into obscurity.|$|E
500|$|Edward II took a {{much closer}} {{interest}} in Hadleigh, {{leading to a}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> and rebuilding during his reign {{and that of his}} son, Edward III. Edward II first stayed there in 1311, and work was done to renovate the castle before he arrived, including building new royal quarters and repairing some of the castle walls that had succumbed to subsidence. Amongst the buildings known to be in the castle during the period were the castle hall, larder, kitchen, cellar, a long house, prison, an [...] "old chamber" [...] and armoury; they were guarded by a garrison of 24 soldiers during crises. Edward stayed there frequently during his reign up until 1324, on occasion travelling to Hadleigh Castle from London on his royal barge, which docked at a wharf to the south of the castle.|$|E

In the second phase fatigue becomes a dominant image and death is a dominant symbol, as Buck comes close to being killed.

25|$|Through {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, large {{residential}} neighborhoods were built {{to accommodate the}} soldiers {{coming back from the}} Vietnam War and for those associated with Ft.

50|$|The Third Great Awakening was a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> in evangelical Protestantism {{from the}} late 1850s to the 1900s. It {{affected}} pietistic Protestant denominations and had {{a strong sense of}} social activism. It gathered strength from the postmillennial theology that the Second Coming of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth. A major component was the Social Gospel Movement, which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the Holiness movement and Nazarene movements, and Christian Science.|$|E

50|$|The {{subsequent}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> saw the self-educated Giono {{now turn}} to Stendhal as a literary model {{in the same way}} as previously he had been influenced by the Classics. His novels thus began to be set in a specific time and place, confronting the protagonists with specific politics, issues, causes and events, in contrast with the timelessness of his earlier work. He also adopted the Stendhalian narrative technique of letting the reader into the experience of the protagonist by means of the interior monologue, whereas the dominant technique of his earlier novels had been that of the omniscient narrator.|$|E

40|$|Timely {{identification}} {{of changes in}} the state of volcanoes and onset of potentially dangerous eruptive phenomena requires efficacious surveillance methods. In the case of an active volcano like Mt Etna, the continuous background seismic signal called volcanic tremor is of paramount importance. The huge amount of continuously acquired digital data entails the necessity of data reduction and parameter extraction. For this purpose, techniques of automatic analysis of volcanic tremor were applied by INGV for the real time monitoring of this signal. We checked the possibility to identify regimes of volcanic activity based on pattern classification of volcanic tremor. A specific software named “KKAnalysis” was developed. It combines various unsupervised classification methods (Kohonen Maps and fuzzy cluster analysis) and forms the backbone of an automatic alert system at INGV-OE. Besides its near real time application, it can be operated off-line, allowing an efficient a-posteriori processing of data and tuning of the alarm criteria to match specific needs of sensitivity and robustness. An ongoing development of this tool will allow us to include a large number of seismic stations in a multistation-alarm system. The new system will be more robust in case of failure of single sensors, and will achieve a better coverage of the various eruptive craters. In an off-line test, we exploited a dataset covering eight years of seismic records, and analysed the performance of the new system in terms of “trigger timing” and spatial distribution of the stations. Intriguing results were obtained throughout <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> volcanic activity at Bocca Nuova-Voragine and North East Crater, {{and in the absence of}} paroxysmal phenomena at South East Crater and New South East Crater...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} an attempt {{is made to}} explain {{a case of the}} water {{circulation}} in the North Aegean shelf based on a set of oceanographic and meteorological measurements.

It is shown that, although the mean horizontal water velocity is estimated at about 7 cm/sec providing a time <b>period</b> <b>of</b> water <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the bay at about 4 days, the geostrophic circulation of the wider area in the North Aegean, controlled by the geometry of the local area, accelerates the water movement in the bay decreasing the time required for the renewal to less than one day...|$|R
