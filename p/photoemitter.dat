In this context, single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have demonstrated outstanding electrical and optical properties that make them an ideal material for the realization of ultracompact optoelectronic devices.

This method was used to estimate the scattering length and the escape depth from the substrates of Al-SiO 2 -Si (N+-type and P+-type) structures.

Zinc metallated porphyrins and ruthenium polypyridyl complexes are well known to act as donors in TTA-based energy upconversion. TINA-modified DNA duplexes and G-quadruplexes significantly improved the interaction between TINA and ZnTMpyP 4 / [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 + as shown by fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), and UV-Vis spectroscopy studies.

40|$|Advantages of optics over {{electronics}} in {{signal processing}} {{derive from the}} fact that many operations, such as addition, multiplication, correlation, and filtering, can be performed in parallel on two-dimensional data samples. However, this advantage is attainable only if information can be input/output or processed at sufficient speed and space bandwidth. Although acousto-optic devices have been used to provide impressive throughput, they are inherently one-dimensional and do not possess any information-storage capability beyond the acoustic transit time (≤ 50 μs). Hence, a high-resolution high-speed two-dimensional transducer (or spatial light modulator, SLM) with real-time update capability is required. Unfortunately, none of the existing SLMs perform well enough to fully utilize the inherent speed and parallelism of the optics. This dissertation addresses the development of an SLM that has the potential to meet most of the performance requirements of advanced optical information-processing applications [...] the <b>photoemitter</b> membrane light modulator (PEMLM). At the heart of the PEMLM is a microchannel plate (MCP) with a flexible membrane covering each pore. In operation, the write image incident on a photocathode, which is placed on the input side of the MCP, creates an electron image. This electron image is then amplified by the MCP and deposited onto the membrane array. The membrane elements, which are electrically and mechanically isolated from each other, are deflected by the induced electrostatic forces. These deflections represent the stored information. Readout of stored information is accomplished by sensing the phase changes induced in an optical-readout beam reflected from the deformed membrane array. A sandwich-type electrostatic grid structure positioned between the MCP and membrane greatly enhances the versatility of the PEMLM by facilitating the use of secondary emission for active electron removal and various intrinsic operations. The theoretical analysis and experimental characterizations performed on prototype devices indicates that PEMLM is capable of higher throughput than most other SLMs, with expected resolutions approaching 50 lp/mm over 10 ⁷ resolution elements and framing rates greater than 1 KHz. MCP gains provides quantum-limited sensitivity. The PEMLM also promises information-storage times of minutes to hours, greater than 2 π phase modulation, good image quality, and an option for serial addressing.

40|$|We {{determine}} {{the limit of}} the lowest achievable photoemitted electron temperature, and therefore the maximum achievable electron brightness, due to heating just after emission into vacuum, applicable to dense relativistic or nonrelativistic photoelectron beams. This heating is due to poorly screened Coulomb interactions equivalent to disorder induced heating seen in ultracold neutral plasmas. We first show that traditional analytic methods of Coulomb collisions fail for the calculation of this strongly coupled heating. Instead, we employ an N-body tree algorithm to compute the universal scaling of the disorder induced heating in fully contained bunches, and show it to agree well with a simple model utilizing the tabulated correlated energy of one component plasmas. We also present simulations for beams undergoing Coulomb explosion at the photocathode, and demonstrate that both the temperature growth and subsequent cooling must be characterized by correlated effects, as well as correlation-frozen dynamics. In either case, the induced temperature {{is found to be}} of several meV for typical photoinjector beam densities, a significant fraction of the intrinsic beam temperature of the coldest semiconductor photocathodes.

Recording the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) -dependent photoemission from the nanowire tips allows us to identify rescattering contributions and also permits us to determine the high-energy cutoff of the electron spectra as a function of laser intensity. So far these types of experiments from metal nanotips have been limited to an emission regime with less than one electron per pulse. We detect up to 13 e/shot and given the limited detection efficiency, we expect up to a few ten times more electrons being emitted from the nanowire. Within the investigated intensity range, we find linear scaling of cutoff energies. The nonlinear scaling of electron count rates is consistent with tunneling photoemission occurring in the absence of significant charge interaction.

These materials are extremely susceptible to degradation in efficiency through multiple mechanisms related to contamination from the local imperfect vacuum environment of the host photoinjector. Few-layer graphene has been predicted to permit a modified photoemission response of protected photocathode surfaces, and recent experiments of single-layer graphene on copper have begun to confirm these predictions for single crystal metallic photocathodes. Unlike metallic <b>photoemitters,</b> the integration of an ultra-thin graphene barrier film with conventional semiconductor photocathode growth processes is not straightforward. A first step toward addressing this challenge is the growth and characterization of technologically relevant, high quantum efficiency bialkali photocathodes grown on ultra-thin free-standing graphene substrates. Photocathode growth on free-standing graphene provides the opportunity to integrate these two materials and study their interaction.

40|$|High quantum {{efficiency}} (QE) photocathodes {{are useful for}} many accelerator applications requiring high brightness electron beams, but suffer from short operational lifetime due to QE decay. For most photocathodes, the decrease in QE is primarily attributed {{to the loss of}} a cesium layer at the photocathode surface during operation. The development of robust, long life, high QE <b>photoemitters</b> is critically needed for applications demanding high brightness electron sources. To that end, a controlled porosity dispenser (CPD) photocathode is currently being explored and developed to replace the cesium during operation and increase photocathode lifetime. A theoretical model of cesium resupply, diffusion, and evaporation on the surface of a sintered wire CPD photocathode is developed to understand and optimize the performance of future controlled porosity photocathodes.

40|$|Laser-switched <b>photoemitters</b> are {{a source}} of {{electrons}} for high current applications such as free electron lasers. Laser-modulated photoemission permits rapid switching of the electron beam, far surpassing what can be achieved using electric-field gated emission. Photoinjector systems consist of a drive laser producing short bunches of photons and an efficient photocathode, which converts photon bunches into electron beam pulses. Development of both technologies is required, but the scope of this project is restricted to improvement of the photocathode. Most high-efficiency photocathodes employ cesium-based surface coatings to reduce work function and enable efficient electron emission in the visible range. Lifetime is severely limited by the loss of this delicate coating, which degrades rapidly in practical vacuum environments. More robust photocathodes exist, but have much lower efficiency, and place unrealistic demands on drive laser power and stability. This research proposes a novel dispenser concept that dramatically extends the lifetime of high efficiency cesium-based cathodes by continuously or periodically restoring the cesium surface monolayer during an in situ rejuvenation process. Sintered tungsten provides an interface between a cesium reservoir and the photoemitting surface. During temperature-controlled rejuvenation, cesium diffuses through and across the sintered tungsten to create and sustain a low-work function photocathode. The prototype dispenser cathode was fabricated and tested for two modes of operation: continuous and periodic near-room temperature rejuvenation. The data are compared with a photoemission model of partially covered surfaces under design for integration with existing beam simulations. Overall performance suggests that this cesium-delivery mechanism can significantly enhance the efficiency and operational lifetime {{of a wide variety of}} present and future cesium-based photocathodes. Also reported are surface characterization, ion beam cleaning, and fabrication techniques used to optimize performance of the dispenser photocathode...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{of large}} (km scale) {{electron}} accelerators (used for high energy physics experiments and as x-ray sources) {{as well as}} small (m scale) ultra-fast electron diffraction setups {{is limited by the}} source of electrons. Low energy (< 1 eV) electrons obtained using visible light from III-V semiconductors activated to negative electron affinity (NEA) are essential for many of these applications. Much of the physics behind the photoemission of electrons from such semiconductors is not well understood. A good understanding of this photoemission will enable design of novel materials that will have enhanced photoemission properties to improve the performance of the fore-mentioned applications. This thesis presents our theoretical, computational and experimental advances to achieve greater understanding of the photoemission process and their application to develop novel III-V semiconductor based structures that enhance photoemission properties. First, using Monte Carlo based electron transport in conjunction with the three step photoemission model, we develop a photoemission simulation that explains the experimentally observed photoemission properties of NEA III-V <b>photoemitters.</b> Based on this simulation, novel layered III-V semiconductors have been designed and grown using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to enhance photoemission characteristics. Second, we identify and discuss the various possible causes of the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted and experimentally observed energy distributions. Effects of surface roughness and work-function non-uniformities at various length scales have been explored in detail. Ab-initio calculations using density functional theory are used to obtain properties of the photoemitting surface of GaAs based photocathodes and explore possible reasons behind surface non-uniformities. Last, to improve photoemission diagnostics, a 2 -D electron energy analyzer, which is capable of measuring the longitudinal (along the surface normal) and transverse (perpendicular to the surface normal) energy distributions simultaneously, has been designed and built. This energy analyzer uses the motion of low energy electrons in a strong magnetic field along with the principle of adiabatic invariance to measure the energy distribution of electrons with a resolution better than 6 meV rms. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Synchrotron x-ray {{radiation}} sources have revolutionized {{many areas of}} science from elucidating the atomic structure of proteins to understanding the electronic structure of complex materials such as the cuprate superconductors. These advances have been possible {{because of the high}} brightness of synchrotron radiation. This high brightness comes from the very small size and divergence of the electron beam, and the interference of light produced by transverse acceleration of the beam in the periodic magnetic structures in the straight sections of a storage ring. The radiation produced is however a sum over the emission from individual electrons as there is no phase relationship between the positions of each electron; the emission therefore scales as the number of electrons. In a Free Electron Laser (FEL), the main difference to the synchrotron radiation mechanism is that the light field acts on the electron beam, over a long distance in an undulator, and causes electron bunching at the optical wavelength. Electrons {{in different parts of the}} electron bunch are therefore correlated, and so emit coherently, with a brightness that scales as the square of the number of electrons. This coherent emission process results in the FEL having a brightness typically 10 orders of magnitude higher than a synchrotron radiation source. Although the FEL concept has been around since the mid 1970 's, only within the last few months has the world's first x-ray FEL lased. This FEL, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), produces x-rays up to an energy of around 8. 5 keV. A much lower energy FEL (FLASH) capable of operation to a few 100 eV started to operate at the DESY laboratory several years ago. In order to lase, the electron beam in a FEL must have a transverse geometric emittance less than the wavelength of the light to be produced. For the generation of x-ray wavelengths, this is one of the most difficult challenges in the design and construction of a FEL. The geometric emittance can be "compressed" by acceleration to very high energy, but with the penalty of very large physical size and very large cost. The motivation for this work was provided by the desire to investigate the fundamental origin of the emittance of an electron beam as it is born at a photocathode. If this initial, or "thermal" emittance can be reduced, the energy, scale and cost of accelerators potentially would be reduced. As the LCLS used copper as its photocathode, this material was the one studied in this work. Copper was used in the LCLS as it represented a "robust" material that could stand the very high accelerating gradients used in the photoinjector of the FEL. Metals are also prompt <b>photoemitters,</b> and so can be used to produce very short electron bunches. This can be a useful property for creation of extremely short FEL pulses, and also for creation of beams that are allowed to expand under space charge forces, but in a way that results in linear fields, allowing subsequent recompression. An ideal photocathode for FEL photoinjector should have high quantum efficiency (QE), small emittance, fast temporal response, long lifetime, and minimal complexity. High QE of cathodes require less power for driving laser and also reduce the risk of damaging the cathode materials. Small emittance reduce the scale of the accelerator, therefore, the cost. Metal photocathodes such as copper exhibit long lifetime and fast response, but have quite low quantum efficiency (< 10 ^- 4). The aim in this work was to understand the quantum yield of the metal, and the transverse momentum spectrum, as the product of the latter and the cathode beam spot size gives the transverse emittance. Initial x-ray diffraction work provided evidence that the LCLS photocathode consisted of large low index single crystal grains, and so work focused on the study of single crystals that could be produced with atomically ordered surfaces, rather than a polycrystalline material. Present theories of quantum yield and transverse emittance assume the basic premise that the metal is entirely disordered, and work here shows that this is fundamentally incorrect, and that the order of the surface plays a critical role in determining the characteristics of emission. In order to investigate these surfaces, I constructed a laser - based ultra-low energy angle resolved photoemission system, capable of measuring the momentum spectrum of the emission and wavelength and angle dependent electron yield. This system has been commissioned, and data taken on low index surfaces of copper. Results from this work on single crystal copper demonstrates that emitted electrons from the band structure of a material can exhibit small emittance and high quantum efficiency. We show that the emission from the Cu(111) surface state is highly correlated between angle of incidence and excitation energy. This manifests itself in the form of a truncated emission cone, rather than the isotropic emission predicted from the normal model. This clearly then reduces the emittance from the normal values. It also results in extremely strong polarization dependence, with p-s asymmetry of up to 16 at low photon energy. It also directly suggests ways through changing materials, or by material design to significantly reduce emittance, at the same time increasing electron yield. These results show the benefits that could be gained from electronic engineering of cathodes and should have direct impact in the design of future FEL photoinjectors...|$|R
