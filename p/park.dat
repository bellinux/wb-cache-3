40|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas, <b>parking</b> management influences drivers {{search time}} and cost for <b>parking</b> spaces, <b>parking</b> revenue, and traffic congestion. The wide deployment of wireless <b>parking</b> meters with sensing and communications capabilities allows the <b>parking</b> authority {{to monitor the}} state of each <b>parking</b> space in real time and optimize the <b>parking</b> management. In this thesis, we study state-of-the-art <b>parking</b> policies in smart <b>parking</b> systems, and show that the smart <b>parking</b> system needs to be 2 ̆ 2 smarter 2 ̆ 2. Our design goals of the smart <b>parking</b> systems include: (1) simplify the operations of <b>parking</b> systems, (2) improve drivers 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction, (3) increase <b>parking</b> revenue, and (4) alleviate traffic congestion. Through analysis and simulations, we first show that the proposed reservation-based <b>parking</b> policy {{has the potential to}} achieve the above goals. We then model the behavior of both service providers and drivers in smart <b>parking</b> systems, and explore the dynamic pricing scheme to achieve the goals in smart <b>parking</b> system design. Furthermore, we design and implement a prototype of Reservation-based Smart <b>Parking</b> System (RSPS) that allows drivers to effectively find and reserve the vacant <b>parking</b> spaces. With the real time tracking of <b>parking</b> status via various sensing technologies, a smart <b>parking</b> system will dynamically update the <b>parking</b> price according to the physical <b>parking</b> status, and the <b>parking</b> price will affect drivers decision on <b>parking</b> slot selection, therefore, affect the <b>parking</b> status. A smart <b>parking</b> system can be regarded as a full-fledged cyber-physical system (CPS).

40|$|Current {{debates on}} {{downtown}} <b>parking</b> policy have been concentrating on downtown <b>parking</b> pricing, while overlooking downtown <b>parking</b> capacity.

In the second-best optimum where curbside <b>parking</b> is underpriced, cruising for <b>parking</b> occurs only when both curbside and garage <b>parking</b> are both present.

40|$|Different {{types of}} drivers and <b>parking</b> spaces {{delineate}} a heterogeneous <b>parking</b> market {{for which the}} literature has yet to provide a model applicable to the real world. The main obstacle is computational complexities of considering various <b>parking</b> restrictions along with traffic congestion on the road network. In this study, the heterogeneity aspects are considered within a Logit <b>parking</b> choice model. A mathematical programming problem was introduced to explicitly consider <b>parking</b> capacities and <b>parking</b> rationing constraints. The <b>parking</b> rationing is defined as any arrangement to reserve <b>parking</b> space for some specific demand such as <b>parking</b> permit, private <b>parking,</b> VIP <b>parking,</b> and different <b>parking</b> durations. Introduction of <b>parking</b> rationing {{in the presence of}} other constraints is a unique factor in this study which makes the model more realistic. The algorithm was tested on a central business district case study. The results prove that the algorithm is able to converge rapidly. Among the algorithm’s output are shadow prices of the <b>parking</b> capacity and <b>parking</b> rationing constraints. The shadow prices contain important information which is key to addressing a variety of <b>parking</b> issues, such as the location of <b>parking</b> shortages, identification of fair <b>parking</b> charges, viability of <b>parking</b> permits, and the size of reserved <b>parking...</b>|$|R
