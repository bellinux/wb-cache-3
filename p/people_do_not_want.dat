25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E
25|$|D. sylvestris is {{generally}} not considered a pest {{despite the fact that}} it is widespread in many regions and lives in urban areas nesting in areas such as the ground, in hedges, or hanging from eaves of houses. This is mostly due to the fact that this species of wasp does not like to enter buildings and is not interested in the types of food that are consumed by humans. It normally is not a problem around humans unless it builds a nest where <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> it or where there is risk of children encountering the nest. The tree wasp is not very aggressive compared to other species of wasps, but can sting if it feels its nest is threatened. On the other hand, many of the reported pest problems for wasps in Scotland have been found to be D. sylvestris suggesting that many people do consider it a pest. Whether this was just from the presence of the nest or aggression of the wasps is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{effective}} {{anger management}} techniques include relaxation techniques, monitored breathing exercises, cognitive restructuring and imagery (e.g. Stosny's Healing imagery Explain oneself emphatically what {{and why it}} makes you respond angrily Apply kindness and compassion to self Love oneself Solving the co-morbid problems phases), problem solving, [...] improving communication strategies and interpersonal skills (DEAR MAN & GIVE). Below are specific types of anger management treatment approaches supported by empirical studies.

He also criticized the candidates for prematurely declaring victory. Both Mamboundou and Mba Obame expressed concern that CENAP and the Interior Ministry could produce fraudulent results in Bongo's favor. Mamboundou supporters gathered at the UPG headquarters in Awendje, Libreville, determined to protect the party's polling station reports, while Mba Obame supporters similarly gathered around his home. Late on 2 September, Mamboundou denounced {{the conduct of the}} elections; [...] "It's not just a possibility of fraud. It's fraud pure and simple.

2500|$|If someone {{suspects}} {{they have}} vaginismus, sexual penetration {{is likely to}} remain painful or truly impossible until their vaginismus is addressed. This is a highly frustrating condition, as other people, including doctors, may speculate negatively on the origin or existence of their difficulties. Vaginismus does not mean that someone does not want intercourse or does not love their partner. People with vaginismus may be able to engage in a variety of other sexual activities, as long as penetration is avoided. Sexual partners of vaginismic people may come to believe that vaginismic <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to engage in penetrative sex at all, though this may not be true for most such people. There is currently no indication that vaginismus reduces the sexual drive or arousal of affected people, and as such it is likely that many vaginismic people wish to engage in penetrative sex to the same degree as unaffected people, but are deterred by the pain and emotional distress that accompanies each attempt. Psychological pressure to [...] "perform" [...] sexually or become aroused quickly with a partner can deter the person from future attempts and/or cause their vaginismus to become more severe.|$|E

60|$|It is a {{good rule}} in life never to apologize. The right sort of <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean {{advantage}} of them. Sellers belonged to the latter class. When Annette, meek, penitent, with all her claws sheathed, came to him and grovelled, he forgave her with a repulsive magnanimity which in a less subdued mood would have stung her to renewed pugnacity. As it was, she allowed herself to be forgiven, and retired with a dismal conviction that from now on he would be more insufferable than ever.|$|E
60|$|I {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} of the guests, for I cannot yet believe that <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> me to come exactly when they say they do. I perceived, however, that one other gentleman had come before me, and I was both surprised and delighted to find that this was my acquaintance Mr. Bullion, the Boston banker. He professed as much pleasure at our meeting as I certainly felt; but after a few words he went on talking with Mrs. Strange, while I was left to her mother, an elderly woman of quiet and even timid bearing, who affected me at once as born and bred in a wholly different environment. In fact, every American of the former generation is almost as strange to it in tradition, though not in principle, as I am; and I found myself singularly at home with this sweet lady, who seemed glad of my interest in her. I was taken from her side to be introduced to a lady, {{on the opposite side of}} the room, who said she had been promised my acquaintance by a friend of hers, whom I had met in the mountains--Mr. Twelvemough; did I remember him? She gave a little cry while still speaking, and dramatically stretched her hand towards a gentleman who entered at the moment, and whom I saw to be no other than Mr. Twelvemough himself. As soon as he had greeted our hostess he hastened up to us, and, barely giving himself time to press the still outstretched hand of my companion, shook mine warmly, and expressed the greatest joy at seeing me. He said that he had just got back to town, in a manner, and had not known I was here, till Mrs. Strange had asked him to meet me. There were not a great many other guests, when they all arrived, and we sat down, a party not much larger than at Mrs. Makely's.|$|E

50|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} British rule, Rajputs & many others {{converted}} to Jains, Agarwals, Vaniyas and other religions.
