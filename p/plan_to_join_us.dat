Last time I booked {{a trip to the}} AALS {{meetings}} in New Orleans, Hurricane Katrina wiped out our plans.

50|$|When he {{was eleven}} years old, Cudi's father died of cancer; his passing had a {{significant}} effect on Cudi's personality and subsequently his music.

Cudi studied film at the University of Toledo, dropping out after a year.

2500|$|In {{becoming}} a Member of Parliament, Johnson broke {{his promise to}} Black {{that he would not}} do so while editing The Spectator. Although labelling Johnson as [...] "ineffably duplicitous", Black did not sack him, viewing him as [...] "a capable editor" [...] who [...] "helped promote the magazine and raise its circulation". In Parliament, Johnson was appointed to serve on a standing committee assessing the Proceeds of Crime Bill, although he missed many of its meetings. Despite his credentials as a public speaker, his speeches in the House of Commons were widely deemed lacklustre and lacking in passion, with Johnson later admitting that they were [...] "crap". In his first four years as MP for Henley he attended just over half of the votes in the House of Commons, although by his second term this had declined to 45%. In most cases, he supported the Conservative party line, only rebelling against it five times during this period, when he adopted a more socially liberal attitude than the mainstream party; he for instance voted to repeal Section 28 and supported the Gender Recognition Act 2004. Although initially claiming that he would not do so, he voted in support of the government's <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the <b>US</b> in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and in April 2003 visited occupied Baghdad. By August 2004 he seemingly regretted his decision by supporting calls to impeach Prime Minister Tony Blair {{for his role in the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq and in December 2006 he described the invasion as [...] "a colossal mistake and misadventure" ...|$|R
