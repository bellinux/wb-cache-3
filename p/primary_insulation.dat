The Peary caribou are whiter and relatively small; woodland caribou are darker brown with unique patches of white fur. The Alaskan and barren-ground caribou are greyer than the woodland caribou.

40|$|At higher {{operating}} temperatures, {{the common}} plastic-sheathed pipe system {{cannot be used}} because the maximum permanent temperature sustained by the insulating polyurethane foam is 120 centigrades. Therefore, pipe systems are to be modified and rendered fit {{to be used for}} temperatures up to 160 centigrades in which the polyurethane insulation does not have contact with the pipe through which the medium courses. In imitation of existing pipe systems, four construction types are envisaged which pursue different objectives: a plastic-sheathed pipe with <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> from expanded glass (Jabitherm), a currugated plastic-sheathed pipe with a medium-conducting pipe from copper (Aquawarm), a plastic-sheathed pipe with <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> from mineral fibre (G + H), and a plastic-sheathed pipe with <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> from cement foam (Loegstoer). By means of lengthy shear experiments involving considerable effort, the required long-term shear resistance of Loegstoer and Jabitherm was demonstrated. G + H does not meet the demands on shear resistance laid down in EN 253. Selecting the next higher insulating thickness is the trick for using Aquawarm almost without restriction up to 160 centigrades. The connection technique for a temperature of 160 centigrades does exist, and a 90 -degree bend with <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> of glass wool was developed as a new element and tested. Aquawarm permits to offer inexpensive connection to the primary grid. Its only drawback is its lack of longitudinal water tightness at 160, respectively 150, centigrades (orig.) Das uebliche Kunststoff-Mantelrohrsystem kann bei hoeheren Betriebstemperaturen nicht eingesetzt werden, weil der als Daemmstoff verwendete Polyurethan (PUR) -Schaum nur eine maximale Dauertemperatur von 120 C ertraegt. Daher sollen Rohrsysteme, bei denen kein PUR-Schaum bis an das Mediumrohr heranreicht, modifiziert und fuer die Anwendung bis 160 C ertuechtigt werden. In Anlehnung an vorhandene Rohrsysteme werden dabei vier Baulinien verfolgt, bei denen unterschiedliche Arbeitsziele zu erreichen sind: - KMR mit Primaerdaemmung aus Blaehglas (Jabitherm) - gewelltes KMR mit Mediumrohr aus Kupfer (Aquawarm) -KMR mit Primaerdaemmung aus Mineralfaser (G+H) - KMR mit Primaerdaemmung aus Zementschaum (Loegstoer). In aufwendigen Zeitstand-Scherversuchen konnte die erforderliche Langzeitscherfestigkeit fuer Jabitherm und Loegstoer nachgewiesen werden. G+H erfuellt nicht die Anforderungen aus der EN 253 an die Scherfestigkeit. Aquawarm ist mit dem 'Trick', die naechst groessere Daemmdicke zu verwenden, fast uneingeschraenkt bis 160 C einsetzbar. Die Verbindungstechnik fuer 160 C ist sichergestellt und es wurde als neues Bauteil ein 90 -Bogen mit einer Primaerdaemmung aus Glaswolle entwickelt und im Einsatz erprobt. Mit Aquawarm wurde das Ziel erreicht, kostenguenstige Anschluesse an das Primaernetz anzubieten. Einziger Nachteil ist die fehlende Laengswasserdichtheit bei 160 bzw. 150 C. (orig.)

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{high voltage}} {{connections}} will increasingly be realized using cables {{as it is}} very difficult to get permits for overhead lines. Pirelli and Nuon are continuously improving the design and production of the cables for increased reliability and capacity as well as lower costs. To this end, the present XLPE insulated cable has been optimized using a thinner <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> and lead sheath. The layout of production has been improved to lower manufacturing costs. Cable capacity has been improved by the choice for a thinner lead screen as well as increased use of cross-bonding. A cross-bonding box has been developed that allows capacity to be increased significantly at limited additional costs. The distance protection of cables has been revised to correct the calculation error caused by the return current in the screen. It is shown that adequate correction can be achieved using a real value which depends only on cable characteristics. This considerably eases implementation into new and in existing systems...|$|E

50|$|Current {{transformers}} {{are used}} for protection, measurement and control in high-voltage electrical substations and the electrical grid. Current transformers may be installed inside switchgear or in apparatus bushings, but very often free-standing outdoor current transformers are used. In a switchyard, live tank current transformers have {{a substantial part of}} their enclosure energized at the line voltage and must be mounted on insulators. Dead tank current transformers isolate the measured circuit from the enclosure. Live tank CTs are useful because the primary conductor is short, which gives better stability and a higher short-circuit current rating. The primary of the winding can be evenly distributed around the magnetic core, which gives better performance for overloads and transients. Since the major insulation of a live-tank current transformer is not exposed to the heat of the <b>primary</b> conductors, <b>insulation</b> life and thermal stability is improved.|$|R

Nylon, polysulfide, low/high density polyethylene (LDPE/HDPE) and plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the common and important plastic resin used for wire coating.

The governing equations are first modeled and then solved analytically by utilizing the homotopy analysis method (HAM). The convergence of the series solution is established. A numerical technique called ND-solve method is used for comparison and found good agreement. The effect of pertinent parameters on the velocity field and temperature profile is shown with the help of graphs. It is observed that the velocity profiles increase as the value of viscoelastic third grade parameter β increase and decrease as the magnetic parameter M and permeability parameter K increase.

40|$|Wiring {{is a major}} {{operational}} component on aerospace hardware {{that accounts}} for substantial weight and volumetric space. Over time wire insulation can age and fail, often leading to catastrophic events such as system failure or fire. The next generation of wiring must be reliable and sustainable {{over long periods of}} time. These features will be achieved by the development of a wire insulation capable of autonomous self-healing that mitigates failure before it reaches a catastrophic level. In order to develop a self-healing insulation material, three steps must occur. First, methods of bonding similar materials must be developed that are capable of being initiated autonomously. This process will lead {{to the development of a}} manual repair system for polyimide wire insulation. Second, ways to initiate these bonding methods that lead to materials that are similar to the <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> must be developed. Finally, steps one and two must be integrated to produce a material that has no residues from the process that degrades the insulating properties of the final repaired insulation. The self-healing technology, teamed with the ability to identify and locate damage, will greatly improve reliability and safety of electrical wiring of critical systems. This paper will address these topics, discuss the results of preliminary testing, and remaining development issues related to self-healing wire insulation...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{safety issues}} are {{becoming}} increasingly important in modern society and cables are one potential fire risk since they can start a fire and/or spread one. Traditionally, materials containing halogen {{have been used as}} <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> in low voltage power and telecommunication cables and most cables used today therefore contain halogen. Today, as a result of concern with environmental and safety issues, the focus has recently been on halogen-free materials that perform well in fire situations. Casico&# 61668; is a halogen-free material used as insulation in low voltage applications. Its flame retardant properties have been evaluated in this study, including the flame retardant effect of each individual component of Casico: ethylene-acrylate copolymer, chalk and silicone elastomer. A system based on low density polyethylene, chalk and silicone elastomer {{has been used as a}} comparative material. Small scale fire tests, such as oxygen index and cone calorimetry, and visual and analytical studies, for instance IR, NMR, ESCA and XRD, of the residues left after thermal treatment were carried out. The results show that the Casico system has good flame retardant properties. This is due to different factors, such as dilution with an inert filler, ester pyrolysis of acrylate groups, ionomer formation and formation of an intumescent structure. Special emphasis is placed on the formation of the intumescent structure obtained at 500 &# 61616;C and 1000 &# 61616;C and it is shown that the initially formed structure consists mainly of chalk and silicon dioxide whereas the final structure consists of calcium silicate, calcium oxide and calcium hydroxid...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) {{analysis is}} an important technique for diagnosis and online monitoring of transformer insulation systems. PD within transformer windings {{may be due to}} several causes such as manufacturing defects, degradation of the <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> or contamination of the oil. The degradation processes occurring in dielectric insulation components can lead to development of different types of PD source [1], [2]. Multiple PD sources induced by different defects can be simultaneously present within the transformer winding. Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to separate measurement data from multiple PD sources in order to facilitate separate PD source identification and location to allow accurate condition assessment of the winding. Conventional techniques for multiple PD source separation are based on analysis of the phase resolved PD (PRPD) pattern [3], [4]. However, in the presence of multiple PD sources, PRPD patterns generated by different PD sources can significantly overlap each other [5], [6]. By using PRPD pattern-based techniques, multiple PD sources cannot easily be separated as one PD source can be entirely immersed in the patterns of the other sources. Recently, {{there have been a number}} of techniques reported for separating multiple PD sources such as through the use of support vector machines (SVMs) or artificial neural networks (ANNs) [3], [7]. This paper reports on a technique that relies on an initial assumption that different PD sources generate different waveform characteristics [8]. The measured discharge current signals from both ends of a transformer winding were decomposed using the Mathematical Morphology (MM) decomposition technique. Then, the energy distribution for each signal for each structure element (SE) length of MM was determined. The OPTICS algorithm was then used as a density based clustering technique to reveal different clusters of signals with similar calculated energy distributions. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Electrical treeing is an {{electrical}} aging phenomenon that severely threatens the operation safety of power equipment, in which polymer {{is used as}} <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> material. A type of low-density polyethylene-montmorillonite (LDPE/MMT) nanocomposite was prepared using melt method to study the impact of MMT nanoparticles on {{the growth of the}} electrical tree and on the breakdown properties of the LDPE material. The distribution characteristic of space charges of the specimens under DC voltage of – 50 kV/mm and short-circuit conditions was measured using pulsed electro-acoustic method. The electrical tree aging characteristics of specimens under AC voltage of power frequency were studied using needle-plate electrode structure test platform. The starting voltage of initiation, the triggering rate, and the growth rate of the electrical trees, as well as the breakdown performance of the specimens under AC voltage of power frequency were measured. The inhibitory mechanism of MMT nano-particles on the growth of electrical trees in nano-composites, and the mechanism behind the improvement of the breakdown strength of the LDPE/MMT specimens were illustrated. Experimental results showed that, the addition of MMT can effectively reduce the amount of space charges injected from electrodes and the accumulation amount in the center of samples. Moreover, space charges dissipated more slowly during short-circuit conditions. The speed and the scale of the growth of the electrical tree declined as the initiation conditions of electrical trees growing in LDPE/MMT nanocomposites increased; meanwhile, the breakdown strength increased substantially. Here are the reasons: MMT can reduce the mobility of carriers in LDPE material, thereby contributing to the improvement of the distribution of space charges. In the meanwhile, MMT changed the development path of electrical trees, and extended the discharge distance. Consequently, MMT postponed the occurrence of pene-trable breakdown in the LDPE/MMT specimen, and ultimately improved the breakdown strength of the specimen...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of an online method for the early detection of a stator turn insulation deterioration is {{the objective of the}} research at hand. A high percentage of motor breakdowns is related to the failure of the stator insulation system. Since most of the stator insulation failures originate in the breakdown of the turn-to-turn insulation, the research in this realm is of great significance. Despite the progress that has been made in the field of stator turn fault detection methods, the most popular and the best known ones are still limited to the detection of solid turn faults. The time span between a solid turn fault and the breakdown of the <b>primary</b> <b>insulation</b> system can be as short as a few seconds. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a method capable of detecting the deterioration of the turn insulation as early as possible and prior to the {{development of}} a solid turn fault. The different stresses that cause the aging of the insulation and eventually lead to failure are described as well as the various patterns of an insulation failure. A comprehensive literature survey shows the methods presently used for the monitoring of the turn insulation. Up to now no well-tested and reliable online method that can find the deterioration of the turn insulation is available. The most commonly used turn insulation test is the surge test, which, however, is performed only when the motor is out of service and disconnected from the supply. So far no research at all has been conducted on the application of an online surge test. The research at hand examines the applicability of the surge test to an operating machine. Various topologies of online surge testing are examined with regard to their practicability and their limitations. The most practical configuration is chosen for further analysis, implementation and development. Moreover, practical challenges are presented by the non-idealities of the induction machine like the eccentricity of the rotor and the rotor slotting, and have to be taken into account. Two solutions to eliminate the influence of the rotor position on the surge waveform are presented. Even though the basic concepts of online surge testing can be validated experimentally by a machine with a solid turn fault, it is preferable to use a machine with a deteriorated turn insulation. Therefore, a method, which does not require complex and expensive hardware, to experimentally emulate the turn insulation breakdown is implemented. The concepts at any stage of the work are supported by simulations and experimental results. In addition, the theory of surge testing is further developed by giving new definitions of the test's sensitivity, i. e., the frequency sensitivity and the error area ratio (EAR) sensitivity. Ph. D.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of arc track testing conducted to determine if such a transfer of power to un-energized wires is possible and/or likely during an arcing event, and to evaluate an array of protection schemes that may significantly reduce the possibility of such a transfer. The results of these experiments may be useful for determining the level of protection necessary to guard against spurious voltage and current being applied to safety critical circuits. It was not the purpose of these experiments to determine the probability of the initiation of an arc track event only if an initiation did occur could it cause the undesired event: an inadvertent thruster firing. The <b>primary</b> wire <b>insulation</b> used in the Orbiter is aromatic polyimide, or Kapton, a construction known to arc track under certain conditions [3]. Previous Boeing testing has shown that arc tracks can initiate in aromatic polyimide insulated 28 volts direct current (VDC) power circuits using more realistic techniques such as chafing with an aluminum blade (simulating the corner of an avionics box or lip of a wire tray), or vibration of an aluminum plate against a wire bundle [4]. Therefore, an arc initiation technique was chosen that provided a reliable and consistent technique of starting the arc and not a realistic simulation of a scenario on the vehicle. Once an arc is initiated, the current, power and propagation characteristics of the arc depend on the power source, wire gauge and insulation type, circuit protection and series resistance rather than type of initiation. The initiation method employed for these tests was applying an oil and graphite mixture to the ends of a powered twisted pair wire. The flight configuration of the heater circuits, the fuel/oxider (or ox) wire, and the RCS jet solenoid were modeled in the test configuration so that the behavior of these components during an arcing event could be studied. To determine if coil activation would occur with various protection wire schemes, 145 tests were conducted using various fuel/ox wire alternatives (shielded and unshielded) and/or different combinations of polytetrafuloroethylene (PTFE), Mystik tape and convoluted wraps to prevent unwanted coil activation. Test results were evaluated along with other pertinent data and information to develop a mitigation strategy for an inadvertent RCS firing. The SSP evaluated civilian aircraft wiring failures to search for aging trends in assessing the wire-short hazard.

40|$|Based on a {{theoretical}} perspective, the <b>primary</b> function of <b>insulation</b> oils is to dissipate heat, and {{it serves as}} an insulator in between turn-to-turn windings in power transformers. To date, the majority of power transformer failures is attributed to the physicochemical reaction {{that takes place in}} the insulation oils due to the presence of heat, moisture content, oxidation and electrical stresses. Knowing that moisture content is one of the factors that leads to the degradation of transformer insulation oils, the main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the effects of moisture content on the breakdown voltage and Fourier transform infrared spectral characteristics of transformer insulation oils. Two types of insulation oils are chosen for this study: (1) conventional mineral-based insulation oil and (2) palm oil-based insulation oil which is a relatively new substitute for mineral-based insulation oils in Malaysia. The effects of moisture content is investigated by varying the amount of distilled water added into the oil samples from 1 to 5 ml, with an increment of 1 ml. Breakdown voltage test is conducted six times and the mean breakdown voltage is determined for each oil sample. The spectral characteristics of the oil samples are determined by means of Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The breakdown voltage test and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry is carried out in accordance with the MS IEC 60156 : 2012 and ASTM D 2144 standards, ensuring the reliability of the test procedures. Based on the findings of the study, it can be concluded that moisture content has a significant effect on the breakdown voltage and spectral characteristics of mineral and palm oil-based insulation oils - however, the effect is more pronounced for the mineral oil samples. Analysis of the Fourier transform infrared spectra reveals that the chemical composition of PFAE oil samples is not significantly influenced by moisture content and thus, this oil is a promising alternative for use as insulation oil in power transformers...|$|R
