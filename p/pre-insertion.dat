5000|$|Buzz Dixon - Originally a StormWatch reservist, the {{creature}} known as Buzz Dixon was later recruited by Colonel Benito Santini as his chief scout and gatherer of difficult-to-get {{information on the}} Achilles team. Dixon handles {{nearly all of the}} team's recon work as Team Achilles' scouting specialist and primary intel-gatherer. He is often the first on the field, as he reconnoiters mission targets and locations <b>pre-insertion.</b> Buzz Dixon is a quadrupedal being possessing compound eyes, large, fan-shaped ears, and chameleon-like skin that allows him to become nearly invisible. Due to his unique optical, olfactory, and auditory physiology, Dixon possesses super-human senses. He also has a [...] "sixth sense" [...] in the form of low-grade telepathy (He can mentally [...] "speak" [...] in others' heads and receive thoughts, but generally only if they are nearby.). Further, Buzz Dixon can cling to walls with the sucker-like pads on the bottoms of his feet, and he possesses a prehensile tail. Despite his completely inhuman appearance, Dixon's personality suggests that he is human, or at least possesses a psyche very much like human beings. He is loud-mouthed, boisterous, swears quite a bit (he is partial to [...] "fuck"), uses current slang, and has the sort of stereotypical mannerisms of a cowboy-type or jarhead-type character. Due to his personality and human name, {{it can be argued that}} Buzz Dixon is a super-powered meta-human who was once human, but whose powers are manifest through a strange physiology that also stripped him altogether of his human appearance. However, he shows no distress over his esoteric physiology. Dixon had very little [...] "screen time" [...] in the StormWatch: Team Achilles series, and his origins can only be conjectured.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pre-insertion</b> preparation: After {{reaching}} the nucleus, mtDNA has {{to enter the}} nuclear genome. The rate of mtDNA incorporation into the nuclear genome {{can be expected to}} depend on the DSB number in nDNA, the activity of DSB repair systems, and the rate of mtDNA escape from organelles. MtDNA insertion comprises three main processes, shown in figure 2; first, the mtDNA has to have the proper form and sequence; in other words, the mtDNA has to be edited which gives a rise to the new edited site in the polynucleotide structure. Mitochondrial DNA is not universal and, in animals similar to plants, mitochondrial editing shows very erratic patterns of taxon-specific occurrence. As shown in figure 2, there are three possible ways that mtDNA can become prepared to be inserted into the nuclear DNA. The process mainly depends on the time mtDNA transfers into the nucleus. [...] As shown in figure 2b, direct integration of unedited mtDNA fragments into the nuclear genomes is the most plausible and the evidence both found in plants, Arabidopsis genome, and animals with the help of different methods, including BLAST-based analysis. In this case, mtDNA is transferred into the nucleus whereby editing and introns arise in the mitochondrion later. If a gene, for instance, was transferred to the nucleus in one lineage before mitochondrial editing evolved, but remained in the organelle in other lineages where editing arose, the nuclear copy would appear more similar to an edited transcript than to the remaining mitochondrial copies at the edited sites. Another represented and less supported model, figure 2a, is the cDNA-mediated model, which intron-contained mtDNA enters the nucleus and by reverse transcription of spliced and edited mitochondrial transcript, it becomes integrated into the nDNA. The third proposed mechanism is the direct transfer and integration of intronless mtDNA into the nucleus, figure 2c, whereby editing and introns in the mitochondrion come and go during evolution. In this case, the introduction and removal of the intron, as well as, reverse transcription occur within mitochondria and the final product, the edited intronless mtDNA, will integrate into nDNA after being transferred into the nucleus.|$|E

40|$|The Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) is a {{two-armed}} robot that {{functions as}} an extension to the end effector of the Space Station Robotics Manipulator System (SSRMS), currently in use on the International Space Station (ISS). Crew training for the SPDM is accomplished using a robotic hardware simulator, which performs most of SPDM functions under normal static Earth gravitational forces. Both the simulator and SPDM are controlled from a standard robotic workstation using a laptop for the user interface and three monitors for camera views. Most operations anticipated for the SPDM involve the manipulation, insertion, and removal of any of several types of Orbital Replaceable Unit (ORU), modules which control various ISS functions. Alignment tolerances for insertion of the ORU into its receptacle are 0. 25 inch and 0. 5 degree from nominal values. The <b>pre-insertion</b> alignment task must be performed within these tolerances by using available video camera views of the intrinsic features of the ORU and receptacle, without special registration markings. Since optimum camera views may not be available, and dynamic orbital lighting conditions may limit periods of viewing, a successful ORU insertion operation may require {{an extended period of}} time. This study explored the feasibility of using augmented reality (AR) to assist SPDM operations.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} how a benzo[a]pyrene-derived N 2 -dG adduct, 10 S(+) -trans-anti-[BP]-N 2 -dG ([BP]G*), is processed in a well-characterized Pol I family model replicative DNA polymerase, Bacillus fragment (BF). Experimental {{results are presented}} that reveal relatively facile nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion, but very inefficient further extension. Computational studies follow the possible bypass of [BP]G* through the <b>pre-insertion,</b> insertion and post-insertion sites as BF alternates between open and closed conformations. With dG* in the normal B-DNA anti conformation, BP seriously disturbs the polymerase structure, positioning itself either deeply in the <b>pre-insertion</b> site or on the crowded evolving minor groove side of the modified template, consistent with a polymerase-blocking conformation. With dG* in the less prevalent syn conformation, BP causes less distortion: it is either out of the <b>pre-insertion</b> site or in the major groove open pocket of the polymerase. Thus, the syn conformation can account for the observed relatively easy incorporation of nucleotides, with mutagenic purines favored, opposite the [BP]G* adduct. However, with the lesion in the BF post-insertion site, more serious distortions caused by the adduct even in the syn conformation explain the very inefficient extension observed experimentally. In vivo, a switch to a potentially error-prone bypass polymerase likely dominates translesion bypass...|$|E

The {{intention}} of this dissertation is to determine, on the Eskom system, if the <b>pre-insertion</b> closing resistors {{installed on the}} Alpha-Beta 765 kV line breakers are preventing overvoltages from being caused during auto-reclosing. Other possible solutions of reclosing protection are investigated. It has been shown on two occasions, from actual field data that overvoltages have occurred on the lines after reclosing. High overvoltages on this network could {{be the cause of}} the many reactor failures that have occurred. A mathematical model of the Alpha-Beta 765 kV system was produced on Matlab/Simulink to simulate the resonance of the line during opening and then the effect on the voltage when reclosing takes place. The effects of installing <b>pre-insertion</b> resistors to reduce overvoltages on reclosing were analysed, as well as looking at controlled reclosing at the optimal voltage across the line breakers. It was shown from the studies, that <b>pre-insertion</b> resistors do limit the overvoltages to within the surge capabilities of the line (10 % overvoltage) and that the cause of the previous overvoltages were actually due to insertion resistor operations failure. It was also shown that the method of controlled closing at optimal voltage across the breakers is also a successful method of preventing overvoltages.

Methods: femoral artery interposition grafts with internal jugular vein were inserted in 12 mongrel dogs. The animals were randomly divided into two groups. Immediately before graft replacement, jugular veins were treated with a single dose of cobalt- 60 radiation at 14 Gy or received no radiation (control group). Six weeks after graft insertion, the vein grafts were pressure-perfusion fixed and harvested for the histomorphometric analysis. Quantitative data on anastomotic stenosis were calculated from Gilman parameters after cross-sectional image analysis. Results: vein grafts treated with radiation demonstrated significantly decreased neointima formation compared with grafts in the control group.

40|$|AbstractThe RNA {{polymerase}} (RNAP) of bacteriophage T 7 is {{a single}} subunit enzyme that can transcribe DNA to RNA {{in the absence of}} additional protein factors. In this work, we present a model of T 7 RNAP translocation during elongation. Based on structural information and experimental data from single-molecule force measurements, we show that a small component of facilitated translocation or power stroke coexists with the Brownian-ratchet-driven motions, and plays a crucial role in nucleotide selection at <b>pre-insertion.</b> The facilitated translocation is carried out by the conserved Tyr 639 that moves its side chain into the active site, pushing aside the 3 ′-end of the RNA, and forming a locally stabilized post-translocation intermediate. <b>Pre-insertion</b> of an incoming nucleotide into this stabilized intermediate state ensures that Tyr 639 closely participates in selecting correct nucleotides. A similar translocation mechanism has been suggested for multi-subunit RNAPs involving the bridge-helix bending. Nevertheless, the bent bridge-helix sterically prohibits nucleotide binding in the post-transolocation intermediate analog; moreover, the analog is not stabilized unless an inhibitory protein factor binds to the enzyme. Using our scheme, we also compared the efficiencies of different strategies for nucleotide selection, and examined effects of facilitated translocation on forward tracking...|$|E

Changes in 2 AP fluorescence intensity provided a spectroscopic reporter of the nucleotide binding reactions, which were combined with rapid-quench, pre-steady state reactions to measure product formation. These studies supported and extended previous findings that the T 4 DNA polymerase binds nucleotides in multiple steps with increasing selectivity. With 2 AP in the template position, initial dTTP binding was rapid, but selective: Kd(dTTP) 1 st step = 31 μM, Kd(dCTP) 1 st step ≈ 3 mM.

40|$|M. Tech. Abstract: Point on wave {{switching}} {{has been}} used extensively for shunt capacitor bank switching. This is due to its ability to switch capacitor banks on-line at the zero crossing of the voltage waveform, which {{in the case of}} a mechanically linked circuit breaker will be achieved by staggering the links 120 electrical degrees. The use of point on wave switching using a 3 -phase mechanically linked SF 6 circuit breaker has been found to be unreliable as a result of drift in the mechanical linkages when the circuit breaker continues to operate. Due to this drifting of the mechanical linkages, circuit breakers ultimately switch beyond the zero crossing, thus generating undesired transient voltage. This work is based on an investigation carried out on 132 kV eThekwini Municipality Substation in Durban North, where the capacitor bank recorded a high unbalance within six months of commissioning. The capacitor bank was consequently isolated from the system as a result of unbalance. The data used in this work is sourced from on-site measurements and recordings using ImpedoGraph units with recordings over a seven-day period, where transient voltage of up 102 kV are observed, resulting in transients of 1. 18 p. u. Simulation runs were conducted using the Electromagnetic transient program, the simulation results observed at peak voltage is 124. 4 kV at resulting in transients of up to 1. 6 p. u. Both the on-site measurements and simulation test results showed that the circuit breaker’s mechanical linkages had drifted and caused these devices to switch on beyond the zero crossing of the voltage waveform.

Operators for this system are trained at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) using a robotic simulator, the Dexterous Manipulator Trainer (DMT), which performs most SPDM functions under normal static Earth gravitational forces. The SPDM is controlled from a standard Robotic Workstation. A key feature of the SPDM and DMT is the Force/Moment Accommodation (FMA) system, which limits the contact forces and moments acting on the robot components, on its payload, an Orbital Replaceable Unit (ORU), and on the receptacle for the ORU. The FMA system helps to automatically alleviate any binding of the ORU as it is inserted or withdrawn from a receptacle, but it is limited in its correction capability. A successful ORU insertion generally requires that the reference axes of the ORU and receptacle be aligned to within approximately 0. 25 inch and 0. 5 degree of nominal values. The only guides available for the operator to achieve these alignment tolerances are views from any available video cameras. No special registration markings are provided on the ORU or receptacle, so the operator must use their intrinsic features in the video display to perform the <b>pre-insertion</b> alignment task. Since optimum camera views may not be available, and dynamic orbital lighting conditions may limit viewing periods, long times are anticipated for performing some ORU insertion or extraction operations. This study explored the feasibility of using augmented reality (AR) to assist with SPDM operations. Geometric graphical symbols were overlaid on the end effector (EE) camera view to afford cues to assist the operator in attaining adequate <b>pre-insertion</b> ORU alignment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — an {{inrush current}} is a {{transient}} current with high amplitude that may {{occurs when a}} transformer is energized under no load or lightly loaded conditions. The magnitude of inrush current may {{be as high as}} several times of transformer rated current. The magnitude of inrush current depends upon leakage reactance, source strength, impendence of winding, residual flux. Inrush current causes huge mechanical and thermal stress on transformer in addition to inadvertent operation of the protective relay systems. The conventional method like <b>pre-insertion</b> of resistor, point on wave is used to minimize the inrush current. Inrush current in transformer can be reduced by selecting appropriate switching angle with respect to the remnant flux. In this paper dynamic modeling of transformer is used for detailed analysis of the inrush current and the effect of switching angle on the magnitude of inrush current is observed. Index Terms—Dynamic modeling, switching transient...|$|E

A random, unloaded transformer energizatinn leads to high inrush currents and voltage disturbances, which can cause unnecessary operations of protection relays and impose mechanical stresses to the transformer windings. Situations have been reported, whereby intensive anda repetitive inrush currents enen caused a thermal explosion of a power transformer. A conventional solution for these issues it to apply a per-insertion resistor. However, the application of a <b>pre-insertion</b> resistor and especially its maintenance are cost intensive and therefore, investigations on controlled transformer core after an unloaded transformer de-energization. First field experiences could br obtained in the year 2004 / 2005. This papaer shows state of the art techniques of actual controlled systems and proposese new research items...|$|E
40|$|Proximal {{migration}} of the distal {{end of a}} ventriculoperitoneal shunt has been observed much more rarely than other numerous shunt-related complications. Subgaleal {{migration of}} the peritoneal end {{is one of the}} samples. In the preset report we have discussed a case of subgaleal migration of the peritoneal end detected {{as a result of the}} examinations performed for shunt dysfunction. There was ventricular dilatation on CT scan of the brain. X-ray examinations confirmed proper ventricular catheter and shunt valve placement but a complete migration of distal (peritoneal) catheter into the subgaleal space. Then the patient’s shunt was revised. When our case and the literature were examined, we observed that this complication was frequently encountered during the first postoperative months, in the pediatric ages and in patients with advanced hydrocephalus. Besides, we have detected that the peritoneal catheters had tendency to migration into the subgaleal tissues similar to <b>pre-insertion</b> forms of the preoperatively original packages...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveOne of the {{alternative}} methods in managing patients for endo-tracheal intubation is the Bonfils fiberscope. We studied the efficacy of Bonfils fiberscope {{in comparison to the}} classical laryngoscope with Macintosh blade inhemodynamic, serum catecholamine and intra-ocular pressure responses. MethodsIn a prospective, randomized trial 40 patients ASA I or II aged ⩾ 18 years scheduled for gynecological, urinary and lower abdominal procedures in supine position were randomly allocated to one of two groups; 20 patients each; according to intubating device by using either Macintosh laryngoscope (L) group or Bonfils Intubation Endoscopes (B) group. Pre-induction (baseline) and <b>pre-insertion</b> values of HR, MAP, IOP and blood samples for catecholamine level were recorded and repeated at 1, 3, and 5 min after intubation. ResultsThere was significant increase in HR, MAP, IOP and catecholamine level in L group at 1, 3, and 5 min after intubation. ConclusionBonfils laryngoscope had superiority over Macintosh as a method of intubation in situations where minimal changes in hemodynamic, catecholamine level and intraocular pressure are desirable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} robotically {{assisted}} prostate brachytherapy system and test results in training phantoms. The system {{consists of a}} transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and a spatially co-registered robot integrated with an FDA-approved commercial treatment planning system. The salient feature {{of the system is}} a small parallel robot affixed to the mounting posts of the template. The robot replaces the template interchangeably and uses the same coordinate system. Established clinical hardware, workflow and calibration are left intact. In these experiments, we recorded the first insertion attempt without adjustment. All clinically relevant locations were reached. Non-parallel needle trajectories were achieved. The <b>pre-insertion</b> transverse and rotational errors (measured with Polaris optical tracker relative to the template’s coordinate frame) were 0. 25 mm (STD= 0. 17 mm) and 0. 75 o (STD= 0. 37 o). The needle tip placement errors measured in TRUS were 1. 04 mm (STD= 0. 50 mm). The system is in Phase-I clinical feasibility and safety trials, under Institutional Review Board approval. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{demonstrated}} {{the importance of}} PEGylation timing of galactosylated liposome/plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexes (lipoplexes) for liver-selective transfection in mice. Because a fenestrated endothelium can be a barrier for penetration of lipoplexes though sinusoids, the particle size of lipoplexes {{is one of the}} determining factors for in vivo liver parenchymal cell (hepatocyte, PC) -selective transfection. Here, we found that syn-insertion, as a novel PEGylation timing, was useful to control the particle size of galactosylated lipoplexes. Syn-insertion of PEGylated lipids was performed by simple mixing of pDNA solution containing PEGylated lipids and dispersion of the cationic liposomes. Both syn- and <b>pre-insertion</b> of PEGylated lipids decreased the particle size of lipoplexes, whereas post-insertion did not. Moreover, syn-insertion of PEGylated lipids to galactosylated lipoplexes improved liver selectivity and the PC/non-parenchymal cell ratio of transgene expression after intravenous injection in mice. Hence, these data will be valuable for the design and preparation of PEGylated lipoplexes for gene targeting...|$|E
