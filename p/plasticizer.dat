25|$|Inclusion of <b>plasticizers</b> {{tends to}} lower Tg and {{increase}} polymer flexibility. <b>Plasticizers</b> are generally small molecules that are chemically {{similar to the}} polymer and create gaps between polymer chains for greater mobility and reduced interchain interactions. A {{good example of the}} action of <b>plasticizers</b> is related to polyvinylchlorides or PVCs. An uPVC, or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, is used for things such as pipes. A pipe has no <b>plasticizers</b> in it, because it needs to remain strong and heat-resistant. Plasticized PVC is used in clothing for a flexible quality. <b>Plasticizers</b> are also put in some types of cling film to make the polymer more flexible.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The use of {{mixtures}} of nontoxic and biodegradable <b>plasticizers</b> coming from natural resources {{is a good}} way to replace conventional phthalates <b>plasticizers.</b> In this study, two secondary <b>plasticizers</b> of epoxidized sunflower oil (ESO) and epoxidized sunflower oil methyl ester (ESOME) were synthesized and have been used with two commercially available biobased plasticizers; isosorbide diesters (ISB) and acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) in order to produce flexible PVC. Different {{mixtures of}} these <b>plasticizers</b> have been introduced in PVC formulations. Thermal, mechanical and morphological properties have been studied by using discoloration, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), tensile - strain and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

25|$|PVC is a common, {{strong but}} {{lightweight}} plastic used in construction. It is made softer and more flexible {{by the addition}} of <b>plasticizers.</b> If no <b>plasticizers</b> are added, it is known as uPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride) or rigid PVC.|$|R
50|$|Crystalline {{deposits}} or liquid-filled bubbles {{appear on}} the emulsion.

25|$|Chewing gum is a soft, {{cohesive}} substance {{designed to}} be chewed without being swallowed. Modern chewing gum is composed of gum base, sweeteners, softeners/ plasticizers, flavors, colors, and, typically, a hard or powdered polyol coating. Its texture is reminiscent of rubber because of the physical-chemical properties of its polymer, <b>plasticizer,</b> and resin components, which contribute to its elastic-plastic, sticky, chewy characteristics.|$|E
25|$|It's {{important}} to check {{whether there are}} any undesired interactions between the preparation and the container. For instance, if a plastic container is used, tests are carried out to see whether any of the ingredients become adsorbed on to the plastic, and whether any <b>plasticizer,</b> lubricants, pigments, or stabilizers leach out of the plastic into the preparation. Even the adhesives for the container label need to be tested, to ensure they do not leach through the plastic container into the preparation.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePhthalates are {{the most}} {{important}} <b>plasticizers</b> used in the polymer industry. However, their fossil origin and the results of recent tests showing their potential negative effect on human health have encouraged the polymer industry to turn toward non-phthalate <b>plasticizers.</b> At the same time, the biodiesel industry produces a surplus of glycerol, thus leading the scientific community to seek new applications for this substance. This paper presents the performance of eight esters derived from glycerol as <b>plasticizers</b> for poly(vinyl chloride), including tests to evaluate their compatibility. Results show that glycerol esters obtained from propanoic, butanoic, isobutanoic, isopentanoic, and benzoic acids, while volatile, can be used as poly(vinyl chloride) <b>plasticizers</b> in certain application...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue {{to their}} versatility, robustness, and low {{production}} costs, plastics {{are used in}} a wide variety of applications. <b>Plasticizers</b> are mixed with polymers to increase flexibility of plastics. However, <b>plasticizers</b> are not covalently bound to plastics, and thus leach from products into the environment. Several studies have reported that two common <b>plasticizers,</b> bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, induce adverse health effects in vertebrates; however few studies have addressed their toxicity to non-mammalian species. The aim of this review is to compare the effects of <b>plasticizers</b> in animals, with a focus on aquatic species. In summary, we identified three main chains of events that occur in animals exposed to BPA and phthalates. Firstly, <b>plasticizers</b> affect development by altering both the thyroid hormone and growth hormone axes. Secondly, these chemicals interfere with reproduction by decreasing cholesterol transport through the mitochondrial membrane, leading to reduced steroidogenesis. Lastly, exposure to <b>plasticizers</b> leads to the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, the increase of fatty acid oxidation, and the reduction in the ability to cope with the augmented oxidative stress leading to reproductive organ malformations, reproductive defects, and decreased fertility...|$|R
25|$|Phthalates, {{which are}} {{incorporated}} into plastics as plasticizers, comprise approximately 70% of the U.S. <b>plasticizer</b> market; phthalates are by design not covalently bound to the polymer matrix, which makes them highly susceptible to leaching. Phthalates are contained in plastics at high percentages. For example, they can contribute up to 40% by weight to intravenous medical bags and up to 80% by weight in medical tubing. Vinyl products are pervasive—including toys, car interiors, shower curtains, and flooring—and initially release chemical gases into the air. Some studies indicate that this outgassing of additives may contribute to health complications, and {{have resulted in a}} call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. Japanese car companies Toyota, Nissan, and Honda eliminated the use of PVC in car interiors since 2007.|$|E
25|$|Of all aldehydes, {{formaldehyde}} {{is produced}} on the largest scale, about 6,000,000 tons per year. It is mainly {{used in the}} production of resins when combined with urea, melamine, and phenol (e.g., Bakelite). It is a precursor to methylene diphenyl diisocyanate ("MDI"), a precursor to polyurethanes. The second main aldehyde is butyraldehyde, of which about 2,500,000 tons per year are prepared by hydroformylation. It is the principal precursor to 2-ethylhexanol, which is used as a <b>plasticizer.</b> Acetaldehyde once was a dominating product, but production levels have declined to less than 1,000,000 tons per year because it mainly served as a precursor to acetic acid, which is now prepared by carbonylation of methanol. Many other aldehydes find commercial applications, often as precursors to alcohols, the so-called oxo alcohols, which are used in detergents. Some aldehydes are produced only on a small scale (less than 1000 tons per year) and are famously used as ingredients in flavours and perfumes such as N°5 from CHANEL. These include cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives, citral, and lilial.|$|E

DEX-COOL antifreeze uses two inhibitors: sebacate and 2-EHA (2-ethylhexanoic acid), the latter which works well with the hard water found in the United States, but is a <b>plasticizer</b> that can cause gaskets to leak.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn recent years, much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} research to replace petroleum-based commodity plastics, in a cost-effective manner, with biodegradable materials offering competitive mechanical properties. Biopolymers have been considered as the most promising materials for this purpose. However, they generally present poor mechanical properties regarding processability and end-use application, since the fragility and brittleness exhibited during thermoformation can limit their potential for application. In order to overcome this problem, <b>plasticizers</b> are added to provide the necessary workability to biopolymers. This class of products became more visible when biodegradable additives and <b>plasticizers</b> also became the focus of material scientists. The use of natural and/or biodegradable <b>plasticizers,</b> with low toxicity and good compatibility with several plastics, resins, rubber and elastomers in substitution of conventional <b>plasticizers,</b> such as phthalates and other synthetic conventional <b>plasticizers</b> attracted the market along with the increasing worldwide trend towards use of biopolymers.

40|$|The {{changes in}} {{microstructural}} parameters of edible polymer films of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) with <b>plasticizers</b> such as glycerol (GLY) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) {{have been studied}} using wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) data and line profile analysis (LPA). Exponential function for the column length distribution {{has been used for}} the determination of microstructural parameters. The crystal imperfection parameters such as crystal size, lattice strain %(g) and orientational parameters have been computed and correlated with the amount of <b>plasticizers.</b> Comparison of orientational parameter with increase in <b>plasticizers</b> suggests that there is increase in the orientation in HPMC films. The flexibility of the films is expected to increase due to {{decrease in the number of}} weak inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the addition of <b>plasticizers.</b> From these investigations it is also observed that there is increase in unit cell volume with increase in the <b>plasticizers</b> in HPMC films indicating greater stability of the blends which are essential in packing industry...|$|R

2500|$|The {{global market}} for {{acetaldehyde}} is declining. Demand has been impacted {{by changes in}} the production of <b>plasticizer</b> alcohols, which has shifted because n-butyraldehyde is less often produced from acetaldehyde, instead being generated by hydroformylation of propylene. [...] Likewise, acetic acid, once produced from acetaldehyde, is made predominantly by the lower-cost methanol carbonylation process. The impact on demand has led to increase in prices and thus slowdown in the market.|$|E
2500|$|Most vinyl {{products}} contain plasticizers which dramatically {{improve their}} performance characteristic. The most common plasticizers are derivatives of phthalic acid.
