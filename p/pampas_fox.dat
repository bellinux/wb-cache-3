This fox is the most abundant native carnivore in southern South America, where it inhabits grasslands, open woodlands and areas highly modified by extensive ranching and agricultural activities. Material from 80 foxes in rural areas of southern Buenos Aires province, Argentina was examined. The intestinal tracts were carefully removed from each carcass and subsequently isolated by ligatures (pylorus and rectum). Examination of the intestinal content was performed using the sedimentation and counting technique. Four foxes (5 %) {{were found to be}} parasitized with adult specimens of A. buckleyi.

40|$|The parasites of {{the genus}} Spirometra belong {{to one of the}} twelve genera of the family Diphyllobothriidae, with several species of {{zoonotic}} importance whose definitive hosts are carnivorous mammals. In Argentina, few reports have described these parasites in wild carnivores. Morphological studies of the adult stage obtained from necropsy allow the distinction between Diphyllobothrium and Spirometra. A less invasive method of identification is the analysis of the parasite eggs; however, the morphometric similarities between close genera and species and alterations in egg preservation affect the identification. In Argentina, molecular tools have been used as a non-invasive and accurate method to increase the information about Spirometra and to improve its identification. In the present study, DNA was extracted from Spirometra eggs from <b>Pampas</b> <b>foxes</b> and a 450 -bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) gene was sequenced. The sequence obtained, which is the first Spirometra DNA sequence from Argentina, was deposited at GenBank.

40|$|The {{spread of}} enteric viruses of {{domestic}} animals {{and human beings}} to wild species can be facilitated by the resistance of these viruses {{on the environment and}} their ability to be transmitted by water and contaminated food. The health status of the populations of <b>pampas</b> <b>foxes</b> (Lycalopex gymnocercus) and crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous) is largely unknown and the landscapes occupied by these animals in southern Brazil have been threatened by human occupation and expansion of agriculture. In this work, the search of genomes of human and canine adenoviruses in feces from these wild carnivores was used to track the dissemination of domestic animals and human pathogens to the free-living populations in a wildlife reserve located in southern Brazil. This was performed by virus-specific differential real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) on stool specimens, avoiding capture and additional stress to the animals. Genus-specific conventional reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was complementarily performed aiming the detection of enteroviruses (EV) and rotaviruses (RV) on these same samples. HAdV genomes were found on 14 out of the 17 (82. 35 %) stool samples analysed, whereas CAV was found co-infecting 5 of these samples. RV genomes were detected on 7 of the 17 samples (41. 18 %) and all samples were negative for EV. The results point to the dispersion of HAdV and RV at a high rate to these species of South American wild carnivores, which can be an effect of growing anthropisation of the habitat of these animals. </p...|$|R

50|$|The pampas foxes mostly live {{a solitary}} life, but come {{together}} as monogamous pairs in the breeding season to raise their young. They are mainly nocturnal, becoming active at dusk, although may also be active during the day. They den in any available cavity, including caves, hollow trees, and the burrows of viscachas or armadillos. Even when raising young together, adult foxes generally hunt alone, marking their territory by defecating at specific latrine sites.

40|$|The <b>Pampas</b> <b>fox</b> (Pseudalopex gymnocercus) is a generalist South American canid that adapts {{well to the}} human-dominated {{landscape}} of the Argentine pampas, which is largely converted to agriculture and pastures. However, {{little is known about}} its ranging behaviour and spatial organization in relict native grasslands. We captured and tracked 13 radio-tagged adult foxes between December 1998 and June 2005 in Ernesto Tornquist Provincial Park, a protected area with a dense population of wild horses, an important food item for foxes. The home range of 10 adult males averaged 1. 40 ± 0. 96 km 2 (mean ± sd; 95 % minimum convex polygon, MCP) and was not significantly larger than that of three adult females, 1. 20 ± 1. 07 km 2 (95 % MCP). Evidence of individual's site fidelity over the study period is indicative of locally abundant food resources all year round. It is likely that the availability of horse carcasses is a main driver of the spatial organization of Pampas foxes in this population. Our population density estimate of 1. 1 - 1. 5 foxes per km 2 falls within the know range of population densities for Pampas foxes, and was close to the upper limit, as also expected from an abundant and aggregated food resource such as horse carrion. Reduced hunting pressures, however, may also contribute to explain the relatively high population densities of foxes in this protected area. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale, multispecies {{monitoring}} {{programs are}} used widely to assess changes in wildlife populations; however, they often assume constant detectability when documenting species occurrence. This assumption is rarely accurate because animal populations vary considerably {{across time and}} space. Furthermore, detectability of a species can be influenced {{by a number of}} physical, biological, or anthropogenic factors (e. g., weather, seasonality, topography, sampling methods, urban development). Analyses of habitat factors affecting occupancy and detection of mammalian species have not been conducted in the Paraguayan Chaco. To address this gap in the literature and provide conservation recommendations, I estimated site occupancy rates using species-specific detection probabilities for focal mammalian species at 3 study sites in the Chaco ecoregion of Paraguay. During remote camera surveys conducted August - November 2011 - 2012, I used photographic data and model selection techniques to assess the influence of different survey and site covariates on occupancy of several focal mammalian species: maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), Geoffroy 2 ̆ 7 s cat (Leopardus geoffroyi), puma (Puma concolor), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), <b>pampas</b> <b>fox</b> (Lycalopex gymnocercus), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), and giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla). I recorded 2, 034 photographs of 24 mammalian species at 64 camera sites; among those, 1, 353 photographs and 529 independent survey-detections were of these 9 focal species. Detection of maned wolves and peccaries was higher in 2011 than 2012; other species did not show significant differences in detection by year.

40|$|In Argentina, hydatid disease {{caused by}} Echinococcus granulosus is widespread. The south of Buenos Aires province, Argentina, {{is one of}} the three regions where {{hydatidosis}} is endemic. Although domestic dogs and sheep are considered to be the main hosts for E. granulosus, the potential role of wildlife in the local transmission of E. granulosus has not been investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the hydatidosis/echinococcosis prevalence in European hare (Lepus europaeus) and <b>Pampas</b> <b>fox</b> (Lycalopex gymnocercus), two abundant species with a strong predator–prey relationship in rural areas of Buenos Aires province using different diagnostic tests. A total of 61 fox intestines were examined, finding that 52 (85. 2 %) harbored at least one helminth species. However, no adult or immature form of Echinococcus sp. was found in the intestinal contents. Coproparasitological analysis and Copro–ELISA followed by Copro–PCR were used as supplementary diagnostic tests. Only one (1. 7 %) of 59 fecal samples was positive to Taeniidae eggs by coproparasitological analysis, but this same sample was negative by the Copro–ELISA test. The analysis by Copro–ELISA showed 6 of 57 (10. 6 %) positive samples, but the Copro–PCR tests carried out on these samples were negative to E. granulosus. A total of 6, 808 lungs, 3, 576 livers, and 3, 542 hearts of hunted hares were examined and palpated, but no structure resembling hydatid cysts were detected. Our results suggest that hares and Pampas foxes are not currently important wild reservoirs of E. granulosus in the studied area. Fil: Scioscia, Nathalia Paula. Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata.

A artéria cerebral rostral originou-se do ramo rostral da a. carótida interna e seguiu rostromedialmente. Nesse trajeto emitiu as aa. oftálmica interna e etmoidal interna. Em seguida a a. cerebral rostral uniu-se com sua contralateral, formando a a. comunicante rostral, que se bifurcou nas aa. inter-hemisféricas rostrais. A a. inter-hemisférica rostral emitiu as aa. rinal, hemisféricas rostrais e hemisféricas mediais rostrais. Da a. rinal foram originadas as aa. lateral do bulbo olfatório, hemisférica frontal e medial do bulbo olfatório. A a. cerebral rostral e suas ramificações, ao cursarem na face ventral do hemisfério cerebral, emitiram ramos para o páleo-palio. O território de vascularização da a. cerebral rostral compreendeu a fossa lateral do cérebro, os dois terços mediais do trígono olfatório, os tratos olfatórios lateral e medial, o tubérculo olfatório, a área paraolfatória, o pedúnculo olfatório, o bulbo olfatório, os dois terços rostrais da face medial do hemisfério cerebral e na face convexa do hemisfério cerebral parte do giro pró-reus, os giros pré-cruzado e pós-cruzado e os dois terços rostrais do giro marginal. aos seguintes ramos: a. corióidea rostral; ramos centrais rostrais e caudais; e ramos corticais. O tronco comum da a. cerebral média antes de ultrapassar o sulco rinal lateral, apresentou com maior freqüência um padrão de bifurcação, com divisão territorial, em uma parte rostral e outra caudal. Em menor proporção o tronco comum não bifurcou, ramificando-se em arborescência. O território vascular da a. cerebral média compreendeu a fossa lateral do cérebro, o terço lateral do trígono olfatório, os dois terços rostrais do lobo piriforme, o trato olfatório lateral, a maior parte da face convexa do hemisfério cerebral, exceto as áreas mais rostromediais do lobo frontal, margeando o sulco endomarginal nos lobos parietal e occipital, e a fissura transversa do cérebro no pólo caudal do hemisfério cerebral. A a. cerebral caudal originou-se do ramo caudal da a. carótida interna, seu eixo principal emitiu como ramos colaterais a a. tectal rostral, ramos para o lobo piriforme, o ramo corióideo caudal, continuando-se como a. interhemisférica caudal, a partir do ponto em que começava a lançar os ramos hemisféricos mediais caudais. O território vascular da a. cerebral caudal compreendeu o terço caudal do lobo piriforme, o colículo rostral, a parte rostral do colículo caudal, o corpo pineal, a estria medular, a habênula, a superfície dorsal do tálamo, os corpos geniculados medial e lateral, o hipocampo, o giro para-hipocampal, os plexos corióides do terceiro ventrículo e do ventrículo lateral, o esplênio do corpo caloso, o terço caudal da face medial do hemisfério cerebral e o bordo limitante da face convexa do hemisfério cerebral em seu pólo caudal. It {{was utilized}} 30 brains of <b>pampas</b> <b>fox</b> (Pseudalopex gymnocercus), injected with red stained latex, aiming to systematize {{and describe the}} distribution and arterial vascularization territories of the rostral, middle and caudal cerebral arteries. The rostral cerebral artery originated from the internal carotid artery's rostral branch and continued rostromedially. In this route it emitted the internal ophthalmic and internal ethmoidal arteries. Then, the rostral cerebral artery joined with its contra lateral, forming the rostral communicating artery, which bifurcated as the rostral interhemispheric arteries. The rostral inter-hemispheric artery emitted the rhinal, rostral hemispheric and rostral medial hemispheric arteries. From the rhinal artery originated the lateral olfactory bulb, frontal hemispheric and medial olfactory bulb arteries. The rostral cerebral artery and its branches, while coursing the ventral face of the cerebral hemisphere, emitted branches to the paleopallium. The vascularization territory of the rostral cerebral artery comprehended lateral cerebral fossa, two medial thirds of the olfactory trigone, the medial and lateral olfactory tracts, the olfactory tubercle, the paraolfactory area, the olfactory peduncle, olfactory bulb, two rostral thirds of the cerebral hemisphere medial face and, in the convex face of the cerebral hemisphere, part of the prorean gyrus, precruciate and poscruciate gyri and the two rostral thirds of the marginal gyrus. Middle cerebral artery originated from the rostral branch of the internal carotid artery and originated the following branches: rostral choroidal artery; caudal and rostral central branches; and cortical branches. The middle cerebral artery’s common trunk, before exceed the rhinal lateral sulcus, presented with a higher frequency a bifurcation pattern, with territorial division, in a rostral and a caudal part. In a lower frequency this trunk did not bifurcated, ramifying in arborescence. The vascular territory of the middle cerebral artery comprehended the lateral brain fossa, the lateral third of the olfactory trigone, two rostral thirds of the piriform lobe, the lateral olfactory tract, most of the convex part of the cerebral hemisphere, except the most rostromedial areas of the frontal lobe, bordering the endomarginal sulcus in the occipital and parietal lobes and the transversal fissure at the caudal pole of the cerebral hemisphere. The caudal cerebral artery originated from the caudal branch of the internal carotid artery, its main axis emitted the rostral tectal artery, branches to the piriform lobe, the caudal choroidal branch, continuing as the caudal interhemispheric artery, from where it started emitting the caudal medial hemispheric branches. The vascular territory of the caudal cerebral artery comprehended the caudal third of the piriform lobe, rostral colliculus, the rostral part of the caudal colliculus, pineal body, medular stria, the habenula, the dorsal surface of the thalamus, the medial and lateral geniculate bodies, hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the choroidal plexus of the third and lateral ventricles, the splenium of corpus callosum, the caudal third of the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere and the convex face limiting hedge of the cerebral hemisphere in its caudal pole...|$|E
