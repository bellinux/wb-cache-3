2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1790s, the Navigation faced calls for a bypass of the river at Nottingham, where the passage past Trent Bridge was dangerous, and the threat of a canal running parallel to the river, which was proposed by the Erewash and the Trent and Mersey Canal companies. In order to retain control of the whole river, they supported the inclusion of the Beeston Cut in the bill for the Nottingham Canal, which prevented the Erewash Canal company from getting permission to build it, and then had the proposal removed from the Nottingham Canal company's bill in return for their support of the main bill. The <b>parallel</b> <b>canal</b> was thwarted in May 1793, when they negotiated the withdrawal of the canal bill by proposing a thorough survey of the river which would result in their own legislation being put before parliament. William Jessop performed the survey, assisted by Robert Whitworth, and they published their report on 8 July 1793. The major proposals included a cut and lock at Cranfleet, where the River Soar joins the Trent, a cut, locks and weirs at Beeston, which would connect with the Nottingham Canal at Lenton, and a cut and lock at Holme Pierrepont. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1794, and the existing proprietors subscribed the whole of the authorised capital of £13,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ), themselves.|$|E

60|$|Section 18. The {{origin of}} the renal organ and duct has very {{considerable}} controversial interest.* In Figure 13, Sheet 22, a diagrammatic cross-section, of an embryo is shown. I. is the intestine, coe. the coelom, s.c. the spinal cord; n.c. the notochord, surrounded by n.s., the notochordal sheath, ao. is the dorsal aorta. In the masses of somatic mesoblast on either side, a longitudinal canal appears, which, in the torpedo, a fish related to the dog-fish, and in the rabbit, and possibly in all other cases, is epiblastic in origin. This is the segmental duct, which persists, apparently, as the Wolffian duct (W.D.). Ventral to this appears a <b>parallel</b> <b>canal,</b> the Mullerian duct (M.D.), which {{is often described as}} being split off from the segmental duct, but which is, very probably, an independent structure in the frog. A number of tubuli, at first metamerically arranged, now appear, each opening, on the one hand, into the coelom by a ciliated mouth, the nephrostome (n.s.), and on the other into the segmental duct. These tubuli are the segmental tubes or nephridia. There grows out from the aorta, towards each, a bunch, of bloodvessels, the glomerulus (compare Section 62, Rabbit). These tubuli ultimately become, in part, the renal tubuli, so that the primitive kidney stretches, at first, {{along the length of the}} body cavity from the region, of the gill-slits backward. The anterior part of the kidney, called the pronephros, disappears in the later larval stages. Internal to the kidney on either side there has appeared a longitudinal ridge, the genital ridge (g.r.), which gives rise to testes or ovary, as the case may be.|$|E

50|$|Construction of the Seneca {{reach of}} the Erie Canal began in the 1820s. The channel between Three Rivers and Cayuga Lake was widened and {{straightened}} to accommodate barges, and other reaches were bypassed via the construction of <b>parallel</b> <b>canals.</b> The canal path had to cross the Seneca River at several points, so locks were built to lower boats down to river level, where they were towed across aided by temporary wooden bridges. In 1849 work began to separate the canal from the river, {{in order to reduce}} the impact of flooding and sedimentation.|$|R
5000|$|Percival Lowell was {{a strong}} proponent {{of the idea that}} the canals were built for {{irrigation}} by an intelligent civilization on Mars, going much further than Schiaparelli, who for his part considered much of the detail on Lowell's drawings to be imaginary. Some observers drew maps in which dozens if not hundreds of canals were shown with an elaborate nomenclature for all of them.

25|$|The {{rationale}} {{for building a}} railway through Solør was first and foremost tied to the large lumber resources in the area, especially in Finnskogen. Engebret Soot proposed in 1851 that Glomma {{be connected to the}} Swedish canal network. It was mostly technical difficulties which resulted in the plans being shelved. Glomma would need to receive several <b>parallel</b> <b>canals</b> and locks. The river is iced half the year and there are shifting sandbanks. The interest for a railway arose with the construction of the Kongsvinger Line, approved in 1857 and completed in 1862.|$|R
50|$|The Hundred Fountains {{were another}} celebrated marvel of the gardens in the Renaissance. They are located between the oval {{fountain}} and the Fontana di Rometta, {{and there are}} actually nearly three hundred spouts fed by three <b>parallel</b> <b>canals,</b> one above the other. Along {{the edge of the}} upper canal there are spouts in the form of lilies, the emblem of France, alternating with the d'Este eagle, boats and obelisks; all spraying water in a fan shape. The water is captured by the second canal, which feeds it into spouts in the form of masks, from which it reaches the lower canal.|$|R

50|$|The {{next section}} of the {{original}} canal route between Thieu and Houdeng-Goegnies climbs 66m over a distance of 6790m, which is too steep a climb for canal locks. Therefore, this section contains four hydraulic boat lifts, dating from 1888 to 1917, which {{are now on the}} UNESCO World Heritage list (see Lifts on the old Canal du Centre). These lifts were designed by Edwin Clark of the British company Clark, Stansfield & Clark. For commercial traffic this stretch of the canal has, since 2002, been replaced by an enlarged <b>parallel</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{idea of a}} {{waterway}} {{to serve}} the cities of Hainaut, linking them ultimately with Antwerp, was first put forward {{during the reign of}} Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy (1396-1467). In 1436, an edict authorized the modification and deepening of the Senne River, though the project {{turned out to be more}} expensive than previously thought. The city of Mechelen, the sole city allowed to tax water transport on the Senne, protested extensively at the prospect of the construction of a <b>parallel</b> <b>canal,</b> and the project was abandoned.|$|E

50|$|His {{all time}} {{contribution}} is finding an ideal location and constructing a well planned port city at Alappuzha. He found Alappuzha {{as the most}} suitable, because of the geographical and oceanic reasons.He constructed two <b>parallel</b> <b>canals</b> for bringing goods to port and offered infrastructural facilities to merchants and traders from Surat, Mumbai and Kutch to start industrial enterprises, trading, and cargo centres. Alappuzha attained progress and became the financial nerve centre of Travancore during his time. The port was opened in 1762, mainly for the export of coir-matting and coir-yarn.Kesavadas built three ships for trade with Calcutta and Bombay, and alleppey afforded a convenient depot for the storage and disposal of goods produce in the east.|$|R
50|$|Brattleboro's center {{area was}} first {{settled in the}} 18th century, but saw {{significant}} growth beginning in the 1820s, with the advent first of river-based transport (on the Connecticut River), and then the railroad, which arrived in 1849. Canal Street was laid out sometime before 1845, <b>paralleling</b> the <b>canal</b> along Whetstone Brook that provided power to the town's industries. Some of the district's oldest houses were built along {{the south side of}} Canal Street. Clark Street, which mostly <b>parallels</b> <b>Canal</b> Street, was laid out 1845-52, and was named for Joseph Clark, the early landowner of the area. It was built to provide access {{to the rear of the}} long and narrow lots on which the early houses were built, for the purpose of subdivision. Lawrence and Estabrook Streets were also built around that time. By the late 19th century the area had been mostly built out, and a period of redevelopment saw the construction of multiunit housing, mainly along the principal roads. The Abbott, at Canal and South Main, was built in 1911; it is a large multiunit brick apartment block with commercial spaces on the ground floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} Canal du Nord and <b>parallel</b> <b>Canal</b> de Saint-Quentin {{represent a}} bottleneck {{on one of}} Europe’s principal transport arteries. This {{is reflected in the}} current statistics: where the market share of inland water transport measured in tonne-kilometres reaches 18% in the Seine-Oise basin and 14% in Nord-Pas de Calais, and even more than 50% on the major waterways of Germany and Benelux, the constraints of carrying capacity on the corridor in France limit the waterway market share to between 3 and 4% (peaking at about 5 million tonnes). Traffic is projected to reach between 15 and 18 million tonnes per year a few years after the waterway has opened.|$|E

50|$|The Douglas Navigation was a canalised {{section of}} the River Douglas or Asland, in Lancashire, England, running from its {{confluence}} with the River Ribble to Wigan. Authorised in 1720, it opened in 1742, but its working life was short, as it was bought out by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Company in 1772, to prevent a rival scheme to build a canal to Wigan. It {{was connected to the}} Leeds and Liverpool once that was open, but the upper river into Wigan was replaced by a <b>parallel</b> <b>canal</b> cut, and the lower river was replaced by the Rufford Branch, which utilised part of the river channel near its mouth. The navigation was abandoned by 1801, as the canal provided a better route to the River Ribble.|$|E
