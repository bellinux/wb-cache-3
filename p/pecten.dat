5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{was first}} {{described}} by the British zoologist Edgar Albert Smith in 1902 as <b>Pecten</b> colbecki. He worked at the British Museum and was responsible for examining and describing shells from collections made {{over the years that}} had been deposited there. The German malacologist Johannes Thiele determined in 1934 that the characteristics of the Antarctic scallop were sufficiently different from those of other members of the genus <b>Pecten</b> to warrant its inclusion in a separate genus, Adamussium. More recently, examinations of the chromosome structure and of the mitochondrial DNA of A. colbecki have been undertaken, but the exact phylogenetic relationship it has with other pectinids is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|Another study {{analysed}} {{the tissues}} of Adamussium colbecki and compared them {{with those of}} <b>Pecten</b> jacobaeus, a temperate water species of scallop. It was found that copper, iron, cadmium and chromium were concentrated in the digestive organ of the Antarctic scallop. Cadmium levels in particular {{were higher in the}} Antarctic scallop than in P. jacobaeus and other pectinids, but zinc and manganese, found in the kidney, were considerably lower.|$|E
5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in ultraviolet that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the <b>pecten.</b>|$|E

Aquaculture of molluscs has been growing at an average annual rate of 11 % over the past decades, although some activities - such as aquaculture of <b>pectens</b> or abalones - were growing even more rapidly. In many countries, {{there is a significant}} mollusc aquaculture, traditionally based on wild stocks. However, these natural populations frequently do not fulfil market demand, because of low value of the product, over-fishing of the resource and/or mass mortality outbreaks caused by diseases. A frequent answer to this situation has been the introduction of new stocks or new species in these areas (Grizel, 1996). Furthermore, species diversification for aquaculture, as well as hatchery production improvements do increase the demand for movements and transfers of live molluscs...|$|R

5000|$|The {{senses of}} the Accipitridae are adapted to hunting (or scavenging), and in {{particular}} their vision is legendary. The sight of some hawks and eagles is up to 8 times better than that of humans. Large eyes with two fovea provide binocular vision and a [...] "hawk eye" [...] for movement and distance judging. In addition they have the largest <b>pectens</b> of any birds. The eyes are tube shaped and cannot move much in their sockets. In addition to excellent vision many species have excellent hearing, but unlike in owls sight is generally the principal sense used for hunting. Hearing {{may be used to}} locate prey hidden in vegetation, but sight is still used to catch the prey. Like most birds the Accipitridae generally have a poor sense of smell; even the Old World vultures make no use of the sense, in contrast to the New World vultures in the family Cathartidae.|$|R
50|$|Southern Georgia {{remained}} submerged by shallow seawater {{into the}} ensuing Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era. These seas were home to relatively small coral reefs. During the Paleocene, Georgia {{was home to}} foraminiferans, mollusks, and sea urchins. The mollusks were preserved as casts and the urchins left behind fossil spines that {{are found in the}} middle part of the state. Eocene life in Georgia included <b>pectens,</b> oysters, and a wide variety of microscopic life. Sea urchins continued to persist in the state. Plant fossils have also been discovered in local Eocene rocks. Later, in the Oligocene epoch Georgia was home to animals like corals as well as a variety of pelecypods (at least 13) and gastropods (at least 11). The most common Miocene aged fossils are gastropods and pelecypods. Most of Georgia was dry land {{by the time of the}} Quaternary period. Local sea levels rose and fell significantly in time with the expansion and thawing of glaciers farther north in the continent. Georgia's terrestrial environments included forests and grasslands. These were home to creatures like mammoths, mastodons and giant ground sloths. An unusually large species of chipmunk called Tamias aristus also lived in the state during the Pleistocene.|$|R

6000|$|At ST. FE BAJADA, in Entre Rios, the cliffs, {{estimated}} at between sixty and seventy feet in height, expose an interesting section: {{the lower half}} consists of tertiary strata with marine shells, and {{the upper half of}} the Pampean formation. The lowest bed is an obliquely laminated, blackish, indurated mud, with distinct traces of vegetable remains. (M. d'Orbigny [...] "Voyage" [...] Part. Geolog. page 37, has given a detailed description of this section, but as he does not mention this lowest bed, it may have been concealed when he was there by the river. There is a considerable discrepancy between his description and mine, which I can only account for by the beds themselves varying considerably in short distances.) Above this there is a thick bed of yellowish sandy clay, with much crystallised gypsum and many shells of Ostreae, <b>Pectens,</b> and Arcae: above this there generally comes an arenaceous crystalline limestone, but there is sometimes interposed a bed, about twelve feet thick, of dark green, soapy clay, weathering into small angular fragments. The limestone, where purest, is white, highly crystalline, and full of cavities: it includes small pebbles of quartz, broken shells, teeth of sharks, and sometimes, as I was informed, large bones: it often contains so much sand as to pass into a calcareous sandstone, and in such parts the great Ostrea Patagonica chiefly abounds.

40|$|The {{molluscs}} {{discussed in}} this account are from two exposures in the Waihao River: a) the "classical" McCullough's Bridge locality (including the stratotype of the Tahuian) which has yielded 189 species, 167 {{of them from the}} 2 m. thick Tahu Member of early Kaiatan age, the others from beds of late Bortonian to Kaiatan age; b) a recently discovered outcrop of tuffaceous sediments [Kapua Tuffs, also Kaiatan but younger than the beds at a) ] from which 46 species are recorded. 26 species are common to the Tahu Member and Kapua Tuffs. Molluscs indicate that the Tahu Member (and probably Kapua Tuffs) was deposited in subtropical waters of normal salinity at depths of at least 150 - 200 m. Neither fauna shows much similarity to other Arnold Series faunas, largely because of ecological factors. In the systematic section, 206 species-group taxa are recorded and discussed. One new subfamily (of Nuculidae), 20 new genus-group taxa and 78 new species-group taxa are proposed and a further 25 new species are recorded but not named. A new supraspecific classification of the Nuculidae, based primarily on shell structure, is presented and the described New Zealand Cenozoic and Recent species are assigned to the relevant genus-group taxa.

The avian eye resembles that of a reptile, with ciliary muscles that can change the shape of the lens rapidly and {{to a greater extent than}} in the mammals. Birds have the largest eyes relative to their size in the animal kingdom, and movement is consequently limited within the eye's bony socket.

It was evident, from the manner in which species were grouped together, that they had lived where now embedded. Before making any further remarks, I may state, that higher up this same valley we shall again meet with a similar association of shells; and in the great Despoblado Valley, which branches off near the town from that of Copiapo, the <b>Pecten</b> Dufreynoyi, some Gryphites (I believe G.
