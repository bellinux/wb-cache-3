5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} of the temple mountain (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.|$|E

5|$|High water {{volume in}} wet seasons {{does most of}} the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are {{responsible}} for transporting most of the 3millionshorttons (2.7millionmetrictons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly. The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.|$|E
5|$|After peaking, Hary {{weakened}} due to land interaction, and {{it struck}} Madagascar southeast of Antalaha. After turning south over land, Cyclone Hary quickly moved offshore. There were three {{deaths in the}} country, {{one of which was}} from electrocution. There was locally heavy crop damage, and four bridges were destroyed. However, the damage was considered minimal, given the intensity of the storm. After affecting Madagascar, Hary accelerated to the southeast, and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over Réunion. On the mountain <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, rainfall reached , although it was much less near the coast. The rainfall caused flooding, killing one person, and 20,000people were left without power. Hary became extratropical on March13, although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid-latitude storm.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Hawaiian {{religious}} practice {{holds that the}} five volcanic <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island are sacred, and regards Mauna Loa, the largest of them all, with great admiration; but what mythology survives today consists mainly of oral accounts from the 18th century first compiled in the 19th. Most of these stories agree that the Hawaiian volcano deity, Pele, resides in Halemaʻumaʻu Crater on Kilauea; however a few place her home at Mauna Loa's summit caldera Mokuʻāweoweo, and the mythos in general associates her with all volcanic activity on the island. Regardless, Kīlauea's lack of a geographic outline and strong volcanic link to Mauna Loa led to it being considered an offshoot of Mauna Loa by the Ancient Hawaiians, meaning much of the mythos now associated with Kīlauea was originally directed at Mauna Loa proper as well.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush {{between one and}} three metres (3–10ft) high, {{but it can also}} grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that they}} are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E
5|$|In Hawaiian mythology, the <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{island of}} Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only {{high-ranking}} aliʻi to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians {{living on the}} slopes of Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the mountain's ecological balance. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophylla–Myoporum sandwicense (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks, and an Acacia koa–Metrosideros polymorpha (or koa–ōhia) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.|$|E

5|$|Maiden Castle {{expanded}} westwards, and {{the ditch}} {{was extended to}} enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley. A shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to , and more ramparts and ditches were added. On {{the south of the}} fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to demographic losses through significant migrations, {{the population of}} Croatia suffered significant losses due to wars and epidemics. In the 20th century alone, there were several such events. The first was World War I, when {{the loss of the}} population of Croatia amounted to an estimated 190,000 persons, or about 5.5% of the total population recorded by the 1910 census. The 1918 flu pandemic started to take its toll in Croatia in July 1918, with <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease occurring in October and November. Available data is scarce, but it is estimated that the pandemic caused at least 15,00020,000 deaths. During World War II, nearly 195,000 people died in the territory of present-day Croatia. The surrender of the armed forces of the Independent State of Croatia and of the civilians accompanying the troops of the British Army at the end of World War II was followed by repatriation and subsequent events that became known as the Bleiburg tragedy. A substantial number of people were executed, but the exact number is disputed. The claims range from 12,00015,000 to as many as 80,000 killed in May 1945. Finally, approximately 20,000 were killed or went missing during the 19911995 Croatian War of Independence. The figure pertains only to those persons who would have been recorded by the 1991 census as living in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|John Colter {{is widely}} {{considered}} the first mountain man and, like those that came to the Jackson Hole region over the next 30years, he was there primarily for the profitable fur trapping; the region was rich with the highly sought after pelts of beaver and other fur bearing animals. Between 1810 and 1812, the Astorians traveled through Jackson Hole and crossed Teton Pass as they headed east in 1812. After 1810, American and British fur trading companies were in competition {{for control of the}} North American fur trade, and American sovereignty over the region was not secured until the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846. One party employed by the British North West Company and led by explorer Donald Mackenzie entered Jackson Hole from the west in 1818 or 1819. The Tetons, as well as the valley west of the Teton Range known today as Pierre's Hole, may have been named by French speaking Iroquois or French Canadian trappers that were part of Mackenzie's party. Earlier parties had referred to the most prominent <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Teton Range as the Pilot Knobs. The French trappers' les trois tétons (the three breasts) was later shortened to the Tetons.|$|E
