Bon Homme Richards Air Group Seven further damaged Kyosen No.1, but smoke obscured Kyosen No.2, and it was restruck on July 8, destroying its powerhouse and <b>penstocks</b> (piping that delivers water to the turbines). USAF F-84s of the 49th FBW attacked the Choshin plants on July 8, striking the generators, transformer yards, and <b>penstocks</b> in 41 sorties.|$|E

40|$|The {{critical}} {{external pressure}} stability calculation of stiffened <b>penstock</b> in the {{hydroelectric power station}} is very important work for <b>penstock</b> design. At present, different assumptions and boundary simplification are adopted by different calculation methods which sometimes cause huge differences too.

This paper presents an optimizing design method to optimize sectional size and spacing of stiffening rings and to determine <b>penstock</b> bearing capacity coordinate with the bearing capacity of stiffening rings and <b>penstock</b> external pressure stability coordinate with its strength safety. As a practical example, the simulation results illustrate that the method {{presented in this paper}} is available and can efficiently overcome inherent defects of BP neural network...|$|R

The pump-generators have a generating capacity of 260 MW and pumping capacity of 235 MW. The generators can each discharge up to [...] of water and the power is converted by transformers to 400 kV. After water is discharged by the generators, it proceeds down one of two tail-race tunnels ( [...] and [...] in length) before being discharged into the lower reservoir.

Following an uprating project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4 megawatt Pelton turbine-generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts. The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 TWh in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956. The average power generated was 4.2 TWh/year for 1947–2008. In 2015, the dam generated 3.6 TWh.|$|E

50|$|However details {{regarding}} the redesign are available. The redesign calls for {{improvements in the}} pipe's lining {{as well as the}} addition of grouting around the <b>penstock</b> to reduce water flow between the <b>penstock</b> and the surrounding rock due to dynamic variation of the pipe diameter during operation (it expands due to water loading during operation then contracts when the load is removed, leaving a gap). The damaged section of the <b>penstock</b> was rerouted around the previous location to where new (undamaged) more stable rock is available. Construction on the redesigned <b>penstock</b> was completed in 2009. Redesign considerations include operational control of maximum agreed design limits under all conditions of assembly, design and service conditions (including water hammer pressure spikes).|$|R

In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the stiffener <b>penstock</b> structure in hydropower stations, the simple genetic algorithm and the direct search method in traditional optimization methods were integrated, and a new hybrid genetic algorithm was obtained.

The corresponding program was developed and applied to a hydropower station.

Finally, the effects of <b>penstock</b> are analysed by using stability region and response curves. The {{results indicate that the}} stability and regulation quality of system without surge tank are determined by time response of frequency which only depends on water hammer wave in <b>penstock,</b> while, for system with surge tank, the time response of frequency depending on water hammer wave in <b>penstock</b> and water-level fluctuation in surge tank jointly determines the stability and regulation quality. Water inertia of <b>penstock</b> mainly affects the stability and time response of frequency of system without surge tank as well as the stability and head wave of time response of frequency with surge tank.

500|$|After the {{clearing}} of over [...] {{of the future}} reservoir site and the relocation of several roads that ran through it, the diversion tunnel was closed and water began to rise behind New Don Pedro. The rising lake submerged Old Don Pedro Dam on April 12, 1970 and inundated the Gold Rush town of Jacksonville by June. The powerhouse and <b>penstocks</b> were completed by August 1970, after lengthy delays and setbacks due to the sheer scale of the generators, pipes and gates used in their construction. Some of the individual components were so heavy that a truck delivering one of the penstock sections sank up to its trailer bed in the road, and another was crushed when the driver braked, inadvertently snapping the chains that held the load in place.|$|E
