5000|$|The Eemmeer (...) is a lake {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} the Netherlands between the provinces of Flevoland, Utrecht, and North Holland. It measures 13.4 km2 and contains one small island, the Dode Hond (Dead Dog). The Eemmeer is one in a series of <b>peripheral</b> <b>lakes</b> used to geohydrologically detach the low-lying polders of Flevoland from higher old mainland. The Eemmeer is connected to the <b>peripheral</b> <b>lakes</b> Gooimeer in the west, at the point where both lakes are crossed by the highway A27 bridge, and the Nijkerkernauw in the east.|$|R
50|$|Eastern Flevoland (Oostelijk Flevoland or Oost-Flevoland) and Southern Flevoland (Zuidelijk Flevoland or Zuid-Flevoland), {{unlike the}} Noordoostpolder, have <b>peripheral</b> <b>lakes</b> {{between them and}} the mainland: the Veluwemeer and Gooimeer respectively, making them, together, the world's largest {{artificial}} island.|$|R
50|$|The {{experience}} of the Noordoostpolder had shown that groundwater from the higher old mainland would flow to the lower new land, causing subsidence and dehydration in the old land. It was decided to use geohydrology to detach the new polders from the mainland. A string of <b>peripheral</b> <b>lakes</b> have been left between the two, requiring a much longer dike of 90 km to encircle the polder.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{geographically}} favourable {{location of}} the southern polder to the heavily urbanised centre of the Netherlands and in particular Amsterdam, the planners devised a design that would include a large new urban area, to be called Almere, in order to relieve the housing shortage and increasing overcrowding on the old land. Almere was to be divided into 3 major settlements, initially; the first, Almere-Haven (1976), situated along the Gooimeer (one of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>lakes),</b> the second and largest, Almere-Stad (Almere City) (1980), which was to fulfil the role of city centre, and the third, Almere-Buiten (1984), to the northeast towards Lelystad.|$|R

40|$|Lake Nakivali {{is one of}} {{the four}} small lakes that form {{what is known as the}} Koki lakes system. It is 14 km long, 6 km wide, 26 km 2 in area and has maximum depth of 3. 5 m at high water level. The lake is located in a lake-swamp complex with River Rwizi as the {{principle}} inflow, and a number of <b>peripheral</b> <b>lakes</b> among which are four major ones, i. e. Lakes Nakivali, Mburo, Kachira, and Kijanebalola. The survey therefore established that Lake Nakivali is a healthy ecosystem capable of sustaining fisheries production. While stock enhancement through restocking with fry could boost fish stocks, especially of the Nile tilapia, effective management measures that allow natural regeneration of stocks of indigenous fish species is paramount. This may require closed fishing seasons and control of fishing effort. Tank aquaculture is a viable option for increasing fish production and Ngege (O. niloticus) and Male (C. gariepinus) are candidate fish species for fish farming...|$|R
50|$|Southern Flevoland {{has only}} one pumping station, the diesel powered De Blocq van Kuffeler. Because of the {{hydrological}} union of the two Flevolands it simply joins the other three in maintaining the water-level of both polders. Almere relieves the housing shortage and increasing overcrowding on the old land. Its name {{is derived from the}} early medieval name for Lacus Flevo. Almere was to be divided into 3 major settlements initially; the first, Almere-Haven (1976) situated along the coast of the Gooimeer (one of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>lakes),</b> the second and largest was to fulfill the role of city centre as Almere-Stad (1980) and the third was Almere-Buiten (1984) to the northwest towards Lelystad. In 2003, the municipality made a new Structuurplan which started development of three new settlements: Overgooi in the southeast, Almere-Hout in the east, and Almere-Poort in the West. In time, Almere-Pampus could be developed in the northwest, with possibly a new bridge over the IJmeer towards Amsterdam.|$|R
40|$|Lake Nakivali {{is one of}} {{the four}} small lakes that form {{what is known as the}} koki lake sysyem. It is 14 km long, 6 km wide. 26 km sqaured in area and has maximum depth of 3. 5 m at high water level. The lake is located in lake-swamp complex with river Rwizi as the {{principle}} inflow, and a number of <b>peripheral</b> <b>lakes</b> among which are four major ones,i. e Lake Nakivali, Mburo, Kachira and Kijanebalola. Lake Nakivali is a controlled lake with four official landing sites, namely: Kikusi, Kahirimbi, Kashojwa and Rukinga. The latter three are located within a Refugee settlement whereas Kikusi is outside. The Nakivali Refugee settlement initially established for Rwandese of Tutsi origin in 1963, now has at least seven nationalities which include people from Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and Eritrea. By the end of 2006, the lake’s hinterland of about 378 km squared contained 43, 448 people of whom 22, 448 were refugees. This large population has had stressful impacts on both land and lake resources to the extent that now there is an apparent overfishing on the lake...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{vegetation}} classification, the Intermountain region has been variously defined as comprising a number of phytogeographic units (Cronquist et al., 1972). Of these, the Bonneville basin forms the largest floristic section in the Intermountain region (Holmgren, 1972). The Bonneville basin floristic section includes mountain ranges <b>peripheral</b> to the <b>lake</b> bed and covers 38, 500 mi 2 of land surface.

40|$|Ngege, Oreochromis esculentus, {{originally}} {{formed the}} mainstay of the Lake Victoria Region (LVR) fisheries. Together with its indigenous congener O. variabilis, it was displaced from Lakes Victoria and Kyoga of LVR and was found to survive as isolated small populations within the <b>peripheral</b> minor <b>lakes</b> and reservoirs around the two lakes. Displacement of the two LVR indigenous tilapiines {{was thought to be}} principally driven by changed lake environment and predation by the introduced Nile perch, but also competition and genetic swamping by the closely related introduced and comparatively more ecologically versatile tilapine species. In a study carried out in the LVR between 1993 and 2003, micro satellites and RAPD markers were used to analyse the remnant populations so as to establish the population structure and extant genetic diversity of O. esculentus. Analyses indicated that the surviving O. esculentus retained a high proportion of genetic diversity with high differentiation between units an indication of genetic exchange between indigenous and introduced Nile tilapia where the two forms co-existed. While this heightened concern for genetic swamping of the remnant population units by the introduced tilapiines it was noteworthy that in a few of the satellite lakes where the O. esculentus was dominant evidence for introgression was weak...|$|R
40|$|Lake {{records from}} {{northern}} Eurasia show regionally coherent patterns of changes {{during the late}} Quaternary. <b>Lakes</b> <b>peripheral</b> to the Scandinavian ice sheet were lower than those today but lakes in the Mediterranean zone were high at the glacial maximum, reflecting the dominance of glacial anticyclonic conditions in northern Europe and a southward shift of the Westerlies. The influence of the glacial anticyclonic circulation attenuated through the late glacial period, and the Westerlies gradually shifted northward, such that drier conditions south of the ice sheet were confined to a progressively narrower zone and the Mediterranean became drier. The early Holocene shows a gradual shift to conditions wetter than present in central Asia, associated with the expanded Asian monsoon, and in the Mediterranean, in response to local, monsoon-type circulation. There {{is no evidence of}} mid-continental aridity in northern Eurasia during the mid-Holocene. In contrast, the circum-Baltic region was drier, reflecting the increased incidence of blocking anticyclones centered on Scandinavia in summer. There is a gradual transition to modern conditions after ca. 5000 yr B. P. Although these broad-scale patterns are interrupted by shorter term fluctuations, the long-term trends in lake behavior show a clear response to changes in insolation and glaciation...|$|R
40|$|I {{studied the}} ecology and {{biogeography}} of the spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) from core and Great <b>Lakes</b> Region <b>peripheral</b> populations. Peripheral populations occupy {{the edge of}} a species’ range and are considered to be important in terms of a species’ ecology, biogeography, evolution, and conservation. Peripheral populations often persist under different environmental conditions from the species’ core populations, and may exhibit adaptations to potentially “harsher” marginal environments. In this study I used common garden experiments, life history analyses, and phylogeography (based on mitochondrial DNA) to address the overall hypothesis that spotted gars from <b>peripheral,</b> Great <b>Lakes</b> Basin populations exhibit distinct life history characteristics and patterns of genetic diversity in comparison to spotted gars from core populations. In common garden laboratory experiments young-of-year spotted gars from peripheral populations exhibited significantly faster growth rates (0. 09 cm/day, 0. 26 g/day) than core populations (0. 04 cm/day, 0. 11 g/day, suggesting countergradient variation in growth. Life history analysis based on length-at-age data from 5 field populations (2 peripheral, 3 core) and incorporating thermal opportunity for growth (degree days above 18 °C) indicated significantly higher growth rate in spotted gars from peripheral (1. 23 mm/degree day) compared to core populations (0. 22 mm/degree day). Catch-curve analyses of the same populations indicated annual mortality rate (A) was lower in peripheral (A = 0. 41) compared to core populations (0. 56). Analysis of mitochondrial DNA from core and peripheral populations indicated genetic diversity (haplotype diversity, H) was highest in the Mississippi River Basin (H = 0. 80), lowest in the Great Lakes Basin (H = 0. 00, single haplotype), and most divergent in the western Gulf Coast Basin (H = 0. 70, no haplotypes shared with other basins). Overall, the Great Lakes Basin population was shown to be a unique component of the species, and is adapted to life at higher latitudes with shorter growing seasons. As a useful case study, my work can inform gar conservation strategies and lead to a better general understanding of the evolution and maintenance of vertebrate life history patterns and genetic diversity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} (sub-decadal to centennial), multi-proxy reconstruction of aeolian input {{and changes in}} palaeohydrological conditions based on a 13000 Yr record from Neor <b>Lake's</b> <b>peripheral</b> peat in NW Iran. Variations in relative abundances of refractory (Al, Zr, Ti, and Si), redox sensitive (Fe) and mobile (K and Rb) elements, total organic carbon (TOC), delta C- 13 (TOC), compound-specific leaf wax hydrogen isotopes (delta D), carbon accumulation rates and dust fluxes presented here fill a large gap in the existing terrestrial paleoclimate records from the interior of West Asia. Our results suggest that a transition occurred from dry and dusty conditions during the Younger Dryas (YD) to a relatively wetter period with higher carbon accumulation rates and low aeolian input during the early Holocene (9000 - 6000 Yr BP). This period was followed by relatively drier and dustier conditions during middle to late Holocene, {{which is consistent with}} orbital changes in insolation that affected much of the northern hemisphere. Numerous episodes of high aeolian input spanning a few decades to millennia are prevalent during the middle to late Holocene. Wavelet analysis of variations in Ti abundances as a proxy for aeolian input revealed notable periodicities at 230, 320, and 470 years with significant periodicities centered around 820, 1550, and 3110 years over the last 13000 years. Comparison with palaeoclimate archives from West Asia, the North Atlantic and African lakes point to a teleconnection between North Atlantic climate and the interior of West Asia during the last glacial termination and the Holocene epoch. We further assess the potential role of abrupt climate change on early human societies by comparing our record of palaeoclimate variability with historical, geological and archaeological archives from this region. The terrestrial record from this study confirms previous evidence from marine sediments of the Arabian Sea that suggested climate change influenced the termination of the Akkadian empire. In addition, nearly all observed episodes of enhanced dust deposition during the middle to late Holocene coincided with times of drought, famine, and power transitions across the Iranian Plateau, Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean region. These findings indicate that while socio-economic factors are traditionally considered to shape ancient human societies in this region, the influence of abrupt climate change should not be underestimated.
