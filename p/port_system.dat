25|$|New Orleans {{began as}} a strategically-located trading entrepôt, and it remains, above all, a crucial {{transportation}} hub and distribution center for waterborne commerce. The Port is the fifth-largest in the United States based on cargo volume and second-largest in the state after the Port of South Louisiana. It is the twelfth-largest in the U.S. based on cargo value. The Port of South Louisiana, also located in the New Orleans area, is the world's busiest in terms of bulk tonnage. When combined with Port of New Orleans, it forms the 4th-largest <b>port</b> <b>system</b> in volume. Many shipbuilding, shipping, logistics, freight forwarding and commodity brokerage firms either are based in metropolitan New Orleans or maintain a local presence. Examples include Intermarine, Bisso Towboat, Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Trinity Yachts, Expeditors International, Bollinger Shipyards, IMTT, International Coffee Corp, Boasso America, Transoceanic Shipping, Transportation Consultants Inc., Dupuy Storage & Forwarding and Silocaf. The largest coffee-roasting plant in the world, operated by Folgers, is located in New Orleans East.|$|E
25|$|The House of Bourbon {{replaced}} the House of Habsburg in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies {{and among the}} colonies. The last flotas sailed in 1737; the monopoly <b>port</b> <b>system</b> was abolished shortly thereafter. By {{the middle of the}} century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the Canary Islands, resettling {{the northern part of the}} colony and planting tobacco in the Cibao Valley, and importation of slaves was renewed. The population of Santo Domingo grew from about 6,000 in 1737 to approximately 125,000 in 1790. Of this number, about 40,000 were white landowners, about 25,000 were mulatto freedmen, and some 60,000 were slaves. However, it remained poor and neglected, particularly in contrast with its western, French neighbor Saint-Domingue, which became the wealthiest colony in the New World and had half a million inhabitants. As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco.|$|E

40|$|This paper sheds an {{empirical}} light on port development patterns by discussing {{the structure and}} the development of the Yangtze River <b>ports</b> <b>system.</b> We argue that the Yangtze River system is going through a regionalization phase, mainly in relation to the port of Shanghai. This process started on the lower Yangtze but is now also moving upstream. The transition towards the port regionalization phase is typically a gradual and market-driven process that mirrors the increased focus of market players on logistics integration. This paper builds on the existing literature on <b>port</b> <b>systems</b> and adapts <b>port</b> development models to river ports. Furthermore, we employ some statistical techniques that are common to the analysis of <b>port</b> <b>systems,</b> and introduce some techniques that have not been used much by transport geographers in ports. This paper will address the dynamics in the Yangtze River <b>ports</b> <b>system</b> by analyzing the level of cargo concentration and the degree of inequality in operations of the container ports. The paper also assesses observed differences in development of ports in different areas along the river (upstream/downstream) and reflects on the role of ownership structures in shaping regional load centre networks...|$|R

40|$|Many <b>porting</b> <b>systems</b> for {{internal}} combustion engines {{have been tried}} and tested over the years, however the basic spring actuated poppet valve system has prevailed over the last century. In the goal to lower engine output parasitic losses, a simple rotary valve <b>porting</b> <b>system</b> design is proposed and analyzed. The proposed design concept takes into consideration and combines all the prominent advantages of many ealier mutlitiple design variations over the past century. The inherent primary advantage of such a rotary <b>porting</b> <b>system</b> is the elimination of reciprocating components, thus lowering vibration, and removal of highly stiff springs which contribute to considerable system power loss. Comparable sized 3 -D representations of both systems are constructed in CAD (Computer Aided Design) software in order to run mechanical and fluid simulations to validate the efficiency advantage of a rotary valve <b>porting</b> <b>system.</b> Using Pro/Engineer Mechanism Dynamics module, the minimum torque required to actuate both systems at 2000 rpm and 3000 rpm is determined. Fluid simulations are performed using a commercial software CFDesign V 10. Volumetric flow rates are compared during the intake stroke as well as turbulence intensity factors which characterizes a systems ability to properly mix the Air/Fuel mixture and the combustion efficiency. Some possible improvement on the rotary geometry is suggested...|$|R
