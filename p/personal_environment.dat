The focus in this paper lies on the main theoretical key concepts which the research of facilitating knowledge practices and <b>personal</b> learning <b>environments</b> is based on.

In the center of this concept is the effect of personalization, according to which the activity of the actor is an important factor of personal development, strengthening of subjectivity of learning, development of learning through social and other types of interaction. The article highlights general theoretical basics of building a <b>personal</b> learning <b>environment</b> as one of the directions of development of modern models of learning, its basic characteristics. Special attention is paid to consideration of one of the variants of constructing <b>personal</b> learning <b>environment</b> – institutional <b>personal</b> learning <b>environment,</b> which combines the benefits of distance learning and the advantages of flexible, adaptive, open educational environments. In a broader sense, an institutional <b>personal</b> learning <b>environment</b> is a mechanism for the integration of formal and informal educational environments...|$|R

This aspect is enhanced by today’s fully sentient networked spaces, constantly communicating their various properties, states and attributes - often through decentralised and devolved systems. Crucial system feedback is supplied by {{a wide range of}} users and occupants, often either by miniature electronic devices or mobile phones - crowdsourcing (like crowd-funding) large volumes of small data feeds to provide accurate and expansive real-time information. Personalisation replaces standardisation as spaces 'intelligently' recognise and respond to individual occupants. Representations of spaces become as vital after construction as they are before; real-time monitoring, feedback and ambient display become integral elements to the ongoing life of spaces and objects. Maintenance and operations become extended inseparable phases of the construction process; a building is never [...] "complete" [...] in open-source architecture's world of growth and change.|$|E

In one scene, he walks away saying he has had it and his significant other packs its bags and leaves a frustrated Lambert alone and miserable. At the end of the video, he is shown very happily greeting the camera after waking up, hinting at a reconciliation. He also goes to explain in an interview with Pop Couture that the feel was intended to be more [...] "accessible," [...] unlike his [...] "For Your Entertainment" [...] video.

Personalization {{is seen as}} the key approach to handle the plethora of information in today’s knowledge-based society. It is expected that personalized teaching and learning will address the needs of the learners more efficiently. The education of the future will change by the influence of Web 2. 0 contents and the steadily increasing amount of data. This means that the students of tomorrow will regularly have to deal with sharing and merging contents from different sources. Therefore, mashup technology will become a very important means to focus on individual learning needs and to personalize the access to particular information.

In the first section, the concept of <b>Personal</b> Learning <b>Environments</b> is presented, while the second section discusses the new challenges that arise for learning with the help of <b>Personal</b> Learning <b>Environments.</b> The third section of the article describes the technical background of <b>Personal</b> Learning <b>Environments</b> and the widget standard in general.

50|$|Guna {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{important}} elements in the framework of ethical theories in Indian philosophy. Bommer et al. suggest that ethical/non-ethical behavior is an outcome of individual attributes, <b>personal</b> <b>environment,</b> social environment and institutional rules and laws. Guna theory is the ancient Indian philosophy on individual attributes, while the theories of Dharma and Ashramas address the personal and social environment, as well as part of its institutional framework. Guna theory, states Crawford, represents a hierarchical theory of values, where the relative order of hierarchy is suggested to vary within each individual along with the relative proportion of each guna. The interplay of three gunas affect an individual's values, and in Hindu worldview, these values affect individual's actions, as well as the happiness and serenity experienced by the individual. The gunas are not considered as static and set. Hindu literature, such as the Bhagavad Gita, state it to be dynamic and changeable with knowledge, introspection and understanding of sva-dharma. Realizing one's sva-dharma and Self, is emphasized in Indian ethical theories. The highest state of existence and bliss, in Advaita school of Hinduism for example, is jivanmukti (Self realization) and moksha.|$|E
5000|$|Long before {{efforts toward}} racial and {{cultural}} integration in the United States arose, the main course of action was assimilation. In 1954, Milton Gordon's book Assimilation in American Life outlined seven stages of the assimilative process, {{setting the stage for}} literature on this topic. Later, Young Yun Kim authored a reiteration of Gordon's work, but argued cross-cultural adaptation as a multi-staged process. Kim's theory focused on the unitary nature of psychological and social processes and the reciprocal functional <b>personal</b> <b>environment</b> interdependence. [...] Although this view was the earliest to fuse micro-psychological and macro-social factors into an integrated theory, it is clearly focused on assimilation rather than racial or ethnic integration. In Kim's approach, assimilation is unilinear and the sojourner must conform to the majority group culture in order to be [...] "communicatively competent." [...] According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) [...] the [...] "cross-cultural adaptation process involves a continuous interplay of deculturation and acculturation that brings about change in strangers in the direction of assimilation, the highest degree of adaptation theoretically conceivable." [...] Interestingly, this view has been heavily criticized, since the biological science definition of adaptation refers to the random mutation of new forms of life, not the convergence of a monoculture (Kramer, 2003).|$|E
