Twenty-four (12 male/ 12 female) young (23 ± 5 y), healthy participants volunteered for this study. Mean height and weight were 173. 9 cm (± 10. 5) and 74. 3 kg (± 11), respectively. Participants reported to the laboratory between the hours of 0700 and 1000 following a 12 -h fast. A MedGraphics VO 2000 portable metabolic measurement system equipped with a low-flow <b>pneumotach</b> was arranged in series to a Pre-Vent <b>pneumotach</b> for the MedGraphics CPX/D metabolic system. Participants rested in a supine position for a 20 -min period of acclimation. Inspired and expired gases were collected for 60 -min, after the acclimation period, for the analysis of VO 2, VCO 2, and VE. There were no significant difference (P< 0. 05) between the systems for VO 2 (P= 0. 12), VCO 2 (P= 0. 45), or VE (P= 0. 10).

Previous work by Waligora, et al., 1992, Waligora and Gilbert, 1992, and Dalrymple 1996, {{have found that}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{accumulation}} in the LES/ACES helmet may be problematic. CO 2 accumulation is important because high inspired levels of CO 2 reduce physical function and pose a safety hazard (e. g. levels of CO 2 accumulation of 3. 6 % in the Extravehicular Mobility Unit are sufficient to terminate Extra Vehicular Activities). My task was to design a suitable test protocol for determining the important physiological aspects of LES/ACES use. Three basic issues arose. First was {{the determination of the}} astronaut's CO 2 inspiration during visor-down use at rest and during walking at 3. 5 mph. A sub-issue was the impact of a <b>pneumotach</b> on CO 2 since it has been previously observed that when the Aerosport <b>pneumotach</b> was used, performance seemed improved, which might be attributable to a lowered respiration rate when using the <b>pneumotach.</b> The second issue was the energy costs of waLking in the LES/ACES with various G-suit inflation levels, since G-suit inflation increases metabolic costs and metabolic costs influence the C 02 production in the LES/ACES helmet. Since G-suit inflation improves orthostatic tolerance after space flight, but likely increases the energy costs of walking, the balance between G-suit inflation and C 02 accumulation is an important safety consideration.

A new group of 13 COPD male patients (FEV 1 /FVC< 70 % and FVC ≥ 80 %) was used in this study, with stricter inclusion criteria than in the previous one. Anthropometric parameters (age, weight, height, skinfolds) and values of several pulmonary function tests, such as spirometry (FVC, FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC), static volumes (RV and TLC) and pulmonary diffusion (DL,CO and DL,CO /VA) were recorded. The EIT system (TIE 4 sys) and a <b>pneumotach</b> were simultaneously connected to monitor tidal volume. The anthropometric main values of COPD patients were: Age 67 ± 9 years; height 1. 65 ± 0. 05 m; weight 72 ± 11 kg; BMI 26. 4 ± 3. 3 kg/m 2; Subscapular skinfold 23 ± 9 mm. The mean values of pulmonary function test were: Spyrometry FVC 83 ± 13, FEV 1 47 ± 15 % of reference value and FEV 1 /FVC 40 ± 9 %.

Methods: Lung sounds were recorded from 20 healthy adults in the frequency range of 150 - 250 Hz using 40 piezoelectric sensors positioned on the posterior chest wall. During the recordings, subjects were breathing at airflow rates ranging between 0. 3 and 1. 7 L/s. Online visual feedback was provided using a <b>pneumotach</b> mouthpiece.

Metabolic data were analysed during the last 30 seconds of each stage and at peak exercise. There were non- significant differences (p > 0. 05) between the two systems in estimation of oxygen consumption (VO 2) and in minute ventilation (VE). Mean Cronbach’s alpha for VO 2 and VE were 0. 88 and 0. 92. The Bland-Altman analysis revealed that limits of agreement were - 0. 52 to 0. 55 l. min- 1 for VO 2, and - 8. 74 to 10. 66 l. min- 1 for VE. Carbon dioxide production (VCO 2) and consequently respiratory exchange ratio (RER) measured by the Innocor were significantly lower (p < 0. 05) through all stages. The CardiO 2 measured fraction of expired carbon dioxide (FeCO 2) significantly higher (p < 0. 05). The limits of agreement for VO 2 and VE are wide and unacceptable in cardio-pulmonary exercise testing. The Innocor reported VCO 2 systematically lower.

Three hundred and sixty-one separate ventilation tests were performed using the low-flow, medium-flow, and high-flow heads of the portable calorimeter.

MUF is accomplished by connecting the arterial cannula in series to a roller pump, an ultrafilter and the venous cannula.

Pressure-cycled infant ventilators generate pressure pulses with short rise-times. Gas flow is approximately equal to the derivative of pressure when lung compliance is low, and hence contains high-frequency components. We defined bandwidth as that frequency fm below which 99. 9 % of {{the energy of the}} signal resided. Simulation of the measurement process using measurement systems with frequency response similar to sixth-order Bessel filters and a lung model comprising series resistance, inertance and compliance showed that measurement systems with frequency response flat +/- 10 % to fm yield time domain errors less than 3 % of the peak value. We digitized pressure and flow signals from 10 - 20 ventilator (Healthdyne 105) breaths in 33 stable MVIS. The transducers' (Gould P 50, Hans Rudolph 8300 screen <b>pneumotach)</b> frequency responses had been measured between 1 Hz and 100 Hz and phase matched at 10 Hz. We calculated total respiratory resistance R and elastance E using multiple linear regression, and ensemble-average power spectral density using the FFT with a rectangular time window and padding to 2048 points. Power spectra were compensated for non-unity transducer and anti-alias filter responses up to 60 Hz. Measured data sequences that were not self-windowing due to spontaneous breathing efforts, that yielded regression R 2 < 0. 95 or that contained flow oscillations due to secretions in the airway were discarded. Satisfactory results were obtained from more than eight breaths in 18 infants. Mean bandwidths (+/- SD) of pressure and flow waveforms were 4. 7 +/- 0. 7, range 3. 5 - 5. 9 and 19. 6 +/- 6. 5, range 10. 8 - 32. 1 Hz, respectively. Flow bandwidths B correlated with the respiratory time constant tau (B = - 77. 2 tau + 26. 8, R 2 = 0. 55, P < 0. 0002), and with elastance E (B = 61. 4 E + 10. 1, R 2 = 0. 74, P < 0. 0001). We conclude that the bandwidth of the flow waveform increases with decreasing compliance and mechanical time constant. The frequency response of pressure and flow measurement systems should be flat +/- 10 % at least up to 6 and 32 Hz respectively to obtain data with dynamic errors less than 3 % in infants with low-compliance lung disease. status: publishe...|$|E

Seven pregnant (gestational ages between the 27 th and 30 th week) and seven non-pregnant women performed two continuous cycle ergometer tests (water and land-based) at the first ventilatory threshold intensity. During all sessions, res- piratory gases were collected with a portable AEROSPORT KB 1 -C mixing box gas analyzer. A <b>pneumotach</b> was used with a neoprene mask. Heart rate (HR) measurements were obtained with a POLAR F 1. Data were collected every 20 s. RPE on Borg scale from 6 to 20 was derived at the end of the exercise. One-way ANOVA was applied for repeated measures using the post-hoc Bonferroni test (p< 0. 05). No significant differences were found in VO 2 or RPE when comparing water with land-based exercise. In the same way, no significant difference was found between pregnant and non-pregnant subjects. We suggest that RPE can be used for water and land-based exercise prescription on cycle ergometer at the intensity of first ventilatory threshold, for both pregnant and non-pregnant women...|$|E
40|$|Current ACCP {{guidelines}} (Colice et al., Chest 2007) recommend {{usage of}} the segment count method and the perfusion scintigraphy method for calculating post-operative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) in patients undergoing a lobectomy or pneumonectomy, respectively. In this trial, functional respiratory imaging (FRI) (De Backer et al., Radiology 2010) is evaluated for calculating post-operative FEV 1 (poFEV 1). Methods 23 patients (14 analyzed [10 single lobectomy, 2 double lobectomy, 2 pneumonectomy], 9 dropouts [2 deceased, 3 lost in follow up, 4 sub-lobar resection]) {{were included in the}} trial. All patients underwent spirometry, perfusion scanning, and <b>pneumotach</b> controlled CT scanning at maximum expiration (RV) and inspiration (TLC), both before and after resection. Post-surgery tests were acquired after recovery and before the start of any adjuvant therapy. RV and TLC scans were used to segment lobar volumes and to calculate regional expansion (EXP). Furthermore, resistances (iRaw, before and after virtual resection) were acquired through computational fluid dynamics. poFEV 1 was predicted using the guideline formulas and using the FRI based formula (Figure 1). Results Median actual poFEV 1 is 2100 ml (1210 ml [...] 3210 ml). The slopes of the fitted linear models between the actual and predicted poFEV 1 are 1. 10 (R 2 = 0. 81, p< 0. 001 *) and 0. 98 (R 2 = 0. 86, p< 0. 001 *) for the ACCP prediction and the FRI prediction respectively. A paired t-test shows no significant difference between actual poFEV 1 and FRI predicted poFEV 1 (p= 0. 76) while ACCP predicted poFEV 1 (p= 0. 002 *) underestimates actual poFEV 1. This is also reflected in the smaller root mean square error of the FRI method (213 ml versus 371 ml). Conclusions In contrast with the guideline formulas, there is {{no significant difference between the}} FRI predicted and the actual poFEV 1. Furthermore, the root mean square error of the proposed method is 43 % smaller than the standard method, and is lower than the minimally important changes in FEV 1 (323 ml) as very recently reported by Janssens et al. (Respiratory Medicine 2013). Also, the slope of the linear fit from the FRI prediction is very close to 1, indicating that the model is very well predicting reality. FRI seems to be a better tool to predict post-operative FEV 1 as compared to the current guidelines in patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to validate a new system of breath-by-breath expired gas analysis to both an artificial working model of lung ventilation and gas exchange {{as well as to the}} Douglas bag technique. In addition, comparisons will be made between expired fractions, ventilation, and computations of VO 2, VCO 2, and RER between the new system and a commercial mixing chamber system (ParvoMedics) for repeated measurements at rest, steady state and non-steady state cycle ergometry exercise. Post acquisition processing involved custom developed software (LabVIEW), where time to gas equilibration within the mixing bag was determined, as well as differences in equilibrated gas fractions. All testing procedures were repeated 5 times for parametric statistical analyses. Gas concentration (%) results for the compliant 2 L mixing bag was the only method to yield data not significantly different between alveolar and measured. Alveolar % oxygen was significantly lower than mixing bag, mixing chamber, and ParvoMedics. The most responsive method was the mixing bag, with significantly lower % gas data for oxygen for breaths 2 to 5 compared to the mixing chamber and ParvoMedics. The ParvoMedics and mixing bag yielded similar results after breath 6, but data were significantly higher than for alveolar air. The slope data for breaths 0 to breaths 2 was significantly (p < 0. 05) lower for the ParvoMedics system compared to the mixing bag and mixing chamber. The mean temporal distribution of 1 L ventilation maneuvers from the mixing bag turbine was 0. 999 ± 0. 142 L, with a range of 0. 96 to 1. 03 L. The mean ventilation (STPD) from the ParvoMedics (<b>pneumotach)</b> was significantly lower (p = 0. 0027) than the mixing bag turbine. For VE (p = 0. 097), VO 2 (p = 0. 786), and VCO 2 (p = 0. 178) were not significantly different in the main effect for method and the Intensity x Method interaction (VE: p = 0. 721, VO 2 : p = 0. 059, VCO 2 : p = 0. 406). As expected, there was a significant difference for the intensity main effect (p < 0. 0001). For FEO 2 (p < 0. 0001) and FECO 2 (p < 0. 0001) there were significant findings for the main effects of intensity. However, the Intensity x Method interaction showed no significant differences in FEO 2 and FECO 2. RER was significantly different in the main effect for method (p = 0. 024), intensity (p = 0. 0006), and Intensity x Method interaction (p = 0. 005). The expired oxygen and carbon dioxide had significant main effects and interactions (p < 0. 001). All mean differences between alveolar and mouth end tidal gas % values across 6 breaths were significant (p < 0. 01). The mean individual computed dead space volumes were 2. 5 ± 0. 13 L. The results suggested that the new 2 L mixing bag is capable of accurately reproducing specific gas fractions from reference calibration gas. The new 2 L mixing bag allowed expired air to wash out through the bag. This system, in combination with including anatomical dead space (ADS) as a factor in the determinations, gives more accurate measurements and calculations than a traditional mixing chamber. Additionally, the new mixing bag method has unique aspects that are advantageous to the operation and validity of the system. Although the new system is not used in commercial systems of expired gas analysis indirect calorimetry (EGAIC), this system provides enhanced accuracy and validity.

40|$|Aberrant {{motor control}} {{strategies}} {{have been identified}} in chronic pelvic girdle pain (PGP) subjects. It has been proposed that aberrant motor control strategies could provide a mechanism for ongoing pain and disability in these subjects. This thesis consists of a series of studies that have investigated motor control strategies during the active straight leg raise (ASLR) test, under various loading conditions, in pain free nulliparous female subjects (n= 14) and female subjects with chronic PGP (n= 12). Clinical examination of the chronic PGP subjects had identified the SIJ and surrounding structures as the primary source of symptoms. Heaviness of the leg (+/- pain) when the pain subjects performing the ASLR was relieved in all the pain subjects with the addition of manual pelvic compression during the ASLR, consistent with a pain disorder associated with impaired force closure mechanism. Phase of respiration was monitored with the <b>pneumotach.</b> Electromyography was recorded bilaterally from internal obliquus abdominis (IO), external obliquus abdominis, rectus abdominis, anterior scaleni and rectus femoris as well as the right chest wall (CW). Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and intra-thoracic pressure were measured with a nasogastric catheter attached to custom-made pressure transducer equipment. Downward pressure of the non-lifted leg during an ASLR was recorded with an inflated pad linked to a pressure transducer placed under the heel. Data for these variables were collected in a custom designed data acquisition program. A separate custom designed program was used for data processing. Additionally, motion of the pelvic floor (PF) was monitored with a real-time ultrasound unit and recorded to digital video for manual processing. Study 1 : Motor control patterns during an active straight leg raise in pain free subjects Pain free subjects demonstrated greater muscle activation of the abdominal and CW ipsilateral to the side the ASLR was performed on. This effect was most pronounced local to the pelvis in IO. This muscle pattern was associated with a small increase in IAP. Although there was an overall commonality in the motor control patterns, individual variation was apparent. This study contradicted the theory of anterior diagonal slings for the provision of pelvic stability/force closure during the ASLR. The findings of this study highlights the flexibility of the neuromuscular system in controlling load transference during an ASLR, and the plastic nature of the abdominal cylinder. Study 2 : Motor control patterns during an active straight leg raise in chronic pelvic girdle pain subjects In contrast to pain free subjects, chronic PGP subjects demonstrated bracing of the abdominal wall and right CW during an ASLR on the symptomatic side of the body. This was associated with higher levels of IAP and increased downward movement of the PF. Increased levels of IAP could have negative consequences and be provocative of pain. The findings from this study support the notion that aberrant motor activation patterns exist in this group of subjects. Study 3 : The effect of increased physical load during an active straight leg raise in pain free subjects When performing an ASLR with additional physical load around the ankle, pain free subjects demonstrated increased muscle activation levels compared to an ASLR without additional load, with higher levels of IAP. Greater ipsilateral IO activation observed during an ASLR was maintained during the loaded ASLR, unlike the symmetrical bracing pattern observed in PGP subjects. This adds support to the notion that PGP subjects have aberrant motor control patterns during an ASLR, not represented solely by the increased effort of lifting the leg. Study 4 : The effect of resisted inspiration during an active straight leg raise in pain free subjects Pain free subjects performed an ASLR while also breathing with inspiratory resistance, to simultaneously provide a stability and respiratory challenge upon the neuromuscular system. Motor activation in the abdominal wall was highlighted by a cumulative increase in motor activation when performing the ASLR with inspiratory resistance compared to performing these tasks in isolation. Despite this general increase in activation, a pattern of greater IO activity {{on the side of the}} leg lift observed during an ASLR was preserved when inspiratory resistance was added to the ASLR. Intra-abdominal pressure demonstrated an incremental increase similar to the increase in muscle activity. This confirms that pain free subjects are able to adapt to multiple demands of an ASLR and inspiratory resistance by an accumulative summation of the patterns utilised when these tasks are performed independently. Study 5 : Non-uniform motor control changes with manually applied pelvic compression during an active straight leg raise in chronic pelvic girdle pain subjects The PGP subjects performed an ASLR with the addition of manual pelvic compression. The hypothesis that this would reduce muscle activation levels and IAP was not supported. Rather, trends for either trunk muscle facilitation or inhibition were identified. Trunk muscle facilitation was associated with higher levels of IAP, whereas motor inhibition was associated with lower levels of IAP. These findings suggest a potential for different underlying mechanism associated with the chronic PGP disorder in these subjects and variable responses to pelvic compression. While a number of the statistical analyses were significant suggesting some consistency in motor patterns, visual inspection of the data demonstrated individual variations in the motor control strategies in both pain free and chronic PGP subjects. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that: * Pain free subjects adopt a predominant pattern of greater motor activation ipsilateral to the side of the leg lift during an ASLR, an ASLR with additional physical load and an ASLR performed with inspiratory resistance. Within this commonality in motor control, individual variations exist. * Chronic PGP subjects do not demonstrate greater ipsilateral activation during an ASLR on the symptomatic side. Instead they adopt a bilateral bracing/splinting motor control pattern with increased IAP. It is hypothesised that: The aberrant motor control patterns observed in these chronic PGP subjects may be maladaptive in nature. These aberrant patterns may have negative consequences on pelvic loading and stability, respiration, continence, pain and disability. The findings of this thesis are consistent with complex underlying mechanisms driving chronic pelvic girdle pain disorders, and suggest that multiple factors have the potential to influence motor control strategies in these subjects. These findings may have implications for management of chronic PGP disorders, highlighting the need for individualised programs that attempt to normalise aberrant motor control strategies. This thesis has added substantially to the knowledge of motor control in chronic PGP disorders, a research area in its infancy compared to the investigation of motor control in the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine. Now that PGP has been recognised as a separate diagnostic entity to LBP, greater understanding of this region is essential for the identification of sub-groups within the diagnosis of PGP, and for the development of specific intervention strategies that target the underlying pain mechanisms driving these disorders...|$|E
