40|$|The Hanford Site C Reactor Technology Demonstration Group {{demonstrated}} the High-Speed Clamshell Pipe Cutter technology, developed and marketed by Tri Tool Inc. (Rancho Cordova, California). The models demonstrated are portable, split-frame pipe lathes that require minimal radial and axial clearances for severing and/or beveling in-line pipe with ranges of 25 cm to 41 cm and 46 cm to 61 cm nominal diameter. The radial clearance requirement from the walls, floors, or adjacent pipes is 18 cm. The lathes were supplied with carbide insert conversion kits for the cutting bits for the high-speed technique that was demonstrated. Given site-specific factors, this demonstration showed {{the cost of}} the improved technology to be approximately 30 % higher than the traditional (baseline) technology (oxyacetylene torch) cost of $ 14, 400 for 10 cuts of contaminated 41 -cm and 61 -cm-diameter pipe at C Reactor. Actual cutting times were faster than the baseline technology; however, moving/staging the equipment took longer. Unlike the baseline torch, clamshell lathes do not involve applied heat, flames, or smoke and can be operated remotely, thereby helping personal exposures to be as low as reasonably achievable.

40|$|As advance {{rates of}} TBM bored tunnels increase, it is {{essential}} that all aspects of the control of the machine and the tunnel support are able to operate at the desired rate. This paper describes the innovative ways that the basic guidance system has been adapted to cater for the TBM’s that are currently in use used on the Gotthard tunnel where the traditional line of sight throughout the backup gear is continuously obstructed due to the use of a sprayed concrete support facility to the use. The guidance system utilizes features from the well proven system for distance and curved pipejacking applications where the main reference is attached to the moving <b>pipe</b> (<b>tunnel</b> lining). Accurate steering of the tunnelling machine is essential if the segmental lining is to be efficiently installed. The use of ring sequencing software for the determination of the ring type and rotation, significantly aids the rapid placement of the most appropriate ring, which in turn can be monitored for any immediate convergence with the innovative chained inclinometer convergence measurement system. All of this information together with the surface mapping, geotechnical, and surface monitoring data bases can be fully integrated with the monitoring of the machines operating parameters in the Controlled Boring Process software integration package to give the machine operator a complete graphical display of all that is happening around him, to ensure optimum control and speed of safe advance...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis work was to develop methods to characterise the {{acoustical}} response of an external gearshift system. First there was a study of what is already done nowadays in terms of processing of recorded noise and testing of the system in a car. Interviewing persons that use the test in their work gave {{an overview of the}} situation. A research of existing models (especially for the cables) was done. A general summary of what former methods were developed and what should be in the field of study has been done. The type of model and associated calculations were chosen after these summary. It has been decided to build up a finite element model of the external gearshift system (approximately 5000 elements) using CATIA. This shell and beam mesh will be processed in the NASTRAN computation software in order to obtain the modal response of the system. I-DEAS may be used as a post processor to visualise modal shapes. The goal is {{to find a way to}} obtain a empty spectrum between 0 and 300 Hz. The excitations coming from the engine are indeed included in this frequency range, the eigen frequencies below 300 Hz have then been processed in order to be risen. Simulations were made on the reference system. The results were then compared to values from physical testing and a former study. It appeared that the values were similar and the model was thus validated. Calculations were ran for different physical properties and thermal conditions configurations. The simulations results matched the theory results, and the influence of the exhaust <b>pipe</b> <b>tunnel</b> dynamic stiffness and the temperature were evaluated. Calculations were made on different geometry of external gearshift systems either to improve an existing EGS or to understand the link between the geometry of some regions and the modal response. General conclusions were drawn from those simulations as well as possible improvements. A methodology covering different modes origins has been written. It explains how to improve the response (rise the eigen frequencies) with respect to the mode origin...|$|E
40|$|Stoats (Mustela erminea, Linnaeus 1758) {{are a major}} {{conservation}} pest in New Zealand, {{and they}} are presently the focus of much research to improve the efficacy of their control (Department of Conservation, 2000). Tunnels are used in almost all aspects of monitoring and control associated with stoats, yet few studies have investigated the influence of tunnel design on stoats' behavioural responses to them, or the effect on capture rate (Dilks et al., 1996; Maxwell et al., 1997; Short and Reynolds, 2000). This thesis describes pen and field research, which examines the influence of several tunnel design variables on stoat entry behaviour. This information {{will be used to}} assist in designing a trapping tunnel for a new repeat-kill, permanent-set kill trap for sustained control of stoats in indigenous forest, currently being developed at Lincoln University. The investigative behaviours of captive stoats were videoed in large outdoor pens. I investigated the effects of diameter (50, 100 and 150 mm), length (400, 600 and 800 mm) and-end type (open, closed and mesh) on stoat entry behaviour into a variety of PVC <b>pipe</b> <b>tunnel</b> types. Three hair collection methods, suitable for monitoring stoats, were also trialled both in the pens and in the field. Initial and repeat entry behaviour was observed as well as general investigative behaviour toward the tunnels. Diameter does affect repeat entry type and frequency in closed ended tunnels, however, the comparison of tunnel diameters in open-ended tunnels demonstrated that diameter alone may have a minor effect on stoat entry behaviour. Diameter did not affect initial entry behaviour into any of the tunnel types and had no influence on the depth to which stoats entered the tunnels. Longer tunnels may encourage more body entries into smaller (50 mm) diameter tunnels. However, stoats were reluctant to proceed {{to the end of the}} tunnels of any length. End type affects both initial and repeat entry behaviour in all tunnel types, although it is more apparent in tunnels with a smaller diameter. Removal of the end cap resulted in significant changes in repeat entry behaviour into the 50 and 100 mm tunnels. Addition of a mesh end cap appeared to discourage stoats from entering 50 mm tunnels. During field trials, stoats were detected in both open and closed-ended tunnels, but more frequently in closed-ended tunnels. The hair collection methods successfully collected adequate hair samples in the pen trials but did not perform as well in the field. Tunnel design does influence stoat entry behaviour and all new tunnel designs should undergo testing prior to use in the field. With no difference in initial entry behaviour, a small (50 mm) closed-ended tunnel is likely to reduce non-target entries and position the stoat correctly for a humane kill with the new kill device...|$|E

The physical model involves a buried pipe installed in granular material subjected to strip surface loading.

To further study the distribution of pressure on the buried structure and the soil-geogrid interaction, numerical analyses are performed using a multi-scale finite-discrete element framework that allows for both the explicit modeling of soil particles using discrete elements and the modeling of the embedded structure using finite elements. The numerical framework is first validated using the experimental results and then used to investigate the detailed behavior of the soil-pipe system...|$|R
