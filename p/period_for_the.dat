5|$|According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a {{problematic}} <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Workshop. Other than Sesame Street, {{many of its}} productions were not successful. 3-2-1 Contact premiered during 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like Square One Television, which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s {{to work on their}} licensing agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of civil wars, Ladislaus's main focus was the {{restoration}} of public safety.

Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years. His relationship with the Holy See deteriorated during the last years of his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.|$|E

After completing a long-planned visit to Yellowstone National Park and other Western sites with his brother William, Sherman returned to a second special session of Congress in October 1881.|$|E

5|$|Born in Hood River, Oregon, on October 19, 1916, Minoru Yasui {{was the son}} of Japanese {{immigrants}} Shidzuyo and Masuo Yasui.

At the age of eight he spent a summer in Japan, and later was enrolled in a Japanese language school in Oregon for three years. Yasui went on to college after high school at the University of Oregon in Eugene. At the school Yasui earned a bachelor's degree from the school in 1937 and a law degree from the University of Oregon Law School in 1939.

5|$|Colonel Joseph Hawkesworth, {{responsible}} {{for the implementation of}} the slighting, acquired the estate for himself and converted Leicester's gatehouse into a house; part of the base court was turned into a farm, and many of the remaining buildings were stripped for their materials. In 1660 Charles II was restored to the throne, and Hawkesworth was promptly evicted from Kenilworth. The Queen Mother, Henrietta Maria, briefly regained the castle, with the Earls of Monmouth acting as stewards once again, but after her death King Charles II granted the castle to Sir Edward Hyde, whom he later created Baron Hyde of Hindon and Earl of Clarendon. The ruined castle continued {{to be used as a}} farm, with the gatehouse as the principal dwelling; the King's Gate was added to the outer bailey wall during this <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of farm workers.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being an}} internationally {{successful}} film, Let the Right One In was not submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The details surrounding the film's eligibility for the award resulted in some confusion. Being released on 24 October 2008, the film {{would normally be}} eligible for submission for the 82nd Academy Awards. However, the producers decided to release it on 24 September as a seven-day limited run only in Luleå. This would be exactly enough to meet the criteria for the 81st Academy Awards instead. When the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September announced that Jan Troell's Everlasting Moments had been selected instead of Let the Right One In, the Luleå screenings were cancelled. Despite {{the fact that the}} film was released within the eligibility <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 82nd Academy Awards, it wasn't among the films considered because the Swedish Film Institute doesn't allow a film to be considered twice.|$|E
5|$|Flood {{waters in}} Miami-Dade County covered about 40,000acres (160km²) of farmland.

Flooded nurseries and fields resulted in about $500million in agricultural damage, including $60million in tropical fruit and $397million in ornamental crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture declared 16Florida counties, including Miami-Dade, Collier, and Palm Beach, as primary disaster areas due to flooding, making farmers and their families there eligible for USDA emergency farm loans. The same agency made 22 other counties, including Broward, eligible for loans due to their proximity to the disaster areas.|$|E

In the 1947–48 season, Real Madrid finished eleventh, which remains, as of 2014, the club's lowest finishing position. Real Madrid won La Liga four {{times and the}} European Cup five times during the 1950s. However, the most successful <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club in terms of domestic titles was the 1960s, when Real Madrid won eight league championships.

5|$|In 1930, Hart {{applied for}} and was {{appointed}} to the position of Administrator of Western Samoa, which was controlled by New Zealand under a mandate from the League of Nations. This was a difficult <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> colony as many of its citizens wanted independence. The Mau movement in particular was agitating for self-determination and employed tactics of civil disobedience as a means of opposing the New Zealand administration. After some heavy-handed management of protestors by his predecessor had resulted in several deaths amongst the movement, Hart made progress in improving relationships with the Mau when he took up his position in 1931. He also returned some financial stability to the colony which had struggled during the Great Depression. Hart was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services in Samoa shortly before completing his term as administrator and returning to New Zealand in July 1935.|$|E

Unable to confront the Mongols and their leader Nogai Khan, in 1292 he abandoned the throne and fled to the Byzantine Empire. In 1292 Joachim III crowned as Emperor the influential magnate Smilets (r. 1292–1298), whose family held extensive lands between the Balkan Mountains and Sredna Gora.

The River Avill was important for trade; the region around Dunster was rich with fisheries and vineyards, and Dunster Castle prospered. Stone fortifications were built on the site during the early 12th century, probably forming a shell keep around the top of the motte.|$|E
