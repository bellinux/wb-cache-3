5|$|An {{assistant}} of LeHand's, Grace Tully, {{took over}} as Roosevelt's secretary, but was never a companion for Roosevelt {{in the same way}} as LeHand had been. After Missy departed the White House, she never saw FDR again, though he did keep in touch with letters, <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> <b>and</b> by sending gifts. In the fall of 1941, FDR rewrote his will to leave half of the annual income from his estate (which was eventually probated at more than $3 million) for LeHand's care, and half to Eleanor. The will stated that upon LeHand's death the income would go to Eleanor, with the principal eventually divided equally among his children. As LeHand died before FDR, her half reverted to Eleanor.|$|E
