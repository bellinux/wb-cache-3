2500|$|Kitana's {{weapon of}} choice {{is a pair of}} razor-edged steel fans, {{inspired}} by Japanese war fans and originally being fully metal. Kitana's fans during the production of MKII were not actually steel but made of a reflective <b>paper</b> <b>material,</b> and were Zamiar's own training fans. Following her MKII debut, Kitana was repeatedly removed from further sequels due to various circumstances, only to always return in a port or an update, as it was the case with UMK3/Trilogy after her absence in MK3, Gold after her absence in Mortal Kombat 4, and [...] after her absence in Deception. In Gold, Kitana uses a throwing weapon, the [...] "Flying Blade," [...] which is similar to Tanya's sharp boomerang due to the two characters' linked development history in the original version of Mortal Kombat 4. In Mortal Kombat X, Kitana can use either her own weapons or those of Jade from previous games: a telescoping staff, and a glaive throwing blade that is guidable in midflight.|$|E
50|$|Paper {{briquettes}} are the {{byproduct of}} a briquettor, which compresses shredded <b>paper</b> <b>material</b> {{into a small}} cylindrical form. Briquettors are often sold as add-on systems to existing disintegrator or rotary knife mill shredding systems. The NSA has a maximum particle size regulation for shredded <b>paper</b> <b>material</b> that is passed through a disintegrator or rotary knife mill, which typically does not exceed 1/8” square. This means that material exiting a disintegrator is the appropriate size for compression into paper briquettes, as opposed to strip-cut shredders which produce long sheets of paper.|$|E

30|$|The {{second phase}} {{of this study is}} the {{evaluation}} of this system. Students’ learning achievement and satisfaction were analyzed by a content test and a questionnaire adaptation of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). All students were randomly assigned into three groups: traditional, blended, and fully on-line groups. Among these three groups, traditional group studied and took tests with <b>paper</b> <b>materials,</b> blended group studied with digital online system but took tests with <b>paper</b> <b>materials,</b> and fully on-line group studied and took tests one digital online basis. The research procedure included three steps and two hours for the implementation. First, students were randomly assigned into groups and seated. After explaining the research procedures, they started to learn online or study with <b>paper</b> <b>materials</b> according to their groups. Third, after the learning period, students took either online tests or paper tests to measure their learning achievement and answered TAM questionnaires to measure their learning satisfaction.|$|R

Shegeru Ban is also known for his humanistic beliefs and social orientation. He built shelters for refuges in Africa and South America. There he noticed that cheap plastic shelters were too cold for people and it was more appropriate to use paper shelters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work is {{concerned}} with the adhesion strength between a paper web and a metal roll surface, which is a common situation in paper machines world-wide. It is shown that the classic expression relating the work of adhesion to the peeling angle and web tension is, in general, insufficient. An improved model is suggested {{to take into account the}} energy dissipation due to elastic–plastic deformation behavior of wet <b>paper</b> <b>materials.</b> To judge the model, an industrially relevant example of wet newsprint and a mild steel surface is studied. It is found that the agreement between theory and experimental observations is excellent. A key result is that elastic–plastic material behavior must always be included for wet <b>paper</b> <b>materials</b> in peeling processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} polymer {{behavior}} over time represents the crucial {{stage in the}} setup of innovative methodologies for paper restoration. In this research, a series of laboratory simulations by accelerated aging and characterization tests by chemical and physical measurements were carried out on paper samples consolidated both by grafting polymerization with acrylic copolymers and by coating with waterborne polyurethanes {{with the aim of}} determining their harmlessness and long-term effectiveness. In this way, our purpose was not only to verify possible risks for the <b>paper</b> <b>materials</b> but also to determine the advantages and potentialities of new restoration methods through an appropriate and essential working plan of investigations. From our evaluation, both the selected consolidation methods appeared unsuitable to be used in paper restoration because of the damage that they could cause on the <b>paper</b> <b>materials</b> because of their limited durability over time...|$|R
50|$|In 1926 a {{high-profile}} counterfeit scandal {{came to light}} in Hungary, when several people were arrested in the Netherlands while attempting to procure 10 million francs' worth of fake French 1000-franc bills which had been produced in Hungary; after 3 years, the state-sponsored industrial scale counterfeit operation had finally collapsed. The League of Nations' investigation found Hungary's motives were to avenge its post-WWI territorial losses (blamed on Georges Clemenceau) and to use profits from the counterfeiting business to boost a militarist, border-revisionist ideology. Germany and Austria had {{an active role in}} the conspiracy, which required special machinery.

50|$|Along with fibres, paper {{can contain}} {{a variety of}} {{inorganic}} and organic constituents, including up to 10,000 different chemicals, which can potentially contaminate the newly manufactured paper products. As an example, bisphenol A (a chemical commonly found in thermal paper) has been verified as a contaminant {{in a variety of}} paper products resulting from paper recycling. Furthermore, groups of chemicals as phthalates, phenols, mineral oils, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and toxic metals have all been identified in <b>paper</b> <b>material.</b> Although several measures might reduce the chemical load in paper recycling (e.g., improved decontamination, optimized collection of paper for recycling), even completely terminating the use of a particular chemical (phase-out) might still result in its circulation in the paper cycle for decades.|$|E
50|$|Development of the {{gun barrel}} and the projectile-fire cannon began in 10th century China as 'fire lances' which {{appeared}} {{as early as the}} year 950. These 'fire-lances' were in widespread use in China by the early 12th century, and commonly featured hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to fire gunpowder with lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards. Perishable bamboo was replaced with durable composite <b>paper</b> <b>material,</b> and then with hollow tubes of cast iron, after which the 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') became known as the 'fire-tube' ('huo tong'). These fire tubes were also known as 'eruptors,' which fired co-viative projectiles, unlike true cannons. The 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao') was a tube of bronze or cast iron that was capable of firing 100 lead balls.|$|E
