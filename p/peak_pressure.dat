5|$|Late on January 1, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{reported}} that {{an area of}} deep atmospheric convection had persisted for the last 48hours about 730km (455mi), to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convection was developing over the northern quadrant of a weak low level circulation center. A subtropical ridge of pressure was helping to guide the disturbance and was providing good outflow as well as low to moderate vertical wind shear. However, as the disturbance was moving into {{a higher level of}} vertical wind shear the depression was not expected to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 48 hours. During the next 48 hours the disturbance gradually developed, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reporting early on January 3 that it had become the first tropical depression of the season, with the name Auring being assigned to the depression by PAGASA whilst it was located about 140km (85mi) east of Surigao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. This came after the low level circulation center had started to consolidate as deep convection was being fueled by a poleward diffluence despite being in an area of strong vertical wind shear. Over {{the next couple of days}} as Auring moved towards the east, dry air started to wrap in to its low level circulation center which started to weaken the depression after it had peaked with winds of 45km/h, (30mph) 10-min sustained and a <b>peak</b> <b>pressure</b> of 1006 hPa/Mbar. As the baroclinic zone approached the depression late on January 5, PAGASA downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure as the baroclinic zone was approaching the depression, as vertical wind shear had increased and outflow became hindered. However the JMA continued to issue warnings on the depression until early the next morning when the depression was declared dissipated by the JTWC and the JMA.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHCCI mode of {{combustion}} {{is known}} for simultaneous reduction of NOx and PM emissions besides yielding low specific fuel consumption. The nature of volumetric combustion of HCCI engine leads {{to the development of}} high <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> inside the combustion chamber. This high <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> may damage the engine, limiting the HCCI engine life period and thus demands sturdy designs. In this study an attempt is made to analyze computationally the effect of induction swirl in reducing the <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> of a HCCI engine under various operating parameters. For the study, specifications of a single cylinder 1. 6 L, reentrant piston bowl diesel engine are chosen. For the computational analysis ECFM- 3 Z model of STARCD is considered. This model is suitable to analyze the combustion processes in SI and CI engines. As HCCI engine is a hybrid version of SI and CI engines, ECFM- 3 Z model with necessary modifications is used to analyze the <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> inside the combustion chamber. The ECFM- 3 Z model for HCCI mode of combustion is validated with the existing literature {{to make sure that the}} results obtaining are accurate. Numerical experiments are performed to study the effect of compression ratio, equivalence ratio, exhaust gas recirculation and boost pressure under different swirl ratios in reducing the in-cylinder <b>peak</b> <b>pressures.</b> The results showed that swirl ratio has a considerable impact in limiting the <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> of HCCI engine. The analysis resulted in achieving about 21 % reduction in <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> are achieved when a swirl ratio of 4 with 30 % EGR is adopted when compared to a swirl ratio of 1 with 0 % EGR. The study revealed that out of the four operating parameters selected, lower compression ratios, higher EGR concentrations, lower equivalence ratios, lower boost pressures and higher swirl ratios are favorable in reducing the <b>peak</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Claw {{lameness}} may {{be associated}} with biomechanical factors caused by imbalances of the pressure distribution under hooves when cows are confined on hard concrete flooring. Using a system based on a thin pressure measurement film (Matscan, Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, Mass.) developed forpressure distribution analysis of human feet, the pressures under the hooves of a population sample of 32 cows divided into trimmed and untrimmed groups were measured under dynamic conditions (stance phase) and compared to evaluate the effects of trimming in correcting the imbalance caused by overgrowth of hoof tissues. The results, obtained for three different points of the stance phase, showed that the pressure distribution under the medial sole, heel bulb, and toe of trimmed cows changed slightly as compared to untrimmed cows. The medial sole displayed higher <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> as compared to the heel bulb and toe, which displayed lower <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> at the midstance phase. In the acceleration phase, the overall <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> shifted to the toe, except on the rear feet of untrimmed cows, which maintained slightly greater (2. 5 %) <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> at the heel bulb than at the toe. The deceleration phase showed similar <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> at the heel bulb and lateral sole for both trimmed and untrimmed cows. It was concluded that trimming results in slightly higher pressures towards the medial sole. This may help improve gait stability by removing some of the <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> at the heel bulb and lateral sole (weight-bearing border). However, the higher <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> at the medial sole may cause an increase in stresses on that region and favor the incidence of lesions, particularly sole ulcers...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} the position of the rearfoot and the distribution of forefoot plantar pressures and skin callosities in rheumatoid arthritis. METHOD: Plantar pressures and callosity patterns were measured in 102 rheumatoid arthritis patients (120 feet with normal heel alignment and 84 feet with valgus heel alignment measured by goniometry) and in 42 (84 feet) age matched healthy adults. <b>Peak</b> <b>pressures</b> (kPa) were measured across the metatarsal heads in-shoe using an FScan system and the distribution of plantar callosities was visually mapped for each foot. RESULTS: <b>Peak</b> <b>pressures</b> were significantly greater at all but the first metatarsal head in the rheumatoid normal heel alignment and healthy adult groups than in the rheumatoid valgus heel group. The feet of both the rheumatoid normal heel group and the healthy adult group behaved the same, the highest <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> registering on the central metatarsal heads. However, only in the rheumatoid group were plantar callosities found at these sites. In the rheumatoid valgus heel group, lateral metatarsal heads were frequently non-weightbearing, producing gross loading patterns with a dominant medial distribution. <b>Peak</b> <b>pressures</b> were shifted to the medial fore-foot accompanied by a higher prevalence of callosities. The results, however, failed to establish clearly an association between <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> and callus formation.

25|$|It {{was water}} hammer {{that caused the}} {{physical}} damage to the reactor, the deaths of personnel who stood atop and nearby, {{and the release of}} radioactive isotopes to the environment. One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit <b>peak</b> <b>pressure.</b> The extra water is also a very effective radiation shield for those who are directly above the vessel.

40|$|PURPOSE: SUI (Stress Urinary Incontinence) {{results from}} sudden {{increases}} in intravesical <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> exceeding urethral resistance leading to involuntary urine loss. Obesity and smoking are well established reversible {{risk factors for}} SUI and may alter intravesical <b>peak</b> <b>pressures.</b> BMI, smoking status, and other clinical factors were studied to determine their relationship to CIPP (maximal Intravesical <b>Peak</b> <b>Pressures</b> generated by Cough) in SUI complaining women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred nineteen women complaining of SUI were evaluated with medical history and urodynamics. Age, parity, comorbidities, previous surgery, BMI and history of smoking were obtained. The maximal intravesical <b>peak</b> <b>pressures</b> generated by cough (CIPP) and cough leak point pressure (CLPP) were acquired. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Current smokers and former smokers had similar CIPP (170 cmH 2 O and 170 cmH 2 O; p = 0. 5, respectively); Those individuals who had never smoked had significantly lower CIPP (140 cmH 2 O; p = 0. 000 and p = 0. 009 respectively). BMI was directly related to CIPP (r = 0. 41; p = 0. 000). Vaginal deliveries (r = - 0. 15, p = 0. 08) and diabetes (r = 0. 15, p = 0. 016) were also directly related to CIPP on univariate analysis. Only smoking status (p = 0. 000) and BMI (p = 0. 000) were independently significantly related to CIPP on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and smoking showed increased CIPP (maximal Intravesical <b>Peak</b> <b>Pressures</b> generated by Cough). While reduced BMI is related to lower CIPP, smoking cessation {{does not appear to}} diminish CIPP. These findings suggest that weight loss may reduce incontinence by CIPP modulation.
