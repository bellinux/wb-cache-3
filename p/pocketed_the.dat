5|$|No {{conclusive}} proof of wrongdoing {{has come to}} light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he {{was found to have}} misused his expenses account, and to have <b>pocketed</b> <b>the</b> proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus. Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919, Arsenal have remained in the top division since then, and as a result hold the English record for the longest unbroken stretch of top-flight football.|$|E
5|$|Italian forces entered British Somaliland from Abyssinia on 4 August 1940, {{overcame the}} {{garrison}} at Hargeisa, and advanced north-east towards the capital Berbera. The British force, including {{a platoon of}} 43 Rhodesians in the 2nd Battalion of the Black Watch, took up positions on six hills overlooking the only road towards Berbera and engaged the Italians at the Battle of Tug Argan. Amid heavy fighting, the Italians gradually made gains and by 14 August had almost <b>pocketed</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth forces. The British retreated to Berbera between 15 and 17 August, the Rhodesians making up the left flank of the rearguard, and by 18 August had evacuated by sea. The Italians took the city and completed their conquest of British Somaliland a day later.|$|E
5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and <b>pocketed</b> <b>the</b> key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E
5000|$|The game can {{be played}} by up to four players. The three- and four-player formats are team-based, and decided in the {{following}} way: 3 players: <b>The</b> player who <b>pockets</b> <b>the</b> 1 ball is solo {{for the duration of}} the game, and competes against the other two players, who are now teammates who shoot alternately against the first player. 4 players: <b>The</b> player who <b>pockets</b> <b>the</b> 1 ball remains alone until the lowest-numbered money ball is pocketed by another player, making those two players teammates. For example, if one player <b>pockets</b> <b>the</b> 1 ball, and another <b>pockets</b> <b>the</b> 5 ball, they become teammates, competing against players three and four, who are also now teammates. If a single player <b>pockets</b> <b>the</b> 1 and 5 balls, this player is partnered with <b>the</b> player who <b>pockets</b> <b>the</b> 8 ball. If the 1, 5 and 8 ball are <b>pocketed</b> by <b>the</b> one player, the 10 ball then becomes the pairing ball, and so on.|$|R

5|$|The {{trial began}} in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley {{conducted}} his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for {{far less than the}} prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had <b>pocketed</b> <b>the</b> difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{returned}} to the bowling crease in England's second innings. He immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. However, Miller did not take a wicket and ended with 0/15 from 14 overs, but again caught Compton. Not {{for the first time}} during the season, the Australian paceman riled the crowd when he launched a series of short-pitched balls at Edrich, apparently in retaliation for the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. The paceman struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop his short-pitched barrage. In another incident, Miller was playing poker with the Englishmen during a rain delay. When the weather cleared, Hassett beckoned him to return to the field for the resumption. Miller ignored him and the poker match continued against the English players who were not currently batting. He won the pot and <b>pocketed</b> <b>the</b> money, before hurriedly running onto the ground late. When he was on the field and approaching the centre, Miller pulled the money out of his pockets. He brandished the notes to the crowd and taunted his English colleagues. The match ended in a draw after the entire fourth day and half of the fifth day was washed out. England declared upon the resumption of play on the final day and set Australia a target of 317 for victory. The tourists reached 1/92 to ensure a draw.|$|E
5|$|Overcrowding was {{a serious}} problem {{in many of the}} ad hoc {{secondary}} camps set up in the Saigon region, and led to public health issues. The Biên Hòa region on the northeastern outskirts of Saigon was scheduled to have a capacity of 100,000 refugees, but this was soon exceeded. In the Ho Nai camp near Bien Hoa, which was supposed to hold only 10,000 refugees, more than 41,000 were present by the end of 1954. The area surrounding Thủ Dầu Một north of the southern capital had initially been allocated a quota of 20,000 even though there was no rice paddies in the area. The area near Tây Ninh was to accommodate 30,000 people, although the locals thought that 100,000 could fit in. Some large Catholic settlements such as Thủ Đức, Bình Thạnh and Gò Vấp on the outskirts of Saigon have now been subsumed by urban sprawl and are now districts of the city. Because of the excessive number of inhabitants, the infrastructure at many camps could not cope and the promises made to the refugees were not kept. American military doctors travelled around the south in groups of three, and because of the paucity of health professionals, saw around 150–450 patients per day. They were also hampered by customs law, which only allowed charities to bring medicine into the country without taxation. This forced them to turn to charitable organisations as a conduit, creating another layer of bureaucracy. This was exacerbated by the fact that some corrupt Vietnamese officials <b>pocketed</b> <b>the</b> medical aid.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to receiving compensation, farmers whose land {{was used to}} build the structures were paid after the war to fill in ditches and trenches and to demolish pillboxes.

A few remain, much humbled, as field drains or field boundaries, whereas others can be seen only as crop marks. In the case of pillboxes, the sum of £5 is sometimes mentioned to pay for demolition, but the challenge of demolishing such structures is considerable and it seems that most farmers <b>pocketed</b> <b>the</b> cash, treating it as compensation.|$|E

By the end of February 1981, 680,000DMs had been paid for the diaries, only around half of which was received by Kujau.

[...] He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. [...] Standing {{to the right of the}} film screen, he introduced [...] "the only dinosaur in captivity". [...] As the film started Gertie poked her head out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. [...] He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and <b>pocketed</b> <b>the</b> apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat.
