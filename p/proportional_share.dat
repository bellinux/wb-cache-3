This latter function shows how re-injected throughput must be shared among users inside WLAN range of injecting user. In particular, we analyzed {{the case of}} flat-rate sharing and the case of <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing.</b> We found that the results achieved in the <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing</b> scenario are more interesting compared to those achieved in the flat-rate scenario. Moreover, <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing</b> scheme presents better fairness properties; {{this is because the}} distribution of the sharing-rate depends on the demand of each user.

2500|$|A mixed {{compensatory}} {{system is}} an electoral {{system that is}} mixed, meaning that it combines a plurality/majority formula with a proportional formula, and that uses the proportional component to compensate for disproportionality caused by the plurality/majority component. For example, suppose that a party wins 10 seats based on plurality, but requires 15 seats in total to obtain its <b>proportional</b> <b>share</b> of an elected body. A fully proportional mixed compensatory system would award this party 5 compensatory (PR) seats, raising the party's seat count from 10 to 15. The most prominent mixed compensatory system is mixed member proportional representation (MMP), used in Germany since 1949. In MMP, the seats won by plurality are associated with single-member districts.|$|E

I brought this under the consideration of the House, by an expository and argumentative speech on Mr. Hare's plan; and subsequently I was active in support of the very imperfect substitute for that plan, which, in a small number of constituencies, Parliament was induced to adopt. This poor makeshift had scarcely any recommendation, except that it was a partial recognition of the evil which it did so little to remedy. As such, however, it was attacked by the same fallacies, and required to be defended on the same principles, as a really good measure; and its adoption in a few Parliamentary elections, as well as the subsequent introduction of what is called the Cumulative Vote in the elections for the London School Board, have had the good effect of converting the equal claim of all electors to a <b>proportional</b> <b>share</b> in the representation, from a subject of merely speculative discussion, into a question of practical politics, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new method {{to trace the}} {{transmission}} loss in deregulated power system by incorporating the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). The idea is to use GA to find the optimal values of hyper-parameters of LS-SVM and adopts a supervised learning approach to train the LS-SVM model. The <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing</b> method (PSM) is proposed to trace the transmission loss at each transmission line which is then utilized as a teacher in the proposed hybrid technique called GA-SVM method. Based on load profile as inputs and PSM output for transmission loss allocation, the GA-SVM model is expected to learn which generators are responsible for transmission losses.

40|$|Abstract:- Open {{access is}} an {{essential}} feature in the deregulated power system. It permits all the generators to transmit power into the system. Depending upon the transmission network parameters, generator responses to the variation in loads differ from each other. To know these responses is important from various aspects such as for determination of nodal prices which will be needed in charging differential tariffs and also in congestion management. By considering the load flow changes due to change in load at a bus, electricity tracing is applied to compute the generator participation factors. A new algorithm of <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing</b> principle is developed. A sensitivity analysis is proposed to determine these changes in power flows due to changed load. This new approach for determination of generators participation could be more appropriate {{when compared with the}} other method based on <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing</b> principle of electricity tracin...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{takes an}} axiomatic {{approach}} to determining “Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory” (“FRAND”) royalties for intellectual property (“IP”) rights. Drawing on the extensive game theory literature on “surplus sharing/cost sharing” problems, I describe specific formulas for determining license fees {{that can be}} derived from basic fairness principles. In particular, I describe the Shapley Value, the <b>Proportional</b> <b>Sharing</b> Rule and the Nucleolus. The <b>Proportional</b> <b>Sharing</b> Rule has the advantage that it is the only rule that is invariant to mergers and splitting of the IP owners. I also explain why, at times, there may be no acceptable to solution. Further, I contrast these rules with the Efficient Component Pricing Rule (“ECPR”) suggested by Baumol and Swanson. Unlike, the ECPR, the rules identified in this paper can uniquely determine license fees when {{there is more than one}} owner of essential IP, and also incorporate various notions of fairness and equity. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{resource allocation}} games with heterogeneous users and identical resources. Most {{of the previous}} work considered cost structures with either negative or positive congestion effects. We study a cost structure that encompasses both the resource’s load and the job’s share in the resource’s activation cost. We consider the <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing</b> rule, where the resource’s activation cost is shared among its users proportionally to their lengths. We also challenge the assumption regarding {{the existence of a}} fixed set of resources, and consider settings with an unlimited supply of resources. We provide results with respect to equilibrium existence, computation, convergence and quality. We show that if the resource’s activation cost is shared equally among its users, a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) might not exist. In contrast, under the <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing</b> rule, a pure NE always exists, and can be computed in polynomial time. Yet, starting at an arbitrary profile of actions, best-response dynamics might not converge to a NE. Finally, we prove that the price of anarchy is unbounded and the price of stability is between 18 / 17 and 5 / 4. ...|$|R
40|$|Fully {{distributed}} storage {{systems have}} gained {{popularity in the}} past few years because of their ability to use cheap commodity hardware and their high scalability. While there are a number of algorithms for providing differentiated quality of service to clients of a centralized storage system, the problem has not been solved for distributed storage systems. Providing performance guarantees in distributed storage systems is more complex because clients may have different data layouts and access their data through different coordinators (access nodes), yet the performance guarantees required are global. This paper presents a distributed scheduling framework. It is an adaptation of fair queuing algorithms for distributed servers. Specifically, upon scheduling each request, it enforces an extra delay (possibly zero) that corresponds to the amount of service the client gets on other servers. Different performance goals, e. g., per storage node <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing,</b> total service <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing</b> or mixed, can be met by different delay functions. The delay functions can be calculated at coordinators locally so excess communication is avoided. The analysis and experimental results show that the framework can enforce performance goals under different data layouts and workloads. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} global (also called isarithmic) {{congestion}} avoidance in computer com-munication networks. In this technique, data traffic inside a computer network is {{kept to a}} comfortable level by imposing an upper limit {{on the number of}} data packets that can be present in the network at any time. This technique is implemented by using permits. A message seeking entry into the network must acquire a permit and a message leaving the network must release the permit. The paper shows that performance of a computer network using isarithmic congestion avoidance, depends upon the distribution of permits among the network nodes. The paper considers three schemes for distribution of permits: com-plete sharing (CS), complete partitioning (CP), and <b>proportional</b> <b>sharing</b> (PS). The main idea behind these schemes is to prevent active users from monopolizing all the permits and also to prevent relatively inactive users from starving for permits.
