50|$|The initial {{doses of}} <b>premazepam</b> given to human test {{subjects}} demonstrated similar psychological test results to those produced by diazepam. It was also demonstrated that initial dosing with <b>premazepam</b> produces similar sedative effects {{as compared with}} diazepam, although psychomotor impairments are greater with <b>premazepam</b> than with diazepam after initial dosing. However, with repeated dosing {{for more than one}} day <b>premazepam</b> causes less sedation and less psychomotor impairment than diazepam. <b>Premazepam</b> possesses sedative and anxiolytic properties. <b>Premazepam</b> produces more slow wave and less fast wave EEG changes than diazepam. Tests have shown that 7.5 mg of <b>premazepam</b> is approximately equivalent to 5 mg of diazepam.|$|E
50|$|<b>Premazepam</b> is a pyrrolodiazepine {{benzodiazepine}} {{and acts}} as a partial agonist at benzodiazepine receptors. The mean time taken to reach peak plasma levels is 2 hours and the mean half life of <b>premazepam</b> in humans is 11.5 hours. About 90% of the drug is excreted in unchanged form. Of the remaining 10% of the drug none of the metabolites showed any pharmacological activity. Thus <b>premazepam</b> produces no active metabolites in humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Premazepam</b> is a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. It is {{a partial}} agonist of benzodiazepine receptors and {{was shown in}} 1984 to possess both anxiolytic and sedative properties in humans but was never marketed.|$|E
5000|$|While through {{recent history}} most {{designer}} drugs had been either opioids, hallucinogens, or anabolic steroids, {{the range of}} possible compounds is limited only by the scientific and patent literature, and recent years have been characterised by a broadening {{of the range of}} compounds sold as designer drugs. These have included a wide variety of designer stimulants such as geranamine, mephedrone, MDPV and desoxypipradrol, several designer sedatives such as methylmethaqualone and <b>premazepam,</b> and designer analogues of sildenafil (Viagra), which have been reported as active compounds in [...] "herbal" [...] aphrodisiac products. Designer cannabinoids are another recent development, with two compounds JWH-018 and (C8)-CP 47,497 initially found in December 2008 as active components of [...] "herbal smoking blends" [...] sold as legal alternatives to marijuana, and subsequently a growing range of synthetic cannabinoid agonists have continued to appear, including by 2010 novel compounds such as RCS-4, RCS-8, and AB-001, which had never been reported in the literature, and appear to have been invented by designer drug manufacturers themselves. Another novel development is the use of research ligands for cosmetic rather than strictly recreational purposes, such as grey-market internet sales of the non-approved alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone tanning drugs known as melanotan peptides.|$|E
40|$|Pharmacological {{studies of}} <b>premazepam</b> in animals {{predicted}} antianxiety activity without sedation and, {{in combination with}} diazepam, {{a reduction in the}} sedative effects of the latter. The effects of single doses of <b>premazepam</b> (25 and 50 mg), diazepam (10 mg), <b>premazepam</b> (25 mg) plus diazepam (10 mg), and a placebo on subjective feelings, psychological tests and the EEG were studied in a double-blind cross-over study in 10 healthy subjects. In a repeated dose study in eight subjects, the effects on subjective feelings, psychological tests and the EEG of <b>premazepam</b> (5 and 10 mg twice-daily), diazepam (5 mg twice-daily) and a placebo were compared. <b>Premazepam</b> had a different EEG profile from diazepam, producing more slow and less fast wave activity. In the single dose study its effects were similar to diazepam for sedative action and most of the psychological tests, with a tendency towards greater psychomotor impairment. In the repeated dose study, however, <b>premazepam</b> caused less sedation and also tended to produce less psychomotor impairment. The combination dose of <b>premazepam</b> (25 mg) plus diazepam (10 mg) in the single dose study indicated an additive effect rather than an antagonistic one...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [55]- 62) Female Swiss albino mice {{were tested}} on an accelerating rotorod {{and in a}} light-dark apparatus {{in order to measure}} the sedative and anxiolytic properties, respectively, of the putative nonsedative anxiolytics buspirone, <b>premazepam,</b> and C 1218, 872. Comparisons were made against mice injected with vehicle and mice treated with the sedative anxiolytic diazepam which was used as a standard. Ephedrine was included as a control for stimulant effects in the light-dark apparatus, and ethyl-beta-carboline- 3 - carboxylate was also used in the light-dark apparatus in an attempt to assess its presumed anxiogenic effects. The results from the accelerating rotorod indicated that buspirone, <b>premazepam,</b> and diazepam all produced significant, dose-dependent sedative effects, suggesting that the accelerating feature of the rotorod may provide a more sensitive test for sedation than most experimental techniques currently in use. The results from the light-dark apparatus were more variable. Of the drugs tested, only buspirone produced a significant anxiolytic response across all doses. Diazepam produced results that were contradictory with previous findings that used a similar apparatus and the same doses. Methodological considerations regarding this model of the anxiolytic response are discussed. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|E
