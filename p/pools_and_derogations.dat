30|$|The key {{question}} {{in the context of}} storage of health data is always with regard to the purpose. The GDPR provides several exemptions <b>and</b> <b>derogations</b> for the use of health data, e.g. in the context of research or public health purposes under certain conditions. Typical procedures in this context include the application of ethical standards for scientific research as mentioned in Recital 33 and the implementation of organisational and technical safeguards as mentioned in Article 89 including anonymisation, pseudonymisation and encryption [2]. Pseudonymisation is generally recommended as long as the research purposes can be fulfilled in this manner. With the condition of such safeguards, the GDPR creates exemptions for researchers to process sensitive health data even beyond the purposes for which they were collected. In addition, the GDPR provides some room for manoeuvre for national regulations (derogations defined by a law) in this context. It is clearly emphasised, however, that exemptions <b>and</b> <b>derogations</b> for research purposes should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers, insurance or banking companies (Recital 54, [1].|$|R
40|$|People {{are confronted}} with {{injustice}} and innocent victims on a regular basis. Reactions toward victims can range from going {{to great lengths to}} help or support the victims in order to alleviate their ill fate to harsh negative reactions often resulting in blaming and derogating the victims for what happened to them. In my dissertation, I addressed two questions regarding social justice and reactions toward victims of injustice. Why do people blame innocent victims? And how can we transform derogatory reactions into more benevolent reactions? Previous research has shown that victim blaming <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> paradoxically stem from people’s belief in a just world (BJW). Innocent victims threaten the BJW and victim blaming <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> help restore the belief. Research even showed that negative reactions are enhanced when the victim is similar to the observer, presumably because victim similarity enhances experienced BJW threat. I added to these findings by showing that perpetrator similarity influences victim blaming <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> in a similar manner. Hence, proximity of the injustice in a broader sense seems to influence experienced BJW threat and subsequent reactions to resolve the threat. In subsequent studies, I showed that in today’s future-oriented society people experience more personal uncertainty. To deal with these aversive feelings, people hold on to the BJW more strongly and victim blaming <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> are enhanced. Together, these lines of research help gain progressive insights into the psychological underpinnings of the paradoxical negative reactions toward innocent victims of injustice. The second part of the dissertation was devoted to incorporating the more benign reactions toward innocent victims of injustice that do occur in real life, but that have received only minor attention in social justice research. I investigated the processes that influence whether people are more prone to make sense of this injustice by either negative or positive reactions. My results indicate that people become spontaneously avoidance motivated and self-focused, when confronted with innocent victims of injustice. These factors make derogatory reactions toward victims a likely strategy {{to make sense of the}} injustice. However, these reactions can be counteracted and may even be transformed in more benign ways of dealing with injustice, such as support and help for the victims involved, by instilling an other-focus or an approach motivation. With the research presented in this dissertation, I showed that making sense of injustice can be accomplished both by benign and derogatory reactions to innocent victims...|$|R

40|$|People tend to derogate their ideological opponents. But {{how does}} social status affect this tendency? We tested a {{prediction}} derived from hierometer theory {{that people with}} higher status would derogate ideological opponents less (i. e., evaluate them more charitably).

40|$|Two factors {{increase}} the threat for individuals’ {{belief in a}} just world (BJW) posed by an innocent victim: the degree of the observer’s explicit endorsement of BJW {{and the fact that}} the victim shares a common identity with the observer. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether or not these two factors (BJW and ingroup identiﬁcation) have an interaction effect on each of two mechanisms that reduce the threat to BJW: victim <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> psychological distancing from the victims. In two studies with university students we predicted and found that BJW interacted with identiﬁcation with an ingroup victim to predict victim <b>derogation</b> (Study 1) <b>and</b> disidentiﬁcation from the group shared with the victim (Study 2).

News reports have blamed individuals with overweight and obesity for various societal issues including prices of fuel, global temperature trends, and precipitating weight gain among their peers.

Programs also often depict them as the targets of teasing <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> often portray heavy characters displaying eating behaviors stereotypical to overweight and obesity. This relatively low social status assigned to characters with overweight and obesity in television is also evidenced in children’s television, a tendency that perpetuates antifat attitudes among viewers. In terms of media attention for obesity itself, a recent review by Puhl and Suh (2015) revealed that obesity-related media campaigns that used stigmatizing messages in fact undermine motivations and intentions to pursue healthy eating and exercise behaviors.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} summarizes {{my program}} {{of research that}} utilized a motivated reasoning perspective to examine {{factors that contribute to}} prejudice, discrimination and victim blame. After briefly introducing the work, I start with a review of motivated reasoning, and in particular system justification theory, as a theoretical backdrop with which to examine work ethic and just-world beliefs. Study 1 examined the effects of individual differences in endorsement of work ethic, applicant race, and resume quality on thoughts, impressions, and support for hiring in response to an individual applying for a job. Results indicated that when participants high in work-ethic beliefs were presented with an applicant whose resume quality was low and who was also Black, they were motivated to use the resume quality information as an additional piece of evidence to justify disadvantaged group status. Studies 2 and 3 examined the role of an applicant 2 ̆ 7 s sexual orientation, source of infection, and participants 2 ̆ 7 beliefs regarding whether sexual orientation as a choice in predicting support for admittance to a free prescription drug coverage program for individuals with HIV/AIDS. These studies found that when infection was uncontrollable, participants who believe that sexual orientation is a choice were less likely to support admittance for the gay (vs. heterosexual) applicant. In other words, these participants appear to have used the sexual orientation of the gay applicant as a way to explain infection (when infection was uncontrollable), thereby reducing the threat to their just world beliefs and justifying the system where gay men are a disadvantaged group. Study 3 also examined motivation to control prejudice as a competing motive that overrode these effects. Finally, Studies 4 and 5 examined individual differences in endorsement of just-world beliefs as a moderator of the effect of justice primes on victim blame (Studies 4 <b>and</b> 5) <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> (Study 5) in response to someone who has been laid off from their job. Results showed that priming justice-related values influenced both those low and high in endorsement of just-world beliefs, such that the justice-related primes resulted in increased system justification tendencies (i. e., greater victim blame <b>and</b> <b>derogation)</b> among those high in just-world beliefs. However, among those low in just-world beliefs, priming justice-related values resulted in reduced victim blame <b>and</b> <b>derogation,</b> indicating that the primes made these participants more aware of their beliefs that the system is not just. Together these studies help demonstrate the effects that motivated reasoning, and in particular the motive to system-justify, has on responses to others facing a wide variety of circumstances...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to investigate}} the attributive noun classes, {{as well as their}} suffixal counterparts, firstly in Bantu, and secondly in Zulu. The investigation will be done with reference to aspects such as the following: the general distribution, meaning and function of the attributive noun class prefixes in Bantu. This study will also investigate the distinction between those prefixes which are exclusively used to categorise size and shape deviations, namely those belonging to classes 12 / 13, 19, 20, 21 and 22; and those class prefixes which have a secondary function of indicating such deviations, namely the prefixes of classes 5 / 6, 7 / 8 and 11. The main concern {{is the way in which}} these prefixes are often associated with positive or negative emotive perceptions regarding size and shape, and are therefore often used to express amelioration <b>and</b> <b>derogation.</b> In languages such as Zulu and Northern Sotho the existence of possible frozen remnants of such attributive noun class prefixes will be investigated. Some Bantu languages such as Venda that express variations in size and shape as well as the emotive perception by means of suffixes, or by a combination of prefixes and suffixes will be investigated. The possible semantic overlap between the meanings expressed by attributive class prefixes, and/or between the meanings expressed by attributive class prefixes and so-called ‘attributive suffixes’ will also be scrutinized. Apart from the aspects mentioned above, the relationship between augmentative and diminutive suffixes and the notion [+ feminine] in languages such as Zulu and Northern Sotho will be scrutinized. The occurrence of the Zulu suffix -azana/-azane, which is apparently a combination of the diminutive and augmentative suffixes, will also be investigated. This study will firstly provide a typological overview of the various strategies employed in Bantu in order to express variations in shape and size, as well as of the emotive perceptions that accompany such variations. Secondly, this study will provide an insight into the way in which shape and size variations, amelioration <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> are expressed in Zulu through the utilisation of diminutive and augmentative suffixes. An indication will also be given of the possible diachronic development of attributive categories in this language. This study will make a significant contribution not only to the field of diachronic and comparative Bantu linguistics, but also to Zulu linguistics. This research will furthermore lead to a deeper understanding of the strategies employed in Zulu to express the semantic nuances of amelioration <b>and</b> <b>derogation.</b> Dissertation (MA (African Languages)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2005.

40|$|<b>Pools</b> <b>and</b> riffles are {{sedimentary}} bed features {{found in}} many natural streams.

40|$|ABSTRACT The paper {{focuses on}} the {{semantics}} of female subjugation <b>and</b> <b>derogation</b> in Igbo proverbs. Proverbs, as forms of figurative communication with didactic functions in studied conversations were found to possess evidences of male attempt at maintaining con-trol over discourse in society. The representations of womanhood in Igbo proverbs are mainly negative: women are typically portrayed as being senseless, morally debased, devil-ish, childish, and weak. The fact that these stereotypes have been encoded in a form of com-munication usually respected and highly valued in Igbo culture suggests the degree rhetoric in the society has been masculinized. Studies in oral literature, especially in male-dominated cultures, {{need to pay attention}} to the role of male-oriented rhetoric in Igbo proverbs that sig-nifies prejudice and hostility toward women in social discourse...|$|R
