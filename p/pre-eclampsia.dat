5|$|Low-dose aspirin supplementation has {{moderate}} benefits {{when used}} for prevention of <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> This benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia {{has been}} linked to {{recurrent}} miscarriage, and possibly various complications of pregnancy such as intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, severe <b>pre-eclampsia</b> and abruptio placentae.|$|E
5|$|Even mild or {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{leads to}} possible infertility and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage. Hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, even with limited or no symptoms, may {{increase the risk of}} <b>pre-eclampsia,</b> offspring with lower intelligence, and the risk of infant death around the time of birth. Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy has also been associated with gestational diabetes and birth of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of <b>pre-eclampsia</b> in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E
5|$|The Bushes {{had tried}} to {{conceive}} for three years, but pregnancy did not happen easily. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna. The twins were born five weeks early by an emergency Caesarean section, as Laura had developed life-threatening <b>pre-eclampsia</b> (toxemia). The twins {{graduated from high school}} in 2000 and attended Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively, in 2004. To date, Bush is the only First Lady to have given birth to twins.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or <b>pre-eclampsia</b> (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-eclampsia</b> is a {{progressive}} disorder and these signs of organ dysfunction {{are indicative of}} severe <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> A systolic blood pressure ≥160 or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 and/or proteinuria >5g in a 24-hour period is also indicative of severe <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> Clinically, individuals with severe <b>pre-eclampsia</b> may also present epigastric/right upper quadrant abdominal pain, headaches, and vomiting. Severe <b>pre-eclampsia</b> is a significant risk factor for intrauterine fetal death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-eclampsia</b> - Demonstrated a {{disturbance}} of ascorbic acid metabolism in <b>pre-eclampsia</b> and in abruptio placentae.|$|E
25|$|Another {{evolutionary}} hypothesis for {{vulnerability to}} <b>pre-eclampsia</b> {{is the idea}} of ensuring pair-bonding between the mother and father and paternal investment in the fetus. Researchers posit that <b>pre-eclampsia</b> is an adaptation for the mother to terminate investment in a fetus that might have an unavailable paternal donor, as determined by repeated semen exposure of the paternal donor to the mother. Various studies have shown that women who frequently had exposure to partners’ semen before conception had a reduced risk of <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> Also, subsequent pregnancies by the same paternal donor had a reduced risk of <b>pre-eclampsia</b> while subsequent pregnancies by a different paternal donor had a higher risk of developing <b>pre-eclampsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Preventive {{measures}} against <b>pre-eclampsia</b> have been heavily studied. Because {{the pathogenesis of}} <b>pre-eclampsia</b> is not completely understood, prevention remains a complex issue. Below {{are some of the}} currently accepted recommendations.|$|E
25|$|Supplementation with {{antioxidants}} such as vitamin C, D and E has {{no effect}} on <b>pre-eclampsia</b> incidence; therefore, supplementation with vitamins C, E, and D is not recommended for reducing the risk of <b>pre-eclampsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities in the {{maternal}} {{immune system and}} insufficiency of gestational immune tolerance seem to play major roles in <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> One of the main differences found in <b>pre-eclampsia</b> is a shift toward Th1 responses {{and the production of}} IFN-γ. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the natural killer cells of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of T helper cells, alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of regulatory T cells in pregnancy. Aberrant immune responses promoting <b>pre-eclampsia</b> may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers. It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal erythroblasts as well as cell-free fetal DNA are increased in {{the maternal}} circulation in women who develop <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that <b>pre-eclampsia</b> is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an immune response and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in <b>pre-eclampsia</b> and eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-eclampsia</b> affects {{approximately}} 2–8% of all pregnancies worldwide, The {{incidence of}} <b>pre-eclampsia</b> has risen in the USA since the 1990s, possibly {{as a result}} of increased prevalence of predisposing disorders, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.|$|E
25|$|Complications of <b>pre-eclampsia</b> {{can affect}} both {{the mother and}} the fetus. Acutely, <b>pre-eclampsia</b> can be {{complicated}} by eclampsia, the development of HELLP syndrome, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, liver damage and dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-eclampsia</b> {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{maternal}} and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Nearly one-tenth of all maternal deaths in Africa and Asia and one-quarter in Latin America are associated with hypertensive diseases in pregnancy, a category that encompasses <b>pre-eclampsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another splice variant termed Bok-P {{was found}} in placental tissue from {{patients}} suffering from <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> While Bok-S misses exon 3, Bok-P lacks exon 2. This deletion includes the BH4 domain {{and parts of the}} BH3 domain. Bok-P may be the cause for trophoblast cell death in <b>pre-eclampsia,</b> a dangerous pregnancy complication. In <b>pre-eclampsia,</b> typical alterations occur in the maternal kidney and lead to hypertension and proteins in the urine. To date, the cause of this medical condition as well as an appropriate treatment have not been discovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} <b>pre-eclampsia</b> {{are associated with}} general endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction and end-organ ischemia. Implicit in this generalized endothelial dysfunction may be an imbalance of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. Both circulating and placental levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) are higher in women with <b>pre-eclampsia</b> than in women with normal pregnancy. sFlt-1 is an anti-angiogenic protein that antagonizes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PIGF), {{both of which are}} proangiogenic factors. Soluble endoglin (sEng) has also been shown to be elevated in women with <b>pre-eclampsia</b> and has anti-angiogenic properties, much like sFlt-1 does.|$|E
25|$|Demonstrated aortic {{hypoplasia}} in {{some patients}} following severe early <b>pre-eclampsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Demonstrated {{impaired}} active {{transfer of}} amino acids from mother to fetus in <b>pre-eclampsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although much {{research}} into mechanism of <b>pre-eclampsia</b> has taken place, its exact pathogenesis remains uncertain. <b>Pre-eclampsia</b> {{is thought to}} result from an abnormal placenta, the removal of which ends the disease in most cases. During normal pregnancy, the placenta vascularizes {{to allow for the}} exchange of water, gases, and solutes, including nutrients and wastes, between maternal and fetal circulations. Abnormal development of the placenta leads to poor placental perfusion. The placenta of women with <b>pre-eclampsia</b> is abnormal and characterized by poor trophoblastic invasion. It is thought that this results in oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the release of factors that promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and other possible reactions.|$|E
25|$|As {{the theory}} of immune {{intolerance}} {{as a cause of}} <b>pre-eclampsia</b> has become accepted, women who with repeated <b>pre-eclampsia,</b> miscarriages, or in vitro fertilization failures could potentially be administered key immune factors such as TGF-beta along with the father's foreign proteins, possibly either orally, as a sublingual spray, or as a vaginal gel to be applied onto the vaginal wall before intercourse.|$|E
25|$|There is {{insufficient}} evidence to recommend either exercise or strict bedrest as preventive measures of <b>pre-eclampsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Long-term, an {{individual}} with preeclampsia is {{at increased risk for}} recurrence of <b>pre-eclampsia</b> in subsequent pregnancies.|$|E
25|$|Demonstrated {{the effects}} of cord around the neck and of <b>pre-eclampsia</b> on the oxygen {{saturation}} of newborn infants.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy {{in itself}} causes {{approximately}} a five-fold {{increased risk of}} deep venous thrombosis. Several pregnancy complications, such as <b>pre-eclampsia,</b> cause substantial hypercoagulability.|$|E
25|$|Taking aspirin is {{associated}} with a 1% to 5% reduction in <b>pre-eclampsia</b> and a 1% to 5% reduction in premature births in women at high risk. The World Health Organization recommends low-dose aspirin for the prevention of <b>pre-eclampsia</b> in women at high risk and recommends it be started before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends a low-dose regimen for women at high risk beginning in the 12th week. Benefits are less if started after 16 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Of note is that {{pregnancy}} associated affections like <b>pre-eclampsia,</b> eclampsia and HELLP syndrome can {{overlap in}} their presentation as pregnancy can trigger TTP episodes.|$|E
25|$|Supplementation with a {{balanced}} protein and energy diet {{does not appear}} {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> Further, there is no evidence that changing salt intake has an effect.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{magnesium}} sulfate (MgSO4) {{can be given}} in response to cardiac arrhythmias to correct for hypokalemia, preventing <b>pre-eclampsia,</b> and has been suggested as having a potential use in asthma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-eclampsia</b> is {{a disease}} defined by a {{combination}} of signs and symptoms that are related to maternal hypertension. The cause is unknown, and markers are being sought to predict its development from the earliest stages of pregnancy. Some unknown factors cause vascular damage in the endothelium, causing hypertension. If severe, it progresses to eclampsia, where seizures occur, which can be fatal. Preeclamptic patients with the HELLP syndrome show liver failure and Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The only treatment is to deliver the foetus. Women may still develop <b>pre-eclampsia</b> following delivery.|$|E
25|$|Doppler {{ultrasonography}} of the uterine arteries {{to investigate}} {{for signs of}} inadequate placental perfusion. This test has a high negative predictive value among those individuals {{with a history of}} prior <b>pre-eclampsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eclampsia {{is a major}} {{complication}} of <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> Eclampsia affects 0.56 per 1000 pregnant women in developed countries and almost 10–30 times as many women in low-income countries as in developed countries.|$|E
25|$|A {{child who}} has {{inherited}} this disorder will grow slower than normal in the uterus before birth and typically will be born before term. The pregnancy can be complicated by gestational hypertension and <b>pre-eclampsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-eclampsia</b> (PE) is a {{disorder}} of pregnancy {{characterized by the}} onset {{of high blood pressure}} and often a significant amount of protein in the urine. The condition begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In severe disease there may be red blood cell breakdown, a low blood platelet count, impaired liver function, kidney dysfunction, swelling, shortness of breath due to fluid in the lungs, or visual disturbances. <b>Pre-eclampsia</b> increases the risk of poor outcomes for both the mother and the baby. If left untreated, it may result in seizures at which point it is known as eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also an}} {{increased}} risk for cardiovascular complications, including hypertension and ischemic heart disease, and kidney disease. Other risks include stroke and venous thromboembolism. It seems <b>pre-eclampsia</b> does not {{increase the risk of}} cancer.|$|E
25|$|Supplementation with L-arginine reduces diastolic blood {{pressure}} and lengthens pregnancy for women with gestational hypertension, including women with high {{blood pressure}} as part of <b>pre-eclampsia.</b> It did not lower systolic blood pressure or improve weight at birth.|$|E
