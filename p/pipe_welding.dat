50|$|In {{areas where}} the water is very deep, the S-lay system may not be {{appropriate}} because the pipeline leaves the stinger to go almost straight down. To avoid sharp bending {{at the end of}} it and to mitigate excessive sag bending, the tension in the pipeline would have to be high. Doing so would interfere with the vessel's positioning, and the tensioner could damage the pipeline. A particularly long stinger could be used, but this is also objectionable since that structure would be adversely affected by winds and currents. The J-lay system, one of the latest generations of lay-barge, is better suited for deep water environments. In this system, the pipeline leaves the vessel on a nearly vertical ramp (or tower). There is no overbend - only a sagbend of catenary nature (hence the J notation), such that the tension can be reduced. The pipeline is also less exposed to wave action as it enters the water. However, unlike for the S-lay system, where <b>pipe</b> <b>welding</b> can be done simultaneously at several locations along the vessel deck's length, the J-lay system can only accommodate one welding station. Advanced methods of automatic welding are used to compensate for this drawback.|$|E
50|$|In the S-lay system, the {{pipeline}} assembly is {{done at the}} installation site, on board a vessel that has all the equipment required for joining the pipe segments: pipe handling conveyors, welding stations, X-ray equipment, joint-coating module, etc. The S notation refers {{to the shape of}} {{the pipeline}} as it is laid onto the seabed. The pipeline leaves the vessel at the stern or bow from a supporting structure called a stinger that guides the pipe's downward motion and controls the convex-upward curve (the overbend). As it continues toward the seabed, the pipe has a convex-downward curve (the sagbend) before coming into contact with the seabed (touch down point). The sagbend is controlled by a tension applied from the vessel (via tensioners) in response to the pipeline's submerged weight. The pipeline configuration is monitored so that it will not get damaged by excessive bending. This on-site pipeline assembly approach, referred to as lay-barge construction, is known for its versatility and self-contained nature - despite the high costs associated with this vessel's deployment, it is efficient and requires relatively little external support. But it may have to contend with severe sea states - these adversely affect operations such as pipe transfer from supply boats, anchor-handling and <b>pipe</b> <b>welding.</b> Recent developments in lay-barge design include dynamic positioning and the J-lay system.|$|E

The study involved fatigue tests on actual components and specimens. The Paris law has been used for the prediction of fatigue crack growth life. Paris constants have been determined for <b>pipe</b> (base), <b>pipe</b> <b>weld</b> and <b>pipe</b> elbow materials by using Compact Tension (CT) /Three Point Bend (TPB) specimens machined from the actual <b>pipe,</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>weld</b> and <b>pipe</b> elbow. Analyses have been carried out to predict the fatigue crack growth life of these piping components having part through cracks on the outer surface. In the analyses, Stress Intensity Factor (K) has been evaluated through two different schemes. The first scheme considers the ‘K’ evaluations at two points of the crack front i. e. maximum crack depth and crack tip end at the outer surface. The second scheme accounts for the area averaged root mean square stress intensity factor (KRMS) at deepest and surface points. In order to validate the analytical procedure/results, experiments have been carried out on full scale <b>pipes,</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>welds</b> with part through circumferential crack. The tests have also been conducted on the full scale carbon steel elbows having part-through circumferential notch at intrados location and axial notch at crown location on the outer surface.

40|$|The {{economy of}} <b>pipe</b> <b>welding</b> {{is governed by}} the welding speed. This {{is one reason why}} the laser {{technology}} in <b>pipe</b> <b>welding</b> is used in a production line only for the case of welding stainless steel tubes for the car industry because of the metallurgical advantages. However, using the effect of beam polarization, the welding speed could be increased. From laser beam cutting of metals, a strong effect of beam polarization referring to the cutting direction is known. In welding, this effect is relatively unknown. Experimental results show that a strong polarization effect could also take place in deep penetration welding if some threshold conditions are fulfilled. Using the right beam polarization e. g. pipes could be welded at a higher speed than with an unpolarized beam. It is possible to weld pipes or plates much faster than with the normal keyhole-welding technique if the polarized beam is used {{in a way that the}} beam is guided to the joining point.

Also, in this study the most welding processes as well as the most pipe variations welded by orbital welding systems mainly for oil and gas pipeline applications are explained. The welding results show that Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) and its variants like Surface Tension Transfer (STT) and modified short circuit are the most preferred processes in the welding of root pass and can be replaced to the Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) in many applications. Furthermore, dual-tandem gas metal arc welding technique is currently considered the most efficient method in the welding of fill pass.
