Up to now available tailored blanks consist of sheet steel and have a different thickness or mechanical strength. For body parts without a necessary stability the vibrational behaviour is of importance. Therefore the material - aluminium - is very suitable. There are tailored blanks made of aluminium and steel. At the moment they only can be produced in an overlapping form by laser welding. But in this case there is the danger of building of an intergranular zone (hard and brittle), which would impede the following conversion. The introduced aluminium-steel-tailored blank is a semi finished plane sheet, that is prepared by rolling of the initial material.

40|$|Background {{and aims}}   Awkward posture has been {{recognized}} as one of the important risk factors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD). The current study aimed at determining ergonomic risk level, WMSDs ratio and exploring working postures contribution to WMSD. During the study, working postures were phased and then they were scored using the REBAtool from observing the work.   Methods   To perform the study, workers of a home appliances manufacturing factory were  assessed. In order to collecting required data, each part of the body was scored and work frequency,  load/force, coupling were considered to achieve a REBA score. Nordic Questionnaire was used  to determining WMSD ratio and its relationship whit REBA score. 231 working phases were  assessed and 13761 questions using Nordic Questionnaire were answered. Percentage of the workers in <b>press,</b> spot <b>welding,</b> grinding, cutting, assembling, and painting was 15. 8, 21. 6, 25. 9, 34. 5, 89. 9 %, respectively. Workers were 18 - 54 years old and their work recording average was 52   month.   Results   REBAscore was 4 - 13 in under study tasks. REBA score = 9 had the most frequency  (20 %) and REBA score = 13 had the least frequency (1. 4 %). Risk level in press, cutting, and  painting was high (25. 5, 100, 68. 2 %) cases). This shows that cutting has the highest risk level. On the other hand 38. 5 % of the workers in past 12 month had problem in different parts of their body. Totally 11. 7 % of the workers had problem in neck, 19. 4 $ in leg, 10. 7 % in foot, 82. 5 % in lower back,   87. 6 % in upper back and 7. 8 % in shoulders. 10. 7 % of the workers had previous illness that 8. 7 %  of them were non occupational and 1. 9 % were caused their previous jobs.

Techenetium- 99 m is diagnostic radioactive medical isotope that is currently used 30, 000 times a day in the United States. All supplies of techenetium- 99 m's parent isotope molybdenum- 99 currently originate from nuclear reactor facilities located in foreign countries and use highly enriched uranium (HEU). The University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) is exploring the feasibility of high volume molybdenum- 99 production at its facility. Current molybdenum- 99 production uses HEU in a powder dispersion target. The powder dispersion method, conventionally used for fuel rods and plates, combines fine particles of aluminum and HEU that are bonded into a rigid plate during irradiation. In accordance with the Global Threat Reduction Initiative all uranium used in future molybdenum- 99 production will use low enriched uranium (LEU). Unfortunately LEU has a much low fissionable density then HEU which makes the dispersion process economically unviable. A design approach to increase the LEU density is to use a target that is based on LEU foil. The foil design places a LEU foil between either two concentric annular aluminum cylinders or two aluminum plates which are <b>pressed</b> and <b>welded</b> together to produce a structure that allows for easy removal and processing. The drawback of these designs is the thermal contact resistance between the LEU and aluminum cladding during irradiative heating is very sensitive to the target design, manufacture, and irradiation holder. This thesis explores those thermal-mechanical design issues for both the cylindrical target design and the plate target design. Analytical, numerical and experimental studies are used to assess the mechanical deformation for these structures and its effect on the target's thermal contact resistance...|$|R

State of the art research of Laser welding ultrahigh strength steels shows that neither increasing the welding velocity, nor {{post weld heat treatment}} {{have an effect on the}} strength and hardness drop in the HAZ. The key to improving these material characteristics is to increase heat dissipation out of the workpiece. To do so, the cooling conditions while laser <b>welding</b> <b>press</b> hardened 22 MnB 5 and S 1100 QL were dramatically increased. Experiments were carried out at subzero temperatures down to - 98 °C by using a mixture of liquid and gaseous nitrogen. To further improve heat dissipation, the clamping jaws were entirely made of copper. Hardness measurements and tensile tests were conducted to compare joints welded at room temperature with those welded at - 98 °C. Whilst an improvement of the hardness values could be achieved for the press hardened 22 MnB 5 and the S 1100, no change in the mechanical behavior regarding tensile tests could be observed. Thus, it can be noticed that there is no possibility to improve the strength levels of martensitic steels throughout varying process parameters (like welding velocity) or utilizing an active cooling, even if subzero temperatures down to - 98 °C are applied. A further improvement at lower temperatures is unlikely because heat dissipation in the work piece itself is the limiting factor...|$|R

The thesis provides an insight to the steps that need to be taken in order to produce a superconductive magnet mainly focusing on mechanical assembly. Tooling upgrade is necessary for the production of the superconductive dipole magnet prototypes in near future. Major attention is given by the introduction of the welding assembly in chapter three. The structural compression is given by the so called shell stress defined by the thermal shrinkage of the weld. The associated aspects include the closure of the gap in the half symmetry of the assembled mock-up. All this is important to minimize the risk for the quenches in the superconductive coil assembly. In the chapter four all the related constraints seen by the magnet are implied into the FEA model to find out the required minimum shrinkage of the weld. It was necessary to verify that the coil stresses stay below the defined limit during the pressing of the magnet and welding, after the welding procedure, as well as the cooling to 1. 9 K followed by operation at nominal current 13 kA (12 T). An aspect is given to the modifications performed for the sample press. The specification of the press implied the analysis of the required hydraulic system, user control interface and coordination of related activities. The luminosity upgrade involves the utilization of the Nb 3 Sn superconductor. The diffusion process of the Nb 3 Sn towards superconductive characteristics implies the stringent heat treatment cycle. An Ar-inert gas furnace is used. It is important to select the appropriate numerical methods to verify critical process parameters as the ramping rate [Celcius/h] and the circulation speed of the used Ar-inert gas [m/s]. This implies the definition of the appropriate numerical methods to carry out an analysis with the aid of CFD. The analysis should provide solid backround for further development of the analysis of heat transfer between the furnace and the coil...|$|R
40|$|Railway {{crossings}} {{belong to}} the most exposed components of a track structure. Operational load presents very complicated complex of adhesive, abrasive, and mainly contact-fatigue affect, which leads to preferential wear and tear primarily in the point and stock rail area depending on many external factors (such as crosswise and lengthwise slip, actual geometry relation in contact with a real worn wheel profile and the like) in the final result. The possibility of continuous reprofiling of the worn segments is an essential requirement on the material applied. The selection of material analyses results presented herein refer to the surfacing technology proposal of progressive bainitic steel for railway crossings casting. This material, industrial termed as Lo 17 MnCrNiMo, is intended for the most load-carrying segments particularly. Its chemical composition together with heat treating leads to the comparison with the original alternative (already applied Lo 8 CrNiMo) to modification of phases represented and later-on higher yield value mechanical parameters, fracture and notch toughness. Development holder of this material and as well the surfacing technology is DT - Výhybkárna a strojírna, a. s, Prostějov company. Surfacing technology solved herein came from experimental verification of some filler material alternatives, while the common background was following: • overlay quality associated with original characteristics of the base material; • demanded quality of join without a degradation of overlays characteristics; • all without a need of pre-heat and after-heat of created overlays. This technology is so attractive primarily because of reducing the problematic heat-cycle requirements {{that are to be}} obeyed. From the results – the crucial zone of transition follows from line of joint to the surface travel area. In this zone direct contact between base material and surfacing metal – no interlayer. This situation present a direct source of weld joint harm in interpreted combinations, simultaneously the absence of interlayer can cause higher inner <b>press</b> on <b>weld</b> boundaries. The positive influence of repeated heating of following layers surfacing on HAZ, {{as well as on the}} inner shape (grain) of surfacing metal, does not take effect. Manual impact load testing results in austenitic material of Cr/Mn type, which is manually able to harden above its original hardness of base material – without a phase transformation. Bainitic surfacing metal of Cr/Ni/Mo type does not yield to dynamic hardening under load. Large amount of dispersion of hardening was identified in area under the surfacing lengthwise the created weld deposits. In coincidence with this “sensitivity” to implementation it is proper to think of automatic surfacing appliance. Automation brings the advantage of stabilized process with and thus also the quality performance, simultaneously there is the possibility for layer preservation by flux and the positive impact regime of surfacing layers cooling. On principal it is necessary to lean the development of contact-fatigue load, where outstanding impact rate of load occurs in addition, against two basic moments: 1. The increase of lifetime in a given regime of load requires an optimal drift into the range of high cycle fatigue, where the influence of fore fatigue process stadium is principally real, which is possible to put together with increase of yield point from the characteristic material impress point of view. 2. Practically running processes of cumulative microscopic deformation (ratcheting) pose claims on the development conditions of surface layers plasticity. That together with anaclastic behaviour of a material influences the circumstances of already initiated damage, i. e. safety in regard of a dynamic load. Železniční srdcovky patří mezi nejvíce exponované součásti kolejového svršku. Provozní zatížení zde představuje velice složitý komplex adhezivního, abrazivního, a především kontaktně-únavového působení, které v konečném důsledku v závislosti na řadě externích faktorů (jako je podíl příčných a podélných skluzů, aktuální geometrické poměry v kontaktu s reálně opotřebeným profilem kola apod.), vede k přednostnímu opotřebení především v oblasti hrotu a opornic. Možnost průběžné reprofilace opotřebených úseků je tedy nezbytným požadavkem na aplikovaný materiál...|$|R
40|$|The Aerospace {{industries}} of the 21 st century demand {{the use of}} cutting edge materials and manufacturing technology. New manufacturing methods such as hydroforming are relatively new and {{are being used to}} produce commercial vehicles. This process allows for part consolidation and reducing the number of parts in an assembly compared to conventional methods such as stamping, <b>press</b> forming and <b>welding</b> of multiple components. Hydroforming in particular, provides an endless opportunity to achieve multiple crosssectional shapes in a single tube. A single tube can be pre-bent and subsequently hydroformed to create an entire component assembly instead of welding many smaller sheet metal sections together. The knowledge of tube hydroforming for aerospace materials is not well developed yet, thus new methods are required to predict and study the formability, and the critical forming limits for aerospace materials. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} the formability and the mechanical properties of aerospace materials, a novel online measurement approach based on free expansion test is developed using a 3 D automated deformation measurement system (Aramis®) to extract the coordinates of the bulge profile during the test. These coordinates are used to calculate the circumferential and longitudinal curvatures, which are utilized to determine the effective stresses and effective strains at different stages of the tube hydroforming process. In the second step, two different methods, a weighted average method and a new hardening function are utilized to define accurately the true stress-strain curve for post-necking regime of different aerospace alloys, such as inconel 718 (IN 718), stainless steel 321 (SS 321) and titanium (Ti 6 Al 4 V). The flow curves are employed in the simulation of the dome height test, which is utilized for generating the forming limit diagrams (FLDs). Then, the effect of stress triaxiality, the stress concentration factor and the effective plastic strain on the nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids are investigated through a new user material for burst prediction during tube hydroforming. A numerical procedure for both plasticity and fracture is developed and implemented into 3 D explicit commercial finite element software (LS-DYNA) through a new user material subroutine. The FLDs and predicted bursting pressure results are compared to the experimental data to validate the models. Finally, the new user material model is used to predict the bursting point of some real tube hydroforming parts such as round to square and round to V parts. Then, the predicted bursting pressure results are compared to the experimental data to validate the models in real and multistep tube hydroforming processes...|$|R
