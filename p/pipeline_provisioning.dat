50|$|Under Khan's tenure both Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and {{president}} Pervez Musharraf visited Swabi, Musharraf announcing a 100 million rupee development {{package for the}} region. After a year's delay in receiving the funds, Khan oversaw a number of local development schemes. Electricity supplies were extended to unpowered regions, gas <b>pipeline</b> <b>provision</b> improved, and construction of the Shah Mansoor hospital advanced.Sharam khan is currently elected {{as a member of}} Provincial Assembly of KPK and is also appointed as a minister of Agriculture.The initially merged Sawabi Jamhoori Ittehad has changed the party name to Awami Jamhoori Ittehad and was in coalition with Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf (PTI) in current government since 2013. His Party has merged into PTI on 22 November 2015.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{proposed}} Multi-domain SDN Orchestrator (MSO), {{based on the}} Application-Based Network Operations (ABNO) framework. This analysis is performed in the Cloud Computing Platform and Transport Network of the ADRENALINE Testbed. We focus on the internal architecture of the MSO by analysing its performance on the orchestration of multi-layer end-to-end (E 2 E) services in a multi-domain network scenario based on OpenFlow and GMPLS control technologies. Detailed implementation considerations to provide efficient orchestration functionalities such multi-layer path computation, <b>pipeline</b> connection <b>provisioning</b> and topology discovery/transfer are provided. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation of the system performance is {{discussed in terms of}} E 2 E setup delay, topology discovery/transfer throughput and overall system performance...|$|R

R. 6008 would require pipeline operators to provide immediate telephonic notice of a pipeline release to federal emergency response officials and would increase civil penalties for pipeline safety violations. S. 3824 would {{increase the number of}} federal pipeline safety inspectors, would require automatic shutoff valves for natural gas pipelines, and would mandate internal inspections of transmission <b>pipelines,</b> among other <b>provision...</b>|$|R
40|$|Inertial {{sensor data}} {{cannot be used}} to {{directly}} display kinematic motion parameters. In this research, we therefore developed a processing <b>pipeline</b> for the <b>provision</b> of visual motion feedback from inertial sensor data. Following the computation steps of the presented system pipeline, {{it is possible to}} determine full-body motion kinematics that can then be animated as moving figures. Data analysis showed that the accuracy of the estimated body kinematics is within few degrees of deviation from the actual data, enabling a use of the system in future applications such as mobile training tools...|$|R
40|$|In 1992, the U. S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission {{created a}} {{secondary}} market {{for natural gas}} transportation whereby shippers holding firm transportation capacity on interstate natural gas pipelines can compete with the <b>pipeline</b> in the <b>provision</b> of transportation services. However, if a shipper does not use some of its contracted firm transportation capacity, the pipeline can resell that capacity as interruptible transportation. That is, the pipeline has residual rights with respect to firm transportation capacity contracted for by shippers. We demonstrate that these residual rights can {{have a significant effect}} on the competitiveness of the secondary market for natural gas transportation. A consequence of these residual rights is that the secondary market for natural gas transportation may be considerably more competitive than indicated by measures of concentration like the widely used Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{support the}} {{interpretation}} of measured molecular facts, like gene expression experi-ments or EST sequencing, the functional or the system biological context has to be con-sidered. Doing so, the relationship to existing biological knowledge has to be discovered. In general, biological knowledge is worldwide represented in a network of databases. In this paper we present a method for knowledge extraction in life science databases, which prevents the scientists from screen scraping and web clicking approaches. We developed a method for extraction of knowledge networks from distributed, heteroge-neous life science databases. To meet the requirement of the very large data volume, the method used {{is based on the}} concept of data linkage graphs (DLG). We present an efficient software which enables the joining of millions of data points over hundreds of databases. In order to motivate possible applications, we computed networks of protein knowledge, which interconnect metabolic, disease, enzyme and gene function data. The computed networks enabled a holistic relationship among measured experimental facts and the combined biological knowledge. This was successfully applied for a high through-put functional classification of barley EST and gene expression experiments with the per-spective of an automated <b>pipeline</b> for the <b>provisioning</b> of controlled annotation of plant gene arrays and chips. Availability: The data linkage graphs (XML or TGF format), the schema integrated database schema (GML or GRAPH-ML) and the graph computation software may be downloaded from the followin...|$|R
