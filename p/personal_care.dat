40|$|PURPOSE We {{wanted to}} assess the {{relationship}} between having a <b>personal</b> health <b>care</b> provider and receiving colorectal cancer testing. METHODS Self-reported data {{were obtained from the}} United States 2004 Behav-ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Men and women aged 50 years and older were included, and associations of having a <b>personal</b> health <b>care</b> provider, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, and health insurance status with colorectal cancer testing were examined. Multiple logistic regression was performed on a fi nal sample of 120, 221 individuals. RESULTS Having at least 1 <b>personal</b> health <b>care</b> provider signifi cantly pre-dicted up-to-date colorectal cancer testing in both the univariate (odds ratio [OR] = 3. 96; 95 % confi dence interval [CI] 3. 56 - 4. 41) and multiple regression models (OR = 2. 91; 95 % CI 2. 58 - 3. 28). Age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, and health insurance were also signifi cantly associated with up-to-date colorectal cancer testing. CONCLUSIONS Having a <b>personal</b> health <b>care</b> provider was associated with up-to-date colorectal cancer testing.
