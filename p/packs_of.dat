In India, the Montagu's harrier and the Pallid harrier roost in their hundreds in grasslands during their winter migration. Jackals stalk close to these roosting harriers and then rush at them, attempting to catch one before the harriers can take off or gain sufficient height to escape. In some regions of Bangladesh and India, jackals subsist by scavenging on carrion and garbage, and will cache extra food by burying it. Golden jackals cause damage to melon, peanut, grape, coffee, maize, and sugarcane crops. They sometimes prey on lambs, weak sheep, kids, goats, and poultry. The jackal will scavenge off the kills made by the lion, tiger, leopard, dhole, and gray wolf.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{obtained}} <b>packing</b> densities <b>of</b> aneurysms treated with the newly introduced GDC 360 ° coils with <b>packing</b> densities <b>of</b> aneurysms treated with either complex Orbit/Trufill coils or helical GDC 10 coils. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two aneurysms in 20 patients were coiled with GDC 360 ° coils. For each of the 22 aneurysms coiled with GDC 360 ° coils, 2 volume-matched controls treated with either complex Orbit/Trufill coils or helical GDC coils were identified from our data base. The <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> these matched controls was compared with the calculated <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> the 22 aneurysms treated with GDC 360 ° coils. RESULTS: There was no difference in mean aneurysm volume between aneurysms treated with any of the 3 types of coils (P. 9). Mean <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> 22. 1 % of aneurysms treated with GDC 360 ° coils was significantly lower than mean <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> 30. 3 % of aneurysms treated with complex Orbit/Trufill coils (P. 0015). Mean <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> 22. 1 % of aneurysms treated with GDC 360 ° coils was not different from mean <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> 21. 6 % of aneurysms treated with helical GDC 10 coils (P. 81). CONCLUSION: The use of complex-shaped GDC 360 ° coils does not lead to increased packing in comparison with that of helical GDC 10 coils. The use of complex Orbit/Trufill coils results i...|$|R

5|$|Tigers usually {{prefer to}} eat prey they have caught themselves, {{but are not}} above eating carrion in times of {{scarcity}} and may even pirate prey from other large carnivores. Although predators typically avoid one another, if a prey item is under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common. If these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill competitors as leopards, dholes, striped hyenas, wolves, bears, pythons, and crocodiles on occasion. Tigers may also prey on these competitors. Attacks on smaller predators, such as badgers, lynxes, and foxes, are almost certainly predatory. Crocodiles, bears, and large <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> dholes may win conflicts against tigers {{and in some cases}} even kill them.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} development, {{the family}} created a large, new deer park around the castle, {{replacing}} the older, unenclosed hunting grounds. Deer parks were an important status symbol in this period, and many nobles who acquired power and wealth {{for the first time}} chose to undertake similar projects. Creating the park, which spread out from the south of the castle to cover , required clearing away the older settlements around the castle and abandoning various fields and pastures. These settlements, comprising long houses built in warmer climate of the 12th and early 13th century, may already have become less sustainable due to the onset of the cooler climate that began to emerge {{at the end of the}} 13th. Land near the castle, later called Kennel Field, was used to hold required the <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> dogs for hunting.|$|E
5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> cards are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip value, while tens and court cards count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.|$|E

Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E

They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E
