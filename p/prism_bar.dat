40|$|<b>Prism</b> <b>bars</b> and {{variable}} Herschel prisms are {{most commonly used}} today to measure the angle of squint. Both have drawbacks, however. <b>Prism</b> <b>bars</b> are too large to carry around all day and are usually limited to 40 prism diopters (PD), while variable Herschel prisms have even smaller ranges. Hans Meester and I have therefore developed, at the Netherlands Ophthalmic Research Institute, Amsterdam, a hand-held prism that is continuously variable over a large range, horizontally as well as vertically. We propose {{to call it the}} "Variprism. " It consists of a small housing containing two glass elements, ie, planoconvex and planoconcave, with equal radii of the convex and concave surfaces (Fig 1). The planoconvex front element is a half globe, freely rotatable in gimbals. The planoconcave lens is situated immediately behind it...|$|R

5000|$|A prism coupler may be {{explained}} in terms of the reciprocity theorem. The reciprocity theorem permits the relative power coupled into the thin film by an incident beam to be computed from the solution to a reciprocal problem. In the reciprocal problem, a waveguide mode in the film (travelling to the left in the first figure) is incident on the <b>prism</b> coupler. <b>Barring</b> significant scattering at the prism interface, the waveguide mode in the reciprocal problem retains its form as a mode and propagates under the prism, losing power as it propagates due to radiation into the prism. The power in the prism emerges as a collimated beam at an angle determined by the propagation constant of the waveguide mode and the refractive index of the prism. Radiation into the prism occurs because the evanescent tail of the waveguide mode touches the bottom of the prism. The waveguide mode tunnels through the tunneling layer.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} read {{efficiently}} and comfortably {{is important in the}} intellectual development and academic performance of a child. Some children experience difficulties when reading due to symptoms related to near vision anomalies. Aim: To explore the feasibility of conducting a large study to determine the prevalence, distribution and characteristics of near vision anomalies in high school children in Empangeni, South Africa. Methods: The study was a cross sectional descriptive pilot study designed to provide preliminary data on prevalence, distribution and characteristics of near vision anomalies in a sample of high school-children in South Africa. Study participants comprised 65 Black children (30 males and 35 females), ages ranged between 13 and 19 years with a mean age and standard deviation of 17 ± 1. 43 years. The visual functions evaluated and the techniques used included visual acuity (LogMAR acuity chart), refractive error (autorefractor and subjective refraction), heterophoria (von Graefe), near point of convergence (push-in-to-double), amplitude of accommodation (push-in-to-blur) accommodation facility (± 2 D flipper lenses), relative accommodation, accommodation response (monocular estimation method) and fusional vergences (step vergence with <b>prism</b> <b>bars).</b> Possible associations between symptoms and near vision anomalies were explored using a 20 -point symptoms questionnaire. Results: Prevalence estimates were: Myopia 4. 8 %, hyperopia 1. 6 % and astigmatism 1. 6 %.   For accommodative anomalies, 1. 6 % had accommodative insufficiency while 1. 6 % had accommodative infacility. For convergence anomalies, 3. 2 % had receded near point of convergence, 16 % had low suspect convergence insufficiency, no participant had high suspect convergence insufficiency, 1. 6 % had definite convergence insufficiency and 3. 2 % had convergence excess. Female participants reported more symptoms than the males and the association between clinical measures and symptoms were not remarkable. Conclusion: Although the overall prevalence of near vision anomalies was low,  convergence anomalies were found to be more prevalent than refractive and accommodative anomalies. Symptoms were not significantly associated with near vision anomalies.   Overall, the pilot project reveals that it is feasible to conduct the study on a large scale with minor modifications. Identification and referrals for near vision anomalies are important steps towards diagnosis and treatment which will minimize discomfort with reading and subsequent poor performance which may be associated with such anomalies...|$|R

50|$|The prism {{fusion range}} (PFR) or fusional vergence {{amplitude}} is a clinical eye test performed by orthoptists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists to assess motor fusion, specifically {{the extent to}} which a patient can maintain binocular single vision (BSV) in the presence of increasing vergence demands. Motor fusion is largely accounted to amplitudes of fusional vergences and relative fusional vergences. Fusional vergence is the maximum vergence movement enabling BSV and the limit is at the point of diplopia (double vision). Relative fusional vergence is the maximum vergence movement enabling a patient to see a comfortable clear image and the limit is represented by the first point of blur. These motor fusion functions should fall within average values so that BSV can be comfortably achieved. Excessive stress on the vergence system or inability to converge or diverge adequately can lead to asthenopic symptoms, which generally result from decompensation of latent deviations (heterophoria) or loss of control of ocular misalignments. Motor anomalies can be managed in various ways, however, in order to commence treatment, motor fusion testing such as the PFR is required. The PFR involves placing a <b>prism</b> <b>bar</b> in front of an eye. In a patient with BSV, a natural shift of the eye occurs. When measuring horizontal fusion ranges, base in prisms assess fusional divergence while base out prisms assess fusional convergence. The vertical fusional vergence amplitude can also be measured with base up and base down prisms although the horizontal PFR is typically the main focus when testing. When performing the PFR, prism strengths are increased, placing greater demand on the vergence system, eventually resulting in a break point accompanying diplopia. Break point, recovery and blur are key aspects of this assessment. The break point occurs at the loss of BSV, recovery point when BSV is regained from break and blur point is at the loss of comfortable BSV. These stops can be subjectively indicated when the patient notices a double or blurred image. Both subjective and objective measurements can be considered however the examiner’s objective observation is the gold standard.|$|E

Ninety-two patients with IXT (8 – 15 years old) were compared with 86 controls. Exodeviation control was evaluated using the Revised Newcastle Control Score. Angle of deviation was measured using prism and alternate cover testing at distance and near. Fusional vergence was measured using <b>prism</b> <b>bar</b> and synoptophore. This study was registered with ChiCTR-RCC- 13003920. Results. Using <b>prism</b> <b>bar,</b> convergence break points were lower whereas divergence break points were higher in children with IXT at distance (P< 0. 001) and near (P< 0. 001) compared with controls.

40|$|Background:   Reading {{difficulties}} {{constitute an}} impediment to the learning process and in the educational achievement of a child. Consequently, several studies examined the visual status of dyslexic children in the Caucasian populations. Such studies are lacking in the African populations. Aim: To determine the prevalence of vision defects and investigate {{if there is an}} association between dyslexia and vision in a South African population of dyslexic school children.   Methods:  This comparative study assessed the visual function of 62 children (31 dyslexic and 31 normally-reading children), mean age 13 ± 1. 42 years and 11. 90 ± 0. 93 years respectively. The participants were matched for gender, race and socio-economic status. The visual functions evaluated and the techniques used were: visual acuity (LogMAR acuity chart), refraction (static retinos-copy), ocular alignment (cover test) near point of convergence (RAF rule), accommodation facility (± 2 D flipper lenses), amplitude of accommodation (push-up method) relative accommodation (trial lenses) accommodation posture (monocular estimation technique) and vergence reserves (<b>prism</b> <b>bars).</b> Results:   In the following, results are  provided for the dyslexic versus control:  Refractive errors: (hyperopia 6. 5 % vs 3 %,) (myopia 6. 5 % vs 6. 5 %), (astigmatism 10 % vs 13 %), (anisometropia 6. 5 % vs 6. 5 %) (amblyopia 6. 5 % vs 0 %), (remote NPC 33 % vs 48 %) (esophoria at near 3 %  vs 0 %) (exophoria at near 9. 5 % vs 0 %), (accommodative infacility at near  54 % vs 33 %), lag of accommodation 39. 28 % vs 41, 93 %,  (poor positive fusional amplitude at near, 25 % vs 16 %). Only the binocular accommodative facility at near was significantly associated with dyslexia (p= 0. 027). Conclusion: The prevalence of vision defects was similar between the dyslexic and non-dyslexic participants, which suggest that an association between dyslexia and vision variables investigated, cannot be inferred.   This study provides a research perspective on the prevalence of vision defects in a Black South African population of dyslexic children and has clinical relevance and implications for the assessment, detection and management of vision anomalies in dyslexic schoolchildren.

D. 2. 5 years) who were unfamiliar with the methods used. Base-in and base-out blur, break and recovery points were sequentially determined. Both sets of measurements were obtained by the same examiner. At each distance, NFV was determined first and then PFV.

40|$|Corrosion of {{reinforcement}} {{is one of}} the major contributors to the deterioration of reinforced concrete structures. The cause of corrosion can be due to carbonation or chloride attack.

40|$|The {{stiffness}} and frequency properties of tensegrity structures are {{functions of the}} pre-stress, topology, configuration, and axial stiffness of the elements. The tensegrity structures considered are tensegrity booms, tensegrity grids, and tensegrity power lines. A study {{has been carried out}} on the pre-stress design. It includes (i) finding the most flexible directions for different pre-stress levels, (ii) finding the pre-stress pattern which maximizes the first natural frequency. To find the optimum cross-section areas of the elements for triangular prism and Snelson tensegrity booms, an optimization approach is utilized. A constant mass criterion is considered and the genetic algorithm (GA) is used as the optimization method. The stiffness of the triangular prism and Snelson tensegrity booms are modified by introducing actuators. An optimization approach by means of a GA is employed to find the placement of the actuators and their minimum length variations. The results show that the bending stiffness improves significantly, but still an active tensegrity boom is less stiff than a passive truss boom. The GA shows high accuracy in searching the non-structural space. The tensegrity concept is employed to design a novel transmission power line. A tensegrity prism module is selected as the building block. A complete parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of several parameters such as number of modules and their dimensions on the {{stiffness and}} frequency of the structure. A general approach is suggested to design the structure considering wind and ice loads. The designed structure has more than 50 times reduction of the electromagnetic field and acceptable deflections under several loading combinations. A study on the first natural frequencies of Snelson, prisms, Micheletti, Marcus and X-frame based tensegrity booms has been carried out. The result shows that the differences in the first natural frequencies of the truss and tensegrity booms are significant and not due to the number of mechanisms or pre-stress levels.

Methods: Forty young normal Chinese adults had their near phoria measured with trial frame correction using the conventional muscle balance card method (method 1). Any deviation was compensated with a <b>prism</b> <b>bar</b> as an alternative approach (method 2). The conventional Maddox rod method (method 3) was also carried out for comparison. These three methods were repeated with phoropter correction and considered as methods 4, 5 and 6. Results: The phorias obtained from these six methods {{were not significantly different}} from each other (repeated measures ANOVA, p > 0. 05). More than half of the subjects were exophoric. Although the difference in phoria was not significant, phoria measurement using phoropter correction yielded a greater coefficient of variation.

The use of prism for compensation did not affect the phoria results. Exophoria seems to be more common than esophoria in young Chinese adults. School of Optometr...|$|E
40|$|Introduction - No {{validated}} protocol {{exists for}} {{the measurement of}} the prism fusion ranges. Many studies report on how fusional vergence ranges can be measured using different techniques (rotary prism, <b>prism</b> <b>bar,</b> loose prisms and synoptophore) and stimuli, leading to different ranges being reported in the literature. Repeatability of the different methods available and the equivalence between them it is also important. In addition, some studies available do not agree in what order fusional vergence should be measured to provide the essential information {{on which to base}} clinical judgements on compensation of deviations. When performing fusional vergence testing the most commonly accepted clinical technique is to first measure negative fusional vergence followed by a measurement of positive fusional vergence to avoid affecting the value of vergence recovery because of excessive stimulation of convergence. Von Noorden recommend using vertical fusion amplitudes in between horizontal amplitudes (base-out, base-up, base-in, and base down) to prevent vergence adaptation. Others place the base of the prism in the direction opposite to that used to measure the deviation to increase the vergence demand. Objectives - The purpose of this review is to assess and compare the accuracy of tests for measurement of fusional vergence. Secondary objectives are to investigate sources of heterogeneity of diagnostic accuracy including: age; variation in method of assessment; study design; study size; type of strabismus (convergent, divergent, vertical, cycle); severity of strabismus (constant/intermittent/latent) ...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{vertical}} fusional amplitudes in isometropic participants with normal binocular single vision at four distances of fixation: 33 cm, 1 m, 4 m, 6 m. Methods: Vertical fusion ranges (break point and recovery point) were {{measured with a}} Gulden vertical <b>prism</b> <b>bar</b> with the participant fixing a 6 / 12 Snellen equivalent letter, twice at each distance. Order effects were controlled with randomisation of both fixation distance and prism direction. Results: Twenty-seven participants were examined (aged 20. 4 ± 1. 05 years). Base up and base down measurements were similar, therefore measurements were combined to give a total vertical range. Median values for the break points were: 33 cm, 6 (Δ); 1 m, 6 (Δ); 4 m, 5. 5 (Δ); 6 m, 5. 5 (Δ); and for the recovery points were: 33 cm, 4 (Δ); 1 m, 4 (Δ); 4 m, 3. 5 (Δ); 6 m, 3. 5 (Δ). The difference was significant between either of the near measures (i. e. 33 cm and 1 m) and either of the far measures (i. e. 4 m and 6 m). Conclusions: The vertical fusion range appears to be slightly greater at near than distance. However, the difference is not clinically significant.

Methods: AC/A ratios were measured {{in a group of}} Orthoptic students. The distance deviation (at 3. 8 m) was measured with an alternate prism cover test using a Gulden <b>prism</b> <b>bar</b> with and without - 3. 00 DS lenses. A Shin-Nippon SRW- 5000 auto-refractor [Grand Seiko Company, Fukuyama, Japan] (open view) was used to measure the refractive state with and without a - 3. 00 DS lens. The {{stimulus and response}} AC/A ratios were calculated. Results: Data were analysed for 16 participants. The mean and standard deviations (SD) of the distance stimulus gradient AC/A ratio were 1. 98 : 1 (1. 30) and the mean (SD) distance response gradient AC/A ratio were 2. 43 : 1 (1. 60). A paired t-test found {{a significant difference between the}} distance response and stimulus gradient AC/A ratio values (t= 3. 58, p= 0. 003). Bland Altman plot suggested that the difference increased as the size of AC/A ratio increased. Conclusion: The response gradient AC/A ratio when measured using the prism cover test at a distance of 3. 8 m was found to be higher than the stimulus AC/A ratio in a group of normal participants who were Orthoptic students. This is due the accommodative lag which normally occurs when viewing through minus lenses. ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Early studies {{reported}} some abnormalities in saccade and vergence eye movements {{in children with}} vertigo and vergence deficiencies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to further examine saccade and vergence performance in a population of 44 children (mean age: 12. 3 ± 1. 6 years) with vertigo symptoms and with different levels of vergence abnormalities, as assessed by static orthoptic examination (near point of convergence, <b>prism</b> <b>bar</b> and cover-uncover test). METHODS: Three groups were identified on the basis of the orthoptic tests: group 1 (n =  13) with vergence spasms and mildly perturbed orthoptic scores, group 2 (n =  14) with moderately perturbed orthoptic scores, and group 3 (n =  17) with severely perturbed orthoptic scores. Data were compared to those recorded from 28 healthy children of similar ages. Latency, accuracy and peak velocity of saccades and vergence movements were measured in two different conditions: gap (fixation offset 200 ms prior to target onset) and simultaneous paradigms. Binocular horizontal movements were recorded by a photoelectric device. RESULTS: Group 2 of children with vergence abnormalities showed significantly longer latency than normal children in several types of eye movements recorded. For all three groups of children with vergence abnormalities, the gain was poor, particularly for vergence movement. The peak velocity values did not differ between the different groups of children examined. INTERPRETATION: Eye movement measures together with static orthoptic evaluation allowed us to better identify children with vergence abnormalities based on their slow initiation of eye movements. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis of a central deficit in the programming and triggering of saccades and vergence in these children...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The Mallett Unit is a {{clinical}} test designed {{to detect the}} fixation disparity that {{is most likely to}} occur {{in the presence of a}} decompensated heterophoria. It measures the associated phoria, which is the "aligning prism" needed to nullify the subjective disparity. The technique has gained widespread acceptance within professions such as optometry, for investigating suspected cases of decompensating heterophoria; it is, however, rarely used by orthoptists and ophthalmologists. The aim of this study was to investigate whether fusional vergence reserves, measured routinely by both orthoptists and ophthalmologists to detect heterophoria decompensation, were correlated with aligning prism (associated phoria) in a normal clinical population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Aligning prism (using the Mallett Unit) and fusional vergence reserves (using a <b>prism</b> <b>bar)</b> were measured in 500 participants (mean 41. 63 years; standard deviation 11. 86 years) at 40 cm and 6 m. At 40 cm a strong correlation (p< 0. 001) between base in aligning prism (Exo FD) and positive fusional reserves was found. Of the participants with zero aligning prism 30 % had reduced fusional reserves. At 6 m a weak correlation between base out aligning prism (Eso FD) and negative fusional reserves was found to break (p = 0. 01) and to recovery (p = 0. 048). Of the participants with zero aligning prism 12 % reported reduced fusional reserves. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: For near vision testing, the strong inverse correlation between base in aligning prism (Exo FD) and fusional vergence reserves supports the notion that both measures are indicators of decompensation of heterophoria. For distance vision testing and for those patients reporting zero aligning prism further research is required to determine why the relationship appears to be weak/non-existent...|$|E

These tests were repeated at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months post-operatively and data analyzed. Results: The pre-operative mean values and ranges were 26. 2 Δ (22 - 35) exotropia for group A and − 21. 3 Δ (14 - 30) exotropia for group B. The post-operative mean and range was + 0. 6 Δ esotropia (+ 20 to − 8) for group A and 8 Δ (− 2 to − 20) exotropia for group B. Mean grade of limitation of abduction changed from − 3. 8 to − 3. 6 versus − 3. 6 to − 2. 8 and mean grade of limitation of adduction changed from − 1. 9 to − 0. 7 versus − 1. 5 to − 0. 5 in the groups A and B respectively. Mean binocular single visual field changed from 14. 7 ° to 23. 3 ° in group A and 11. 8 ° to 26. 4 ° in the group B respectively. Conclusion: Lateral rectus periosteal fixation is an effective surgery to correct the exodeviation, anomalous head posture and improving adduction in Exo-DRS and partial VRT in addition is effective in improving abduction and binocular single visual fields...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether stereoacuity can be used as an indicator of prism adaptation. In particular, we wanted to know whether the time required for stereoacuity to return to the initial level after viewing through a prism can be used to determine the degree of adaptation. Materials and Methods: Eighteen subjects participated in this study. Stereoacuity and dissociated phoria were determined using the TNO stereotest and the Maddox rod, respectively. Prism vergences were measured using a <b>prism</b> <b>bar.</b> For each participant, prism power equivalent to the blur point of base-in (BI) and base-out (BO) fusional vergence at 40 cm was divided and placed in front of both eyes. At 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 min after prism introduction, the stereoacuity was measured, and at 0 and 12 min, the heterophoria was measured. Results: The repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant difference between the mean stereoacuity for BI and BO prisms at the different measurement times (p < 0. 05). For BO prism, the initial value was different between 0 and 3 min after the prism introduction, whereas for BI prism, a difference in stereoacuity was found between the pre-prism value and the value at 0, 3 and 6 min. The size of the heterophoria with BO and BI prisms was different from 0 to 12 min (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: The time required for stereoacuity to return to baseline level was more than 3 min for BO, and more than 6 min for BI prism. In addition, the time required to return to baseline values was not similar for the stereoacuity and heterophoria. The recovery of stereoacuity is slower when adapting to divergence, as when looking from near to far. This implies that stereopsis responds faster to near targets than to distant one, and may precede complete phoria adaptation. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

40|$|Purpose: Ocular and/or vision defects {{are one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for the {{referral}} of young children to the hospital. Vision disorders are the fourth most common disability of children and the leading cause of handicapping conditions in childhood. In preschool-age children, amblyopia and amblyogenic risk factors, such as strabismus and significant refractive errors, are the most prevalent and important visual disorders. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the prevalence of visual disorders in preschool children in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Methods: Four hundred and eighty-four children attending eight preschools in Kathmandu Valley underwent detailed optometric examination. Visual acuity was assessed with either Sheridan Gardiner or Kay Picture chart monocularly. Binocularity was assessed with cover test and <b>prism</b> <b>bar</b> neutralisation. Refraction was carried out in all children. In most instances this was done without the use of a cycloplegic agent. Stereopsis was assessed with the Lang stereo test. Anterior and posterior segment abnormalities were assessed by using a pen light, hand-held slit lamp, and direct ophthalmoscope. Results: Refractive error was the most common visual disorder. Considering our criteria of refractive error for myopia ≥ 0. 50 D, hyperopia ≥ 1. 50 D, astigmatism ≥ 1. 00 D, and anisometropia ≥ 1. 00 D, the overall prevalence of refractive error in our study was 31. 82 %. The overall prevalence of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism was 24. 17 %, 2. 48 %, and 5. 17 %, respectively. Anisometropia was present in 1. 65 % of the participants, and 2 %, 1. 4 %, and 0. 2 % had strabismus, amblyopia, and nystagmus, respectively. Conclusion: The relatively high prevalence of refractive error in our studied population needs more attention. The results suggest that there is a need for a large-scale community-based preschool screening program in Nepal so that affected children can be identified early and appropriate treatment can be started promptly...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} distance and near stereoacuity and fusional vergence in patients with intermittent exotropia [X(T) ] and their change after surgery. Materials and Methods: This prospective interventional institution-based clinical study included 31 cases of X(T) requiring surgery and 33 age, sex-matched controls. All subjects underwent complete orthoptic assessment including near stereopsis (Randot stereogram) and distance stereopsis by polaroid stereo-projector apparatus using special paired slides and fusional vergence assessment at distance and near <b>prism</b> <b>bar</b> at baseline and one week, one month, three months and six months after surgery in X(T). Results: The successful surgical alignment rate was 74. 2 &#x 0025;. Preoperatively, cases demonstrated significantly poor distance and near stereoacuity, compared to controls (P < 0. 001). Mean distance stereoacuity (sec of arc) in normals, (X) T preoperatively and postoperatively was 344. 8 &#x 00 B 1; 139. 5, 1149. 2 &#x 00 B 1; 789. 4 and 450. 1 &#x 00 B 1; 259 while mean near stereoacuity was 34. 7 &#x 00 B 1; 9. 5, 68. 7 &#x 00 B 1; 31. 1 and 47. 4 &#x 00 B 1; 22. 6 respectively. Postoperatively at six months, significant improvement in stereoacuity was observed both at near and distance (P < 0. 05). Mean distance fusional convergence (in prism diopter) in normals, X(T) preoperatively and postoperatively was 20. 7 &#x 00 B 1; 4. 7, 18. 0 &#x 00 B 1; 3. 3 and 21. 4 &#x 00 B 1; 3. 6 respectively, mean near fusional convergence was 27. 8 &#x 00 B 1; 6. 3, 24. 1 &#x 00 B 1; 5. 5 and 29. 1 &#x 00 B 1; 5. 5 respectively. There was good correlation between fusional vergence amplitudes for distance and near indicating any one would suffice. Conclusion: Early detection of abnormal stereoacuity (near and if possible distance) and near fusional vergence amplitudes may help to decide proper timing of surgery in X(T) ...|$|E
40|$|Syfte: Studiens syfte var att undersöka prevalensen av avståndsforier och avståndstropier bland hjälpsökande i Ghana under en resa med hjälporganisationen Vision For All. Metod: Vid behov utfördes en enkel binokulär refraktion för att finna den bästa sfäriska ekvivalenten. Med denna eventuella korrektion på utfördes covertest på 6 m avstånd. Om indikation på att en fori eller tropi var förekommande mättes denna upp med prismastav och prisma covertest. Resultatet jämfördes sedan med liknande prevalensstudier i andra länder. Resultat: Av de personerna som screenades ingick 153 personer i studien. Åldern varierade mellan 5 - 85 år, där medelåldern var 47 ± 19 år. Hos 134 personer (87, 6 %) hittades ingen inställningsrörelse och de noterades som ortofori. Hos resterande var 7, 8 % exofori, 0, 7 % esofori. Exotropi och esotropi var lika förekommande med 2, 0 % vardera. Medelvärdet var 0, 27 ± 1, 21 Δ exofori för hela gruppen, med tropierna borträknade. Vanligast förekommande var 2 Δ exofori. Enbart två utav de sex upptäckta tropierna kunde mätas upp, dessa var 6 Δ esotropi och 10 Δ esotropi. Slutsats: Det vanligaste binokulära tillståndet på avstånd var ortofori. Därefter var den vanligaste binokulära avvikelsen exofori. Vilket ligger i linje med tidigare studier. Förekomsten av tropi var något högre än medelvärdet hos de studier som jämförts med. Denna studie kan ses som en fingervisning om hur prevalensen av avståndstropier och avståndstropier ter sig i Ghana. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of distance heterophoria and heterotropia in a sample population of Ghana who attended vision screening camps from the Swedish non-profit organization called Vision For All. Vision For All collects, cleans and measures old spectacles in Sweden. During organized trips to less privileged countries in the world they perform eye examinations and donate spectacles. At first a simple eye examination was performed to find the patients’ best binocular spherical equivalent. Then to determine if a distance phoria or tropia was present, the unilateral and alternating cover test were used. If a heterophoria or heterotropia was found the prism cover test was performed using a <b>prism</b> <b>bar</b> to determine the size. 153 people were included in the study, with an average age of 47 ± 19 years and ranging between 5 - 85 years. The study found that 87, 6 % were orthophoric at distance. 7, 8 % were exophoric and 0, 7 % were esophoric. Exo- and esotropia were 2, 0 % respectively. The average deviation size for the whole group was 0, 27 ± 1, 21 Δ exophoria, where 2 Δ exophoria was the most common. Only two of the six found tropias could be measured, they were 6 Δ esotropia and 10 Δ esotropia. Earlier studies confirm that the most common condition is no deviation at distance and that an exophoric state is the second most common condition. The presence of tropia in this study was more frequent than the mean of other studies presented in this paper. This study only shows a hint of how the prevalence of distance heterophoria and heterotropia is in Ghana. Desirably further prevalence studies should be conducted with more stable conditions, better spectacle correction and a bigger sample size to accomplish higher reliability...|$|E
