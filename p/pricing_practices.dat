25|$|If {{significant}} use of bicycles {{for shopping}} trips {{is to be}} achieved, sufficient retail services must be maintained within reasonable cycling distances of residential areas. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany {{the high levels of}} utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle. It is arguable that this is related to policies that favour access to retail services by non-motorised modes. The Danish 1997 Planning Act requires that planning shall encourage a diverse mix of retail shops in small and medium-sized towns and in individual districts of large cities and ensure that retail trade uses will be placed in locations to which people have good access by walking, bicycling and public transport. From the mid-1970s the Netherlands has had policies in place to severely restrict the growth of large out-of-town retail developments. Germany has had federal planning regulations in place to restrict retail uses to designated areas since the 1960s. In addition, since the 1970s federal regulations have been in place specifying that developments above a certain size (1,200m²) be assessed regarding potential adverse effects. These federal regulations are further strengthened by regionally adopted regulations. This includes regulations specifying that new retail centres be limited to selling products not readily provided by shops at inner city/town centre locations. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, this approach not restricted to planning guidelines and is also supported by a ban on below cost selling. This supports smaller shops by preventing large multiples from engaging in predatory <b>pricing</b> <b>practices</b> by aggressively discounting key goods to use as so called loss leaders.|$|E

2500|$|McGee had {{concerns}} about falling cattle prices and that large chain drug stores were engaging in unfair practices with large meat processors {{at the expense}} of western cattle farmers. He felt an investigation was necessary to assess the “complete change” that had occurred in food marketing since World War II. He said the Commission should establish what, if any, “is the relationship between the phenomena of the food chain store and the increasing cost squeeze on the farm front.” [...] On April 26, 1963, McGee introduced S J Res 71 which authorized the Federal Trade Commission to conduct an investigation of purchasing, processing, marketing and <b>pricing</b> <b>practices</b> of large chain stores to determine whether there may have been any violation of antitrust laws. Special emphasis was to be given to why a sharp drop in meat producers' income since January 1963 had not been reflected in consumer prices, which had generally remained level since a rise in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the U.S. {{government}} investigated the brokerage industry's <b>pricing</b> <b>practices.</b> They concluded {{the industry was}} engaged in price fixing. The government told the brokerage industry that, as of May 1, 1975 it {{would be required to}} [...] "fully negotiate" [...] brokerage commissions with each client for each trade. As the May 1, 1975 deadline approached the brokerage industry went through several changes in an attempt to restructure itself so it could offer services and negotiate the price of each service separately. In the industry this process was known as [...] "unbundling" [...] and it created the discount-brokerage segment of the industry. At the same time, the brokerage industry lobbied Congress to allow it to continue to include the cost of investment research given to institutional clients as part of the fully negotiated commission. Shortly after May 1, 1975 Congress passed an amendment to Section 28 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 28(e) provides a [...] "safe harbor" [...] for any fiduciary that [...] "pays up" [...] from its fully negotiated commission rate to receive qualifying research or brokerage services from its broker(s).|$|E

50|$|Predatory <b>pricing</b> <b>practices</b> {{may result}} in {{antitrust}} claims of monopolization or attempts to monopolize. Businesses with dominant or substantial market shares are more vulnerable to antitrust claims. However, because the antitrust laws are ultimately intended to benefit consumers, and discounting results in at least short-term net benefit to consumers, the U.S. Supreme Court has set high hurdles to antitrust claims based on a predatory pricing theory. The Court requires plaintiffs to show a likelihood that the <b>pricing</b> <b>practices</b> will affect not only rivals but also competition in the market as a whole, {{in order to establish}} that there is a substantial probability of success of the attempt to monopolize. If there is a likelihood that market entrants will prevent the predator from recouping its investment through supra competitive pricing, then there is no probability of success and the antitrust claim would fail. In addition, the Court established that for prices to be predatory, they must be below the seller's cost.|$|E

30|$|The {{relationship}} between innovation process and competition-informed pricing {{is found to}} be significant in the Malaysian telecommunications sector whereas in the Bangladeshi telecommunications sector, it is insignificant. Theoretically, innovation process refers to the mechanistic stand of the organisation. According to Liker et al. (1999) and Tidd and Hull (2011), a mechanistic organisation is appropriate when the environment is efficient, effective, and stable. The findings of this study reflect what was advocated earlier in the context of innovation in developed countries. The Malaysian telecommunications sector is presumably at a mature stage with greater efficiency and effectiveness compared to the Bangladeshi telecommunications sector. Such an efficient and mature state of the industry instigates us to consider the most important stakeholder in the business environment such as competitors. With this contextual argument, it is noteworthy to state that the Malaysian telecommunications industry takes into account the competition-informed <b>pricing</b> <b>practice</b> with the mechanistic state of business operation. However, the innovation process can improve firm’s performance if the <b>practice</b> of gathering <b>price</b> related information from competitors is emphasized. Competition-informed pricing helps managers in the Malaysian telecommunications field to understand the upper-limit of the price decision while practising the innovation process for performance improvement. Therefore, it is important to mention that through the competition-informed <b>pricing</b> <b>practice,</b> the mechanistic state of organisation can assist to achieve performance.|$|R
