40|$|Since 1990, {{the date}} of German reunification, urban {{development}} and especially the recovery of inner cities in East Germany has been delayed by several factors including real estate restitution claims, inflexible <b>preservation</b> <b>codes</b> for historic buildings, and the shortage of stores for retailers. This blockade situation {{has resulted in the}} quick and intensified development of shopping centres as „inner city substitutes“ on the urban periphery. The combined effect of the factors preventing revitalisation strategies and the newly realised and practised potential for autonomous action by the authorities of smaller municipalities was a severe restriction for the governing capacities of the authorities of the larger cities. in regaining their governance capability city governments are dependent on urban groups joining and supporting public developmental strategies. In accordance with Stone (1993) and Stoker and Mossberger (1994) urban groups active in urban development policy can be described as urban regimes. In Germany three types of regimes can be differentiated. The cities differ with respect to the political strength and the forms of coalition and conflict between different urban regimes. Specific conditions in East Germany have led to a special regime constellation with a powerful „conservation regime“ {{on the one hand and}} a vivid „globalisation regime“ on the other hand. This conflicting constellation results in a developmental blockade. The hypothesis is that a third regime type, the „local alliance“, is missing and still has to be created by practices such as city marketing and city management. Only when this regime building process has advanced will new constellations of political coalitions and compromise become possible and be able to reduce governance problems of city government in the long run. ...|$|R

30|$|We propose an {{approach}} toward the <b>preservation</b> of structural <b>code</b> coverage when transforming the program. To achieve this, we introduce in Section 3 a notation to formally define structural code-coverage criteria. In Section 4 we present coverage preservation {{criteria for the}} different variants of structural code coverage. As described in Section 5, these criteria can help to extend a compiler with the ability of preserving coverage achieved at source level. The code coverage is preserved by prohibiting all code transformations that can disrupt the concrete structural code coverage metric. If full coverage preservation is not strictly required, the compiler {{may be used in}} a special mode where all available code transformations are allowed but a warning is emitted if structural code coverage may be compromised by an applied code optimization. Issues of preserving model coverage by code generators are discussed in Section 6.|$|R

We consider a two layer coding scheme in which a base SDR layer is coded with HEVC, inverse tone mapped and subtracted from the input HDR signal to yield the enhancement HDR layer. The tone mapping curve design is formulated as the minimization of the distortion on the reconstructed HDR signal under the constraint of a total rate cost on both layers, while preserving a good quality for the SDR signal. We first demonstrate that the optimum tone mapping function only depends on {{the rate of the}} base SDR layer and that the minimization problem can be separated in two consecutive minimization steps.

40|$|Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) {{has been}} used with speech for many years. It {{has not been as}} {{successful}} for images because of poor edge performance. The only corruption in DPC is quantizer error but this corruption becomes quite large in the region of an edge because of the abrupt changes in the statistics of the signal. We introduce two improved DPCM schemes; Edge correcting DPCM and Edge <b>Preservation</b> Differential <b>Coding.</b> These two coding schemes will detect the edges and take action to correct them. In an Edge Correcting scheme, the quantizer error for an edge is encoded using a recursive quantizer with entropy coding and sent to the receiver as side information. In an Edge Preserving scheme, when the quantizer input falls in the overload region, the quantizer error is encoded and sent to the receiver repeatedly until the quantizer input falls in the inner levels. Therefore these coding schemes increase the bit rate in the region of an edge and require variable rate channels. We implement these two variable rate coding schemes on a token wing network. Timed token protocol supports two classes of messages; asynchronous and synchronous. The synchronous class provides a pre-allocated bandwidth and guaranteed response time. The remaining bandwidth is dynamically allocated to the asynchronous class. The Edge Correcting DPCM is simulated by considering the edge information under the asynchronous class. For the simulation of the Edge Preserving scheme, the amount of information sent each time is fixed, but the length of the packet or the bit rate for that packet is chosen depending on the availability capacity. The performance of the network, and the performance of the image coding algorithms, is studied...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} between different techniques for depth compression and view synthesis rendering with multiview video plus scene depth data. Two different approaches for depth coding are compared, namely H. 264 /MVC, using temporal and inter-view reference images for efficient prediction, and the novel platelet-based coding algorithm, characterized by being adapted to the special characteristics of depth-images. Since depth-images are a 2 D representation of the 3 D scene geometry, depth-image errors lead to geometry distortions. Therefore, the influence of geometry distortions resulting from coding artifacts is evaluated for both coding approaches in two different ways. First, the variation of 3 D surface meshes is analyzed using the Hausdorff distance and second, the distortion is evaluated for 2 D view synthesis rendering, where color and depth information are used together to render virtual intermediate camera views of the scene. The results show that-although its rate-distortion (R-D) performance is worse-platelet-based depth coding outperforms H. 264, due to improved sharp edge <b>preservation.</b> Therefore, depth <b>coding</b> needs to be evaluated with respect to geometry distortions...|$|R
40|$|Code-coverage-based {{testing is}} a widely-used testing {{strategy}} {{with the aim}} of providing a meaningful decision criterion for the adequacy of a test suite. Code-coverage-based testing is also mandated for the development of safety-critical applications; for example, the DO 178 b document requires the application of the modified condition/decision coverage. One critical issue of code-coverage testing is that structural code coverage criteria are typically applied to source code whereas the generated machine code may result in a different code structure because of code optimizations performed by a compiler. In this work, we present the automatic calculation of coverage profiles describing which structural code-coverage criteria are preserved by which code optimization, independently of the concrete test suite. These coverage profiles allow to easily extend compilers with the feature of preserving any given code-coverage criteria by enabling only those code optimizations that preserve it. Furthermore, we describe the integration of these coverage profile into the compiler GCC. With these coverage profiles, we answer the question of how much code optimization is possible without compromising the error-detection likelihood of a given test suite. Experimental results conclude that the performance cost to achieve <b>preservation</b> of structural <b>code</b> coverage in GCC is rather low...|$|R

40|$|Embedded {{systems are}} often used in safety-critical environments. Thus, {{thorough}} testing of them is mandatory. A quite active research area is the automatic test-case generation for testing embedded systems. To achieve high retargetability of the testing framework, the test-case generation {{has to be done}} at source-code level. However, it is challenging to guarantee that the test-cases obtained from the source code are also valid at the object-code level, since even in safety-critical domains programs are optimized during compilation, i. e., the compiler may also introduce new control-flow decisions to the program. In this paper we address the issue of how to guarantee the <b>preservation</b> of structural <b>code</b> coverage of test data during the optimizing compilation of the program. We analyze the formal program properties that have to be maintained to preserve different structural testing coverages, like branch coverage or modified condition/decision coverage. Based on this we describe a compilation profile that can be integrated into a compiler to allow the enforcement of structural code-coverage preservation. This work was motivated by current research activities to generate test data automatically from the source code, for example, for measurement-based timing analysis of real-time programs. ...|$|R

Rules {{are commonly used}} for integrity enforcement, i. e., for repairing database actions {{in a way that}} integrity constraints are kept. Yet, Rule Triggering Systems fall short in enforcing eect preservation, i. e., guaranteeing that repairing events do not undo each other, and in particular, do not undo the original triggering event. A method for enforcement of eect preservation on updates in general rule triggering systems is suggested. The method derives transactions from rules, and then splits the work between compile time and run time. At compile time, a data structure is constructed, that analyzes the execution sequences of a transaction and computes minimal conditions for eect <b>preservation.</b> The transaction <b>code</b> is augmented with instructions that navigate along the data structure and test the computed minimal conditions. This method produces minimal eect preserving transactions, and under certain conditions, provides meaningful improvement over the quadratic overhead of pure run time procedures.

40|$|This {{creative}} {{project has}} explored {{the relationship between}} fire codes and adaptive reuse of historic commercial architecture. The goals of historic <b>preservation</b> and fire <b>codes</b> are {{at opposite ends of}} the spectrum. The goals of preservation are to save and reuse historic spaces and materials that are frequently in conflict with the fire codes. Fire codes seek to ensure the health, safety and property of the community by regulating the design and materials of buildings in the community. Many of the buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places were built before building codes were implemented. As a result, it is difficult to apply modern code standards to these buildings without destroying the spaces and elements that make them unique. Finding compromises that best satisfy the intent of the fire codes and the goals of historic preservation has been the objective of this creative project. Fire codes vary widely from model code to model code. This problem is compounded by the adoption of the codes: many municiplities choose to exercise the right of home rule and alter the model codes to the need of the comm. This has resulted in fire codes that vary widely from community to community. This creative project has, therefore, dealt with general issues which are most likely to arise in the adaptive reuse of historic commercial architecture. In addition, this creative project has used the W. A. McNaughton Department Store (Ball Stores) as the test building. The McNaughton building is scheduled for demolition in the spring of 1989. As a result of this creative project, the exterior and interior of the McNaughton building have been thoroughly documented. Department of ArchitectureThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
