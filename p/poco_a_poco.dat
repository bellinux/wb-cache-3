5|$|IV. Allegro. This {{movement}} {{is written in}} 6/8 and in tarantella style, and is characterised by a relentless galloping rhythm calling on demanding pianistic effects with frequent hand-crossing and leaps across registers. It employs the three-key exposition, a recurrent element in Schubert's style. The first theme shifts from C minor to C major – another Schubertian feature, and contains many allusions to D-flat major, which finally becomes established in a climactic reference to the Adagio's characteristic plagal cadence. The second theme, proceeding with the enharmonic parallel minor of this cadence (C-sharp minor), further develops the cadence in its alternation of tonic and subdominant tonalities. After a series of modulations, the exposition ends in the traditional relative major, E-flat. The development section begins in C-flat with a new theme, derived from the last bars of the exposition. Later on, additional material from the exposition is developed, gradually building up towards a climax. The recapitulation is also written in three keys; the first theme is drastically shortened, {{and this time the}} second theme veers to B-flat minor, the result being that the closing section appears in the traditional tonic. The coda begins with a long anticipatory passage which stresses A-flat, the submediant, and then reintroduces the first theme, restoring the most of the music omitted from its reprise. This last passage is characterized by sweeping arpeggios with violent dynamic contrasts - a series of subito fortissimo decaying to piano, following {{the rise and fall of}} the melody. On the last iteration, the melody hits triple forte at the zenith of its register and then plunges four octaves in a descending arpeggio, <b>poco</b> <b>a</b> <b>poco</b> diminuendo al pianissimo. An emphatic cadence then concludes the piece.|$|E

40|$|Background-—The cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway is {{involved}} in the cardioprotective effects of postconditioning (PoCo). Although PKG signaling in PoCo has been proposed to depend on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt cascade, recent data bring into question a causal role of reperfusion injury signaling kinase (RISK) in PoCo protection. We hypothesized that PoCo increases PKG activity by reducing oxidative stress–induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) uncoupling at the onset of reperfusion. Methods and Results-—Isolated rat hearts were submitted to 40 minutes of ischemia and reperfusion with and without <b>a</b> <b>PoCo</b> protocol. PoCo reduced infarct size by 48 % and cGMP depletion. Blockade of cGMP synthesis (1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a] quinoxalin- 1 -one) and inhibition of PKG (KT 5823) or NOS (L-NAME) abolished protection, but inhibition of PI 3 K/Akt cascade (LY 294002) did not (n= 5 to 7 per group). Phosphorylation of the RISK pathway was higher in PoCo hearts. However, this difference is due to increased cell death in control hearts because in hearts reperfused with the contractile inhibitor blebbistatin, a drug effective in preventing cell death at the onset of reperfusion, RISK phosphorylation increased during reperfusion without differences between control and PoCo groups. In these hearts, PoCo reduced the production of superoxide (O 2) and protein nitrotyrosylation and increased nitrate/nitrite levels in parallel with a significant decrease in the oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) and in the monomeric form of endothelial NOS...|$|R

Call a finite group G <b>a</b> <b>poco</b> group over k if any finitely generated cohomological Mackey functor for G over k has polynomial growth. The main result {{of this paper is}} that G is <b>a</b> <b>poco</b> group over k if and only if the Sylow p-subgroups of G are cyclic, when p> 2, or have sectional rank at most 2, when p= 2. A major step in the proof is the case where G is an elementary abelian p-group. In particular, when p= 2, all the extension groups between simple functors can be determined completely, using a presentation of the graded algebra of self extensions of the simple functor S 1 G, by explicit generators and relations...|$|R

There is much stormy strife between the soloist and the orchestra {{and between the}} two principal competing keys. This is followed by <b>a</b> <b>Poco</b> adagio, interrupted several times by quicker, more disturbed sections.
