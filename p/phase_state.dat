We {{introduce}} a one-parameter generalized oscillator algebra A(k, 2) {{which provides a}} unified scheme for dealing with su(3) (for k 0) and h(4) x h(4) (for k = 0) symmetries. Finite- and infinite-dimensional representations of A(k, 2) are constructed for k 0 or = 0, respectively. Phase operators associated with A(k, 2) are defined and temporally stable <b>phase</b> <b>states</b> (as well as vector <b>phase</b> <b>states)</b> are constructed as eigenstates of these operators.

50|$|It {{has been}} shown by Fulda et al. that the {{naturally}} occurring compound resveratrol (a polyphenol found in grapes and red wine) {{can be used as}} a sensitizer for anticancer drug-induced apoptosis by the action of causing cell cycle arrest. This cell cycle arrest causes a dramatic decline in survivin levels in the cells, as it is known from the literature that survivin expression is highly linked with the cell cycle <b>phase</b> <b>state.</b> Thus, the decrease in survivin, which is a contributing factor to chemotherapy resistance and apoptosis induction therapies, would render the cancer cells more prone to such cancer treatments. Fulda et al. have demonstrated the benefits of resveratrol through a series of experiments. First, the authors of the paper tested the intrinsic cytotoxic effects of resveratrol. They found that it induced moderate apoptosis levels only in SHEP neuroblastoma cells. After, they tested resveratrol in combination with several different known anticancer agents. They found a consistent increase in the level of apoptosis induced by the drugs when resveratrol was also present. Moreover, they varied the order with which either the drugs or resveratrol was introduced to the cancer cells to determine whether the sequence of treatment had any important effect. It was found that the highest levels of apoptosis induction were observed when resveratrol was added prior to anticancer drug treatment. Next, the authors tested for any differential sensitivity to apoptosis linked to the phase of the cell cycle the cells were in. Analysis by flow cytometry revealed an accumulation of cells in S phase upon treatment with resveratrol. The cells were also halted in different phases of the cell cycle using special compounds and then treated with the anticancer drugs. They found that cells halted in S phase were significantly more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the drugs.|$|E
5000|$|Attempts {{are often}} made to place traffic signals on a coordinated {{system so that}} drivers {{encounter}} a green wave, {{a long string of}} green lights (the technical term is progression). The distinction between coordinated signals and synchronized signals is very important. Synchronized signals all change {{at the same time and}} are only used in special instances or in older systems. Coordinated (progressed) systems are controlled from a master controller and are set up so lights [...] "cascade" [...] (progress) in sequence so platoons of vehicles can proceed through a continuous series of green lights. A graphical representation of <b>phase</b> <b>state</b> on a two-axis plane of distance versus time clearly shows a [...] "green band" [...] that has been established based on signalized intersection spacing and expected vehicle speeds. In some countries (e.g. Germany, France and the Netherlands), this [...] "green band" [...] system is used to limit speeds in certain areas. Lights are timed in such a way that motorists can drive through without stopping if their speed is lower than a given limit, mostly 50 km/h (30 mph) in urban areas. This system is known as [...] "grüne Welle" [...] in German, [...] "vague verte" [...] in French, or [...] "groene golf" [...] in Dutch (English: [...] "green wave"). Such systems were commonly used in urban areas of the United States from the 1940s, but are less common today. In the UK, Slough in Berkshire had part of the A4 experimented on with this. Many US cities set the green wave on two-way streets to operate in the direction more heavily traveled, rather than trying to progress traffic in both directions. But the recent introduction of the flashing yellow arrow (see Traffic-light signalling and operation) makes the lead-lag signal, an aid to progression, available with protected/permissive turns.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{investigating}} the feasibility of a Ku- and Ka-band space/air-borne dual wavelength radar algorithm to discriminate various <b>phase</b> <b>states</b> of precipitating hydrometeors. A phase-state classification algorithm has been developed from the radar measurements of snow, mixed-phase and rain obtained from stratiform storms. The algorithm, presented {{in the form of}} the look-up table that links the Ku-band radar reflectivities and dual-frequency ratio (DFR) to the <b>phase</b> <b>states</b> of hydrometeors, is checked by applying it to the measurements of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Airborne Precipitation Radar Second Generation (APR- 2). In creating the statistically-based phase look-up table, the attenuation corrected (or true) radar reflectivity factors are employed, leading to better accuracy in determining the hydrometeor phase. In practice, however, the true radar reflectivities are not always available before the <b>phase</b> <b>states</b> of the hydrometeors are determined. Therefore, it is desirable to make use of the measured radar reflectivities in classifying the <b>phase</b> <b>states.</b> To do this, a phase-identification procedure is proposed that uses only measured radar reflectivities. The procedure is then tested using APR- 2 airborne radar data. Analysis of the classification results in stratiform rain indicates that the regions of snow, mixed-phase and rain derived from the phase-identification algorithm coincide reasonably well with those determined from the measured radar reflectivities and linear depolarization ratio (LDR) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} for iterative demodulation and decoding of convolutionally coded and interleaved Continuous Phase Frequency Shift Keying (CPFSK) signals with {{an irrational}} modulation index is presented. The algorithm {{is based on}} integrating the Per-Survivor Processing (PSP) technique into a Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) CPFSK demodulator. Using PSP, the phase offsets emerging from {{the difference between the}} irrational transmit modulation index and the employed rational receive modulation index are estimated within the PSP-SISO algorithm at each state and in each time step. These phase offsets are taken into account to calculate the soft information. The phase offsets and the soft information are then refined during several iterations and used to estimate the transmit symbols. Simulations have shown that with only five trellis <b>phase</b> <b>states</b> and after only four iterations, the proposed algorithm performs at BER 10 - 5 only 0. 5 dB worse than a quasi-exact algorithm which has sixt een trellis <b>phase</b> <b>states.</b> This enables a significant reduction in computational complexity {{in terms of the number}} of the trellis <b>phase</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
