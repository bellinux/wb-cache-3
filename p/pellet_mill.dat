40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDonghai WangLignocellulosic biomass such as {{agricultural}} residues {{tends to}} be a sustainable feedstock for production of biofuels and biobased products in the long term due to its high availability and relative low cost. However, conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels faces significant technical challenges. One of the major challenges is biomass logistics. The agricultural residues are often harvested during a limited harvest season and stored as bales with low bulk density, making them difficult to handle, transport, store, and use in their natural forms. Densification of biomass by pelleting process could significantly improve the bulk density of biomass and thus improve handling efficiency and reduce transportation and handing costs. The main focus of this research was to better understand the impacts of pelleting process as well as pelleting conditions on physical properties, chemical compositions, biomass structure, and fermentable sugar yield of sorghum stalk, corn stover, wheat straw, and big bluestem. Results showed that pelleting process can increase biomass density up to 9 - 12 folds. Pelleting condition such as hammer mill screen size and ring-die <b>pelleting</b> <b>mill</b> die thickness had significant effects on bulk density, true density, and durability of biomass pellets. Although the pelleting process did not show significant effects on chemical composition of biomass before dilute-acid pretreatment process, glucan content of biomass pellets increased with the increase in ring-die <b>pelleting</b> <b>mill</b> die thickness and decreased with the increase in mill screen size after dilute-acid pretreatment. Opposite trend was observed for xylan content of biomass pellets as affected by pelleting conditions after dilute-acid pretreatment process. Biomass crystallinity increased after pelleting process, but not in a significant level. Softened surface region of biomass was removed after pelleting process, making the biomass more amendable to enzymatic attack. In this study, the optimum pelleting conditions were to grind the biomass feed using a 6. 5 -mm mill screen and to pellet biomass using a 44. 5 -mm ring-die <b>pelleting</b> <b>mill</b> die thickness. Under this optimum pelleting condition, the enzymatic conversion of cellulose of wheat straw pellets was the highest (94. 1 %), followed by corn stover pellet (93. 1 %), sorghum stalk pellet (92. 1 %), and big bluestem pellet (91. 1 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Swine Industry Day, 2014 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 2014 A 3 -wk study was {{conducted}} at a commercial feed mill in northwest Iowa to determine where the formation of fines occurs during pelleted feed manufacturing and if differences are present in nutrient composition between fines and pellets. During the study, 1, 781 pelleted feed samples were collected from 4 swine and 2 turkey diets. Samples were collected from 4 different locations throughout the mill to determine progression of fines formation during the manufacturing process. These locations included the <b>pellet</b> <b>mill,</b> pellet cooler, fat coater, and at load-out. Samples were taken on 7 to 10 different runs for each diet throughout the 3 -wk period. Pellet durability index (PDI) and percentage fines were determined for all samples, and nutrient analysis was determined on a pooled sample from each run within diet. Nutrient analysis was determined via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) at the processing site and via wet chemistry at a commercial lab. Overall, PDI was different (P < 0. 05) between locations in the mill. Pellet durability index increased from the <b>pellet</b> <b>mill</b> to the fat coater but then decreased between the fat coater and load-out. The largest increase in PDI was seen between the cooler and fat coater. Percentage fines decreased (P < 0. 05) from the <b>pellet</b> <b>mill</b> to the cooler, but then increased as pellets went to the fat coater and then to load-out. The largest increase in fines {{was found between the}} cooler and fat coater and between the fat coater and loadout (5. 6 and 6. 5 %). Dry matter and crude fiber were greater (P < 0. 05) and fat tended to be greater (P < 0. 08) in fines than in pellets as determined by NIR, whereas CP was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in the fines than in pellets. These differences were verified by wet chemistry results. Wet chemistry also found that fines tended to be higher (P < 0. 05) in ADF, but fines were similar in Ca and P compared with pellets. In conclusion, fines increased as pellets were moved from the <b>pellet</b> <b>mill</b> to the load-out area. Pellet durability index improved from the <b>pellet</b> <b>mill</b> to the fat coater due to the removal of moisture in the pellet but then worsened at load-out, most likely due to the addition of fat, which may have started to soften the pellets. Both NIR and wet chemistry found that fines were higher in fiber and fat but lower in CP than pellets. These differences in nutrient content of the pellets compared with fines and the possibility of fines refusal at the feeder may lead to poorer pig performance. More {{research is needed to determine}} if fines formation can be reduced in the mill and if differences in nutrient composition of fines compared with pellets could lead to performance differences in pigs...|$|E

40|$|In 2008, the dry-grind ethanol {{industry}} produced 23 {{million metric}} tons of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). Currently DDGS is sold as a feedstock but due to its quality and handling issues, competing with other feed products is challenging. <b>Pellet</b> <b>mills</b> {{have been used in}} the past to enhance DDGS handling and prevent particle segregation during transportation. The current drawback to pelleting DDGS is the high capital and maintenance costs. Instead of using expensive <b>pellet</b> <b>mills,</b> the use of wet granulation has been proposed to enhance DDGS densification and handling while minimizing costs. ^ A lab scale drum granulation process was used to manufacture granules of DDGS by adding condensed distillers solubles (CDS) to wet distillers grains (WDG) under varying formulation and process conditions. A full factorial experimental design was used to test all combinations of factor levels which included CDS binder addition (30, 35, and 40 % (wt/wt)), CDS solids content (22 and 38 %, wet basis), screen size opening (3. 175 and 6. 35 mm), and residence time (1, 2. 5, 5, and 10 min). Measured response variables included mean particle size, bulk density, true density, granule yield (3. 35 - 1. 68 mm), and porosity. Results from the experiment indicated that as binder addition increased between 30, 35, and 40 % mean particle size of the final granules increased to 2. 08, 3. 15, and 4. 45 mm, respectively. As binder solids content increased, the bulk density increased due to the increased amount of dry matter in the final granular product. Porosity decreased as solids content increased mainly due to greater shrinkage of the granules during the drying process. Screen size opening also affected nucleation which influenced the final size and yield of the granules produced. Compression testing of wet granule compacts indicated that increasing CDS binder addition and increasing solids content enhanced granule plasticity. Growth was observed for granules prepared from high binder additions, and low solids content while minimal growth occurred for material prepared from the high solids content CDS. The highest granular yields (~ 80 %) were observed at residence times between 2. 5 and 10 minutes with 35 % binder addition using the high solids content CDS and the small screen size opening. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{engineering}} {{economic analysis}} of a biomass pelleting process was performed for conditions in North America. The pelletization of biomass consists {{of a series of}} unit operations: drying, size reduction, densifying, cooling, screening, and warehousing. Capital and operating cost of the pelleting plant was estimated at several plant capacities. Pellet production cost for a base case plant capacity of 6 t/h was about $ 51 /t of pellets. Raw material cost was the largest cost element of the total pellet production cost followed by personnel cost, drying cost, and <b>pelleting</b> <b>mill</b> cost. An increase in raw material cost substantially increased the pellet production cost. Pellet plants with a capacity of more than 10 t/h decreased the costs to roughly $ 40 /t of pellets. Five different burner fuels – wet sawdust, dry sawdust, biomass pellets, natural gas, and coal were tested for their effect on the cost of pellet production. Wet sawdust and coal, the cheapest burner fuels, produced the lowest pellet production cost. The environmental impacts due to the potential emissions of these fuels during the combustion process require further investigation...|$|R

They are used to provide and apply controlled or metered amounts of lubricant to a part or piece of equipment.

Lubrication systems are useful in many industries, including packaging, printing, water and sewage pumping, textiles, food processing, chemical processing, mining, brewing and bottling, <b>pellet</b> <b>mills</b> and machinery production. Some of the equipment for which lubrication systems are used includes dies, chains, cables, rails, gears, pumps and any other moving and rotating parts commonly found on conveyer or assembly machinery.

40|$|Increasing {{production}} of corn masa for tortillas, chips, and related snack foods is resulting {{in large quantities}} of organic residuals requiring environmentally sound management. These byproduct streams appear suitable for use as livestock feed material, thus eliminating landfilling costs. Possibilities for developing livestock feed include direct shipping to livestock feeding facilities, blending prior to shipping, extrusion processing, <b>pellet</b> <b>mill</b> processing, and dehydration. To assess the viability of these options for reprocessing masa byproducts as livestock feed materials, an economic model was developed and applied {{to each of these}} alternatives. Through a series of simulation runs with this model, it was determined that direct shipping was by far the most inexpensive means of recycling masa processing residuals (10 – 57 $/Mg). Other alternatives examined in increasing order of costs included blending prior to shipping, extrusion, <b>pellet</b> <b>mill</b> processing (3 – 15, 5 – 18, and 4 – 18 times greater than direct shipping, respectively), while dehydration was clearly cost-prohibitive (33 – 81 times greater). Bagged feed was slightly more expensive to produce than bulk feed (1. 1 times greater), and reprocessing costs increased as delivery distance increased, due to increased labor, equipment, and fuel costs, but decreased as byproduct generation rate increased, due {{to the development of the}} economies of scale. Alternately, based on a tipping fee of 50 $/Mg, the total estimated cost to landfill ranged from 65 to 112 $/Mg. Based on this cost analysis, direct shipping and feeding to livestock is the recycling option of choice for masa processing byproducts.

Therefore, we examined feed <b>pelleted</b> from different <b>mills</b> as well as conditioning temperature as factors influencing our previous results. In Experiment 1, pens of pigs were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments with 10 pens per treatment and 7 pigs per pen. The 3 dietary treatments used the identical corn-soybean meal–based formulation and were mixed from the same batch of ingredients. Experimental diets were: (1) feed mixed at <b>mill</b> B but <b>pelleted</b> in <b>mill</b> A; (2) feed mixed and <b>pelleted</b> at <b>mill</b> B; and (3) feed mixed at mill B and fed in meal form. Experiment 2 was a feed preference study where pens of pigs were randomly allotted to the same diets as Experiment 1 with 4 pens per treatment and 7 pigs per pen. Pens contained 2 feeders, each containing 1 of 3 treatment diets. Feeders were rotated once daily within each pen for the entire 33 -d study with three diet comparisons tested: 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, and 2 vs. 3. In Experiment 3, pens of pigs were randomly allotted to 1 of 5 dietary treatments and fed for 16 d with 14 pens per treatment and 5 pigs per pen. Similar to Experiment 1, all diets used the identical corn-soybean meal–based formulation and were mixed from the same batch of ingredients. The experimental diets were: (1) feed mixed at mill A and fed in meal form; (2) feed mixed at <b>mill</b> A, but <b>pelleted</b> at <b>mill</b> B; (3), (4), and (5) feed mixed and <b>pelleted</b> at <b>mill</b> A at a conditioning temperature of 140, 160, or 180 ˚F, respectively. In Experiment 1, pigs fed the mill-B pelleted diet had the greatest (P < 0. 05) ADG, whereas pigs fed the mill-A pelleted diet had the lowest (P < 0. 05) ADG, with the meal diet from mill B intermediate (Table 6). There were no differences in ADFI among the three experimental diets. The mill-A pelleted diet significantly worsened (P < 0. 05) F/G and final BW compared with the mill-B pelleted diet, whereas the mill-B mash diet only tended (P < 0. 06) to worsen F/G compared with the mill-B pelleted diet. In Experiment 2 for comparison 1, pigs consumed more (P < 0. 05) of the mill-B pelleted diet than the mill-A pelleted diet, which translated into pigs eating 70 % of their daily intake from the <b>mill</b> B <b>pellet</b> (Table 7). For comparison 2 and 3, pigs fed either the mill-A or mill-B pellet consumed more feed (P < 0. 05) than the mill B diet fed in mash form, with the pellets equated to 90 % of their daily intake. For Experiment 3, {{there were no differences}} among the three diets pelleted under increasing conditioning temperatures at mill A, so they were combined for analysis (Table 8). Pigs fed the meal diet had improved (P < 0. 05) ADG compared with pigs fed the mill-A pellet with the mill-B pellet fed pigs intermediate. For ADFI, both mill-B and mill-A pellet-fed pigs had reduced (P < 0. 05) intake compared with the meal diet but improved (P < 0. 05) F/G. Final BW was reduced when pigs were fed the mill-A pelleted diet compared with the mash diet, with the pigs fed the mill-B pellet intermediate. In our study, conditioning temperature did not seem to explain the differences between mill-related growth performance differences observed in Experiments 1 and 2.

The effect of particle concentration and size of casein micelle aggregates (CMAs) on foam stability and thin film stability was investigated. Results showed that foam stability increased with increasing bulk concentration of CMAs. The actual aggregate concentration in foam lamella which account for an improved foam stability was well quantified using optical microscopy. Besides, the thin film measurements showed an increase in film rupture times with increasing aggregate concentration in the thin films for diluted dispersions, which confirmed the strong link between aggregate number in foam lamella and corresponding foam stability. At the protein concentration studied (2 %), the aggregates did not form a gel network in the lamella but were randomly distributed over the film. The film and foam stabilization by CMAs is ascribed {{to the fact that}} they effectively divided the whole film into film elements with smaller radius, resulting in a smaller critical film thickness for film rupture. Another effect is that film drainage can be slowed down by an effective suction pressure in the film due to the curvatures induced by the wetting of hydrophilic particles. In conclusion, aggregated particles of casein micelles around 5 – 10 μm prepared in this research could be applied to enhance the functional properties of dairy foams...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} {{different}} mill fracture mechanisms were examined {{for a wide}} range of densified biomass pellets to provide a comprehensive analysis of biomass milling behaviour for pulverised fuel combustion. The milling behaviour of 7 woody, herbaceous, fruit, and thermally treated densified biomasses were investigated for four distinct types of comminution fracture mechanism using traditional milling indices and novel application of 3 D imaging techniques. For the coal mill trials, a reference coal was used to provide a milling performance comparator. For the pre-milled samples, woody and herbaceous pellets have the least spherical particles (φ 0. 324 – 0. 404), followed by thermally treated pellets (φ 0. 428), La Loma coal (φ 0. 503), with olive cake having the most spherical particles (φ 0. 562). This trend was noted for all the shape factors. Conventional comminution did not significantly impact biomass particle shape, even after a significant change in particle size. Therefore biomass pellet process history plays a key role in determining the comminuted particle shape. La Loma coal had significantly enhanced milling performance in comparison to the biomasses in the coal mills. Significant improvements in grindability and shape factors were observed for the thermally treated <b>pellets.</b> <b>Mill</b> choking was experienced for several of the woody and herbaceous samples, which resulted in a significant energy penalty. The mechanisms of mill choking were found to be intrinsically linked to the critical particle size of comminution through compression, particle shape factors, and the Stokes conditions set for the classifier and burners in pulverised fuel combustion systems. The study showed that for optimal <b>milling</b> performance, biomass <b>pellets</b> should be composed of particles which meet the Stokes requirements of the mill classifier. This would minimise the potential for mill choking and milling energy penalties, and ensure maximum mill throughput...|$|R

Experiment 2 included seven treatments: the control with no added soy oil or glycerol, the control diet with 3 or 6 % added soy oil, the control diet with 3 or 6 % added glycerol, and the control with 6 or 12 % of a 50 : 50 soy oil to glycerol blend. Experiment 3 included five treatments: a control with no added lactose or glycerol, the control diet with 3. 6 or 7. 2 % lactose, or the control with 3. 6 or 7. 2 % glycerol. Each experimental diet was replicated by manufacturing a new batch of feed three times. Glycerol lowered delta temperature, amperage, and motor load in Exp. 1, 2, and 3. The addition of glycerol consistently improved pellet quality. Production rate was not affected by the addition of glycerol; however, glycerol decreased total energy usage (KWh/t). Furthermore, glycerol can be added to a diet in combination with soy oil in a blend to improve production efficiency and pellet quality compared to a diet containing only soy oil.

Experiment 2 evaluated Biofix in both low- and high-DON diets and showed no effects on growth. Experiments 3 and 4 further evaluated levels of Defusion {{and the effects of}} pelleting and supplemental nutrients in DON-contaminated diets. Defusion improved growth in low-DON diets, but had variable effects in high DON diets. Pelleting DON-contaminated diets resulted in comparable growth to pigs fed positive control diets in meal form. In Exp. 5 and 6, pilot studies evaluated DON-detoxification using sodium metabisulfite (SMB) with hydrothermal treatment in both an autoclave and a <b>pellet</b> <b>mill.</b> These conditions reduced analyzed DON by as much as 89 and 75 % for the autoclave and <b>pellet</b> <b>mill,</b> respectively. In Exp. 7 and 8, pelleting DON-contaminated diets with SMB improved growth. Experiments 9 and 10 evaluated feed-withdrawal time on carcass composition and economic returns. These experiments showed that pre-slaughter fasting for up to 36 h prior can be used to avoid weight discounts in heavyweight pigs without negatively impacting carcass composition and maintaining overall revenue. However, these advantages come with a potential reduction in carcass weight and increased incidence of leaking ingesta, which can result in condemned heads. Experiments 11, 12, and 13 compared phase-feeding to blending diets using an automated feed delivery system. These studies showed that corn-supplement blending is not economical and feeding diets blended to a Lys curve results in lower feed costs compared to phase-feeding, but due to reductions in growth and carcass weight, these savings do not translate into higher income over feed cost. Finally, Exp. 13 showed that over- and under-budgeting situations do not significantly influence overall returns, but pigs fed under-budgeted diets performed more closely to those fed correctly estimated feed budgets...|$|E
40|$|Deoxynivalenol (DON), {{also known}} as vomitoxin, was {{prevalent}} in the 2009 U. S. corn crop and subsequently present in dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), in which DON levels are about 3 {{times higher than the}} original corn source. One method shown to reduce DON levels was by increasing moisture and temperature when sodium bisulfite was added to DON-contaminated corn (Young et al., 19874). Therefore, a pilot study aimed first to replicate these results by placing DON-contaminated DDGS in an autoclave (60 min at 250 °F) in the presence of sodium metabisulfite (SMB). The study used 6 treatments: (1) control, (2) 0. 5 % SMB, (3) 1. 0 % SMB, (4) 2. 5 % SMB, (5) 5. 0 % SMB, and (6) 5. 0 % SMB with 100 mL/kg water added to evaluate the role of water. After drying, samples were analyzed at North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (NDSU; Fargo, ND). Autoclaving reduced DON levels (R 2 = 0. 99) with increasing SMB, justifying a follow-up study that aimed to assess whether SMB has the same detoxifying effects on corn DDGS in a commercial <b>pellet</b> <b>mill.</b> For this study, batches of 450 lb DDGS were prepared from DDGS with a known DON concentration (23. 4 ppm). The <b>pellet</b> <b>mill</b> was set to a production rate of 1, 000 lb/h so retention rate and conditioning temperature could be altered within each batch. Within each batch, 4 samples were collected at conditioning temperatures of 150 and 180 °F and retention times of 30 and 60 sec within each temperature. Samples were sent to NDSU for full mycotoxin analysis. No differences (P > 0. 15) were found in conditioning temperature or retention time on total DON, DON, or acetyl-DON; however, pelleting DDGS reduced (quadratic; P < 0. 01) DON and total DON as SMB increased. Based on these results, the reduction in DON and total DON levels appear to plateau somewhere between SMB levels of 2. 5 and 5. 0 %. These results imply that pelleting in combination with SMB may allow pork producers to utilize DON-contaminated DDGS more effectively, but additional research is required to determine the effect of pelleting SMB in DON-contaminated diets on growth performance of pigs...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{dewatering}} of cut alfalfa {{could replace}} the traditional method of field drying and {{would also be}} cheaper than total thermal dehydration in dryers. Juice from alfalfa also contains several compounds that would meet the growing demands of a low-calorie-fed population and also, provide compounds that could find a cure {{to some of the}} fatal communicable diseases. The major objective of this research is to find the pressure levels required to remove some of the initial moisture from shredded alfalfa {{and the quality of the}} pressed pulp and juice if alfalfa is mechanically dewatered in a pressure cell. The results from dewatering using the pressure cell are used to simulate the working of a continuous screw press for process optimization purposes. Experiments on dewatering of alfalfa were done on a screw press which is originally designed for extracting oil from oilseeds. The screw press was modified to simulate the field conditions of a continuous dewatering process for cut alfalfa. Measurements were done for dewatering power consumption and the pressed pulp was pelleted on a pilot scale <b>pelleting</b> <b>mill.</b> The quality of pressed pulp and expressed juice was analyzed at different screw speeds and choke openings. Using the available data from the above experiments, a quasimechanistic model was developed for the continuous dewatering process in a single-screw press. The model is based on a semi-empirical relationship given by Koegel et al. (1972) for dewatering of alfalfa in a batch-type hydraulic press. The model was tested against the experimental data and a sensitivity analysis was done by changing the variables. The agreement for predicted power and pressure is very poor. The results show that once the initial moisture is removed from fresh alfalfa at a low pressure of 2 - 4 MPa, further moisture removal from the dewatered pressed pulp becomes difficult even at considerably higher pressures. The efficiency of juice extraction can be enhanced by delaying the onset of the 'steady equilibrium moisture content state'. Comparison of energies using three different methods of pelleting shows that field drying can save energy by 13 % over combination of mechanical dewatering and thermal drying. Combination of mechanical dewatering and thermal drying can save energy by 45 % over total thermal dehydration. However considering the numerous value-added products obtained from the alfalfa juice and the fact that mechanical dewatering is a weather independent system, it seems to be a promising technology for the future...|$|R
40|$|The study {{draws upon}} the milling {{theories}} {{developed for the}} ore processing industry (Von Rittinger, Kick and Bond theories) in order to define a method for characterising wood chip and pellet energy consumption during milling. Energy consumption during wood milling depends on three main factors: the material moisture content, the particle size difference between the feed and the milled product, and the material itself. The latter may be characterised by a single parameter based on an adaptation of Von Rittinger’s constant. A relation characterising wood pellet energy consumption {{as a function of}} the particle size distribution of the pellet ingredients and the <b>milled</b> <b>pellets</b> is proposed. This is characteristic of each type of pellet for each moisture content value considered. Peer reviewe...|$|R
