5000|$|A <b>phonogram</b> is a {{grapheme}} (written character) {{which represents}} a phoneme (speech sound) or combination of phonemes, {{such as the}} letters of the Latin alphabet or the Japanese kana. For example, [...] "igh" [...] is an English-language <b>phonogram</b> that represents the hard [...] "I" [...] sound in [...] "high". Whereas the word phonemes refers to the sounds, the word <b>phonogram</b> refers to the letter(s) that represent that sound.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{significant}} portion of the Chinese characters is <b>phonogram,</b> whose phonetic part can be used for overall sound inference. Phonetic degree is an inherent problem in the inference because low phonetic degree implies little phonetic dependence between the <b>phonogram</b> and its phonetic components. Solving the phonetic degree problem requires association each <b>phonogram</b> with the acoustic features. This paper introduces acoustic feature-based clustering, a classifying model that divides the common <b>phonogram</b> by defining new similarity of the sounds. This allows phonetic degree to be evaluated more reasonable. We demonstrate the clustering outperformed the traditional empirical estimation by having more accurate and real expressiveness. Acoustic feature-based clustering output 48. 6 % as phonetic degree, less than the empirical claim which is around 75 %. As a clustering classifier, our model is competitive with a much clearer boundary on the <b>phonogram</b> dataset. ...|$|R
