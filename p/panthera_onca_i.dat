In 1939, {{due to lack of}} evidence, Reginald Innes Pocock accepted that other proposed subspecies, <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> arizonensis, <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> centralis, <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> goldmani, and <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> veraecrucis, were the same subspecies as <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> hernandesii. Therefore, the taxonomic name <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> hernandesii referred to a geographic group, if not subspecies, of jaguars, from the United States and Mexico in the north, Central America in the middle, and Colombia in the south.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> onca was {{proposed}} as a jaguar subspecies by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1939. before later research {{failed to find}} evidence for it.

In other words, the taxonomic name [...] "Panthera onca onca" [...] referred to a geographic group, if not subspecies, of jaguars north and west of the Amazon River, and south of Central America, including some Colombian jaguars, which was believed to include another group of jaguars, that is <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> centralis.|$|R

50|$|The Central American jaguar was {{proposed}} as a subspecies of jaguar, native to Colombia and Central America, with the taxonomic name <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> centralis (Mearns, 1901). In 1939, {{due to lack}} of evidence, Reginald Innes Pocock accepted that other proposed subspecies of jaguars, from {{the southern part of the}} United States to Colombia, such as <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> arizonensis and <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> hernandesii, and <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> centralis were one subspecies, before recent tests failed to establish evidence for different subspecies of jaguar. Therefore, the name <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> centralis referred to a geographic group, if not subspecies, of jaguars, from the United States and Mexico in the north, Central America in the middle, and Colombia in the south.|$|R
50|$|Earlier, Colombia {{was thought}} to contain two {{subspecies}} of jaguar, <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> centralis and <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> onca. Eventually, recent tests failed to establish evidence for different subspecies of jaguar, but that geographical barriers, such as the Andes Mountains, limited the flow of genes between them.|$|R
50|$|The Pantanal jaguar was {{proposed}} {{as the largest}} subspecies of jaguar, with the taxonomic name <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> palustris (Ameghino, 1888), native to the Pantanal of South America, besides Argentina, before later research failed to find evidence for different subspecies of jaguar. Besides Brazil, the Pantanal forms part of Bolivia and Paraguay, the namesake countries of <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> boliviensis and <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> paraguensis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> veraecrucis (Nelson and Goldman, 1933) was {{proposed}} as a subspecies of jaguar, which {{ranged from the}} Tabasco in Mexico to Texas in the United States, before 1939. In 1939, {{due to lack of}} evidence, Reginald Innes Pocock accepted that it was the same subspecies as <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> centralis or <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> hernandesii, before recent tests failed to establish that the jaguar was divided into different subspecies. Like other jaguars, its population faced a decrease.|$|R
50|$|The Peruvian jaguar was {{proposed}} as a subspecies of jaguar, with the taxonomic name <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> peruviana (de Blainville, 1843), before Reginald Innes Pocock (1939) accepted {{that it could}} be grouped with <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> onca, before later research failed to find evidence for different subspecies for the jaguar. It is found in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, and Manú National Park, Peru.|$|R

5000|$|Goldman's jaguar was {{proposed}} as a subspecies of jaguar, with the taxonomic name [...] "Panthera onca goldmani" [...] (Mearns, 1901), which {{ranged from the}} Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, in the north, to Belize and Honduras in the south, before 1939.

50|$|Before recent tests {{failed to}} {{establish}} that the jaguar was divided into different subspecies, it was presumed that different subspecies existed {{north and south of}} the Amazon River, such as <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> onca north of the river, and <b>Panthera</b> <b>onca</b> palustris south of the river. Eventually, it was reckoned that geographical barriers, such as the Amazon River or the Andes Mountains, limited the flow of genes between jaguars, if not restricting them to be different subspecies. Southern jaguars disappeared in a number of places, like the Pampas' part of Argentina and Uruguay.|$|R
