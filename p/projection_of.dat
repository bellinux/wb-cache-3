5|$|The known {{expansion}} {{rate of the}} Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the nebula onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae is clearly at the same distance.|$|E
5|$|The pinnae have {{an effect}} on facial appearance. In Western societies, {{protruding}} ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been considered unattractive, particularly if asymmetric. The first surgery to reduce the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845, and the first case report in 1881.|$|E

5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of flying through the sky while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands with a light gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a horizontal plane, but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third button of the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was added, {{with its}} width being {{determined by the}} <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the north transept chapel, with the west and east walls taken down at the time. The different thickness of the walls in the present church suggests that the wall {{for the length of}} the first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century. The church underwent a restoration in 1839, with £370 being spent, and in 1875 at a cost of £2,377.|$|E
5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse is {{transferred}} to the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
40|$|This article studies {{optional}} {{and predictable}} <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> integrands and convex-valued stochastic processes. The existence and uniqueness are shown under general {{conditions that are}} analogous to those for conditional expectations of integrands and random sets. In the convex case, duality correspondences between the <b>projections</b> and <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> epigraphs are given. These results are used to study <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> set-valued integrands. Consistently with the general theory <b>of</b> stochastic processes, <b>projections</b> are not constructed using reference measures on the optional and predictable sigma-algebras.

40|$|Abstract. The notion <b>of</b> {{the central}} <b>projection</b> in spaces <b>of</b> pencils is {{generalized}} and new concepts <b>of</b> <b>projections</b> are introduced. The category of projectivities with segment subspaces as objects arises. These general projectivities are collineations given by linear maps. Properties of pencils of segment subspaces and projections between segments are investigated. Classical <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> lines onto pencils of hyperplanes are considered {{in terms of}} spaces <b>of</b> pencils as <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> lines onto pencils of segment subspaces...|$|R

5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in {{the wild}} and for a similar period in {{artificial}} conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> its jaw called the egg tooth. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|E
5|$|Late in the game, Vanessa discovers a clone {{of herself}} in a CAMS {{facility}} but is forced to abandon her when the building's self-destruct sequence is initiated. After destroying the CAMS central core, Vanessa encounters a digital <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the client, whose appearance is identical to her own. She speculates {{that she is a}} clone of the client, but the client counters that none of their memories may be real. Vanessa debates whether to continue her work as a mercenary as the game ends.|$|E

5|$|Signs {{of a more}} {{positive}} reception to the Games began to emerge following its opening; on the first official day of competition, 20,000 tickets were sold (in comparison to a single-day <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> eight to nine thousand), and by the next day, at least 850,000 of the 1.2 million total tickets had been sold. By {{the end of the}} games, approximately 1.05million out of 1.2million available tickets were sold.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony struts, and the {{connection}} between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in Tarbosaurus. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E
5|$|The SG-1000's launch did {{not prove}} to be successful. The three launch games, {{all of which were}} ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name {{recognition}} of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. However, the situation was quickly turned around. Thanks in part to the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in part to a recall on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> 50,000 units.|$|E

A <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the minimap which showed each team's map control was shown {{on the floor of the}} arena between the two teams.

The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. The main gallery, described as cavernous and dramatic, includes objects such as a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier jet, and a British 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army's first shot of the First World War. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery.|$|E
