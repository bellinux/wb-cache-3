40|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanisms that}} govern the variation of alphas of a silicon <b>p-n-p-n</b> <b>device</b> with current are investigated and an analytical expression for the small-signal alphas is derived. It is shown that both diffusion and electric field contribute to the transport of carriers and, therefore, affect the device transport factors and injection efficiencies. The value of alpha can be tailored to the desired range by choosing properly the base width, the diffusion length and the doping levels. A numerical example is worked out and the small-signal alpha, the d. c. alpha, the transport factor and the injection efficiency are plotted as functions of current for several values of base width of the p-n-p section of a <b>p-n-p-n</b> <b>device.</b> It is seen that the small-signal alpha is always greater than the d. c. alpha in the current range investigated. © 1967. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{turn-off}} {{characteristics of}} p-n-p-n devices are investigated {{and a general}} turn-off criterion is established. It is found that the voltage across center junction of a <b>p-n-p-n</b> <b>device</b> {{at the onset of}} turn-off is not zero as assumed by previous investigators, but the junction is forward biased. Experimental results of the gain and junction voltages at turn-off agree closely with those predicted theoretically. © 1967. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|An {{optoelectronic}} p-n-p-n {{winner-take-all network}} is presented that {{can identify the}} location of the maximum intensity in two-dimensional spatially distributed light. An input pattern of illumination is incident upon an array of <b>p-n-p-n</b> <b>devices</b> that are connected in parallel to a common load resistor and therefore have identical voltage biases. If the light intensity at one or several elements exceeds a threshold value, only one p-n-p-n element stays on and emits light when the input light pattern is turned off. The element that is turned on is the one that receives the maximum illumination. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We have {{fabricated}} {{and assessed}} 1550 nm SIBH FP lasers using a novel Ruthenium precursor for MOVPE. Low temperature analysis revealed no unexpected defects and performance {{is similar to}} standard <b>p-n-p-n</b> current blocking <b>devices.</b> Accelerated aging at 85 degC indicates no significant degradation after 5, 700 hours on test...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of a gate-controlled <b>p-n-p-n</b> injection laser <b>device</b> has been demonstrated. The switching is accomplished by an electrical control signal. The threshold current of the laser incorporated into the device is about 100 mA, and its optical properties {{are similar to those}} of the Be-implanted laser reported recently...|$|R
