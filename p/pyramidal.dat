5|$|Basket {{cells in}} CA3 receive {{excitatory}} {{input from the}} <b>pyramidal</b> cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to the <b>pyramidal</b> cells. This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the hippocampus. The <b>pyramidal</b> cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these two}} palaces is the Hall of Union, which is square in shape with a <b>pyramidal</b> roof. Stored {{here are the}} 25 Imperial Seals of the Qing dynasty, {{as well as other}} {{ceremonial}} items.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a third lobe present called the <b>pyramidal</b> lobe. When present, this lobe often {{stretches}} up the hyoid bone from the thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The <b>pyramidal</b> lobe is also known as Lalouette's pyramid. The <b>pyramidal</b> lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland's descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the position of the thyroid in the adult. A small horn {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called Zuckerkandl's tubercle.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5 was a pyramid-temple. Excavation {{revealed}} {{at least}} two phases of construction and the <b>pyramidal</b> platform had a single stair that divided into two as it approached the summit shrine.|$|E
5|$|Built under Babylonian rule (605–539BC), {{the oldest}} {{monument}} {{at the site}} is a <b>pyramidal</b> building resembling a ziggurat that includes an access ramp to a water cistern. Fragments of marble column bases with Torus moldings and facetted columns found east of the podium are also attributed to the Babylonian era.|$|E
5|$|Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie uses a {{combination}} of double-circuit three-level pylons and single-circuit delta pylons to suspend electrical conductors of other voltages, such as 315kV. The ±450kV high-voltage direct current line in Hydro-Québec's power grid uses a T-shaped tower, lattice or pole, to support two bundles of three conductors on each side. The direct current power line sometimes uses two poles or a wider, <b>pyramidal,</b> self-supporting lattice structure for angle towers.|$|E
5|$|Locus 122 and Locus 123 are groups {{located on}} the {{floodplain}} south of the river. Locus 122, although unexcavated, is a compound consisting of a <b>pyramidal</b> mound and a NE–SW oriented plaza, similar to some Preclassic complexes in the highlands, for which reason it is presumed to date from that period.|$|E
5|$|Some 400 {{genes are}} {{shown to be}} brain-specific. In all neurons ELAVL3 is expressed, and in <b>pyramidal</b> neurons NRGN and REEP2 are also expressed. GAD1 {{essential}} for the biosynthesis of GABA is expressed in interneurons. Proteins expressed in glial cells are astrocyte markers GFAP, and S100B. Myelin basic protein and the transcription factor OLIG2 are expressed in oligodendrocytes.|$|E
5|$|Structure 17 is a <b>pyramidal</b> base in Plaza 2, to {{the west}} of Structures 15 and 16. It {{supported}} two rooms accessed via a double stairway on the northwest side of the temple. The entrance to outermost room once had two columns, although now only the lower portions of the walls and columns remain.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} {{temple in}} Guadalajara is <b>pyramidal</b> {{and has an}} innovative structure. The project began in 1983, when the Church's former temple built to accommodate 8,000 people was deemed insufficient to accommodate {{the growing number of}} people who attended various annual celebrations. Construction began on July 3, 1983 when Flores laid the cornerstone and lasted until August 1, 1992. The temple was completed largely by members of the Church. It is a notable architectural feature in Guadalajara in a working-class district {{on the outskirts of the}} city. Dozens of institutions, architects, and engineers were invited to submit proposals for a new temple. The <b>pyramidal</b> design submitted by Leopoldo Fernández Font was from the final shortlist of four proposals. Fernandez Font was later awarded an honorary degree for this and other structures. He said that one of his favorite works is the Temple of the Resurrection, but that the temple of La Luz del Mundo seemed difficult to him. The temple was built to accommodate 12,000 worshipers and is used for annual ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the <b>pyramidal</b> cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 <b>pyramidal</b> cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{composition of}} the painting is constructed upon two <b>pyramidal</b> structures. The perimeter of the large mast on {{the left of the}} canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E
5|$|The present château {{with its}} five conical towers and watchtower capped by slate roofs {{began to be}} built in the 15th century, and was altered and {{extended}} several times since then. A park was built in the 19th century through which a wide driveway brought visitors to the main building. This is based on a central square tower with a <b>pyramidal</b> roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks that}} form Snowdon were {{produced}} by volcanoes in the Ordovician period, and the massif {{has been extensively}} sculpted by glaciation, forming the <b>pyramidal</b> peak of Snowdon and the arêtes of Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd. The cliff faces on Snowdon, including Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, are significant for rock climbing, and the mountain was used by Edmund Hillary in training for the 1953 ascent of Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|The shrine was {{adorned with}} gold, silver and {{precious}} stones. In 1339, three London goldsmiths were employed {{for a whole}} year to rebuild the shrine to a higher standard. William Dugdale records that the shrine was <b>pyramidal</b> in shape with an altar table placed in front for offerings.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} in all mammalia, both in absolute and relative terms. The olfactory system is reduced, suggesting that the sperm whale has a poor sense of taste and smell. By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. The <b>pyramidal</b> tract is poorly developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.|$|E
5|$|Although the puffball was {{originally}} described as new to science by Elizabeth Eaton Morse in 1935, {{it was not}} published validly until 60 years later. The species is named for its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta, from which it can be usually distinguished in the field by its less prominent <b>pyramidal</b> warts, and microscopically by the antler-like branches of its capillitium (thread-like material among the spores). Calbovista subsculpta is a good edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white. As the puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of English cathedrals, uncommon elsewhere except in Normandy, is the large and often elaborate square central tower over the crossing. The larger of these towers range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The central tower may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester or in combination with paired towers at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three towers, the central tower is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western towers are capped by <b>pyramidal</b> spires sheathed in lead.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, <b>pyramidal</b> orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 is {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of temple and palace. It is situated on the southeast side of Plaza 2. The structure consists of a central <b>pyramidal</b> base flanked by two attached range structures. The <b>pyramidal</b> base is topped by a shrine containing three rooms, the final room of the three is circular. The temple has three steep stairways flanked by balustrades. The main stairway ascends directly from the plaza, those on either side are perpendicular to the main stairway. The balustrade of each stairway terminates at the top in a vertical panel. The temple facade is in good condition although {{the roof of the}} temple is missing. The range structures are unequal in size and each contains a single long room atop a low platform. The facade of each of these rooms once possessed a row of columns although only stumps remain in situ. This temple-palace is K'iche' in style and has been identified with the Nija'ib' lineage of the K'iche', being very similar to the Temple of Awilix at Q'umarkaj. A tomb was excavated in Structure 4, it consisted of a complete skeleton with associated offerings that included two tripod earthenware bowls, one with duck effigies, a tripod incense burner, a flint knife, nine obsidian knives, five jade beads and some fragments of gold.|$|E
5|$|The Apple House, a small red-brick {{building}} {{to the west of}} the stables quadrangle, also dates from around 1636, and can be seen in a painting of Crewe Hall from around 1710. Originally a dovecote, it is used as a storehouse. Built on an octagonal plan with two storeys, it has two oval windows with stone surrounds. The lower entrance has a stone semicircular arch; a second doorway is located at first-floor height. The <b>pyramidal</b> tiled roof is topped by a glazed lantern with a lead cap. The building is listed at grade II.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall is {{furnished}} with mostly 17th century oak furniture, including tables, coffers and wainscot chairs, {{and a great}} dining table, on which stand two blue and white late 17th century Delftware <b>pyramidal</b> tulip vases. One treasure of the home is the Lytes Herbal, a 16th-century botanical volume by noted horticulturist Henry Lyte, who was born and resided at the manor. Lyte's Niewe Herball was published in 1578 and was a translation and elaboration of the Cruydeboeck of Flemish herbalist Rembert Dodoens. The herbal was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. A copy is displayed in the Great Hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} {{are located on}} both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys. In humans, the right adrenal gland is <b>pyramidal</b> in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger. The adrenal glands measure approximately 3.0cm in width, 5.0cm in length, and up to 1.0cm in thickness. Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10grams. The glands are yellowish in colour.|$|E
5|$|The canons {{built an}} {{octagonal}} dovecote {{a short distance}} {{to the west of}} the west range. The dovecote is extant, though it cannot be visited and is not part of the priory grounds. Built in the 14th century, it was modified in the mid-18th century with the addition of a <b>pyramidal</b> roof tiled with Welsh slate and capped with an open-sided timber cupola. The original nesting boxes have been removed and the dovecote is used as a garden store.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built {{along the banks}} of the Loboc River. The coral stone church follows a {{cruciform}} plan, with a sunken <b>pyramidal</b> roof on its crossing. As a church built by the Jesuits, exterior walls of the church have the Jesuit insignia and icons of an angel's wing and head. Major renovations were undertaken by Augustinian priest Father Aquilino Bon, including the addition of a portico to the façade (1863–1866) and re-roofing with tiles (1873). Father José Sánchez, OAR, added stone buttresses to the walls (1891–1893) and side porticoes (1895–1896). Because of frequent flooding, its wooden flooring was changed to cement tiles in 1895 and was elevated in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{final season}} {{of work in}} 1843 was spent in fitting out the interior. By then Alan had become chief {{engineer}} to the NLB and the final work was undertaken {{under the supervision of}} his brother Thomas. The light, which had eight lenses revolving around a four wick lamp with <b>pyramidal</b> lenses above and reflecting prisms below each one, was constructed by John Milne of Edinburgh. The machinery was ready by the beginning of 1844, but it was seven weeks before a landing could be undertaken on the rock. The lamp was finally lit on 1 February and it shone without interruption for the next 110years.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} is {{primarily}} composed of neurons, glial cells, neural stem cells, and blood vessels. Types of neuron include interneurons, <b>pyramidal</b> cells including Betz cells, motor neurons (upper and lower motor neurons), and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Betz cells {{are the largest}} cells (by size of cell body) in the nervous system. The adult human brain is estimated to contain 86±8 billion neurons, with a roughly equal number (85±10 billion) of non-neuronal cells. Out of these neurons, 16 billion (19%) {{are located in the}} cerebral cortex, and 69 billion (80%) are in the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The mosque has an old Quran, {{believed}} by the locals {{to have been}} given as a gift from heaven in 1650 to Yidan Barimah Bramah, the Imam at the time, {{as a result of}} his prayers. The mosque, built with mud and reeds, has two tall towers in <b>pyramidal</b> shape, one for the mihrab which faces towards Mecca forming the facade on the east and the other as a minaret in the northeast corner. These are buttressed by twelve bulbous shaped structures, which are fitted with timber elements.|$|E
5|$|The pagoda {{was then}} {{completed}} {{by his son}} King Kyansittha (r.1084–1113). While its lower terraces were built by Anawrahta, the balance structure is credited to Kyansittha. Its final completion date is 1086 and the footprints below the four standing Buddha statues here are also believed {{to be of the}} same period. The pagoda is a replica of the <b>pyramidal</b> Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the location of Buddha’s illuminating realisation in India.|$|E
5|$|There are 189 rooms {{within the}} castle, {{making it the}} largest in the {{northern}} Highlands. Much of Barry's interior was destroyed by the fire of 1915, leading to the restoration by Sir Robert Lorimer, although he incorporated surviving 17th-century and 18th-century work, including wood carvings attributed to Grinling Gibbons. Externally, the castle has elements inspired by the work of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc, such as the <b>pyramidal</b> roof over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|According to Abdul Baqir Zein, {{the mosque}} was first built in 1700 {{at the foot}} of Mount Padang, then moved to the bank of Batang Arau, as the Dutch colonial {{government}} intended to use the previous location to build a road to Emma Haven Port. It was later moved to its present location. However, the Indonesian Department of Religion documents the mosque as having been constructed in 1790 with a wooden frame and a roof made from Sago palms. According to this documentation, a sturdier mosque was built in 1805. Another history of the mosque, from the Culture and Tourism Department of the City of the Padang, suggests that the mosque was first constructed in 1805. The small mosque had stone flooring, wood and dirt walls, and a <b>pyramidal</b> ceiling like the mosques in Java.|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta, {{commonly}} known as the loaded Lepidella or the gunpowder Lepidella, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family of mushrooms. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruit bodies that have white to pale gray caps crowded with roughly conical, <b>pyramidal,</b> or irregular gray warts. The stipe is whitish-gray with woolly or wart-like veil remnants, and at the base is a spindle- or turnip-shaped base that is rooted somewhat deeply in the soil. The species is distributed in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia to Mexico, and may be found growing on the ground in deciduous forests, particularly those with oak, hickory and chestnut. Fruit bodies smell somewhat like bleaching powder, and their edibility is unknown, but possibly toxic.|$|E
5|$|Chester Rock Light was a {{light in}} Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal <b>pyramidal</b> tower had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a daymark.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Ottoman Turkish {{architecture}} {{are located}} in the Old Bazaar. Mosques in Skopje are usually simple in design, with a square base and a single dome and minaret. There entrance is usually emphasised by a portico, as on Mustafa Pasha Mosque, dating from the 15th century. Some mosques show some originality in their appearance: Sultan Murad and Yahya Pasha mosques have lost their dome and have a <b>pyramidal</b> roof, while Isa Bey mosque has a rectangular base, two domes and two side wings. The Aladža Mosque was originally covered with blue faience, but it disappeared in the 1689 Great Fire. However, some tiles are still visible on the adjoining türbe. Other Turkish public monuments include the 16th-century clock tower, a bedesten, three caravanserais, two Turkish baths and the Stone Bridge, first mentioned in 1469.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, <b>pyramidal</b> orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat.|$|E
5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or <b>pyramidal</b> erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near the margin of the cap, and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the cap, and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E
