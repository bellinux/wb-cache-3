30|$|As {{noted by}} Groff [15], RAT <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> groundwork for interaction, {{but does not}} <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> {{framework}} for decision making. Cornish and Clarke’s [16] rational choice theory (RCT) contends that offenders are rational, similar to non-offenders; however, they have a propensity to commit crime that sets them apart. RCT <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> perspective by which offenders are rational actors and seek optimal strategies for themselves. RAT <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> framework for interacting pieces within a criminological system and RCT <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> theory for rational offender decision-making.|$|R

5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. The committee was of the view that the Boltzmann constant <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water, as it overcame these difficulties.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} on this theme were oil-lamp clocks. These early timekeeping devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> rough measure of the passage of time.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{preceding}} naval engagements around Guadalcanal, the strategic outcome was inconclusive because neither the Japanese nor United States navies secured operational {{control of the}} waters around Guadalcanal {{as a result of}} this action. However, the Battle of Cape Esperance <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> significant morale boost to the U.S. Navy after the failure at the Savo Island.|$|E
