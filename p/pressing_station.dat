Parts can be pierced, partially pierced, offset (up to 75°), embossed, or coined, often in a single operation. Some combinations may require progressive fine blanking operations, in which multiple operations are performed at the same <b>pressing</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

The station provides sealing of a hole in the injector body by ball pressing in. By using several tests the thesis finds out a reason of large amount of waste pieces, checks how can pressing-speed change or lubricant change infuence the pressing process itself and compares capabilities of hydrolic vs. electric pressing machine...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{industrial}} activities involving load balancing problems and there is currently no general approach to such problems. The genetic algorithm (Holland 1975), has proved to be successful on optimisation problems and is often used in conjunction with other methods. This paper describes and compares two methods which use the genetic algorithm to balance the load of the presses in a sugar beet <b>pressing</b> <b>station.</b> The first approach uses the genetic algorithm to optimise an on-line mathematical model of the station and then uses the resulting model to maximize the percentage of dry substances in the pressed pulp produced. The second approach implements the genetic algorithm in direct control of the station with the identical goal of reducing the moisture content of the pressed pulp. This reduction improves energy efficiency of the driers which dry the pulp to be used as animal feed...|$|E
40|$|Productivity {{is often}} used to {{determine}} how well resources are used for an operation. Most often, the ratio of what is produced to what is required to produce it determines productivity. Laminated veneer products are considered complicated products often with complex shapes, a raw material with high variation, and machining processes that create scrap materials that need to be handled. Therefore, keeping a high productivity in the industries producing such products may become challenging. This study reports productivity measurements in a production cell consisting of an adhesive, <b>pressing</b> and processing <b>station.</b> The study seeks to increase understanding of production-related problems in this industry. The research has been using productivity measurement as well as interactive discussions between researchers and workers. Measurement of downtime causes were made for 20 days, for a total of approximately 300 hours. The production cell had 1, 299 minutes of stops. Of those, 450 minutes were one-time events. The rest were intermittent disturbances. Many of them could be explained by the dust-laden air and processing residues but were also related to veneer and adhesive. There is a need for determining material and processing parameters; however, the first priority is cleaning the factory. From a social perspective, some other issues must be added to the discussion of this paper. First and foremost, the business has gone through a transformation from a family business to a privately held firm. From the non-family employee’s view, this is a huge change. This has resulted in unclear roles and responsibilities within the company, which has also affected the productivity of the company. Flexible automation in manufacturing of laminated veneer product...|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{resistance}} to extinction such as the generalized decrement theory (GDT) have been largely based on research involving isolated individuals. In the natural environment however, extinction, like acquisition {{takes place in a}} social context. Very few studies have addressed this issue and those that have either failed to create a stable social environment or have not addressed the effect of population density, an important aspect of sociality, on resistance to extinction. To study this effect a group of eight rats was exposed to two daily 30 -minute VI- 120 schedules of reinforcement in an eight station operant conditioning arena. During each of four phases of the experiment, the population was consistently exposed to the VI- 120 reinforcement schedule at a given number of stations (n=l, 2, 4, 8). Following each condition the rats were exposed to a session of extinction in which bar <b>pressing</b> at a <b>station</b> no longer produced food. To avoid the confounding effect of amount of reinforcement, since only the number of work stations available and not the reinforcement schedule changed, a second experiment was conducted in which the VI schedule was varied to compensate for the amount of reinforcement. According to the GDT the results should have produced an increased resistance to extinction during trials when the conditions of reinforcement were similar to conditions of extinction. This similarity occurred when fewer bars were available for reinforcement, which according to the GDT, should have created a negative relationship between responses in extinction and the number of stations presented. Exactly the opposite effect occurred; that is, a decrease in resistance to extinction was observed when fewer bars were presented to the rats. The data support an ecological theory of social foraging called the skill pool effect, which predicts a positive relationship between the number of responses in extinction and the number of stations available. This suggests that social learning and transmission mechanisms exist and should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of various learning and foraging theories...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} a comparison of two models of a genetic algorithm - the generational and incremental/steady state genetic algorithms - for use in the nonstationary/dynamic environments. It is experimentally shown that selection of a suitable version of the genetic algorithm can improve performance of the genetic algorithm in such environments. This can extend ability of the genetic algorithm to track the environmental changes which are relatively small and occur with a low frequency without need to implement an additional technique for tracking changing optima. 1 Introduction The genetic algorithm is a proven search/optimisation technique [Holland 1975] based on an adaptive mechanism of the biological systems. In our previous work we showed that the genetic algorithm is a suitable on-line optimization method to balance the load of the presses in a sugar beet <b>pressing</b> <b>station</b> [Fogarty,Vavak,Cheng 1995] and to balance the fuel load in a multiple burner boiler [Vavak,Foga [...] ...|$|E
