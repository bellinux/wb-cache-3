This study examines the influence of partners ’ views on auditors ’ <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> in China. This examination is important given the hierarchical structures of audit firms, and even more important in China given the strong cultural emphasis on subordination and obedience.

40|$|The {{continuously}} evolving {{landscape of}} the audit profession and environment, and the focus on audit quality, make <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> an issue of considerable contemporary significance. An apparent lack of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> reflected in auditors’ judgments and decisions {{has been identified as}} one of the causes of the corporate and audit failures in the past decade. Auditors continue to be criticised by regulators and inspectors for not exercising an appropriately high level of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism.</b> Responding to this criticism, research has investigated ways in which auditors may be assisted in applying an appropriate level of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism.</b> One area of enquiry has been to better understand scepticism as an innate characteristic (trait scepticism) and how it is applied and observed in a given setting (state scepticism). The growing body of literature, which continues {{to examine the relationship between}} trait scepticism and state scepticism, has not found a consistent relationship between the two, and this lack of clarity is a limiting factor in the search for ways in which auditors may be assisted in meeting ongoing demands for an elevated level of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism.</b> My dissertation is an endeavour to achieve a more complete understanding of the relationship between trait scepticism and state scepticism, by measuring and modelling a potential omitted variable that I refer to as trait seduction. Trait seduction is understood as the predisposition towards being influenced by attractive, but non-diagnostic, characteristics present in the environment (e. g., an attractive, modern, open-plan office space). Indeed, the audit engagement process takes place in a setting that exhibits various cues and information, and it is possible for auditors to be influenced, even unknowingly, by cues and information that are not relevant for an objective assessment of a client. Study 1 conceptualises the trait seduction construct, and develops a scale to arrive at a measure of trait seduction that can be modelled into the investigation of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism.</b> Study 2 incorporates trait seduction into the trait-state scepticism relationship within a controlled 3 x 2 experiment setting, using a sample of audit students substituting for junior auditors. The appearing image of the client is varied in terms of the appealing features of its appearance and presentation. I manipulate the client environment, and the attractive characteristics reflected therein, with the innovative use of videos embedded in experiment materials. In Study 3 I investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at encouraging sceptical application by countering the scepticism inhibiting effects of trait seduction. One intervention took the form of a briefing prompt aimed at making auditors aware of the potential influence of non-diagnostic information in their judgment and decision-making processes. The other intervention altered the manner in which the auditor interacts with the client, so as to remove the exposure to the attractive characteristics present in the environment. The testing of these interventions in a 2 x 2 experiment administered online on a sample of practising auditors reinforced the usefulness of incorporating seduction into an understanding of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism,</b> and demonstrated how corrective interventions based on this knowledge and understanding can help auditors meet ongoing demands for an elevated level of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> in their judgments and actions...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} evidence selection strategy among external auditors (i. e. professionals) and accounting students (i. e. novices) in a going concern assessment task considering three factors; hypothesis framing, prior expectation and professional “trait” scepticism {{as measured by}} Hurtt (2010) scale. Within this context, the study sets out to accomplish three goals: (1) to re-examine evidence selection strategy based on hypothesis framing and prior expectation, (2) to validate the Hurtt (2010) scale using expert reviews and confirmatory factor analysis and (3) to investigate whether professional trait scepticism influences selection strategy. Owing to the incidence of high-profile accounting and auditing scandals worldwide, the regulatory bodies identified {{that two of the}} top five areas that contributed to audit deficiencies are: (a) failure to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence and (b) insufficient level of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism.</b> However, it is to be noted that the regulatory bodies did not specify how <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> is to be measured. As a result, researchers across the globe explored this concept and tried to understand what factors influence <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> and how it can be measured. One of the factors was identified as the trait of an individual that affects <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism.</b> Other factors include incentives, knowledge and audit experience. This study was motivated by the fact that limited research has been conducted to date to understand the effect of trait scepticism on auditors’ behaviour. Accounting students were chosen to understand the influence of trait scepticism unaffected by audit experience. The result reconfirmed previous research findings that auditors across junior to partner level exhibit disconfirmation selection behaviour mainly because of sensitivity to the potential loss function for not identifying a failed firm whereas students exhibit confirmatory selection behaviour indicating they are not so sensitised to the loss function that may be due to lack of real audit experience. This study also validates the Hurtt (2010) 30 item scale and reduces the scale to 16 items to have a good model fit. With the reduced 16 item scale, trait scepticism was measured for individual auditors and students and the study found that trait scepticism had an effect on evidence search among students but only a marginally effect among auditors. The result {{may be due to the}} fact that although devoid of practical audit experience students are aware of the concept of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> and going concern assessment as these concepts are taught in their curriculum, hence were primed to the task and approached it cautiously. For the auditors, it may be the task did not motivate them to exhibit enough scepticism as they are well versed in the nature of going concern assessment. Further, other factors (i. e. states or situations) such as accountability, incentives, knowledge and experience also influence their day-to-day work and, therefore, may be in combination with trait scepticism, be required to exhibit sceptical behaviour. However, after controlling the different situations formed by a combination of hypothesis framing and prior expectation, the results showed that trait scepticism influences evidence selected among auditors but not among students. The study contributes to existing auditing literature by validating the Hurtt (2010) scale and by investigating the impact of trait scepticism on selection strategy among students in an Australian university and external auditors based in the US. Further, this study explored the impact of hypothesis framing and prior expectation among students and re-examined the effect of hypothesis framing and prior expectation using auditor...|$|E

40|$|Auditor {{independence}} {{became a}} focus of regulatory and accounting research due {{to a number of}} large corporate collapses involving fraud in the early 2000 s. The focus of research was the reduction of auditor bias, and attention to improving the auditors’ objective position as a means to enhance the identification of fraud and mitigate the risks of issuing an inappropriate audit opinion or being implicated in fraud cases. Audit team members are required, under the International Auditing Standards, to exercise <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> throughout the audit process. In Australia, this requirement is mandatory under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, and auditors have been held accountable in the courts for failure to exercise an appropriate degree of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> following audit failure. Two aspects under International Auditing Standard ASA 200 (AUASB, 2013 b) are associated with professional scepticism: A questioning attitude, and critical assessment of evidence. Interestingly, a professional level of that attitude is not defined within the Standard, so {{it is not clear how}} auditors can judge whether they are exercising an appropriate standard of scepticism. This research explored whether a ‘professional’ standard, or level, of scepticism could be identified, and developed the notion of level to distinguish a range of ‘professional scepticism’ from ranges of lay scepticism and less objective attitudes. The levels are then used to explore whether external auditors exercise the appropriate <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism,</b> as mandated by the International Auditing Standards. This extends prior research, which has attempted to measure auditor scepticism focused on the attitude factor only, and resulted in relative measures of scepticism that compared auditors with other auditors rather than comparing with a ‘professional’ level or benchmark. In this research, a conceptual model of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> is developed, illustrating the interrelationships between the attitude and critical assessment aspects. The literature informing the model supports the view that the attitude factor reflects an inherent trait, while critical assessment is a learned skill, developed over time, and influenced by training and/or experience. Together, these factors represent a default level of scepticism, being a default mindframe in the absence of prompts to increase vigilance, and distinct from a state that may be achievable by such an increase in vigilance. Three established questionnaires were combined to address the trait and skill aspects of the model: Wrightsman’s (1991) Interpersonal Trust Scale, Budner’s (1962) Intolerance of Ambiguity Scale, and The Curiosity and Exploration Inventory-II (Kashdan et al, 2009). These generic inventories were chosen to facilitate participation by non-auditors, enabling exploration of a broad range of sceptical and non-sceptical attitudes and skills, increasing the range of observations across the model continuum for the purpose of establishing scepticism levels. The resulting questionnaire was administered online to potential participants via social media. This method of recruitment enabled participation by subjects across the world, appropriate to the modern international educational, commercial and investment scenarios. Clusters of relevant participant groups were encouraged by advertising the survey to the memberships of qualified fraud examiner and auditor groups’ online discussion boards, and the social media construct was utilised to snowball recruitment to a reasonably diverse cross-section of adult internet users without accounting, auditing or fraud training. The non-specialist participants could be expected to have a direct or indirect interest in the truth and fairness of financial statements, as business decision makers, employees, investors and/or consumers. Participation was voluntary, anonymous and without reward. Of 298 completed surveys, 7 participants were excluded, resulting in 291 usable responses. After preliminary analysis, the survey instrument was analysed and reduced to a 17 -question instrument with a Cronbach’s Alpha of 0. 910 and two confirmed factors. Each participant’s data was scored in two ways: Firstly, a Bias Score indicated a degree of personal bias as well as the direction of bias, toward either trust or distrust, where a score of zero represents the lowest level of subjective or dispositional bias and the maximum bias score is +/- 26. This score was derived solely from the items in Wrightsman’s (1991) Interpersonal Trust Scale. Secondly, each participant’s data was received a Scepticism Score, derived from all items in the composite scale, converted to a percentage, where 100...|$|E

With this article we would like to draw attention to common self-treatment or self-medication in persons with psychiatric symptoms, and to the equally common fact that the physicians are – more often than not – unacquainted with this practice. Some of the most frequently used herbal medicines are presented in the article (registered in Slovenia as class C medicinal products). Regardless of their extensive use and implementation of regulatory procedures, in most cases qualitative and quantitative data are insufficient for final conclusions about their efficacy and safety to be reliable.

Conclusions. <b>Professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> (PS) {{has been widely}} recognised as the cornerstone of audit quality and {{the foundation of the}} profession, and {{remains one of the most}} important and underexplored topics in auditing. This dissertation makes theoretical, methodological and empirical contributions to the literature on PS by examining various antecedents to auditors’ sceptical judgments in the Chinese context. China is selected for examination because there have been calls for studies to provide richer and deeper understanding of auditors’ judgment and decision making (JDM) beyond Anglo-American cultural settings. The Chinese core cultural values, which emphasise collectivism, interdependence and harmony within hierarchy, substantially differ from the individualist and independent cultural values dominant in Anglo-American countries. Specifically, the aim of this dissertation is to provide empirical evidence on various antecedents to Chinese auditors’ sceptical judgments by taking into account relevant cultural values and within cultural differences in individual auditors’ personality. This aim is attained by three papers comprising the dissertation, which empirically examine the influence of various antecedent factors on Chinese auditors’ sceptical judgments, namely self-construal, partners’ views, and peer pressure respectively. The first paper provides empirical evidence on the influence of a relevant personality variable, namely, self-construal on sceptical judgments. Self-construal has been selected because this variable captures complex cognitive processes experienced by individuals and is fundamental in explaining individual differences at both cultural and personality levels. Self-construal is broadly classified into two categories: independent and interdependent self-construal. Independent self-construal emphasizes autonomy, uniqueness, assertiveness and independence from others, whereas interdependent self-construal emphasizes belonging, fitting in, conformity, connectedness and harmony with others. This study examines how Chinese accounting students in two distinctive learning and cultural environments, Australia and China, are likely to differ in their self-construal, and how these differences may influence their sceptical judgments. Final year undergraduate accounting students have been selected as proxies for entry-level auditors because they have not been socialised and influenced by organizational cultures of audit firms. The results show that Chinese students undertaking university accounting education in Australia scored higher on measures of independent and lower on measures of interdependent self-construal than their counterparts in China. Furthermore, this study examines the influence of self-construal on sceptical judgments through two conflicting and competing perspectives, namely, auditors’ perceived relationship with client management, and auditors’ perceived relationship with their superiors. The results support the perspective based on auditors’ perceived relationship with their superiors, and show that interdependents are more sceptical than independents. It is argued that interdependents are more concerned with pleasing and maintaining harmonious relationship with their superiors. Therefore, they are more cautious and more rigorous in carrying out their audit duties in order to ensure that they are not criticized by superiors. These findings suggest that possible competing and conflicting perspectives need to be taken into account when examining sceptical judgments. The second paper further empirically examines the influence of partners’ views on Chinese auditors’ sceptical judgments. The hypotheses development based on the Chinese cultural values which emphasize the importance of submission, subordination, obedience, and loyalty towards superiors, together with social contingency theory, suggests that auditors are likely to be under intense pressure to align their judgments with partners’ views. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with practicing auditors in two local and two Big 4 audit firms operating in China. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence that both a high partner emphasis on PS and unknown views of partners, lead to higher levels of auditors’ scepticism, and that a low partner emphasis on PS leads to lower levels of scepticism. Furthermore, this study measures the intensity of auditors’ perceived pressure, and examine the influence of such pressure on auditors’ sceptical judgments. The results show that a high (low) intensity of perceived pressure strengthens (weakens) the influence of partners’ known views on their sceptical judgments of auditors. The third paper empirically examines the importance of peer pressure relative to trait scepticism in influencing Chinese auditors’ judgments of <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism.</b> Prior studies predominantly from individualist and independent cultural contexts of Anglo-American countries provide strong evidence on the influence of trait scepticism on sceptical judgments but inconclusive evidence on the influence of peer pressure. This study extends the literature by providing evidence that peer pressure is of greater importance than trait scepticism in influencing Chinese auditors’ sceptical judgments. The findings from a between-subjects experiment suggest that in the Chinese cultural context, the influence of peer pressure overrides the influence of trait scepticism on auditors’ sceptical judgments. Additionally, prior research shows that auditors’ judgments are influenced by peer pressure in Indonesia, but not in the US, which provides contradictory evidence on the influence of peer pressure on auditors’ judgments between individualist and collectivist cultural settings. This study further contributes to the literature by showing that peer pressure influences auditors’ sceptical judgments in China, a collectivist cultural setting. The findings of this dissertation have implications for cross-cultural audit research, both international and national standard setters, as well as audit firms either operating in China or employing auditors with Chinese cultural background. Particularly, the findings of this dissertation suggest that attention needs to be given to cultural and personality factors and their dynamic interrelations in influencing auditors’ JDM and PS. Importantly, this dissertation suggests that contextual factors cannot be ignored in examining auditors’ JDM and caution needs to be exercised when generalising findings from individualist to collectivist cultures. While it has been recognised that PS may be influenced by various factors at the firm level, engagement level and individual level, very little attention has been paid to cultural contexts associated with PS. As such, there is a need to stress the importance of understanding PS in its cultural context. Overall, the findings of this dissertation suggest that greater insights into auditors’ PS and JDM from both cultural and personality perspectives may assist in enhancing quality and consistency in audit practices within and across countries, particularly in response to the international convergence of auditing standards as well as the growing cultural diversity in audit firms.

40|$|A hermeneutical {{model of}} doing {{research}} is adopted {{to investigate the}} process of coping and self-management {{in the experience of}} recovering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Three research participants who consider themselves as recovering or recovered from CFS were interviewed to obtain data for analysis. The findings are that once the participants cope with the uncertainty about the meaning of the onset of symptoms by defining themselves as ill in somatic terms, the participants use external social and treatment resources to cope with the onset of symptoms and being chronically ill with CFS. As a consequence of feeling stigmatised in relation to social and <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> about initially being ill and subsequently, being chronically ill with CFS, the participants become uncertain about the meaning of having CFS. Coping shifts to using internal resources by adopting self-management practises. In this process, firstly, existing self-management shifts {{in such a way that}} the participants view themselves as recovering or recovered from CFS, and secondly, the participants come to the understanding that difficulties with self-management cause and maintain CFS. The findings are discussed to conclude that CFS may be a misdiagnosis of difficulties with self-management. CFS itself may not be an 'objective' disorder, but a constituent of social processes. Becoming diagnosed with CFS arises as a consequence of the search for meaning in relation to the lay and professional assumption that psychological illness does not constitute 'real' illness, operating at both the levels of popular society and the doctor-patient relationship. Difficulties with self-management rather than the diagnosis of CFS provide a more adequate understariding of the participants' illnesses. KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 54 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on changes in auditor reporting behaviour in Australia, in particular, whether auditors change their likelihood of issuing a going concern opinion and change their audit effort in response to a challenging audit environment. Using non-financial Australian listed companies over the period 20052009, I test whether the propensity of going concern modifications issued by auditors, audit report lag and audit fees vary in the financial crisis period (2007 - 2009) compared with the pre-financial crisis period (2005 - 2006). I find an increase in the propensity to issue going concern opinions by auditors during the period 2008  2009 compared with the period 20052006; that Big N auditors respond to the GFC earlier than non-Big N auditors; and that all Big auditors increase their propensity to issue going concern opinions in response to the GFC, though the degree of increase varies between Big N auditors. However, variation between Big N auditors in propensity to issue going concern opinions is sensitive to model specification and definition of the GFC period. I also find evidence of increased audit fees but no evidence of longer audit report lags during the crisis period relative to the pre-crisis period. Overall, I provide evidence on to what ex tent auditors exercise their <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> regarding particular issues and how much resources they invest in conducting audit engagements during the GFC. My findings are of interest to regulators, auditors and financial information users because it assists auditors and regulators to assess the appropriateness of the strategies implemented and it also informs financial information users {{of the extent to which}} audit opinions are informative during the financial crisis. Also, the study informs the policy and law makers as to the impact of shareholder actions on auditor opinion issuance...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. The 1990 {{contract}} requires general {{practitioners to}} offer all their patients aged 75 years and over an annual health check. Increasing importance is {{being placed on}} consumers' views of service provision. AIM. A study was undertaken in June 1992 to investigate elderly patients' views and experiences of the annual health check, and to compare these with the previously reported views of general practitioners and practice nurses who had also been surveyed {{as part of the}} study. METHOD. Twenty family health services authorities wrote to a sample of 1500 elderly patients asking if the patient's name could be passed to researchers. Patients who agreed were then interviewed. RESULTS. A total of 664 elderly patients (44 %) were interviewed. Only 64 % of respondents were aware of their entitlement to a health check. Vulnerable patients, such as those in poor health or who lived alone, were less likely to know about the health checks than other patients. Only 31 % of respondents thought they had had a health check. Of these, fewer than half recalled the doctor or nurse discussing the findings with them, although 80 % of doctors reported that they always or mostly discussed results with patients. Elderly patients were more likely to recall the physical aspects of the health check rather than discussion about particular health aspects. However, doctors and nurses felt that routine checks were useful for giving advice rather than detecting medical problems. Of those who had had a health check, 82 % reported no improvement in their health as a result, but 93 % thought that they were a good idea. Only 7 % of doctors thought they were of value, compared with the majority of nurses. CONCLUSION. It appeared that the inverse care law was operating, with those more in need of the service being less likely to have known about it. Discrepancies were found between general practitioners' and practice nurses' reports of service provision and those of elderly patients. Evidence about the cost-effectiveness of regular health checks may help the conflict between <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> and consumer enthusiasm for these assessments...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} audit research {{relating to}} <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism,</b> ambiguity tolerance, judgement {{and decision making}} in the fraud domain, fraud detection rates by auditors remain low. This study provides a rationale for and a description of an experiential learning activity in an online environment, {{which is designed to}} enhance the fraud detection knowledge and skills of audit students. The methodology operates within the constructivist interpretive paradigm encompassing the e-learning environment, a mixed-method research design and methods of data collection suited to this inquiry. The case study involves final year auditing students. The research investigates the process by which audit teams undertake the task of fraud detection through a protocol analysis, and presents findings from individual survey instrument data. The knowledge and skill acquisition activity (KSAA) builds on existing knowledge and assists in knowledge construction to engage and facilitate critical thinking. This teaching tool provides experience in a real-world setting and requires operative knowledge and the application of audit processes and procedures to identify and resolve the frauds. The KSAA encourages participants to consider the possibility of fraud in all audits, and thus to become more cognisant of ‘red flags’ that may lead to uncovering fraud with more exploration and information. Important elements of the activity are the online environment, the fraud detection life cycle (McCormack 2011), fraud-specific audit knowledge, experiential learning using a problembased learning case and the involvement of an expert tutor. The fraud detection experience is provided in a ‘safe’ online learning environment. Participants are randomly allocated by software into three- or four-member audit teams, and an expert tutor (who remains anonymous) plays all information-providing roles (e. g., company officer and external third party roles such as bank officer) online. The physical roleplay environment is a computer with constant access to the confidential team discussion space. There is no face-to-face collaboration. All collaborations are written, as are external requests for information. The concurrent benefit of online communication is that it enables better quality verbalisation of thinking than face-to-face collaboration and prompts reflection, reasoning, analysis, evaluation and problem solving. The written communication in the discussion space allows the capture of 24 / 7 individual ‘thinking’ for later review. By analysing the scenarios, asking questions and thinking things through, participants are able to form an opinion and to make a judgement. Overall, the aim is to activate a process of building awareness of ‘red flags’ and developing skills for detecting them. So the students are required ‘to solve the fraud’, {{with a great deal of}} scaffolding built in. As a result, the students are far better equipped because they have more awareness and understanding as to where they might begin their search. The key conclusion is that the online team collaboration allows meaningful discussion that in turn enables students to make connections. The ability to make connections is the skill that needs to be enhanced, and this in turn is supported by collaboration and reflection fostered in the team. Participants perceive an enhancement in knowledge and problem-solving skills in the fraud domain after completing the activity...|$|E
40|$|Governance isn 2 ̆ 7 t easily {{reduced to}} slogans, but it’s {{fundamentally}} important, writes ANNE TIERNAN THE Governance stream at the 2020 Summit had inherent {{potential to be}} fraught. Serving ministers, a former premier, a former chief justice and governor-general, two former and one shadow attorneys-general, academics, current and former senior bureaucrats, lawyers, media players, editors, journalists and commentators, assorted activists, advocates and ideas brokers worked alongside small business representatives, students and young people. It was an eclectic and opinionated group, struggling to meet the substantive and process challenges of developing “big ideas” about how Australia’s system of governance might be improved. The deluge of commentary that followed the Summit has captured both the participant experience and the public response. My aim here is to offer some ideas on how we might understand the Summit in the broader context of Kevin Rudd’s leadership and style of political management. As a personal aside, I should mention {{that it is difficult}} for political scientists invited into the corridors of power to leave their <b>professional</b> <b>scepticism</b> at the door. We’re a curmudgeonly lot - always alert to the possibility we might be schmoozed or beguiled by a new leader, approach or discourse. Maintaining objectivity and professional distance can be hard, especially when an opportunity to avenge the childhood taunts of southern relatives about the backwardness of “banana-benders” presents. Seeing “Kevin from Queensland” firmly in charge of the national government confirmed for me that the “iron triangle” which for so long concentrated power in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra has been finally broken, by a Mandarin-speaking, public school educated child of the Sunshine Coast hinterland no less! I confess to a twinge of pride when Governance co-chair, Maxine McKew (also a Brisbane girl), told members of the “Red Team” that Rudd describes the Queenslanders who comprise and advise the new government as the “Pineapple Mafia. ” These admissions notwithstanding, my experience of the Summit affirmed my developing view that the prime minister is carving out a new narrative of Australian governance. It fuses learning and reflections drawn from state politics, notably the unexpected defeat of the reformist, policy-focused Goss government in which Rudd played an integral part. Along the way, he is dismantling the Howard legacy with seemingly effortless and self-deprecating charm. During his election night speech, Rudd promised Australians his government would move beyond the old and divisive battles of the past, towards a new and more inclusive style of governing. He acted decisively in the weeks following Labor’s victory to give effect to this commitment. In late December, the Council of Australian Governments was convened and tasked with becoming the “workhorse” of Commonwealth-state collaboration. In January, ministers and federal bureaucrats attended their first Community Cabinet, part of the prime minister’s commitment to “ensure close consultation with the Australian people on the things that concern them whether they are national or local matters. ” In February, Rudd announced the Australia 2020 Summit would be held in Canberra in April 2008. He would invite the nation’s “best and brightest” to “help shape a long-term strategy for the nation’s future. ” After much speculation, and flush with success from a seventeen-day overseas trip to meet world leaders, Rudd convened the 1002 delegates in the Great Hall at Parliament House. In his opening remarks, he told “summiteers” and the television audience: “Rather than pretending that we the politicians of Australia have all the answers, and the truth is, we don’t, we are turning now to you, the people of Australia. ” One was simultaneously exhilarated and intrigued by Rudd’s claim that he was “throwing open the windows of democracy to let a little bit of fresh air in. ” The spectacle of the prime minister sitting on the floor engaged in intense discussions with participants, or carrying his boxed breakfast out to a courtyard table, was vaguely unsettling, so stark was its contrast to the formal and buttoned-down approach of his predecessor. Yet it speaks to Rudd’s mastery of pragmatic-populist politics and his intense understanding of the electoral imperative of the “rolling dialogue” that he was prepared to gamble on the Summit process. He presents as a prime minister prepared to respect the “wisdom” and “common sense” of Australians; one who is open to ideas and suggestions, even from political opponents. Rudd has sensed a mood for change and seized the opportunity to weave a new and compelling narrative. He is exhorting Australians to take active roles in a new and different approach to governing, elements of which were outlined in his speech to the Progressive Governance conference in London on 4 April. There, Rudd argued that through debate and engagement on policy ideas his government would “forge a new politics of the centre that embraces both the empowerment of peoples through open economies and the opportunities created for people throught the agency of a compassionate state. ” Most interesting from the viewpoint of the professional observer, is the political tone being set by the new prime minister, strongly in evidence at the Summit. Cabinet ministers (or in our case, a parliamentary secretary) co-chaired the various streams. But other ministers, such as the special minister of state, John Faulkner, and the minister for home affairs, Bob Debus, attended all governance sessions. They participated in, and importantly, they heard, the debates over issues and proposals. They had and actively sought, opportunities to meet and talk extensively with participants {{over the course of the}} weekend. So did the senior officials sprinkled across the various streams. The prime minister’s message to both ministers and the bureaucracy is clear. His government is in the market for ideas and is comfortable with debate and contestability. It is seeking a balance between strategic, long-term considerations and responsiveness to immediate, practical concerns. In short - and as suggested by Rudd’s observation that a key theme of the Summit was the importance of building “a strong, independent, resilient, professionally challenging and rewarded Australian Public Service” - this is a government whose key players understand policy and public administration. Not unexpectedly, this is music to the ears of people like me who work across theory and practice, but that this theme failed to survive the selection process of the “big ideas” to be conveyed to the prime minister, suggests gaps remain in understandings of Rudd’s leadership and political management style. It seems that my big idea - the need to bridge the expectations gap at the heart of Australian governance, by reconciling what decision-makers (ministers supported by their personal staffs), and their advisers (public servants) expect of each other, and what is feasible given limits to the knowledge, information, skills, time and resources of both sides - persuaded no one. Until we create advisory systems that support decision-makers to make informed decisions in Australia’s long-term interests, and an operating environment that tolerates the time and argument needed to address complex issues, the cycle of distrust that has developed between governments and the media (much in evidence in the “open government” sub-stream, though with little sense that journalists appreciate some kind of reciprocal obligation might motivate changed behaviour), will continue. And that’s the dilemma of governance - it isn’t exciting and it isn’t easily reduced to pithy slogans, but it’s fundamental. And without such changes, none of the ideas from the Summit have a hope. • Anne Tiernan is with the Centre for Governance & Public Policy at Griffith Universit...|$|E
