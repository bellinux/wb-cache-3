40|$|I {{investigate}} {{whether and how}} expected future contract renegotiation considerations affect the type of covenants used in ex-ante debt contracts. I find that when future contract renegotiation costs {{are expected to be}} high, debt contracts are less likely to include covenants that restrict the borrower's financial flexibility in good states. This finding suggests that when renegotiation costs are high, borrowers and lenders avoid the use of covenants that are more likely to hold up the borrower and force it to bypass value-enhancing corporate policies (e. g., investments). Consistent with this interpretation, the negative relationship between renegotiation costs and the presence of flexibility-reducing covenants becomes stronger when the borrower has fewer outside options and financial flexibility becomes more valuable. Finally, I find that when future renegotiation costs are expected to be high, debt contracts have more covenants that are directly linked to the current <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower,</b> which allows for a more efficient allocation of decision rights between the borrower and lenders. Overall, this study provides initial evidence about how renegotiation considerations affect the design of covenant packages in debt contracts. by Daniel Andres Saavedra Lux. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of analyzing the factors that influence microfinance loan repayment investigating determinants of loan repayment performance of borrowers (beneficiaries) and identify the major factors that face OMFI, by using primary data collected through structured questionnaire. The survey includes a total of 339 respondents, using stratified sampling the population was divided into Urban and rural based on settlement areas. The primary data has been collected by interviewing 167 urban borrowers and 172 rural borrowers’ respondent using a structured questionnaire with the help of trained enumerators. The questionnaire includes both open- and closed- ended questions. In addition, secondary data were gathered from OMFI head office, OMFI branch office and other related relevant publications. A binary logit model was used to analyze the socio-economic factors that influence loan repayment. In related with the regression analysis Multi co- linearity t and various model fitness tests were made for the assumption of Loan repayment by SPSS 20. 0 statistical packages. Furthermore, a chi-square(X 2) analysis was employed to compare the defaulters and nondefaulters group. A total of twelve explanatory variables were included in the regression. The results of the descriptive statistics and the binary logistic model show that sex, age, education, source of income before loan, method of lending,loan size,suitability of installment period and timeliness of loan release were important in influencing loan repayment <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower.</b> However, family size, distance of borrowers from institution, residence of borrowers, and frequency of collection were found to be insignificant in model.

40|$|This Article {{develops}} a unique theory of performance-sensitive debt {{and argues that}} certain revenue-stage startups may be missing out on {{an important source of}} capital from asset-based loans. Debt contracts are performance sensitive to the extent any of the borrower’s obligations adjust in response to the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower.</b> The three main types of performance sensitivity I identify are (1) a loan’s interest rate adjusting based on the performance of the borrower; (2) the amount of available credit adjusting based on the value of collateral; and (3) renegotiation following breach of a loan covenant. Conceptualizing performance sensitivity as a separate governance mechanism allows me to flesh out, and in some cases challenge, several distinct bodies of research, including incomplete contracting theory and the literature on capital structure. The focus of this Article is on the nature of one type of performance-sensitive debt in particular — asset-based loans. Asset-based loans are important because they are the only type of loan that adjusts the amount of credit available to a borrower based on the performance of its assets. Due to the protections asset-based loans provide to lenders, they are often the only type of loan lenders are willing to make to high-risk borrowers. Asset-based loans are often cheaper than other sources of capital, more borrower-friendly than other types of debt, and can be structured {{to meet the needs of}} a wide variety of borrowers. Because of these characteristics, I argue that certain revenue-stage startups, including those with intellectual property assets, may be better off raising capital with asset-based loans than other types of financing...|$|E

The study will look into the current credit evaluation process of FIs and looks into how to improve the credit evaluation process of FIs for evaluating ME companies. A survey was conducted and I have managed to receive around 31 percent response rate from different types of financial institution from the 98 surveys sent out. Results of the survey shows that only one third of the FIs where respondents work for finances credit proposition for ME companies with some of the results from the survey tied-in with some of the earlier studies conducted on credit evaluation of ME companies.

40|$|Executive summary Techniques for {{transferring}} credit risk, such {{as financial}} guarantees and credit insurance, {{have been a}} long-standing feature of financial markets. In the past few years, however, the range of credit risk transfer (CRT) instruments and {{the circumstances in which}} they are used have widened considerably. A number of factors have contributed to this growth, including: greater focus by banks and other financial institutions on risk management; a more rigorous approach to risk/return judgments by lenders and investors and an increasing tendency on the part of banks to look at their credit risk exposures on a portfolio-wide basis; efforts by market intermediaries to generate fee income; a generally low interest rate environment, which has encouraged firms to search for yield pickup through broadening the range of instruments they are prepared to hold; and arbitrage opportunities arising from different regulatory capital requirements applied to different kinds of financial firm. The significance of CRT seems to vary appreciably across firms and market segments. Thus, for example, the intermediation of credit default swaps seems to be a major business line for a small, but only a small, number of firms; and CRT markets are particularly active for major company credits, much less so for SMEs. Given these differences, it may be misleading to talk about the overall impact of CRT. However, while CRT flows have been substantial, and despite recent growth, CRT activity seems still to be relatively small compared with the outstanding stocks, and even the current flows, of credit-riskrelated instruments. After setting out some of the broader background (Section II), this Report reviews the recent development of CRT markets, describing the characteristics of the instruments used, the nature of the market participants and the reasons for their involvement (Section III). It then discusses some of the principal features of the markets themselves, focusing on the questions of transparency and data availability, on how CRT instruments of different kinds are priced and on how far the existence of CRT markets has affected the process of price discovery (Section IV). The remainder of the Report (Sections V, VI and VII) identifies and analyses some possible implications of the evolution of CRT markets for the overall functioning of the financial system and discusses some of the concerns which have been expressed about the impact of CRT on financial stability. CRT instruments typically change the relationship between borrowers and lenders and establish new relationships between lenders and those to whom they may pass on credit risk (Section V). This implies in particular changes in the incentives which the different parties to a credit transaction face. The Report analyses these changes in terms of potential market failures, for example asymmetric information, principal/agent problems and incomplete contracts. It concludes that most of these problems have been recognised by market participants and market authorities and have been addressed in one way or another. In some cases, however, it has proved difficult or impossible to arrive at an entirely satisfactory solution. One common approach is to ensure that the risk shedder retains some interest in the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> and therefore some incentive to monitor the borrower’s performance carefully. Such retention can, however, diminish the attraction of CRT transactions in so far as regulators may not recognise the risk transfer for capital requirement purposes unless it is complete. A further problem has proved to be the formulation of contracts in a way which is unambiguous in all plausible circumstances. In a number of cases a situation has arisen which was not anticipated at the time a contract was drawn up and in which the interests of the parties to the contract have diverged. At one level this is a legal/documentation issue, and some worthwhile progress has been made, in this and in other areas, by developing the standard ISDA contract. Further improvements could no doubt be introduced. Some especially difficult issues arise, however, in relation to the definition of "restructurings" and their inclusion as credit events. At present {{it is not clear how}} far these are capable of being resolved by legal drafting and how far they reflect deeper problems of contract design. In any case, there remains a concern that those who believe they have shed risk could sometimes find that they have not, and that those who believe they are not at risk may find that they are. The Report considers (in Section VI) some structural implications of the wider use of CRT. In particular, it notes that rating agencies play a central role in some CRT markets. To an extent this is no different from the role which they already play in the rating of corporate debt (and indeed the market in single name credit derivatives is, broadly speaking, confined to names which are already rated). But the rating agencies arguably have an even more important role in relation to portfolio instruments, and their models have set market standards for credit risk assessment of such instruments. While the analytical basis for these assessments has been advancing, there are still some significant unresolved questions, notably about the way diversification effects should be handled. This in turn implies some uncertainty about the pricing of the instruments themselves. CRT also has a potentially major impact on the way that banks go about their business. Increasingly, they are acting as credit originators rather than long-term funders, shifting loans off their balance sheet either individually or as part of a package through loan transfers and securitisation. In some cases, however, they continue to act in an agency capacity in terms of monitoring and servicing the loans. While these trends now seem firmly established, they have so far had only a relatively small impact on the profile of business for the banking sector as a whole, with a possible exception in the area of credit card receivables and mortgages in some countries. Innovation in financial markets, and within that the development of new financial instruments such as credit derivatives, is generally to be welcomed as increasing market efficiency, enabling better diversification of portfolios and providing a wider range of techniques for risk management. However, there are a number of aspects of CRT which raise policy issues and which, at least in some cases, might point to the need for a policy response (Section VII). Some of the main ones are as follows: Transparency - financial firms’ disclosure of their CRT activities is patchy at best. In a fastdeveloping market with a potentially significant effect on the distribution of risks this lack of disclosure is a concern. The Report suggests that the issue might best be addressed by lending support to existing initiatives on disclosure (eg Fisher II) and by flagging the specific concerns in relation to CRT. Aggregate data - the relative dearth of information at the level of the individual firm is paralleled by an incomplete picture of how CRT markets are developing in aggregate. Central banks and others are currently exploring how to improve their database related to CRT instruments without imposing an undue reporting burden on market practitioners. Rating agencies - the Report notes the critical role of rating agencies in various CRT markets and the implicit reliance on the risk assessment techniques which they use. Although the Report does not formulate any view on the desirability or otherwise of this state of affairs, the CRT dimension should be taken into account in the various reviews of the rating agencies’ activities which are at present in progress. Diversification and concentration - one of the principal potential benefits of CRT is that it facilitates the wider dispersion of risk and allows risk profiles to be adjusted more flexibly. At the same time, some elements of the CRT market appear to be highly concentrated, which might give rise to market disruption if the firms concerned were to come under pressure. Contract design - as previously noted, the formulation of restructuring clauses in credit derivatives contracts has proved to be particularly problematic. It remains to be seen whether the difficulties can be resolved; if not, it could act as a significant brake on the further development of this part of the CRT market. Risk management - although in many respects CRT involves familiar risk management issues, it does sharpen questions about counterparty risk in relation to unfunded risk transfers, given the speed and scale of possible changes in exposures, and also raises technical questions about the reliability of pricing of portfolio instruments. In addition, there are a number of issues related to documentation on which further work is needed. More fundamentally, there has been concern that CRT could lead to a weakening in overall credit risk monitoring if those who end up holding the credit risk have less information about the borrower than the original lender. Market practice has, however, evolved in a number of ways to mitigate this risk. Accounting - divergences in accounting rules have had a restraining effect on certain parts of the CRT market. As credit risk (at least vis-à-vis larger borrowers) becomes more readily tradable, it may also increase the tension between book value and mark to market valuation. Although the Report did not explore this (contentious) issue it is clear that it is attracting increasing attention from practitioners. Regulation - CRT has the potential to highlight more clearly differences in the regulatory treatment of credit risk as between different kinds of institution and is, therefore, likely to work towards a more integrated approach to regulatory capital standards. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors and the UK Financial Services Authority have recently reviewed the regulatory implications of CRT. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{reviewing}} World Bank evaluations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> population projects, <b>the</b> author {{explains the}} nature and uses of four families <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. Two measure inputs: Project implementation indicators, which are project-specific, are the principal measures used in Bank supervision. They measure success in creating sources capable of conducting certain desired activities. Process (or activity) indicators measure <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> a project's intended activities but tell nothing about the yield or output of those activities. Two measure output: Performance (or intermediate-output) indicators measure the yield or output-performance of a project or program. For family planning, the principal indicator in this category is acceptor figures, normally with details about methods used plus the age, parity, and geographical distribution of acceptors. Quality {{may or may not}} be good and coverage {{may or may not be}} comprehensive. These indicators do not directly measure ultimate demographic impacts - lower fertility and slower population growth. Demographic outcome (or impact) indicators do measure demographic impacts, usually the contraceptive prevalence rate and age-specific and total fertility rates. One can use a desired value of any comparator as a target, but a target is only one possible comparator. Two more widely used comparators for family planning are trends (comparing current with past performance) and international performance (an external comparison). The author recommends strengthening <b>the</b> Bank's use <b>of</b> world (successful developing country) standards and of trend analysis rather than increasing its use <b>of</b> target setting. <b>The</b> Bank's primary interest is normally <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower's</b> national program, so more attention should be given to program-level rather than to project-level performance - except for pilot projects. The author recommends: that the Bank standardize its terminology about these four families <b>of</b> indicators; that <b>the</b> Population and Human Resources Department periodically prepare comparator tables and graphs for use in Bank project and sector reports; that the Bank discontinue Project Performance Audit Reports on population projects, as they seldom add much to information and judgments contained in Project Completion Reports - the money saved could be applied to more effective evaluation research; that operational staff show more concern for a program's contraceptive mix; that more attention be paid to a program's service quality; and that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> demographic and health surveys be the rule, not the exception, in Bank population and health projects.

40|$|<b>The</b> overall {{objective}} <b>of</b> {{this study is}} to investigate the relationship between <b>the</b> communication <b>of</b> Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts and the corporate reputation (CR) in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> credit lending process of Italian banks. Prior researches indicate <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a two-way relationship between <b>the</b> communication <b>of</b> CSR actions and the corporate reputation. Basing on <b>the</b> theoretical principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signaling theory, several studies indicate that organizations might use <b>the</b> communication <b>of</b> their CSR practices to convey positive messages to their stakeholders helping them to build a favorable impression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm. Recently, some empirical studies (Stanaland et al., 2011; Maden et al., 2012) find that the stakeholder groups (including customers, employees and investors) tend to assign good reputations to those firms which they evaluate positively in terms <b>of</b> their social <b>performance.</b> On the other side, when companies possess an enhancing reputation this help to improve the credibility and <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CSR communication (Forman and Argenti, 2005, Scandizzo, 2011, Shamma, 2012; Yoon et al., 2006). <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> this relationship with respect to the banks remains quite unexplored. A little number of studies (Helm, 2007; Maden et al., 2012) has investigated the importance that investors (including banks) assigned to the CR when they assess the borrowers’ creditworthiness, indicating that the communication regarding the CSR practices (both positive and negative) have a significant influence on the investor loyalty and satisfaction. A few studies have examined <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CSR on <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> bank loans and into the credit risk management (Goss and Roberts, 2011; Weber et al., 2010) and reveal that CSR activities can be used to predict <b>the</b> financial <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrowers</b> and to improve <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rating system. Furthermore we are not aware of similar studies realized in the Italian context. To contribute to the extant literature on the relationship between CSR communication and corporate reputation we have carried out an explorative research investigating this relationship based upon three Italian banks case studies. For each case study we realized semi-structured interviews with credit managers to examine whether (or not) banks take into consideration CSR communication within the corporate loan originator process, the importance assigned to the CSR in the phases featuring <b>the</b> processes <b>of</b> loan origination and monitoring and, how the corporate reputation impact on <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CSR disclosure made by the banks Researchers decided to investigate Italian banking for two main motivations: “comparability” and “voluntary disclosure environment”. As pointed out in other studies (Gamerschlag et al., 2010), CSR and their communication differ between countries. To analyzing homogeneous and comparable case studies we decided to concentrate on companies with a same political and institutional background.

There is an {{increased interest in}} knowing whether <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> nonfinancial, technical services along with microcredit has {{a positive impact on}} <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowers.</b> <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> these services may help poor households improve their economic performance. Yet, evidence proving this proposition is scarce and results are mixed. This lack of formal evaluation is often a consequence of these services being part of integrated approaches, making <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> their impact difficult to disentangle from <b>the</b> sole impact <b>of</b> microcredit. This dissertation provides evidence of joint productivity impact from microcredit and technical assistance received during 1997 - 1999 by rural household clients of a major microcredit institution in El Salvador. We find that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> credit has positive effects on farm productivity. It is estimated that for every 1, 000 colones of additional credit received there is a 9 percent increase in <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> farm output. These results are at <b>the</b> high end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> productivity impact reported in previous studies. When technical assistance is introduced along with credit there is also a positive impact in household productivity. In addition, we find that <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> consumption of these two services matters. Households with repeated loans experience smaller changes in productivity than households that borrow for the first time. It is unclear why these patterns of consumption impact productivity in different ways. However, we find that credit and technical assistance contribute to productivity through different paths: increased technical efficiency, technology adoption, and economies <b>of</b> scale. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> credit and technical assistance in contributing to these productivity elements is assessed through <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> households' production possibility frontier. Technical efficiency improved during these years, mainly from <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> technical assistance. In addition, we conclude that adoption of new technologies was promoted by both credit and technical assistance. There is also evidence that these households experience increasing returns to scale.

Design/methodology/approach - A model showing the relationships among the variables is first proposed based on the hypotheses developed in the literature review. Then the model is tested with empirical data using multiple regression and path analysis. Data used in the analysis relate to 234 microfinancing institutions across 63 countries. Findings - The study finds that operational efficiency and gender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrowers</b> have a direct impact on <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> microfinancing institutions. Although population density does not have a direct impact on performance it has an indirect effect through operational efficiency and gender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrowers.</b> Practical implications - <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this study reveal to the policy makers and managers <b>of</b> microfinancing institutions <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> focussing on <b>the</b> three factors analysed (operational efficiency, gender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrowers</b> and population density) to reduce poverty.

In a regression setting, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> borrowers' characteristics on both the risk-free probability and default risk can be assessed simultaneously. Using the C statistic as a measure <b>of</b> accuracy, <b>the</b> survival mixture model shows improved power to discriminate between good' and bad' customers, when compared with other commonly used statistical models for credit risk analysis. A simulation study is conducted to assess <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed numerical estimation method. The survival mixture model not only concentrates on <b>the</b> time-to-default <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrowers,</b> it also predicts <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> being risk-free. It provides additional information about the borrowers' default risk {{in relation to their}} characteristics, which assists the lending institutions to better manage credit risk. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} a macro-finance {{model with}} {{two types of}} borrowers: entrepreneurs who engage in productive activities and gamblers who play in lotteries. It links a central bank's interest rate policy to expected cash ows of both types of borrowers. Via this link we study how the interactions between various shocks and different monetary policy rules affect <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> pool faced by financial intermediaries. We find that if the economy is hit by an expansionary monetary policy shock, {{in the long run}} <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> entrepreneurs in <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> pool will be persistently lower than the steady state level. This worsening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> pool is more serious if the central bank does not react to output uctuations. By contrast, not reacting to output uctuations in case of a negative productivity shock avoids a persistent worsening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> pool in <b>the</b> long run. ...|$|R
