5|$|Lithuania {{is divided}} into three layers of {{administrative}} divisions. The first-level division consists of 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis, <b>plural</b> – apskritys). These are sub-divided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: <b>plural</b> – savivaldybės, singular – savivaldybė), which in turn are further sub-divided into over 500 smaller groups, known as elderships (Lithuanian: <b>plural</b> – seniūnijos, singular – seniūnija).|$|E
5|$|Most count nouns are inflected for <b>plural</b> number {{through the}} use of the <b>plural</b> suffix -s, but a few nouns have {{irregular}} <b>plural</b> forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised {{through the use}} of a count noun classifier, e.g. one loaf of bread, two loaves of bread.|$|E
5|$|Also {{referred}} to as the Melodifestival, and incorrectly as the Melodifestivalen. The <b>plural</b> is Melodifestivaler.|$|E
50|$|Akkadian, unlike Arabic, has mainly regular <b>plurals</b> (i.e. no broken <b>plurals),</b> {{although}} some masculine words take feminine <b>plurals.</b> In that respect, it {{is similar to}} Hebrew.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Plurals</b> {{generally}} are formed by replacing initial a- with i-, and either suffixing -en ("regular/external" [...] <b>plurals),</b> changing vowels within the word ("broken/internal" [...] <b>plurals),</b> or both. Examples: ...|$|R
5000|$|The Gallo‒Italic {{languages}} have vowel-changing <b>plurals</b> {{rather than}} /s/ <b>plurals.</b>|$|R
5|$|Elderships (or wards) (Lithuanian: <b>plural</b> – seniūnijos, {{singular}} – seniūnija).|$|E
5|$|For <b>plural</b> 2 the suffix is -li (-lí in Parmaquesta).|$|E
5|$|In English, when unit {{names are}} {{combined}} to denote multiplication {{of the units}} concerned, they are separated with a hyphen or a space (e.g. newton-metre or newton metre). The <b>plural</b> is formed by converting the last unit name to the <b>plural</b> form (e.g. ten newton-metres).|$|E

5|$|Symbols {{of units}} {{do not have}} a <b>plural</b> form; e.g., 25kg, not 25.|$|E
5|$|The main medieval Germanic {{cognates}} (words of {{a common}} origin) of elf are Old Norse alfr, <b>plural</b> alfar, and Old High German alp, <b>plural</b> alpî, elpî (alongside the feminine elbe). These words must come from Common Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, German, and the Scandinavian languages: the Common Germanic forms must have been *ɑlβi-z and ɑlβɑ-z.|$|E
5000|$|...Class 10 {{contains}} the <b>plurals</b> of class 9 nouns {{as well as}} the <b>plurals</b> of some class 5 nouns (from Proto-Bantu class 11).|$|R
50|$|Some {{classical}} compounds form classical <b>plurals,</b> and {{are therefore}} irregular in English. Others do not, while some vacillate between classical and regular <b>plurals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... some <b>plurals</b> do {{differ from}} the {{singular}} in pronunciation; for example, masculine singulars in -al [...] sometimes form masculine <b>plurals</b> in -aux [...]|$|R
5|$|The {{territory}} of Lithuania {{is divided into}} 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular apskritis, <b>plural</b> apskritys), all named after their capitals. The counties are divided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular savivaldybė, <b>plural</b> savivaldybės): 9 city municipalities, 43 district municipalities and 8 municipalities. Each municipality is then divided into elderates (Lithuanian: singular seniūnija, <b>plural</b> seniūnijos). This division was created in 1994 and slightly modified in 2000. On 1 July 2010, the county administrations were abolished, and since that date, counties remains as the territorial and statistical units.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and <b>plural</b> forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The definite form of an adjective {{is identical to the}} indefinite <b>plural</b> form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the green chair"), det gröna huset ("the green house"), and de gröna stolarna ("the green chairs").|$|E
5|$|For <b>plural</b> 1 the suffix is -i or -r (depending of {{the type}} of the noun). In Parmaquesta, the -í is (not always) long (the precise rules have not yet been published).|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th century that a common, {{standardized}} national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, {{with the exception of}} some minor deviations, {{by the time of the}} spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of <b>plural</b> forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The <b>plural</b> verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study the {{influence}} of information structure in the referential status of linguistic expressions such as bare <b>plurals</b> and indefinite NPs in Spanish. In particular, we will argue for the following claims: (a) Spanish bare <b>plurals</b> can receive a generic interpretation in object position and (b) Spanish bare <b>plurals</b> in object position can be topics in siru. We will focus on object position because of the well known semantic and syntactic constraints that affect preverbal subject bare <b>plurals</b> in Spanish...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Plurals</b> {{may either}} involve a regular change ("sound plurals"), {{internal}} vowel change ("broken plurals"), {{or a combination}} of the two. Some <b>plurals</b> are mixed, e.g. [...] ('hand') [...] ('hands').|$|R
5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine). The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person <b>plural</b> and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person <b>plural</b> pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E
5|$|The <b>plural</b> form of {{the common}} name {{narcissus}} has caused some confusion. British English sources such as the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary give two alternate forms, narcissi and narcissuses. In contrast, in American English the Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides for a third form, narcissus, used for both singular and <b>plural.</b> The Oxford dictionaries only list this third form under American English, although the Cambridge Dictionary allows of all three in the same order. However, Garner's Modern American Usage states that narcissi is the commonest form, narcissus being excessively sibilant. For similar reasons, Fowler prefers narcissi in British English usage. Neither support narcissus as a <b>plural</b> form. Common names such as narcissus do not capitalise the first letter {{in contrast to the}} person of that name and the Latin genus name.|$|E
5|$|There are {{personal}} pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and <b>plural.</b> These pronouns are optional {{as subjects}} or objects, {{but only when}} the verbal inflection refers to such arguments.|$|E

50|$|Interest revived in <b>plurals</b> {{with work}} in {{linguistics}} in the 1970s by Remko Scha, Godehard Link, Fred Landman, Roger Schwarzschild, Peter Lasersohn and others, who developed ideas for a semantics of <b>plurals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Swedish {{has five}} {{different}} ways to form regular <b>plurals</b> of nouns, also determined on a word-by-word basis, in addition to irregular <b>plurals.</b> These are -ar, -or, -er, -en and identical to singular.|$|R
