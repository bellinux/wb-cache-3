40|$|A {{combination}} cocoa dryer and <b>storage</b> <b>bin,</b> made as much {{as possible}} from local materials, has been designed at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Nairobi, Kenya. The dryer uses charcoal and the sun. It is durable and simple, and can treat cocoa until it is dry enough for storage. Drying takes three days, at which point the receptacle becomes a <b>storage</b> <b>bin,</b> saving time and trouble for the farmer. Cocoa post-harvest losses occur primarily as a result of insect and rodent attack, micro-organism activities and moulding. The new dryer reduces losses by establishing an atmosphere which inhibits such adverse activities during storage. Experiments have shown that the cocoa thus dried can satisfactorily be stored in the drier for five months. It measures ten by five metres and is four metres high.
