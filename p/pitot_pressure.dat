25|$|The {{measurement}} and indication of airspeed is ordinarily accomplished on board an aircraft by an airspeed indicator ("ASI") {{connected to a}} pitot-static system. The pitot-static system comprises one or more pitot probes (or tubes) facing the on-coming air flow to measure <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> (also called stagnation, total or ram pressure) and one or more static ports to measure the static pressure in the air flow. These two pressures are compared by the ASI to give an IAS reading.|$|E
500|$|The pitot-static {{system of}} {{instruments}} uses {{the principle of}} air pressure gradient. It works by measuring pressures or pressure differences and using these values to assess the speed and altitude. These pressures can be measured either from the static port (static pressure) or the pitot tube (<b>pitot</b> <b>pressure).</b> [...] The static pressure is used in all measurements, while the <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> is used only to determine airspeed.|$|E
500|$|The <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{obtained}} from the pitot tube. [...] The <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is a measure of}} ram air pressure (the air pressure created by vehicle motion or the air ramming into the tube), which, under ideal conditions, is equal to stagnation pressure, also called total pressure. [...] The pitot tube is most often located on the wing or front section of an aircraft, facing forward, where its opening is exposed to the relative wind. [...] By situating the pitot tube in such a location, the ram air pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less distorted by the aircraft's structure. [...] When airspeed increases, the ram air pressure is increased, which can be translated by the airspeed indicator.|$|E

500|$|The {{airspeed}} indicator {{is connected to}} both the pitot and static pressure sources. [...] The difference between the <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> and the static pressure is called dynamic pressure. The greater the dynamic pressure, the higher the airspeed reported.

50|$|<b>Pitot</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> is {{the pressure}} that is measured by a Pitot tube, an open-ended tube connected to a pressure-measuring device. For subsonic flow, <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is equal to the}} stagnation pressure (or total pressure) of the flow, and hence the term <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> is often used interchangeably with these other terms. For supersonic flow, however, <b>pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> is the stagnation pressure of the flow behind the normal shock ahead of the pitot tube. <b>Pitot</b> <b>pressure</b> is named for Henri Pitot, French scientist.|$|E

Results show that supersonic jet mixing noise behaves in flight {{in the same}} way that subsonic jet mixing noise does. Regarding shock-associated noise, the frequencies of both screech and peak broadband shock noise were found to decrease with flight speed. The external flow determines the dominant screech mode over a wide range of nozzle pressure rations. Change in the screech mode strongly affects both the development of the downstream shock structure and the characteristic frequency of the broadband shock-associated noise. When no mode change occurs, the main effect of the external flow is to stretch the axial development of the shock cells...|$|R
