5000|$|Under normal usage, swarf {{is carried}} {{up and away}} from the tip of the drill bit by the fluting of the drill bit. The cutting edges produce more chips which {{continue}} the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or insufficient backing off (removing the drill slightly or totally from the hole while drilling). Cutting fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to prolong the tool's life by cooling and lubricating the tip and chip flow. Coolant may be introduced via holes through the drill shank, which is common when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from grabbing the drill bit in the process of drilling the hole. When cutting brass, and other soft metals that can grab the drill bit and causes [...] "chatter", a face of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the cutting edge to create an obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents [...] "chatter" [...] during which the drill tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit cutting edge, the drill is pushing the metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This creates high friction and very hot swarf.For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in the drill bit, with a lubricant pumped to the drill head through a small hole in the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill <b>press</b> <b>arrangement</b> can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in automatic drilling machinery in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather than the drill bit.|$|R

The coverage provided by the local stations eventually led to further investments and technological developments to provide real-time news; newsgathering vehicles equipped with satellites began to be used on the local and national levels beginning in the 1970s.

30|$|MMNR is Kenya's highest-earning {{wildlife}} tourist destination, taking 15 to 20 million USD annually (Norton-Griffiths 2007). Numerous additional wildlife enterprises {{have grown}} up around Mara, with landownersiv on the now-adjudicated, subdivided and privately owned former group ranch lands able to capture wildlife returns. There has been a rapid evolution of revenue-sharing institutions around Mara since the 1970 s, from the initial 19 % county council MMNR gate takings paid to group ranch wildlife associations; through post-group ranch, politically constituted wildlife associations; and most recently, conservancy partnerships between tourism investors and landowners (Thompson et al. 2009; Bedelian in press). The most recent conservancy agreements offer better security of income to landowners, through rent rather than bed-night payments. They require 5 - to 15 -year covenanting of the designated area, during which current resident households must move out. In covenanted areas, land sales, homestead construction, cultivation and fencing are excluded, as is grazing of livestock under most circumstances (Bedelian in <b>press).</b> Conservancy <b>arrangements</b> may offer a better deal for landowners (Thompson et al. 2009) and better conservation outcomes (Western et al. 2006).

50|$|Multi-anvil <b>presses</b> involve an <b>arrangement</b> of anvils to {{concentrate}} pressure from a press onto a sample. Typically the apparatus uses an arrangement eight cube-shaped tungsten carbide anvils to compress a ceramic octahedron containing the sample and a ceramic or Re metal furnace. The anvils are typically {{placed in a}} large hydraulic press. The method was developed by Kawai and Endo in Japan. Unlike shock compression, the pressure exerted is steady, and the sample can be heated using a furnace. Pressures of about 28 GPa (equivalent to depths of 840 km), and temperatures above 2300 °C, can be attained using WC anvils and a lanthanum chromite furnace. The apparatus is very bulky and cannot achieve pressures {{like those in the}} diamond anvil cell (below), but it can handle much larger samples that can be quenched and examined after the experiment. Recently, sintered diamond anvils have been developed for this type of press that can reach pressures of 90 GPa (2700 km depth).|$|R

In the autumn of 1892 the French ambassador addressed a friendly inquiry to the new government as to the reception likely to be given to overtures for re-opening the negotiations. The answer was that if France had suggestions to offer, they would be received in the same friendly spirit in which they were tendered. When any communications were received, Mr. Gladstone said in the House of Commons, there would be no indisposition on our part to extend to them our friendly consideration. Of all this nothing came.

5000|$|During World War II, {{declines in}} male {{enrollment}} at Harvard and heightened sensitivity {{about the use}} of resources called for a new, more efficient arrangement concerning faculty time. Under the leadership of President Comstock, Radcliffe and Harvard signed an agreement {{that for the first time}} allowed Radcliffe and Harvard students to attend the same classes in the Harvard Yard, officially beginning joint instruction in 1943. Equally significant, the agreement ended the era in which individual faculty members at Harvard could choose whether to enter contracts with Radcliffe. The agreement instead opened the entire Harvard catalogue to Radcliffe students, in exchange for which Radcliffe made a payment to Harvard of a fixed portion of Radcliffe tuitions. President Comstock noted that the agreement was [...] "the most significant event since our charter was granted in 1894." [...] All Harvard faculty, whether interested or not, had a legal obligation to teach Radcliffe students. (In practice a few holdouts on the Harvard faculty maneuvered around this obligation by announcing that their classes had [...] "limited enrollment" [...] and then limiting enrollment solely to male students.) At the time both Harvard and Radcliffe were adamant in telling the <b>press</b> that this <b>arrangement</b> was [...] "joint instruction" [...] but not [...] "coeducation." [...] Reacting to the agreement, Harvard President James Bryant Conant famously stated that [...] "Harvard was not coeducational in theory, only in practice."
