He was a tough conventional speaker, rich in established phrases and never abashed by hearing himself say commonplace things, and in addition to his campaign against automobiles he found time to engage also in quasi-political activities, taking chairs, saying a few words and so on, cherishing a fluctuating hope that his eloquence might ultimately win him an invitation to contest a constituency in the interests of reaction and the sounder elements in the Liberal party.|$|E

There were clockwise and anti-clockwise routes running from Shahpur to Shahpur. Moreover, there were other routes for Shahibaug, Dudheshwar, Vadaj, Sabarmati and Calico Mills outside the city area. There were buses for Asarva, Khokhara-Mehmdabad, Gomtipur, Amraiwadi and Maninagar in the eastern area, while Paldi, Vasna, Ambawadi and Commerce College routes were covered on the western bank of the Sabarmati River.

In fact British Motor Corporation later produced a kit to improve the performance and fuel consumption of these cars once premium fuel supplies resumed under the popular petrol brands. This kit comprised a replacement distributor and an optional cylinder head gasket that was thinner and therefore raised the compression slightly from the standard 7.2:1.|$|R

40|$|In Colombia the <b>petrol</b> <b>supply</b> sector lags {{well behind}} other sectors such as {{electricity}} supply, ports, and motorways, in undertaking an open policy. However, freeing the <b>petrol</b> <b>supply</b> market is considered {{necessary in order}} to release the state from the economic burden that it would otherwise have. This situation is particularly true in the oil industry, {{which is one of the}} most capital-intensive businesses. This thesis assesses the <b>petrol</b> <b>supply</b> chain in Colombia identifying the key driving factors, the companies involved and the challenges they are facing in the light of world and regional trends.  In this way, a comparative assessment of the Colombian Oil Company (Ecopetrol) is undertaken looking at how other state-owned companies such as the Venezuelan, Brazilian, Mexican and the Argentinian are tackling similar problems. In addition, the thesis will assess what is the best trade off between importing and/or refining for supplying petrol to Colombia regarding three different schemes under three different scenarios of demand. The analysis considers environmental, institutional, technical and economic issues; the latter is assessed using a Linear Programming (LP) model. The paper concludes that the Colombian government should elaborate a white paper to restructure Ecopetrol. Administratively, the chairman should be appointed for a fixed period of time with the provide it with autonomy for selecting its most convenient business strategy.  Ecopetrol should be opened up to both international competition and foreign partnership in order to compete in the global market. This would involve improving its competitiveness, pursuing international standards of efficiency and using benchmarking targets for its planning and development. In addition, the government and Ecopetrol should separate their accountancy; thus, subsidies for middle distillates consumed by low income groups should be funded through the national budget and not charged to Ecopetrol. Similarly, the government must commit to a policy of not withdrawing economic resources from Ecopetrol to finance independent projects. After undertaking this first series of measures, the next step should be setting a legal and stable framework for the capitalization and opening of Ecopetrol. In this way Ecopetrol should be listed in the stock exchange market both in the country and abroad initially offering a minority stake of its shares in the search for fresh capital, should reduce its political dependency and form strategic alliances to scale up its businesses and improve its efficiency.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{knowledge}} about the Egyptian Scuds able to hit deep inside Israel, Israel avoided attacking strategic targets deep inside Egypt throughout the entire war. This fear was raised by military intelligence chief Eli Zeira at a situation assessment with the Chief of Staff on October 9. This avoidance is more noticeable when compared to the significant Israeli strikes which were conducted during the 1967-70 War of Attrition. These strikes caused significant damage to the Egyptian military and forced it to defend the Egyptian front, therefore weakening its offensive capabilities. On the Syrian front, however, Israel struck deep inside Syria, damaging the Syrian war effort and even disrupting normal life in the country, attacking important power plants, <b>petrol</b> <b>supplies,</b> bridges and main roads.|$|R

As modern complex {{computer}} systems become increasingly sophisticated and data-intensive, people have long {{recognized the importance}} of precisely and unambiguously specifying them with formal methods. This paper advocates the use of Object-Z, a formal specification language, in the description of complex systems. Object-Z is an extension to the Z language to facilitate specification in an object-oriented style. First, we informally describe the syntax and semantics of Object-Z, highlighting those features that facilitate decomposing a large system into a collection of underlying objects and thus separating concerns. Then, we demonstrate the use of Object-Z by presenting a case study of a <b>petrol</b> <b>supply</b> system, illustrating how the system runs by communicating the constituent objects. Finally, we discuss several issues we encountered in this exercise, which may serve as feedback to the development of Object-Z...|$|E
40|$|Petrol {{stations}} in Saudi Arabia {{are considered the}} lifeline of transportation in the Kingdom because {{the only means of}} transportation is either through the use of cars or buses. The major petroleum products to refuel vehicles in Saudi Arabia are petrol and diesel, pinpointing the importance of petrol {{stations in}} Saudi Arabia. However, Saudi Arabian petrol stations experience petrol delays and poor service quality. In addition, Saudi Arabian petrol stations utilise traditional petrol operational processes that include manually measuring petrol levels in tanks, testing for leaks and book-based accounting processes to minimise cost And Increase profit. Moreover, considering that approximately 90 % of Saudi Arabian petrol stations are operated and managed by individuals, either locals or expatriates, this intensity to compete causes serious problems such as mixing petrol products to reduce petrol prices and thus, attract customers; defrauding petrol pump meters; wasting petroleum resources; and, petrol smuggling to nearby countries, leading to a shortage in petrol products in the domestic market. On the basis of the literature reviewed, this is considered as a source of uncertainty and quality problems that will consequently impact budgets and schedules. Hence, this study diagnoses and explores the key factors that influence the Saudi Arabian <b>petrol</b> <b>supply</b> chain to answer the research question, &lsquo;how do the technological, organisational and environmental aspects of the Saudi Arabian petroleum industry impact on petroleum supply chain integration?&rsquo...|$|E
