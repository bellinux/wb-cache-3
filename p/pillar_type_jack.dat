40|$|In this paper, we {{fabricated}} 3 D <b>pillar</b> <b>type</b> silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) {{devices for}} high density flashapplications. To solve the limitation between erase speed and data retention {{of the conventional}} SONOS devices,bandgap-engineered (BE) tunneling oxide of oxide-nitride-oxide configuration is integrated with the 3 D structure. In addition, the tunneling oxide is modulated by another method of N 2 ion implantation (N 2 I/I). The measureddata shows that the BE-SONOS device has better electrical characteristics, such as a lower threshold voltage (VT) of 0. 13 V, and a higher gm. max of 18. 6 μA/V and mobility of 27. 02 cm 2 /Vs than the conventional and N 2 I/I SONOSdevices. Memory characteristics show that the modulated tunneling oxide devices have fast erase speed. Among thedevices, the BE-SONOS device has faster program/erase (P/E) speed, and more stable endurance characteristics,than conventional and N 2 I/I devices. From the flicker noise analysis, however, the BE-SONOS device seems to havemore interface traps between the tunneling oxide and silicon substrate, which {{should be considered in}} designingthe process conditions. Finally, 3 D structures, such as the <b>pillar</b> <b>type</b> BE-SONOS device, are more suitable for nextgeneration memory devices than other modulated tunneling oxide devices...|$|R

30|$|Recently, many {{authors have}} argued against nonoperative treatment, {{especially}} in children > 6  years old with lateral <b>pillar</b> <b>type</b> B, B/C, or C LCPD. This group benefits more from varus or innominate osteotomy than nonoperative treatment because both pain and hip dysfunction {{are common in}} them. The clinical signs of femoroacetabular impingement and the radiographic signs of hip osteoarthritis were also found to be correlated with pain in nonoperatively treated patients [13, 22, 24, 33]. The main advantage of Salter or innominate osteotomy is its effect on femoral head remodeling during the remaining growth. Patients who are indicated for this osteotomy alone are usually younger children with a recent clinical onset of LCPD and no femoral head deformity or subluxation [34, 39].|$|R

40|$|A steel construction, {{divided into}} two parts, was {{designed}} for the building object of a production block of a bio power plant. The two parts separate the boiler room and the engine room. Due to the specific load caused by the operation equipment, also several plateaus, consoles, footbridges and technological constructions were designed. A system of principal pillars HEB, transversely frame-connected with plane solid girders IPE, forms the hall construction. Pillars in rows 1 and 4 are rigidly jointed to foundations. A bearing structure of the roof deck is imposed on the girders. It is composed {{of a system of}} purlins – rolled profiles type UPE. The rigidity of the roof is secured by horizontal bracing between the purlins. The construction of the boiler room is attached to the construction of the engine room, which is formed of frame-connected principal pillars HEB in rows 4, 7 and 8. The roof truss IPE is designed for 12 900 mm span between rows 4 and 7 and for 4 800 mm between rows 7 and 8. The spatial rigidity of the structure is not only secured by the rigid connection of pillars and foundation combined with the frame-connected roof rungs. It is mainly maintained thanks to the system of vertical wall bracings interacting with the horizontal bracing of the roof. Between the pillar rows B, C, D, E, F and G and 8 to 9 a construction of a substation is attached. In the engine room is situated technological structure. The construction is formed by supporting frames consisting of <b>pillars</b> <b>type</b> HEA, rungs type IPE and HEA and vertical bracing of rolled profiles. <b>Pillars</b> <b>type</b> HEA are connected to foundation using articulated connection.

40|$|Abstract—Spatial beam {{compression}} of an electromagnetic wave {{is one of}} the fundamental techniques employed in microwaves and optics. As {{there are many ways to}} achieve this task using the combination of prisms and lenses, recent research suggests the parabolic gradient index photonic crystals (GRIN PC) for the design of spatial beam compressor owing to its functionalities. However, the fabrication of a graded media with the parabolic profile is a difficult challenge in practical realization. As an alternative, present work attempts this problem with respect to the triangular gradient index profile. The performance and aspects of the beam compression are investigated experimentally using the <b>pillar</b> <b>type</b> GRIN PC at the microwave length-scales. The utility of the device for an effective beam injection to the photonic-waveguide component is further demonstrated experimentally. 1...|$|R

Transmission electron micros-copy, powder X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and surface area (BET) methods are used to study the untreated and pillared forms of the monmlorillonite. A structural model involving deformed Al~ 3 pillars is proposed. Four <b>pillar</b> <b>types</b> are derived and these pillars are uniformly distributed over the interlayer-cation positions of montmorillonite. Calculated electron diffraction patterns were sim-ulated using the multi-slice method. The structural model explains the increased ordering along the c axis of the pillared form compared with the untreated montmorillonite. The model explains {{the structure of a}} pillared montmorillonite with different distributions of the pillars in the interlayer. The proposed model is consistent with the observed ata...|$|R
