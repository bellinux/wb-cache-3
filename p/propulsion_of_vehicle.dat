40|$|AbstractAsymmetrical {{electrodes}} under {{high voltage}} which {{are separated by}} a dielectric material experience thrust towards the smaller electrode. This system <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> is innovative and has several unique features that distinguish it from conventional methods <b>of</b> <b>propulsion.</b> One such advantage of this phenomenon is that the electrical energy is directly converted into a mechanical force without the requirement of any moving components. However, the flow physics associated with the thrust produced on the asymmetrical electrodes is quite complex and not yet fully understood. An experimental investigation at the University of New South Wales Aerodynamics Laboratory was conducted on model asymmetrical electrodes in order to investigate its possible use in the <b>propulsion</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> A simple experimental model frame was constructed using lightweight balsa wood and asymmetrical electrodes composing of foil and wire. High DC voltage {{in the range of}} 10 - 35 kilo volts was used in the experiments. The results were very encouraging and thrust was observed. Further experiments involved altering parameters such as, the electrode geometry and configuration, the dielectric material and the pulsing of voltage input. When these changes were implemented, it was shown that a greater thrust was obtained. This suggests that the concept has real potential for practical application and that higher thrust may be possible with the same energy input which could pave the way for an efficient <b>propulsion</b> system <b>of</b> future <b>vehicles</b> with minimal energy requirements...|$|R

Six vehicle attribute were used to describe each vehicle. The results showed that the initial purchase price and the amount of local emission were experienced as the most important attributes by DLA’s, where initial purchase price has a negative influence and local emission a positive influence in the choice for a new vehicle. Next, fuel price, range and availability of the fuel were found evenly important.

40|$|Typically when {{transport}} systems are considered from an energy or environmental perspective {{it is primarily}} the energy use associated with the <b>propulsion</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> that is addressed. There are however other significant energy categories associated with {{transport systems}}, labelled as indirect energy – construction, operation, maintenance and demolition of infrastructure; manufacturing, service and scrapping of vehicles; and fuel production. In this paper the indirect energy is calculated to slightly more than 45 % of the total energy use in the Swedish road transport sector. In detail, infrastructural energy stands for approximately 22 %, vehicular energy at least 14 %, and fuel production about 9 % of the total energy use. In conclusion, the insight into {{the significance of the}} indirect transport energy should have implications on transport policy, for example, the design of means of control to reduce energy use and environmental impact. Four scenarios involving energy-saving measures are tested, and even though direct energy use remains the single largest item, policy-makers concerned with reducing road sector CO 2 -emissions cannot focus exclusively on the consumption of petrol and diesel for propulsion, but should also give heed to the energy use associated with infrastructure and vehicles...|$|R

50|$|The first {{experimental}} road going steam powered {{vehicles were}} built in the late 18th century, {{but it was not until}} after Richard Trevithick had developed the use of high-pressure steam, around 1800, that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition. The first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design, and by the 1850s it was becoming viable to produce them on a commercial basis. This progress was dampened by legislation which limited or prohibited the use <b>of</b> steam powered <b>vehicles</b> on roads. Improvements in vehicle technology continued from the 1860s to the 1920s. Steam road vehicles were used for many applications. In the 20th century, the rapid development of internal combustion engine technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> on a commercial basis, with relatively few remaining in use beyond the Second World War. Many <b>of</b> these <b>vehicles</b> were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation, and numerous examples are still in existence. In the 1960s the air pollution problems in California gave rise to a brief period of interest in developing and studying steam powered vehicles as a possible means of reducing the pollution. Apart from interest by steam enthusiasts, the occasional replica vehicle, and experimental technology no steam vehicles are in production at present.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{increase}} knowledge in the area <b>of</b> articulated <b>vehicles</b> and specifically energy efficient traction control. Eletrical <b>propulsion</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> has started to be popular due to its versatility and freedom of design. One reason is the reduced fuel consumption associated with hybrid solutions that generate power through a smaller engine that can run at its optimal setpoint. The placement of the electrical motor is in this case dependent on the design <b>of</b> the driveline. <b>Vehicles</b> with one electrical motor for each driving wheel can be designed without a mechanical driveline. This kind of driveline {{is referred to as}} individual-wheel drive is usually over-actuated. With the extra actuation provided by these vehicles some critera, i. e. energy efficiency, component wear, traction and driveability, can be optimized. Experiments were performed by using ArtiTRAX (Developed at Luleå University of Technology in Sweden), a 320 kg small-scale articulated vehicle with individual wheel drive. In this thesis we study how the extra actuation can be used to minimize the energy consumption and to determine tyre parameters.
