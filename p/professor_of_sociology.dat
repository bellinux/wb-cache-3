5|$|Much of Durkheim's {{work was}} {{concerned}} with how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity; {{an era in which}} traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social institutions have come into being. His first major sociological work was The Division of Labour in Society (1893). In 1895, he published The Rules of Sociological Method and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>sociology.</b> In 1898, he established the journal L'Année Sociologique. Durkheim's seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.|$|E

5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sociology</b> Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E
