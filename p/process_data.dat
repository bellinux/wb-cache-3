5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, weather {{prediction}} was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 Cleveland Abbe, founder of the United States Weather Bureau, proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century. In 1904, Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a diagnostic step is used to <b>process</b> <b>data</b> to generate initial conditions, which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves the initial value problem. He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: pressure, temperature, density, humidity, and the three components of the flow velocity vector. Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity, conservation of momentum, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the ideal gas law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods. With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics, these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present-day weather models.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of LCA data – unit <b>process</b> <b>data</b> and {{environmental}} input-output data (EIO), where the latter is based on national economic input-output data.

30|$|A BYEC {{classifier}} {{composed of}} 25 SVM subclassifiers was trained by 70 % {{of the original}} NEU defect data set, and the remaining 30 % of the data were {{used to evaluate the}} accuracy of the BYEC classifier on the original data set. Then, we randomly sampled 10 % of the <b>processed</b> <b>data</b> sets to adjust our BYEC classifier. Finally, the accuracy of the adjusted BYEC classifier and the original classifier on the <b>processed</b> <b>data</b> set were tested by the remaining 90 % of the <b>processed</b> <b>data.</b> As for the BYEC classifier, 70 % of the original data set were used to train the KNN, BPNN, and SVM classifier and 30 % were used to evaluate the accuracy on the original data set, then the accuracy of these classifiers on the <b>processed</b> <b>data</b> set was tested by 90 % of the <b>processed</b> <b>data</b> set. The BPNN and KNN parameters were determined by cross-validation testing. The average accuracy of the classifiers on every data set was run 100 times, and the data sets were sampled individually.|$|R

The Type 052C may use an improved system to better engage anti-ship missiles, and to <b>process</b> <b>data</b> from its helicopter; the Ka-28 ASW helicopters must pass data back to its host ship for processing.|$|E
25|$|For {{acoustic}} hydrography and bathymetry, {{the ship}} had a deep-water echosounder, a shallow-water echosounder-lOOKhz, and a hydrographic survey sounder. To <b>process</b> <b>data,</b> she had the National Ocean Services Hydrochart system, which employed a PDP/8E computer to acquire and process hydrographic data in real time, generate a real-time position-corrected plot of sounding data, provide steering commands to the helmsman, and generate a punched paper tape for shore-based processing of sounding dara.|$|E
25|$|To help {{determine}} the capability of a process, statistically determined upper and lower limits are drawn {{on either side of}} a process mean on the control chart. The control limits are set at three standard deviations {{on either side of the}} process mean, and are known as the upper control limit (UCL) and lower control limit (LCL) respectively. If the <b>process</b> <b>data</b> plotted on the control chart remains within the control limits over an extended period, then the process is said to be stable.|$|E

25|$|The monad {{represents}} computations with a sequential structure: a monad defines what {{it means}} to chain operations together. This enables the programmer to build pipelines that <b>process</b> <b>data</b> in a series of steps (i.e. a series of actions applied to the data), in which each action is decorated with the additional processing rules provided by the monad. A monad is defined by a return operator that creates values, and a bind operator used to link the actions in the pipeline; this definition must follow a set of axioms called monad laws, which are needed for the composition of actions in the pipeline to work properly.|$|E
25|$|The word robot {{can refer}} to both {{physical}} robots and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually referred to as bots. There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to possess {{some or all of}} the following abilities and functions: accept electronic programming, <b>process</b> <b>data</b> or physical perceptions electronically, operate autonomously to some degree, move around, operate physical parts of itself or physical processes, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behavior, especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals. Closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of Synthetic Biology, which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{can perform}} both {{sequential}} control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both {{in an industrial}} application. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logic type systems. General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can <b>process</b> <b>data</b> from a network of PLCs, instruments and controllers in order to implement typical (such as PID) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers and management.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} this is mouse gesture trackings, where the motion of the mouse is {{correlated}} to a symbol being drawn by a person's hand, as is the Wii Remote or the Myo armband or the mForce Wizard wristband, which can study changes in acceleration over time to represent gestures. Devices such as the LG Electronics Magic Wand, the Loop and the Scoop use Hillcrest Labs' Freespace technology, which uses MEMS accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors to translate gestures into cursor movement. The software also compensates for human tremor and inadvertent movement. AudioCubes are another example. The sensors of these smart light emitting cubes can be used to sense hands and fingers as well as other objects nearby, and can be used to <b>process</b> <b>data.</b> Most applications are in music and sound synthesis, but can be applied to other fields.|$|E
25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another {{latching}} region would allow for the latching of two input values at the two different outputs. To perform computation, a gate that takes as inputs both serial lines at their respective outputs is added. The gate is placed over a new latching region configured to <b>process</b> <b>data</b> only when both latching regions {{at the end of}} the serial lines hold the values of interest at the same instant. Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, latching regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to latching region 7. At this instant, latching region 7 will let the values latched on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring the latching regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|E
25|$|The 53d WRS {{maintains}} similarly configured {{satellite communications}} ground stations within CARCAH at the NHC and its facility at Keesler to receive and <b>process</b> <b>data</b> from the aircraft. The Keesler ground station is maintained {{as a backup}} to the primary system at NHC, which has greater data streaming capability, and would be manned by CARCAH personnel {{in the event of}} a long-term satellite communications failure at NHC. During temporary outages, 53d personnel at Keesler act as operators and relay data from the aircraft by land line to the CARCAH ground station. Processed data is transmitted to the Weather Product Management and Distribution System (WPMDS) of the Air Force Weather Agency at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, which then relays it to the NWS Telecommunication Gateway at Silver Spring, Maryland, for worldwide distribution. The Keesler site has direct communications capability with WPMDS in the event of land line/internet failure between Keesler and the NHC. The system also provides backup transmission paths to WPMDS using local NHC servers and satellite connection to Keesler in the event of internet outages, except if an outage originates at Offutt.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} encounter, Voyager {{navigation}} engineer Linda A. Morabito noticed a plume {{emanating from the}} surface {{in one of the}} images. Analysis of other Voyager 1 images showed nine such plumes scattered across the surface, proving that Io was volcanically active. This conclusion was predicted in a paper published shortly before the Voyager1 encounter by Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds. The authors calculated that Io's interior must experience significant tidal heating caused by its orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede (see the [...] "Tidal heating" [...] section for a more detailed explanation of the <b>process).</b> <b>Data</b> from this flyby showed that the surface of Io is dominated by sulfur and sulfur dioxide frosts. These compounds also dominate its thin atmosphere and the torus of plasma centered on Io's orbit (also discovered by Voyager).|$|E
