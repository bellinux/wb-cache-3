40|$|Abstract — A bank of {{nonlinear}} adaptive observers is {{used for}} fault diagnosis in oil and gas drilling where managed pressure drilling (MPD) is applied. The particular fault considered is formation of a <b>pack-off,</b> causing increased friction {{in one part of}} the annulus. The process model is a simplified hydraulics model with a Newtonian fluid. All states in the model are assumed measurable, an assumption based on planned implementation of the wired drill pipe measurement technology. A fault detection observer is used to detect that a <b>pack-off</b> is being formed somewhere in the annulus. Then a set of fault isolation and approximation observers, one for each possible fault, is used to isolate the location of the <b>pack-off</b> and estimating its magnitude. Isolation is done by using residuals of annular friction estimation. The method for fault diagnosis is illustrated in a simulation study.

40|$|<b>Pack-off</b> is a {{partially}} or complete blocking of the circulation flow {{in oil and}} gas drilling, {{which can lead to}} costly delays. Early detection and localization of a <b>pack-off</b> is crucial in order to take necessary actions avoiding downtime. This incident will affect physical friction parameters in the well. A model-based adaptive observer is used to estimate these friction parameters as well as flow rates. Detecting changes to these estimates can then be used for <b>pack-off</b> diagnosis, which due to measurement noise is done using statistical change detection. Isolation of incident type and location is done using a multivariate generalized likelihood ratio test, determining the change direction of the estimated mean values. The method is tested on simulated data from the commercial high-fidelity multi-phase simulator OLGA, where three different pack-offs at different locations and with different magnitudes are successfully detected at an early stage and with low false alarms. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Data from a medium-scale {{horizontal}} {{flow loop}} test facility {{is used to}} test fault diagnosis in managed pressure drilling. The faults are downhole incidents such as formation influx, fluid loss, drillstring washout, <b>pack-off,</b> and plugging of the drill bit, which are important to detect and handle {{in order to avoid}} downtime and possibly dangerous situations. In this paper a fault diagnosis scheme based on an adaptive observer and the generalized likelihood ratio test is applied on the experimental data. The different types of faults are detected and their location are isolated using friction parameter estimates. Results indicate that the method can in most cases identify the type of fault, whereas the location is sometimes more uncertain...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringAdvanced {{real-time}} monitoring systems are useful tools for safe and cost effective well operation practices. As one moves into deeper water, higher pressure and higher temperature, the drilling operations only becomes more challenging. Since the operational drilling window is getting narrower, implementation of good IO technology (i. e. real-time data, technology and people) {{are necessary to}} increase safe operations, increase productivity, enhance HSE and reduce NPT. This thesis is divided into a theoretical and a simulation part. The theoretical part presents major downhole drilling problems related to hydraulics, prevention and remedial actions. The theoretical part emphasizes on describing different rheological models for hydraulic calculations. The simulation part presents the {{real-time monitoring}} system Discovery Web application developed by Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies. In the simulation part, the rheology models are used for hydraulic calculation in different drilling scenarios. Pressure at different locations in the well (Pump pressure (bar), BHP (bar) and ECD (sg)) has been calculated. Different events and unwanted situations are considered and different visualization views have been provided to demonstrate how different well parameters will develop. The input parameters to the models have typically been ROP, flow rate, rheology data and mud density. In order to illustrate {{the applicability of the}} implemented models, a case study is presented while drilling a vertical well from 4000 m. The following drilling scenarios have been simulated and the results are briefly discussed. These are: Connection scenario, Kick scenario during drilling, Kick scenario during connection, <b>Pack-off</b> scenario and sensitivity of <b>pack-off,</b> Lost circulation scenario, ROP vs cutting concentration scenario, Hydraulics and rheology model comparison scenario and Washout scenario. By building a monitoring panel in Discovery Web, based on the proper rheological models and hydraulic calculations, this thesis have been used to show how models and simulations can be combined in Discovery Web. The experience has been that it was easy to implement the model using Discovery Web Formulas. Another strength of the software is that it is very easy to visualize and import data from real wells in this application. Hence, it is a very good tool for comparing models with real data. This real-time data handling capability and visualization flexibility is considered as one of the major strengths. It has also been shown how to embed events into the models, which later {{can be used as a}} basis for developing training scenarios and demonstrations in teaching. The results show how the models implemented can be the first step in introducing models in combination with real-time data for monitoring and handling drilling problems using this application...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThis thesis {{studies the}} impact of wired drill pipe {{telemetry}} on the Martin Linge field. In addition, the utilization of along string measurements will be analysed and a verification will be made on both how far the technology has come, and the way forward. The reliability trends for the wired drill pipe telemetry system on Martin Linge are positive. The reliability rates achieved, currently averaging 91 % uptime, {{might be one of}} the highest on the Norwegian Continental Shelf so far. Uptime is a very important aspect of the wired drill pipe telemetry system, and it is important to put a focus on how to increase it. Having a third party responsible for the uptime has introduced a whole new incentive for increasing, and maintaining, stable uptime. Early start-up of the utilization of wired drill pipe telemetry has familiarized everyone with the equipment and handling of the tools, and has contributed to the network uptime gradually increasing. Several examples of how to use the along string measurement pressure sensors will be presented, with respect to <b>pack-off</b> detection, hole cleaning, lost circulation and leak off testing. These can be used as means of analysing downhole data in real-time and used as a basis for software development. In the end, high speed transfer of data between downhole tools and surface are reducing telemetry time and saving rig time. Currently, a reduction in telemetry time of 5. 87 [hours/ 1000 m drilled] has been achieved. Thus, a lot of cost has been saved by decreasing time spent on downhole communication...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Coporo- 1 is an 18, 000 -ft dry hole located in the tectonically active foothills of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia. A mechanical stability analysis allowed explaining most of the drilling stability-related problems and elaborating an optimal mud-density window for Coporo- 1 and future wells in the area. Repeated sections of the Carbonera formation, high in-situ stresses, abnormal pore pressure in some intervals, high temperature, and micro-fractured formations make drilling in this region both technically and economically challenging. Shear failures in shales caused frequent <b>pack-off,</b> stuck pipe, reaming, and back reaming. Tensile failures in sands generated lost-circulation incidents. Log-derived mechanical properties, leak-off test and lost-circulation data, borehole geometry, estimated pore pressure based on the Eaton's method, and borehole images from Coporo- 1 and partial information from the Cumaral- 1 AX well were available for this research to develop a geomechanical model for Coporo- 1. Further calculations based on the Mohr-Coulomb criterion were applied to elaborate a mud-density window designing mud-densities that allow controlled breakouts in the formations for its lower limit and mud-densities equivalent to the magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress in its upper limit. The Carbonera formation C 7 unit at 13, 620 ft {{is one of the most}} difficult formations to drill in the area. There appears to be no optimal mud-density window to simultaneously avoid serious borehole deterioration and lost circulation risks in this formation. Additional research is required to analyze the Carbonera formation C 5 unit that caused casing to collapse in several intervals in the Coporo- 1 well. The C 5 unit is likely to be a potential problem during the drilling and production operations of future wells in the area. Conclusions and recommendations are provided for future wells in the area...|$|E
