40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: Given the {{importance}} of microbial contamination in creating food-borne diseases, {{this study was conducted}} to assess level of microbial contamination of <b>pastry</b> <b>creams</b> in Hamedan, Iran. 			Materials and Methods: Totally, 80 samples were randomly collected from the confectioneries and analyzed for microbial contamination according to Iranian national standard microbial tests. 			Results: Data indicated that 49 (61. 2 %) samples were contaminated, mostly comprised of Coliforms (92. 5 %). Moreover, the infection was seen to be higher in jelly roll compared to puff pastry. Yeast contamination was about 82. 5 percent, which could accelerate the decay of such products. However, yeast contamination of puff pastries was higher than jelly roll. The microbial contamination with Staphylococcus aureus, total viable count and molds were 57. 5 %, 35 % and 37. 5 %; respectively. 			 		 	 Conclusion: Nevertheless, Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes were not found in any of the samples. Abundance of microbial contamination in the puff pastry samples might put consumer’s health at risk...|$|R

5000|$|Gâteau Basque is a {{traditional}} dessert from the Basque region of France. Typically Gâteau Basque is constructed from layers of a wheat flour based cake (a butter-sugar pastry dough, in this case [...] "pâte sablée", not [...] "brisée") with a filling of either almond or vanilla <b>pastry</b> <b>cream,</b> or preserved cherries. The <b>pastry</b> <b>cream</b> Gâteau Basque is more typical in the Spanish Basque Country. This started during the 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|When starch is added, {{the result}} is called <b>pastry</b> <b>cream</b> (crème pâtissière, [...] ) or confectioners' custard, made with a {{combination}} of milk or cream, egg yolks, fine sugar, flour or some other starch, and usually a flavoring such as vanilla, chocolate, or lemon. Crème pâtissière is a key ingredient in many French desserts including mille-feuille (or Napoleons) and filled tarts. It is also used in Italian pastry and sometimes in Boston cream pie. Although egg thickens the custard, the effect is minimal, with the majority of thickening resulting from starch. Corn flour or flour thicken at 100 °C and as such many recipes instruct the <b>pastry</b> <b>cream</b> to be boiled. In a traditional custard such as a crème anglaise, where egg is used alone as a thickener, boiling results in the over cooking and subsequent 'curdling' of the custard; however, in a <b>pastry</b> <b>cream,</b> starch prevents this. Once cooled, the amount of starch in <b>pastry</b> <b>cream</b> 'sets' the cream and requires it to be beaten or whipped before use.|$|E
50|$|Custard is {{a variety}} of culinary {{preparations}} based on a cooked mixture of milk or cream and egg yolk. Depending on how much egg or thickener is used, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (crème anglaise) to a thick <b>pastry</b> <b>cream</b> (French: crème pâtissière) used to fill éclairs. Most common custards are used as desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla. Sometimes flour, corn starch, or gelatin is added as in <b>pastry</b> <b>cream</b> or crème pâtissière.|$|E
