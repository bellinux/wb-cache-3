By belonging to ENF, a political group with nationalist features, Rebega claims to have tried to express once again his unconditional patriotism and loyalty for national values and Romania's unitary state principles. [...] "I firmly believe that the good of one nation does not necessary mean the bad of the other, therefore my patriotic and nationalist beliefs will always be part of my political actions. I will stand up for national ideals, history, traditions, Christianity and inherited customs and I will actively participate in the process of Romanian values’ recognition at a European and global level. I am and I will always be the one who follows the rightful aspirations of the Romanian revolution from 1848, namely the territorial unity, the spirit of emancipation and affirmation of the Romanian nation, its just, national harmony.My activity is based on the defense of Romania's territorial integrity and national sovereignty, the support of Christianity, in general and the Orthodox faith, in particular, the protection of individual liberties, with a focus on the freedom of speech." ...|$|E
