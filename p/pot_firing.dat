40|$|The {{transition}} from the Neolithic to the EBA in Crete is best illustrated through the pottery sequence of the island. Crete is a large self-sufficient island of the Mediterranean and for {{the best part of}} the Neolithic era kept aloof from the rest of the Aegean. The EN I to LN pottery is very homogeneous and is characterised by a rather conservative typology. In the LN II and the FN periods a combination of internal factors, such as improvements in <b>pot</b> <b>firing</b> techniques and a taste for innovation from within the system, led to the invention of new types of decoration and a strong tendency for mass production. These developments took place at Knossos and Phaistos, the two main settlements of the island with a fully developed mixed agricultural economy. The other LN/FN sites -mainly caves- do not demonstrate the same creativity and variety in pottery styles. Their pottery assemblages are rather monotonous in typology and of lower quality. This difference may well derive from the different types of economic exploitation practised in the various environments. Nevertheless, there are sufficient typological links between Knossos and Phaistos and the other sites to substantiate the typological and cultural homogeneity of the island as a whole. In the EBA (EN I) a major innovation appears with the sudden introduction of painted pottery. At the same time, each major geographical area of the island develops its own individual pottery styles. Despite the apparent discontinuity between the Neolithic and the EBA, which led to the formulation of various invasion theories, lines of continuity can be followed up and have to do with the improvements in <b>pot</b> <b>firing</b> and mass production. Affinities and communication with the Aegean are now stronger and more intensified, but do not Justify a cultural break. The Cretan EBA pottery has its own unmistakable character and identity. All in all, the transitional period seems to be rather short and coincides with the last phase of the Neolithic, the FN...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{ceramics}} that were found during the field season excavation of May 2012 at the pre-Columbian site Aguas Buenas, Nicaragua, AD 400 - 1400. Aguas Buenas is situated in the Chontales province, Central Nicaragua, where {{there is not much}} archaeological research done. Linguistic and ethno historical research shows that the province was a cultural complex area in pre-Columbian times. Aguas Buenas is the largest known site in this province and so far only studies in surveys. The aim of the thesis is trying to say something about the identity of the people who build the site and regional interaction. During the field season of 2012 pottery was the most found material. The ceramics were studied using a modal analysis. The following modes were analysed: pot shape, lip shape, diameter of the <b>pot,</b> <b>firing</b> colour, colour, slip, decoration, and surface finishing. These results are compared with previous studies from Chontales and the Pacific region of Nicaragua...|$|E

50|$|One notable {{feature of}} the Pitted Ware Culture is the sheer {{quantity}} of shards of pottery on its sites. The culture has been named after the typical ornamentation of its pottery: horizontal rows of pits pressed {{into the body of}} the <b>pot</b> before <b>firing.</b>|$|R
25|$|With one exception, pre-Hispanic {{pieces were}} not glazed, {{but rather the}} finish was made with a slip made of {{extremely}} fine clay. This slip often had mineral pigments added for color, which could be added before and/or after firing. Firing was done in an open fire or in a pit. Figurines were often done in the family hearth. <b>Pots</b> were <b>fired</b> in a heap placed {{on the ground or}} in a pit and covered with wood. The use of this method for firing most often led to incompletely <b>fired</b> <b>pots,</b> with the notable exception of Fine Orangeware.|$|R

50|$|One common {{issue that}} Ghanaian markets face {{is the problem}} of market fires. These are rampant and the effect, typically, is that goods and {{structures}} are destroyed with the cost running into thousands of cedis. These fire outbreaks start from varied sources, that is, they may start {{as a result of an}} unattended iron, coal <b>pot</b> <b>fire</b> not turned out to wielders forgetting to turn off their wielding torches. The problem is always compounded because of congestion. Every major market in Ghana faces the problem of congestion. Due to this, fire hydrants have been obscured by stalls, lanes that fire trucks could use to access the market are converted into stores etc. All these come together to cause the kind of destruction that occurs during such outbreaks of fires.|$|R

5000|$|In Cambodia, hot pot {{is called}} Yao Hon (យ៉ាវហន) or other regions call it Chhnang Pleurng (ឆ្នាំងភ្លើង), which {{literally}} translates to <b>Pot</b> <b>Fire.</b> It is usually eaten during celebrations or family gatherings.

Another variation of the dish is called [...] "Buttered Yao Hon" [...] or [...] "Buttered Chhnang Pleurng" [...] where all the same ingredients are used but except cooking in coconut milk soup it is cooked on a flat grill pan where butter is used as the base. It is similar to the Korean Barbecue. An herb sauce usually assist with the [...] "Buttered Yao Hon" [...] since all the ingredients are not flavored.|$|R
5000|$|Undhiyu: A mixed {{vegetable}} casserole that {{is traditionally}} cooked upside down underground in earthen <b>pots</b> <b>fired</b> from above.

These are cooked in a spicy curry that sometimes includes coconut. Surti Undhiyu is a variant that is served with puri at weddings and banquets. Again it is a mixed vegetable casserole, made with red lentils and seasoned with spices, grated coconut, and palm sugar in a mild sauce. It is garnished with chopped peanuts and toasted grated coconut, and served with rice or roti.

50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process is quite simple. A press forms the pot shape out of clay mixed with rice husks. The <b>pot</b> is <b>fired,</b> and the husk burns, leaving small holes {{that the water}} can run through. Finally the filters are coated with colloidal silver. The filters are used with plastic storage units to collect the water.|$|R
50|$|After painting, the <b>pots</b> are <b>fired</b> on {{open ground}} or in pit ovens. Two or three small <b>pots</b> may be <b>fired</b> together, but larger ones are fired individually. They are {{set on a}} pile of dried cow dung and wood and if fired on open ground, covered with a large {{overturned}} pot called a “saggar.” For polychrome pots, air is allowed to circulate inside the firing chamber. If the pots are to be turned black, the chamber is sealed to keep smoke in and air out. Lydia Quezada is credited for the black variation. She says she learned how to do it when she accidentally sealed the chamber for a polychrome pot, creating black clouds. The effect prompted her to experiment.|$|R
