40|$|In {{order to}} handle tools or workpieces, {{industrial}} robots {{are provided with}} a gripper device having two gripper jaws moving synchronously in opposite directions. The new changing device is intended to permit a simple and fast automatic change of gripper jaws. The changing device has a fixture for the gripper jaw which is friction-locked in the fixture. The gripper jaw is mounted in the fixture transverse to the direction of motion of a gripper jaw holder, having a <b>positive-locking</b> part insertable in an opening of the gripper jaw. The gripper jaw holder is moved by the industrial robot transverse to the gripper jaw through the fixture, whereby the <b>positive-locking</b> part engages in {{the opening of the}} gripper jaw, thus connecting it to the gripper jaw holder. The changing device is suitable for use with industrial robots...|$|E
40|$|Improved spring-tab {{lock washer}} offers {{alternative}} to such <b>positive-locking</b> devices as cotter pins and lock wires and to conventional split-ring lock washers. Does not dig into fastened parts with sharp edges; {{less likely to}} inflict scratches causing cracks. Contains three winglike spring tabs and three alignment pips, pressed into mating dimples in surface of part to be fastened. Spring tabs on lock washer allow only clockwise rotation (tightening) of bolt or nut...|$|E
40|$|Gas-lifted {{oil wells}} are {{susceptible}} to failure through malfunction of gas lift valve assemblies (GLV). One failure mode occurs when the GLV check valve fails and product passes into the well annulus, potentially reaching the wellhead. This {{is a growing concern}} as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions, and repair and monitoring become difficult. Currently no safeguard exists in the GLV to prevent product passage in the event of check valve failure. In this paper a design and operational procedures are proposed for a thermally-actuated <b>positive-locking</b> safety valve to seal the GLV in the event of check valve failure. A thermal model of the well and GLV system is developed and compared to well data to verify feasibility of a thermally-actuated safety valve. A 3 Ã— scale prototype safety valve is built and tested under simulated failure scenarios and well start-up scenarios. Realistic well temperatures in the range of 20 C to 70 C are used. Results demonstrate valve closure in response to simulated check valve failure and valve opening during simulated well start-up...|$|E
