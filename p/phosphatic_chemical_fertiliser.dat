30|$|In general, soil {{biological}} {{activities are}} associated with soil structure (Rillig and Mummey 2006), which in turn affects root penetration {{and the movement of}} water and gases. Yoshino (1993) reported that solid ratio and aggregate stability increased in the soil surface on UFs, suggesting that the physical properties of soil are improved by unfertilised farming systems. We hypothesized that improving the physical and biological properties of soil would increase crop yield in high-yield UFs. To test this hypothesis, we studied the physicochemical, biological and morphological properties of soils in long-term UFs in Japan. In general, biological activities are influenced by <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and organic manures (Marschner et al. 2003). Moreover, soil structure, particularly soil aggregates, is influenced by the tillage method (Pagliai et al. 2004; Plante and McGill 2002; Six et al. 1999). We investigated the effects of shallow tillage and unfertilised management of unfertilised farming systems and compared them with the effects of deep tillage of farm with no <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (Eniwa, Hokkaido) and those of a shallow-tillage farm with <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> (Narita, Chiba).

40|$|Conventional {{modelling}} {{approaches to}} understand farmers’ adoption preferences tend {{to ignore the}} range of choices farmers face, {{as well as the}} trade-offs among various possibilities to improve crop yield. To address this deficiency, this study employs the choice modelling approach to examine famers’ valuation of various attributes under a Green Revolution package to improve crop yield. It was found that the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and drought-resistant seed varieties was highly valued by farmers in the two regions of Northern Ghana. Information on farmers’ willingness to pay for <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> is a useful tool for reducing the current high fertiliser subsidy. Food-insecure farmers, on the other hand, valued organic fertilisers and drought-resistant seeds, while female-headed households among food-secure farmers had a preference for organic fertiliser. Legume intercropping to fix soil fertility has some potential for promotion among farmers, but it was less valued than <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> Farm households {{did not appear to be}} interested in using seed varieties that vary in time to maturation, which have potential benefits in the face of current climate variability and future climate change.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{diagnose}} {{problems that}} threaten regional sustainability and to devise appropriate treatment measures in China's agro-ecosystems, a study {{was carried out}} to quantify the nitrogen (N) flow in China's typical agro-ecosystems and develop potential solutions to the increasing environmental N load. RESULTS: The analysis showed that owing to human activity in the agro-ecosystems of Changjiang River Basin the mean total input of anthropogenic reactive N (i. e. <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> atmospheric deposition and bio-N fixation) increased from 4. 41 x 10 (9) kg-N in 1980 to 7. 61 x 10 (9) kg-N in 1990 and then to 1. 43 x 10 (10) kg-N in 2000, with <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser</b> N being the largest contributor to N load. Field investigation further showed that changes in human behaviour and rural urbanisation have caused rural communities to become more dependent on <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> In rural regions, around 4. 17 kg-N of per capita annual potential N load as excrement was returned to farmlands and 1. 38 kg-N directly discharged into river systems, while in urbanised regions, around 1. 00 kg-N of per capita annual potential N load as excrement was returned to farmlands and 5. 62 kg-N discharged into river systems in urban areas. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study suggest that human activities have significantly altered the N cycle in agro-ecosystems of China.

40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> {{contribute}} to greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel use, use of non-renewable phosphate {{rock and a}} flow of reactive nitrogen to the biosphere, exceeding the planetary boundaries. Recycling of plant nutrients from waste and by-products from society would reduce the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> These plant nutrient sources are also of interest for organic farming, where <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> are not allowed, especially organic farms without access to manure. This thesis assessed {{the environmental impact of}} systems recycling plant nutrients from slaughterhouse waste, toilet waste fractions, digested food waste and mussels too small to be used in food production. The methodology used was life cycle assessment (LCA) and the functional unit was production of 1 kg plant-available nitrogen. The environmental impact categories studied were primary energy use, global warming potential (GWP), potential eutrophication and potential acidification. Flow of cadmium to arable soil, use of non-renewable phosphate rock and potential carbon sequestration were also assessed. In addition, additional functions such as phosphorus added to arable soil, energy production, removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater streams etc. were considered. The reference scenario for all comparisons was the production and use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> In general, storage and spreading of the organic fertilisers contributed greatly to potential eutrophication and acidification, except in the case of meat meal fertiliser, which was in a pseudo-stable form. All investigated fertilisers gave rise to goal conflicts as none of the fertilisers reduced the impact for all impact categories studied. The urine fertiliser reduced the largest amount of impact categories and added the least amount of cadmium to arable soil. Meat meal reduced, or had similar results as the reference scenario, for all impact categories except primary energy use and potential eutrophication. For digested food waste, <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use was an environmentally better option for all impacts. Composting gave rise to large nitrogen emissions, thus anaerobic storage was a better environmental option for mussel treatment. Due to the large amount of phosphorus per kg nitrogen in the compost, the reference scenario used the largest amount of non-renewable phosphate rock. A need for applicable methods and data for estimating emissions in LCA of agricultural systems was identified...|$|R

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{empirical}} evidence that suggests {{the existence of}} gender discrimination {{when it comes to}} access to and subsequent use of productivity-enhancing farm inputs, specially those provided via market institutions, such as <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and hired labour. This discrimination is often found to be in favour of male farmers or male-headed households. Against this background, this focus contributes to building an understanding of the role of female education as a possible intervention that could mitigate such gendered agricultural input use disparities. A bivariate probit model on <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and hired labour use by households is estimated, using data collected in 2007 in rural Zimbabwe. This estimation strategy allows for interdependency between the input use decisions. Our results suggest that education significantly raises the probability of female farmers' use of both <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and hired labour. Interestingly, this impact is found to be higher for femaleheaded households in communal areas as opposed to female-headed households in resettlement areas where eneficiaries of Zimbabwe's Fast-track Land Reform Programme reside.

Yield of ears without husks under all treatments increased between 16 - 108 % when compared to the control. Application of Bokashi alone showed 16 % increased yield of ears without husks over the control. However, in terms of statistical data, the total yield of ears was similar to those found in control. Moreover, plant height, plant diameter and area of the largest leaves were insignificant at a confidence level of 95 %. Excluding labor costs, the maximum net return (25. 92 US$) was obtained in T 4 which corresponding with the highest total yield of ears without husks (182. 78 ± 13. 85 kg).

30|$|Human {{population}} is increasing worldwide {{giving rise to}} intensive farming system and unsuitable cropland management that ultimately results in reduced soil fertility (Onwudike 2010; Bedada et al. 2014). Extensive use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> is suggested for replenishment of nutritional deficiencies to increase crop yield. Many disadvantages of widespread use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> include increase in soil acidity, mineral imbalance and soil degradation (Kang and Juo 1980; Ayoola and Makinde 2008) and even farmers nowadays do not prefer <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> (Bedada et al. 2014). In composting, microorganisms decompose organic substrate aerobically into carbon dioxide, water, minerals and stabilised organic matter (Bernal et al. 2009; Kala et al. 2009; Vakili et al. 2015). Compost is added into the soil to improve nutrients and water-holding capacity (Arslan et al. 2008; Vakili et al. 2015). Recently, researchers observed that addition of cow dung to biomass generated from palm oil industries improves the {{physical and chemical properties}} including nutritional composition of compost. Palm oil biomass mixed with cow dung in the ratio of 1 : 3 significantly improved the compost quality with respect to various parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity and C:N ratio (Vakili et al. 2015). Thus, cow dung may not only act as a substitute for <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> because it supplements organic matter, but also as a conditioner for soil (Garg and Kaushik 2005; Yadav et al. 2013; Be´langer et al. 2014). Slurry from biogas plant is also a nutrient-rich source but it cannot be used at large scale because of its drawbacks such as eutrophication and leaching of the soil nutrients (Garg et al. 2005; Wachendorf et al. 2005; Islam et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2014).|$|R
