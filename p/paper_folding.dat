5|$|The Japanese paper-folding art of origami {{has been}} {{reworked}} mathematically by Tomoko Fusé using modules, congruent {{pieces of paper}} such as squares, and making them into polyhedra or tilings. Paper-folding was used in 1893 by T. Sundara Rao in his Geometric Exercises in <b>Paper</b> <b>Folding</b> to demonstrate geometrical proofs. The mathematics of <b>paper</b> <b>folding</b> has been explored in Maekawa's theorem, Kawasaki's theorem, and the Huzita–Hatori axioms.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations {{are also}} a main genre in origami (<b>paper</b> <b>folding),</b> where pleats are used to connect {{molecules}} such as twist folds together in a repeating fashion.|$|E
5|$|Kawasaki's theorem is a theorem in the {{mathematics}} of <b>paper</b> <b>folding</b> {{that describes the}} crease patterns with a single vertex that may be folded to form a flat figure. It states that the pattern is flat-foldable {{if and only if}} alternatingly adding and subtracting the angles of consecutive folds around the vertex gives an alternating sum of zero.|$|E

2500|$|The Froebel star {{carries the}} name of the German educationist Friedrich Fröbel (1782–1852), founder of the Kindergarten concept. He {{encouraged}} the use of <b>paper</b> <b>folding</b> in pre–primary education with the aim of conveying simple mathematical concepts to children. It is, however, likely that Froebel did not invent this item and that it had already been within the realm of general knowledge for a long time. Froebel did encourage <b>paper</b> <b>folding</b> as an activity for young children and he popularised discourse about children's activities, which is how his name and the folding instructions might have become related.|$|E
