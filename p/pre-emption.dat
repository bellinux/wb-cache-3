5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a <b>pre-emption</b> of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Response to the <b>pre-emption</b> by {{viewers and}} other critics was negative; the family members of several Jets players were unaware of the game's actual conclusion, while NBC {{received}} further criticism for its poor timing in displaying the final score of the game during the Heidi movie. NBC's president Julian Goodman formally apologized for the incident. The Jets and Raiders met again in the AFL Championship Game, with the Jets winning 27–23. They later defeated the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.|$|E
5|$|The land in question, {{which had}} been part of the Seneca Nation's {{traditional}} territory for centuries before the American Revolution, comprised part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, a tract of land disputed after the war between claims of New York and Massachusetts. By a December 16, 1786 interstate compact, the states agreed that Massachusetts would retain the proprietary rights and the <b>pre-emption</b> rights, but New York would retain governmental rights. After the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, the federal government ratified their compact.|$|E
50|$|As of September 2016, {{syndicated}} programs broadcasting on KIRO-TV presently include Right This Minute, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Judge Judy, The Insider and Entertainment Tonight. KIRO {{runs the}} entire CBS programming lineup with minimal <b>pre-emptions,</b> generally only for KIRO's award-winning special, InColor. However, KIRO-TV's alternate feed for Canadian viewers has more <b>pre-emptions</b> than the regular feed, particularly infomercials replacing programs like Let's Make a Deal, KIRO 7 News at Noon, Right This Minute and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.|$|R
50|$|WTMJ {{broadcasts}} {{the entire}} NBC schedule, {{with the exception}} of program <b>pre-emptions</b> for breaking news or severe weather coverage. From the 1960s to the 1990s, <b>pre-emptions</b> on the station were more common (examples include those involving NBC's daytime game show and soap opera lineup; Sanford and Son airing on Saturday nights instead of Fridays during the 1970s; and its replacement of Gimme a Break! and Mama's Family in favor of the syndicated drama Fame on Thursday nights during the 1983-84 season). Although NBC had long been less tolerant of <b>pre-emptions</b> of its programming than the other networks, it usually did not raise objections to those made by WTMJ, since it {{has been one of the}} network's strongest affiliates. NBC was also helped by then-independent station WVTV often picking up NBC programs declined by channel 4 for their own schedule, with WCGV also doing so when that station signed on in March 1980.|$|R
50|$|Under Viacom ownership, channel 10 {{took part}} in another trade—this one the first (and only) network {{affiliation}} switch in Rochester. On July 1, 1989, WHEC-TV joined the NBC network, replacing WROC-TV (now on channel 8), which took on CBS. This move {{was the result of}} WROC-TV's poor performance and constant <b>pre-emptions</b> of NBC network programming (NBC was very intolerant of <b>pre-emptions</b> at this time). The swap brought channel 10 in-line with sister stations WNYT in Albany and WVIT in New Britain, Connecticut, which had recently renewed their NBC relationships. In addition, NBC's strong primetime programming—NBC was the most-watched network at the time, while CBS was in distant third near the midpoint of the Laurence Tisch era—was another major factor.|$|R
5|$|In 1993, {{answering}} a petition signed {{by a group}} of cultural personalities from Iași, Metropolitan Daniel (the future Patriarch of All Romania) signed a decision to posthumously revert the decision to exclude Ion Creangă from among the Moldavian clergy. The public polled during a 2006 program produced by the Romanian Television nominated Creangă 43rd among the 100 greatest Romanians. New monuments honoring the writer include a bust unveiled in Târgu Neamț, the work of sculptor Ovidiu Ciobotaru. The patrimony associated with Creangă's life has also sparked debates: local authorities in Târgu Neamț were criticized for not maintaining the site near his house in its best condition, while the Fălticeni where he once lived was controversially put up for sale by its private owners in 2009, at a time when city hall could not exercise its <b>pre-emption</b> right.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Ullevaal Stadion AS {{bought the}} West Stand, {{including}} the commercial areas. In March 2001, NFF gave Lyn a loan for NOK12.5 million, {{on the condition}} that if it was not paid back within two years, NFF would take over Lyn's ownership in the stadium. This made it possible for Lyn to pay their investment company back the debt for the loan, which had increased to this amount in five years, and to purchase the stadium and secure NFF the right of <b>pre-emption.</b> On 4 July 2002, Lyn and NFF announced that NFF would make a private placement of NOK27 million in Ullevaal Stadion AS {{and at the same time}} terminate Lyn's debt. In exchange, Lyn's ownership was reduced to 15%.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to England the {{expedition}} was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the <b>pre-emption</b> {{of a role}} they envisaged for their own National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in Antarctic survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel, and had {{opened the way for}} all the expeditions that followed.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of Westinghouse's deal with CBS, KYW-TV began {{carrying}} the entire CBS schedule in pattern with no <b>pre-emptions</b> except for extended breaking news or severe weather coverage.

5|$|A {{settlement}} {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made a more accurate survey of the reservation lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within the reservation. He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} east bank that {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. His plan was to stake a <b>pre-emption</b> claim at the falls. However, Franklin Steele also had plans to stake a claim. On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to the falls, built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's claim, as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E

50|$|Veterans Broadcasting {{merged with}} Rust Craft Broadcasting in 1964. Rust Craft became a {{subsidiary}} of Ziff Davis in 1979. Rust Craft then sold WROC-TV and sister stations in Saginaw, Michigan, Augusta, Georgia and Steubenville, Ohio to Television Station Partners LP in 1983. Television Station Partners sold WROC-TV, along with the WEYI-TV and WTOV-TV, to Smith Broadcasting in 1996. Nexstar purchased WROC-TV in 1999.Under the stewardship of Television Station Partners, WROC-TV made another switch: On July 1, 1989, after 40 years with NBC, channel 8 swapped network affiliations with WHEC-TV and became a CBS station. This move {{was the result of}} the station's poor performance and constant <b>pre-emptions</b> of NBC network programming (NBC was very intolerant of <b>pre-emptions</b> at this time).|$|R
50|$|As ABC has {{a limited}} sports {{programming}} schedule during the Major League Baseball season prior to September (when the MLB {{regular season and}} college football season overlap), the station mainly carries the team's weekend daytime games in order to limit <b>pre-emptions</b> of the network's prime time programming.|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} stunted by heavy <b>pre-emptions</b> or {{relocation}} to overnight timeslots by ABC affiliates {{which had been}} displeased by the network's previous mid-day lifestyle programming, The Home Show and Mike and Maty, in addition to tough competition from CBS's longtime ratings powerhouse The Price Is Right.|$|R
25|$|By 1832, {{over one}} hundred {{settlers}} had arrived at Naper's Settlement. Following {{the news of the}} Indian Creek massacre during the Black Hawk War, these settlers were temporarily displaced to Fort Dearborn for protection from an anticipated attack by the Sauk tribe. Fort Payne was built at Naper's Settlement, the settlers returned and the attack never materialized. The <b>Pre-Emption</b> House was constructed in 1834, as the Settlement became a stage-coach stop on the road from Chicago to Galena. Reconstructions of Fort Payne and the <b>Pre-Emption</b> House stand as part of Naper Settlement outdoor museum village, which was established by the Naperville Heritage Society and the Naperville Park District in 1969 to preserve some of the community's oldest buildings.|$|E

40|$|National leaders under {{pressure}} are often tempted to consider shifting costs to other {{levels of government}} and to satisfy new demands for public services by passing mandates and costs to other levels of governments to finance new programmes. These new mandates take {{a variety of forms}} but have one central feature: they permit the national government leaders to claim credit without paying for the costs of their own initiatives. This article examines intergovernmental relationships and the various forms of mandates including direct-order mandates, grants, <b>pre-emptions,</b> and tax policy. The article discusses the arguments for mandates, trends in their use, and reforms to curb them.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the major issues for modern embedded systems. Early, power saving approaches mainly focused on dynamic power dissipation, while neglecting the static (leakage) energy consumption. However, technology improvements resulted in a case where static power dissipation increasingly dominates. Addressing this issue, hardware vendors have equipped modern processors with several sleep states. We propose a set of leakage-aware energy management approaches that reduce the energy consumption of embedded real-time systems while respecting the real-time constraints. Our algorithms are based on the race-to-halt strategy that tends to run the system at top speed with an aim to create long idle intervals, which are used to deploy a sleep state. The effectiveness of our algorithms is illustrated with an extensive set of simulations that show an improvement of up to 8 % reduction in energy consumption over existing work at high utilization. The complexity of our algorithms is smaller when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. We also eliminate assumptions made in the related work that restrict the practical application of the respective algorithms. Moreover, a novel study about the relation between the use of sleep intervals and the number of <b>pre-emptions</b> is also presented utilizing a large set of simulation results, where our algorithms reduce the experienced number of <b>pre-emptions</b> in all cases. Our results show that sleep states in general can save up to 30 % of the overall number of <b>pre-emptions</b> when compared to the sleep-agnostic earliest-deadline-first algorithm...|$|R
50|$|Finally, as {{a result}} of <b>pre-emptions</b> {{mounting}} from key affiliates such as KPIX in San Francisco, and an economic recession causing a decline in ad revenues, CBS decided to cancel the serial in 1974 {{and replace it with a}} less-expensive game show, Tattletales. This had also been the reason for the cancellations of Where the Heart Is and Love is a Many Splendored Thing the previous year.|$|R
25|$|Maximising funding {{permitted}} under <b>pre-emption</b> rules. For countries, {{such as the}} UK, where {{companies are}} subject to limits {{on the number of}} shares that can be offered to non-shareholders non-pre-emptively, convertibles can raise more money than via equity issues. Under the UK’s 1989 Guidelines issued by the Investor Protection Committees (IPCs) of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Fund Managers (NAPF), the IPCs will advise their members not to object to non pre-emptive issues which add no more than 5pct to historic non-diluted balance sheet equity in the period from AGM to AGM, and no more than 7.5pct in total over a period of 3 financial years. The <b>pre-emption</b> limits are calculated on the assumption of 100pct probability of conversion, using the figure of undiluted historic balance sheet share capital (where there is assumed a 0pct probability of conversion). There is no attempt to assign probabilities of conversion in both circumstances, which would result in bigger convertible issues being permitted. The reason for his inconsistency may lie {{in the fact that the}} Pre Emption Guidelines were drawn up in 1989, and binomial evaluations were not commonplace amongst professional investors until 1991-92.|$|E
