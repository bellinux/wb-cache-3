50|$|Kuipto Forest {{which was}} the first of many forest {{plantations}} in the Mount Lofty Ranges, established in 1898 to ensure a sustainable timber supply for South Australia. The forest serves as both a community forest and a commercial venture. Kuitpo {{is one of the more}} <b>popular</b> <b>plantation</b> forests; it is regularly frequented by locals and tourists alike, as an escape to nature. It is equipped with many walking trails, and a ForestrySA interpretive centre provides insight into both the forest ecology and the history of Kuipto. The Heysen Trail runs through the forest, popular for any South Australian hiker, as well as being popular for bike rides, camping, picnics and also a great place to go horse riding or foraging for Mushrooms.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the evaluation of the heartwood diameter (dcerne) at breast height on stand trees, for Eucalyptus globulus Labill and the hybrid Populus euramericana. The data used was collected in eucalyptus and <b>popular</b> pure <b>plantations</b> in Central and North Portugal. The non destructive methods tested in the evaluation of heartwood diameter at breast height were [1] visual identification of the heartwood on core samples and [2] indirect estimation using mathematic models. The results allow to consider that visual determination of dcerne is appropriate for Populus, and development of prediction models based diameter at breast height (d), total height (h) and age (t), give better results for eucalyptus...|$|R
50|$|In the {{upstream}} {{reaches of}} the valley, the Asana River {{is one of the}} four major tributaries of the Moquegua (Tumilaca) River, which becomes the Osmore River downstream. It is situated in the south central Andes mountains. The main Asana has its primary source at an elevation of 4800 m. This is within the pampas in the peripheral region of the high puna, defined as an area (Pampa Tinajones and Apachita Limani) above 3800 m elevation. The river's run off source is seasonal precipitation including snow melt from the western cordillera of the Andes. At these high altitudes population was sparse and herding the llama and alpaca was <b>popular.</b> The <b>plantation</b> of potatoes, a frost tolerant crop was widely practiced at these altitudes.|$|R
25|$|After {{analysing}} DNA from collections {{around the}} world, mycologists Jorinde Nuytinck, Annemieke Verbeken, and Steve Miller {{have concluded that}} L.deliciosus is a distinct European species that differs genetically, morphologically, and ecologically from populations in North America or Central America. It has been reportedly introduced to Chile, Australia and New Zealand, where it grows in Pinus radiata <b>plantations.</b> <b>Popular</b> places for collecting this mushroom, especially among the Polish community, are around Macedon in Victoria, and in the Oberon area in New South Wales, Australia, where they can grow {{to the size of}} a dinner plate. Many people of Italian, Polish, Ukrainian and other eastern European ancestry in the states of Victoria and New South Wales, Australia travel to collect these mushrooms after autumn rainfall around Easter time.|$|R
40|$|The {{accelerated}} rate {{of deforestation}} in Nepal {{in the past has}} resulted in severe forest degradation in the country. Fortunately, the fast-growing tree species present in the country have become very <b>popular</b> for their <b>plantation</b> to overcome this problem. One of such fast-growing tree species is sissoo (Dalbergia sissoo, Roxb.). Sissoo is a nitrogen fixing leguminous multipurpose plant spe-cies, occurring along riverbanks in the lowland region of Nepal up to an altitude of 1, 000 m. It is an important reforestation species on the plains (known as Terai). This plant species occurs naturally in the riverine sal (Shorea robusta, Gaertn.) forest. It springs up on land slips and at other places where fresh soil is exposed but avoids stiff clay and waterlogging. It thrives in sandy-loam soils with good drainage. It is a deciduous tree species, growing t...|$|R
2500|$|Couhig {{was born}} in Baptist Hospital in New Orleans to Robert Emmet [...] "Bob" [...] Couhig, Sr. (1916-2014), and the former Marcelle [...] "Nootsie" [...] Reese (1916-1985). The senior Couhig came to New Orleans from Massachusetts after World War II. He {{was hired by the}} Orkin Company to manage two area pest-control offices and became the top {{executive}} of a four-state territory. In that position, he moved the Orkin central office from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. In the mid-1960s, Rollins Environmental Services, Inc., bought Orkin and transferred Couhig to its office in Atlanta, Georgia. After a year-long relocation to Georgia, Couhig left the company and moved his family to St. Francisville in West Feliciana Parish. Bob and Marcelle Couhig were pioneers in the promotion of tourism in both West Feliciana and East Feliciana parishes. In 1962, they opened Fairview Plantation, a restaurant and gift shop in an historic home in West Feliciana Parish. After Fairview burned, they established in 1966 Jackson, Louisiana, Asphodel Village {{as one of the first}} bed and breakfasts in the state. The Couhigs lived in one part of Asphodel Plantation and until the later 1980s operated a restaurant and gift shop in the other part of the house. Marcelle in 1980 published the <b>popular</b> Asphodel <b>Plantation</b> Cookbook with regional specialties. In 1967, the senior Couhig formed his own Couhig Pestaway Company, based in Baton Rouge, which he operated until he was in his middle eighties.|$|R
40|$|First year {{of three}} year plan of Community Empowerment Program through Student Community Services (SCS) of Gadjah Mada University was {{conducted}} in Pinogu Subdistrict, Bone Bolango Regency, Gorontalo Province in 2013. Pinogu is located on top of hill and reserved as the National Park of Bogani Nani Wartabone and this protects some endangered species, such as Tarsiers and Megapodon birds. As the most remote area, Pinogu had not been touched equally by the central government, therefore it was less developed. Pinogu had been <b>popular</b> with coffee <b>plantations</b> since Dutch colonial periods. This plantations was now too old and became forest. This SCS Program was designed to empowered local people for agribusiness including rejuvenate coffee plantation and coffee production and to educate local people to be aware of local biodiversity and understand how to conserve the most endangered species, Tarsiers and Maleo. Twenty one of UGM students from different study programs had been coached and trained priorly by Field Instructure within 3 months with the SCS-thematic programs and leadership; then they were mobilized to Pinogu and stayed for 2 months conducting the program.  Two main programs out of 7 SCS thematic programs were successfully conducted during SCS activity in Pinogu, Bone Bolango Regency. Coffee agribusiness programs from up stream to down stream processes were trained to local community who interested in coffee production twice a week by students and biodiversity conservation was tought to junior high school students. These SCS program achievements were including establishment of anursary, improvement of local people skills in manage coffee plantation, selection of mature seed, seed drying, and good coffee processing, and also establishment of a coffee producing community. Conservation education on local endemic and endangered species—Megapodon birds (M. Maleo) and Tarsiers (T. Spectrum) —to junior high school students was attracting some students who were really interested in learning more about fauna conservation and improve student awareness on endemic and endangered species as the main icon for foreign tourists who visited Bone Bolango. The success of the SCS-UGM programs were contributed by sinergy of university and the local government financial support and students and field instructure commitment...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between hygroscopic properties and chemical characteristics of Indonesian biomass burning (BB) particles, which are dominantly generated from peatland fires, was investigated using a humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer. In addition to peat, acacia (a <b>popular</b> species at <b>plantation)</b> and fern (a pioneering species after disturbance by fire) {{were used for}} experiments. Fresh Indonesian peat burning particles are almost non-hygroscopic (mean hygroscopicity parameter, κ  <  0. 06) due to predominant contribution of water-insoluble organics. The range of κ spans from 0. 02 to 0. 04 (dry diameter =  100  nm, hereinafter) for Riau peat burning particles, while that for Central Kalimantan ranges from 0. 05 to 0. 06. Fern combustion particles are more hygroscopic (κ  =  0. [*] 08), whereas the acacia burning particles have a mediate κ value (0. 04). These results suggest that κ is significantly dependent on biomass types. This variance in κ is partially determined by fractions of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), as demonstrated by a correlation analysis (R  =  0. 65). κ of water-soluble organic matter is also quantified, incorporating the 1 -octanol–water partitioning method. κ values for the water extracts are high, especially for peat burning particles (A 0 (a whole part of the water-soluble fraction) : κ  =  0. 18, A 1 (highly water-soluble fraction) : κ [*]=[*] 0. 30). This result {{stresses the importance of}} both the WSOC fraction and κ of the water-soluble fraction in determining the hygroscopicity of organic aerosol particles. Values of κ correlate positively (R  =  0. 89) with the fraction of m ∕ z   44 ion signal quantified using a mass spectrometric technique, demonstrating the importance of highly oxygenated organic compounds to the water uptake by Indonesian BB particles. These results provide an experimentally validated reference for hygroscopicity of organics-dominated particles, thus contributing to more accurate estimation of environmental and climatic impacts driven by Indonesian BB particles on both regional and global scales...|$|R
50|$|The Tungabhadra {{river was}} the {{lifeline}} of the capital. Many elaborate and clever canals and Anecut stored and channelled {{water to the}} capital. These canals also lead to the cultivable areas in the fortified city and outside. The features were so advanced {{that many of the}} ideas were maintained by the Tungabhadra river authority during their projects in the 1950s. The core area urban communities depended on private tanks, communal tanks and bore wells for water. The royal enclosures had the most sophisticated water distribution and recirculation systems. The main water supply to the royal enclosure came from Kamlapuram. Water pipes sealed in brick and lime plaster were used. Water conservation and recirculation had gained importance in these dry areas. Large tanks providing water for irrigation were called Anecut or Bund. There were several irrigated areas within the fortified city making the fortress very self-sufficient and capable of withstanding long sieges. In the empire, {{the majority of the people}} were involved in agriculture growing rice, wheat, ragi, cotton, sugarcane and pulses which were <b>popular.</b> There were <b>plantations</b> growing coconut, Areca and Betel. Portuguese influence brought the growth of onion, tobacco and ground nut into practice.Many large tanks called Bukkasamudram, Vyasasamudram, Krishnarayasagara, Sadashivasagara, Maiviru Magada, Kamalapurasagara, Rayavakaluve, Basavanakaluve were constructed.many people adopted many religions. there are variety of religious structures i.e. stupas monasteries and temples.Industries that prospered were cotton textiles, weaving, carpentry, coir work, sculpting, stone quarrying etc. The prolific temple construction activities undertaken provided employment for thousands. Major exports were jaggery, limestone, textiles, salt, sugar, spices from Malnad, iron ore from Kudremukh, gold from Kolar, Hatti and Raichur, diamonds from Telangana area and rice. Major imports were horses from Persia, artillery and cannons, copper, coral, mercury and salt peter from Europe. While ports were humming on both the western and eastern shores, the most important ports were Mangalore, Barkur, Bhatkal, Honavar from where the empire traded with the Europeans and Persians.|$|R
