500|$|Advertisements {{are used}} to attract {{customers}} to a business’ <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> doing so, they are also making statements regarding race, social class, gender, values, and [...] family. They not only describe these social categories, they prescribe behaviors or show one {{how it is that}} they should act in accordance with social ideals or norms. According to Belk and Pollay, “not only do [...] show us the ideal life, they instruct us [...] how to live.” Through targeting specific groups of people for products and services, advertisements both reflect changes of social norms and are changers of social norms regarding acceptable behavior. Some argue that the image of family only plays a symbolic role by reflecting the current cultural values. Advertisements may not only reflect changes in social norms, but also be asserting that such behavior is acceptable. As a result, sociologists have challenged the public to study ads containing images of the family not just as marketing messages but also as vehicles for behavior and attitudes towards society.|$|E
