40|$|Background: Childhood <b>pyogenic</b> septic <b>arthritis</b> and its {{associated}} musculoskeletal morbidity is an important health concern in developing countries. Its pattern of presentation that varies from and within subregions has implications on the early recognition, treatment, and outcome. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the pattern and outcome of childhood septic arthritis in our environment. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of all the children seen with <b>pyogenic</b> septic <b>arthritis</b> in Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki between January 2005 and December 2015. Results: Childhood septic arthritis accounted for 44 (83 %) of the 53 patients seen with <b>pyogenic</b> septic <b>arthritis.</b> Female to male ratio was 1 : 1. 75 and the mean age was 5. 7 ± 0. 73 years. Eight patients (18. 2 %) had polyarticular involvements. The right shoulder was significantly more involved than the left and the left hip more than right. Overall, there was a preponderance of onset of symptoms in the dry season. Children from the rural areas accounted for 85. 7 % of those with the onset of symptom in rainy season. Delayed presentation> 6 days (in 68. 2 % of patients) was related to age (P < 0. 042), and health seeking behavior (P < 0. 036). Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest causative organism. Seventy-seven percent (77 %) underwent open arthrotomy. Anemia, septic shock, and joint stiffness were three top complications observed. Mortality rate was 2. 3 %, and cause of death was overwhelming sepsis. Conclusion: In our setting, <b>pyogenic</b> septic <b>arthritis</b> is predominantly a childhood health problem and children under 5 years of age are the most vulnerable. Delayed presentation, an important factor in morbidity and mortality associated with septic arthritis was common among the patients, calls for a public enlightenment program on the importance of early presentation...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{describe}} a family from New Zealand with the <b>pyogenic</b> <b>arthritis,</b> pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome, an autoinflammatory, variably expressed, erosive destructive form of arthritis. Methods. Information was gained through medical records and interviews {{of the affected}} patients and wider family. DNA sequencing was performed at Seay Center for Musculoskeletal Research Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children. Results. Five patients were affected over three generations with an E 250 Q mutation found on the CD 2 BP 1 gene on chromosome 15. Common features included a severe, pauciarticular-onset, destructive peripheral arthritis, beginning at ages 5, 5, 2, 3 and 1 years. This combination marked cervical ankylosis (in two members), micrognathia and a more severe phenotype is unique. A third-generation family member treated early with DMARDs is following a less severe course. The skin involvement was variable, all with degrees of acne from puberty, though only one patient displayed pyoderma gangrenosum. A clear pattern of the arthritis switching off in adolescence and the triggering of skin disease was observed. Conclusions. Differing degrees of joint destruction, and cervical ankylosis in this family with the E 250 Q mutation demonstrate PAPA syndrome’s variable expression. Further understanding of this rare condition and its pathway may allow better targeting of treatments, not just for families with this specific syndrome but also for other, more common, forms of arthritis.

Some of those names are bilateral clavicular osteomyelitis with palmar and plantar pustulosis, inter-sterno-costo-clavicular ossification, subacute and chronic symmetric osteomyelitis, arthro-osteitis associated with a follicular occlusive triad, sternoclavicular hyperostosis, nonbacterial osteitis, pustulotic arthro-osteitis, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), Koehler’s disease, <b>pyogenic</b> sterile <b>arthritis,</b> acquired hyperostosis syndrome, or spondyloarthritis hyperostotica pustulo-psoriatica [1, 2, 3, 4].

40|$|PSTPIP 1 is a cytoskeleton-associated adaptor {{protein that}} links PEST-type phosphatases to their substrates. Mutations in PSTPIP 1 cause PAPA {{syndrome}} (<b>Pyogenic</b> sterile <b>Arthritis,</b> Pyoderma gangrenosum, and Acne), an autoinflammatory disease. PSTPIP 1 binds to pyrin and mutations in pyrin result in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a related autoinflammatory disorder. Since disease-associated mutations in PSTPIP 1 enhance pyrin binding, PAPA syndrome and FMF {{are thought to}} share a common pathoetiology. The studies outlined here describe several new aspects of PSTPIP 1 and pyrin biology. We document that PSTPIP 1, which has homology to membrane-deforming BAR proteins, forms homodimers and generates membrane-associated filaments in native and transfected cells. An extended FCH (Fes-Cip 4 homology) domain in PSTPIP 1 is necessary and sufficient for its self-aggregation. We further show that the PSTPIP 1 filament network is dependent upon an intact tubulin cytoskeleton and that the distribution of this network can be modulated by pyrin, indicating {{that this is a}} dynamic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that pyrin can recruit PSTPIP 1 into aggregations (specks) of ASC, another pyrin binding protein. ASC specks are associated with inflammasome activity.

Materials Our case series includes 9 patients (seven males and two females) with {{the mean age}} of 34 years (13 - 56 years). Five patients had trauma, two had <b>pyogenic</b> <b>arthritis,</b> one had tuberculous arthritis, and one had <b>pyogenic</b> <b>arthritis</b> following surgical fixation. Results The average duration of follow up is 65 months (45 months- 80 months). The mean Mayo's elbow performance score (MEPS) preoperatively was 48 (35 - 70). The MEPS at final follow up was 80 (60 - 95). With no movement at elbow and fixed in various degrees of either flexion or extension preoperatively, the mean preoperative position of elbow was 64 °(30 °to 100 °). The mean post operative range of motion at final follow up was 27 °of extension (20 - 50 0), 116 °of flexion (110 0 - 130 0), and the arc of motion was 88 °(80 0 - 100 0).

Recurring inflammatory episodes lead to accumulation of sterile, pyogenic, neutrophil-rich material within the affected joints, ultimately resulting in significant destruction. We recently localized the genes for PAPA syndrome and FRA to chromosome 15 q {{and suggested that}} they are the same disorder. We have now established this by the identification of co-segregating disease-causing mutations in the CD 2 -binding protein 1 (CD 2 BP 1; GenBank accession no XM 044569) gene in the two reported families with this disorder. E 250 Q or A 230 T amino acid substitutions occur within a domain highly homologous to yeast cleavage furrow-associated protein CDC 15. CD 2 BP 1 and its murine ortholog, proline–serine–threonine phosphatase interacting protein (PSTPIP 1), are adaptor proteins known to interact with PEST-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrate severely reduced binding between PTP PEST and both the E 250 Q and A 230 T mutant proteins. Previous evidence supports the integral role of CD 2 BP 1 and its interacting proteins in actin reorganization during cytoskeletal-mediated events.

The novel PSTPIP 1 -R 405 C mutant induces filopodia formation, increases matrix degradation, and is associated with severe pyoderma gangrenosum. PSTPIP 1 is a cytoskeletal adaptor and F-BAR protein that has been implicated in autoinflammatory disease, most notably in the PAPA syndrome: <b>pyogenic</b> sterile <b>arthritis,</b> pyodermagangrenosum, and acne. However, themechanismbywhichPSTPIP 1 regulates the actin cytoskeleton and contributes to disease pathogenesis remains elusive.

We identify a novel PSTPIP 1 -R 405 C mutation in a patient presenting with aggressive pyoderma gangrenosum. Identification of this mutation reveals that PSTPIP 1 regulates the balance of podosomes and filopodia in macrophages. The PSTPIP 1 -R 405 C mutation is in the SRC homology 3 (SH 3) domain and impairs Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) binding, {{but it does not}} affect interaction with protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) -PEST. Accordingly, WASP inhibi-tion reverses the elevated F-actin content, filopodia formation, and matrix degradation induced by PSTPIP 1 -R 405 C.

40|$|The {{patients}} with acute leukemia occasionally present with musculoskeletal symptoms initially, including bone pain, joint pain, muscular pain, and functional impairment. Without abnormal findings of {{peripheral blood cell}} counts or smear, the correct diagnosis tends to be delayed. Magnetic resonance imaging is often performed to examine musculoskeletal abnormalities; it can simultaneously reveal the bone marrow composition with high anatomical resolution and excellent soft tissue contrast. We present 4 pediatric patients who were initially diagnosed with acute <b>pyogenic</b> osteomyelitis or <b>arthritis,</b> based on the elevated {{white blood cell counts}} and/or C-reactive protein in addition to the localized high signal intensity on T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance images. Finally, they were diagnosed with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia by bone marrow examination. The period between the onset of musculoskeletal symptoms and the diagnosis of leukemia ranged from 20 days to 6 months. In all cases, the T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance images taken prior to detection of peripheral blood abnormality revealed diffuse low signal intensity of the bone marrow in regions adjacent or contralateral to localized musculoskeletal symptoms. These findings should raise the suspicion of leukemia even without abnormalities in peripheral blood...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy, radiculopathy and myeloradiculopathy can {{be managed}} by laminoforaminotomy, or {{bilateral}} decompression using posterior approach in single or multilevel compression. Posterior endoscopic techniques allow preservation of motion segment and neural decompression without fusion. Materials and Methods: A prospective study of 50 patients of cervical compressive myelopathy with primarily posterior lesion or multilevel anterior compression with acceptable preoperative lordosis was undertaken. Any instability, significant anterior compression, and cervical myelopathy secondary to tumor, trauma, severe ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament, rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> <b>pyogenic</b> spondylitis, and destructive spondylo-arthropathy {{were excluded from the}} study. There were 5, 23, 12, 10 patients with 2, 3, 4, 5 vertebral body level pathologies, respectively. Results: There were 2, 4, 7, 32, and 5 patients in preoperative Nurick grade 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively with an average of 2. 6 grades. All the patients improved in post-operative grading with 10, 34, and 6 patients in 0, 1, and 2 grades (average 0. 92), respectively. Better outcome was observed in patients with good preoperative grade and in short segment compression on cord. There was no change in cervical Cobb angle after surgery. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 24 months (averages 19 months). There was small dural tear, minor bleeding from muscles or epidural vessels and temporary C 5 root injury in 1, 3, and 2 patients, respectively. Conclusion: Endoscopic decompression of cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a safe and an effective alternative treatment option in selected patients when pathologic changes are primarily posterior or multi level anterior lesions with acceptable preoperative lordosis...|$|R
40|$|Autoinflammatory {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} disorders characterized by recurrent unprovoked inflammatory events in absence of autoantibodies or autoreatcive T cells. At least eight forms are well characterized: 1) Familial Mediteranean Fever (FMF), 2) hypergammaglobulinemia D with periodic fever (HIDS), 3) tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), 4) Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), 5) familial cold autoinflammatroy syndrome (FCAS), 6) chronica infantile neurologic cutaneous articular (CINCA) syndrome, 7) <b>Pyogenic</b> sterile <b>Arthritis,</b> Pyoderma gangrenosum and Acne syndrome (PAPA) and 8) Blau syndrome. Recently also Schnitzler and SAPHO (Synovitis Acne Pustolosis Hyperostosis Osteitis) syndromes {{have been added to}} the list. With the exception of FMF these disorders are rare. In many of these diseases there is a fundamental alteration in the IL- 1 (FCAS, MWS, CINCA, HIDS, FMF, PAPA) or TNF pathway (TRAP). Recent advances in molecular genetics of FACS, MWS and CINCA have led to the identification of the likely cause of deregulated IL- 1 secretion. Processing and release of IL- 1  occur in a macromolecular complex termed inflammasome which includes the proteins the proteins ASC, NALP 3, Caspase- 1 and Cardinal. The mechanism of inflammasome activation is obscure. However, it is well known that extracellular ATP is the most potent physiological activator so far identified. Extracellular ATP-mediated activation of caspase- 1 occurs via a receptor named P 2 X 7 (P 2 X 7 R). Mice deficient of constituents of the inflammasome (es ASC) are unresponsive to P 2 X 7 R-mediated stimulation but molecular link between P 2 X 7 R and inflammasome has not been elucidated. Here we have investigated the role of the P 2 X 7 R and of the inflammasome components ASC and NALP 3 in the pathogenesis of Schnitzler and SAPHO syndromes. The results show that PBMCs from Schnitzler patients present a defective pathway of IL- 1 ß processing and secretion which allows substantial IL- 1 ß release also in the absence of the “second hit” usually required. Therapies aimed at normalizing inflammasome function might help to correct the unbalanced IL- 1 ß secretion typical of this syndrome. In the SAPHO patient a deregulation of the extracellular ATP-dependent P 2 X 7 -IL- 1 ß axis is suggested, that prompted to begin treatment with the interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) anakinra (100 mg/day). The blockade of IL- 1 signalling had a sustained effect, with remission of signs and symptoms and normalization of acute phase markers. The dosage of anakinra was then gradually reduced and the patient is still symptom-free. In any case, since a positive response to anti-TNFα agents has also been observed, the precise pathogenetic role of IL- 1 β and TNFα is a matter for further investigations...|$|R
