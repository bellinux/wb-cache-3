50|$|The {{initial cost}} of using ICFs rather than {{conventional}} construction techniques {{is sensitive to}} the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and labor, but building using ICF can generally add 3 to 5 percent to the total purchase price over building using wood frame.

Above grade, ICF construction is typically more expensive, but when adding large openings, ICF construction becomes very cost effective. Large openings in conventional construction require large headers and supporting posts, whereas ICF construction reduces the cost, as only reinforcing steel is needed directly around the opening.|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{exchange}} rate have direct and indirect effects on the prices of domestically produced goods and imports in the domestic market. The direct effects originate {{with the impact of}} {{the exchange}} rate on the marginal cost of imports; the indirect effects, with its impact on the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> used by domestic producers and hence on their marginal costs. Direct and indirect exchange rate pass-through elasticities are estimated for 37 Canadian manufacturing industries and their determinants are examined in a cross-section analysis. It is found that the direct and indirect elasticities are approximately equal in size for domestic goods, while the direct effect is dominant for imports. For a small number of industries, the net result of the direct and indirect effects is that a depreciation of the domestic currency increases the competitiveness of imports, contrary to conventional analysis. Important determinants of the direct (indirect) elasticities are the import share and non-tariff barriers (the responsiveness of domestic costs to changes {{in the exchange}} rate, and concentration). ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the production structure of the sawmilling industry of the Lake States (Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin) {{in order to determine}} elasticities of substitution and elasticities of demand. A homogeneous translog cost function was estimated using pooled time-series data for the period 1963 - 1996 with inputs labor, materials and capital. Based on the model selection process, the estimated model imposes constant returns to scale and allows for nonunitary elasticities of substitution amongst the inputs. The hypothesis of constant returns to scale could not be rejected at the 1 % level. This was common for studies of the sawmill industry but seems particularly common to regions where the industry was made up primarily of small mills. Constant returns to scale in a mature sawmill industry would lead to the outcome of mills of similar size as all economies of scale have been exhausted and the industry has settled into an equilibrium firm size near the minimum of the long run average cost curve. Nevertheless, this does not explain why the average mill size in the Lake States is small compared to the Pacific Northwest and Southeastern U. S. Results for the Allen Partial Elasticity of Substitution (AES) indicate that labor and materials were inelastic substitutes with an elasticity of 0. 76 while labor and capital were elastic complements with an elasticity of - 1. 38. Materials and capital were also inelastic substitutes and had an elasticity of substitution of 0. 80. The labor/materials elasticity of substitution is high compared to almost all studies of softwood lumber producing regions. The Morishima Elasticity of Substitution (MES) results indicate that labor/materials, materials/labor, materials/capital, capital/materials and labor/capital were inelastic substitutes with the greatest substitutability between labor/materials. The MES for capital/labor was - 0. 017 indicating a complementary relationship. The own-price elasticities of demand were all inelastic and negative indicating downward sloping demand curves. All other elasticities were inelastic and indicate that materials was a substitute for labor and capital but labor and capital were complements. Changes in the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> had a relatively large, but inelastic, effect on the demand for capital with a cross-price elasticity of 0. 51. Changes in the price of labor also had a relatively large effect on the demand for capital, but in a complementary fashion, with an elasticity of - 0. 44.

METHODS: A retrospective evaluation conducted in the Costs Section of the University Hospital of Ribeirão Preto, of the costs involved in the perioperative period for patients submitted to bariatric surgery from 2004 to 2007. Changes in the routines and protocols of the service aiming at the reduction of these costs {{during the study period}} were also analyzed. RESULTS: Nine patients in 2004 and seven in 2007 submitted to conventional vertical banded "Roux-en-Y" gastric bypass were studied. All patients presented good postoperative evolution. The average cost with these patients was R$ 6, 845. 17 in 2004.

All-encompassing analyses of cost and performance, such as total cost of ownership, are extraordinarily difficult to implement because they are demanding in terms of time, data and cooperation. We study monetary quantification of points of difference, which enables an NPD team to base its decisions instead on more focused, strategically-pertinent analyses of costs and performance. We propose a substantive model of its antecedents and consequences. We then test this model with data from matched samples of 144 project leaders and 144 cost analysts who participated in the same NPD projects. Using structural equation modeling, we also test hypothesized differences in perspectives between project leaders and cost analysts. Results demonstrate the pivotal role of monetary quantification of points of difference among the sourcing alternatives being considered, especially for cost analysts.
