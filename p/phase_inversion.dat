25|$|The kinetic {{process of}} destabilisation can be rather long (up to several {{months or even}} years for some products) and it is often {{required}} for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of <b>phase</b> <b>inversion</b> or chemical degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.|$|E
500|$|... "I Care" [...] {{comprised}} 75 {{tracks in}} total: 35 {{for the music}} and 40 for the vocals. According to Swivel, the main challenge in mixing [...] "I Care" [...] was hand‑aligning every single drum shot as it was time-consuming. He said, [...] "It's super‑monotonous, but it's the best way I can do it. If you Beat Detective the drums to the grid, it's never perfect." [...] As the layering of the drums had to be right on the millisecond, Swivel did one kick and snare at a time. This helped him ensure that the kicks line up with the programmed drums, hence preventing any <b>phase</b> <b>inversion.</b> Accordingly, each drum punched through as strongly as the last. The inspiration for the main drum sound on [...] "I Care" [...] came to Swivel at around four {{o'clock in the morning}} during a mixing session. He took a large plate sound from Avid’s D‑Verb plug‑in, rolled the high frequencies off at 8.6kHz, and sent it through an SSL channel strip with a gate on it, setting the release time to 0.6 seconds. He said, [...] "It's a really basic plug‑in, and I used a very 80s‑sounding gated reverb." ...|$|E

40|$|The search {{problem is}} to find a state {{satisfying}} certain properties out of a given set. Grover's algorithm drives a quantum computer from a prepared initial state to the target state and solves the problem quadratically faster than a classical computer. The algorithm uses selective transformations to distinguish the initial state and target state from other states. It does not succeed unless the selective transformations are very close to <b>phase</b> <b>inversions.</b> Here we show a way to go beyond this limitation. An important application lies in quantum error correction, where the errors can cause the selective transformations to deviate from <b>phase</b> <b>inversions.</b> The algorithms presented here are robust to errors as long as the errors are reproducible and reversible.

5000|$|As {{is typical}} with the Dumble brand, the SSS (Steel String Singer) can vary {{drastically}} from serial number to serial number. For example, The first SSS (made for Henry Kaiser) {{has a built-in}} vibrato circuit. Also, despite its reputation as a [...] "clean machine", the earlier SSS (and possibly #7) would break up when their input gain was turned up or pushed by a loud input signal. The earlier versions also had more complicated <b>phase</b> <b>inversion</b> techniques pioneered by vintage hi fidelity amplifiers, and Fender style transformers. Starting with #4, the <b>Phase</b> <b>Inversion</b> was simplified, and the amp was given more negative feedback which cleaned up the signal even further. These updates significantly changed the sound and feel of the circuit, and became standard to the SSS model from #4 and on. The sound the Steel String Singer is most known for is a [...] "clean feedback" [...] effect - where the amplifier will feedback, even though the signal is audibly clean. This is most notably apparent with the later SSS models, though a balance of factors contribute to this unique response, and the earlier versions {{as well as other}} Dumble amplifiers reportedly imitate this effect under certain conditions.|$|E
