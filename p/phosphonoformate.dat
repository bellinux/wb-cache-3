The synergistic effect was more pronounced with increasing concentrations and was not secondary to toxic effects of the drugs. 3 '-Azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine neither inhibited the replication of human cytomegalovirus in human embryonic lung fibroblasts nor interfered with the anticytomegalovirus effect of <b>phosphonoformate.</b> By using partially purified reverse transcriptase of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase, various combinations of 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine- 5 '-triphosphate and <b>phosphonoformate</b> produced strong indications of additive interactions.

40|$|AIDS {{dementia}} {{complex is}} a common neurological syndrome thought to result from {{the invasion of the}} CNS by HIV. <b>Phosphonoformate</b> has anti-HIV activity but due to its charged nature is excluded from the CNS by the blood-brain barrier. Lipophilic triesters of <b>phosphonoformate</b> designed to improve transport properties are unsuitable prodrugs due to their rapid and complicated hydrolysis, involving competitive P-O and P-C bond cleavage. Diesters, though hydrolytically stable, are considered too polar to passively diffuse into the CNS. Hydrophilic drugs mimicking endogenous nutrients are known to be actively transported across the blood-brain barrier. In this thesis the possibility that diesters of <b>phosphonoformate</b> may be actively transported is investigated. Triesters of <b>phosphonoformate</b> with labile aryl carboxyl esterrs were synthesised and their hydrolysis followed by 31 P NMR spectroscopy. The triesters were found to undergo rapid hydrolysis via P-C bond cleavage to the phosphite. <b>Phosphonoformate</b> diesters designed to be analogues of actively transported -keto acids have been synthesised and fully characterised. Tyrosine-phosphonoformate and lipid-phosphonoformate conjugates have also been synthesised and characterised. An in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier utilising confluent monolayers of porcine brain microvessel endothelial cells grown on a permeable support has been established. The presence of enzyme and antigen markers specific to the blood-brain barrier has been demonstrated for the endothelial cells and the diffusional properties of the model investigated with hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. Active transport systems for -keto acids and large amino acids have been identified in the endothelial cell monolayers using 14 C-pyruvate and 3 H-L-tyrosine respectively. Temperature and concentration dependence of the two systems have been demonstrated and transport constants calculated. Competition with 14 C-pyruvate transport was shown with other monocarboxylic acids including the anti-epileptic drug valproate. Stereospecificity was shown in that L-lactate inhibited pyruvate transport while D-lactate did not. Sodium methyl methoxycarbonylphosphonate, a <b>phosphonoformate</b> diester was shown not to compete for 14 C-pyruvate transport indicating that this compound has no affinity for the carrier. Competition with 3 H-L-tyrosine transport was shown with other large amino acids, including the anti-Parkinsonian agent L-dopa. Stereospecificity was shown using L- and D-tyrosine and L- and D-dopa. The tyrosine-phosphonoformate conjugate, which was stable under the experimental conditions, was shown to compete with 3 H-Ltyrosine transport indicating that it may be actively transported at the blood-brain barrier.

40|$|<b>Phosphonoformate</b> and phosphonoacetate are {{effective}} antiviral agents, however they are charged at physiological pH {{and as such}} penetration into cells and diffusion across the blood-brain bamer is limited. In an attempt to increase the lipophilicity and improve the transport properties of these molecules, prodrugs were synthesised and their stabilities and reconversion to the parent compound subsequently investigated by the techniques of 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high performance liquid Chromatography. A series of 4 -substituted dibenzyl (methoxycarbonyl) phosphonates were prepared and found to be hydrolytically unstable giving predominantly the diesters, benzyl (methoxycarbonyl) phosphonates. This instability arose from the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group promoting nucleophilic attack at phosphorus. It was possible to influence the mechanism and, to some extent, the rate of hydrolysis of the <b>phosphonoformate</b> triesters to the diesters by varying the electronic nature of the substituent in the 4 -position of the aromatic ring. Strongly electron-withdrawing groups increased the sensitivity of phosphorus to nucleophilic attack, thus promoting P-O. bond cleavage and rapid hydrolysis. Conversely, weakly electron-withdrawing substituents encouraged C-O bond fission, presumably through resonance stabilisation of the benzyl carbonium ion. The loss of the protecting group on phosphorus was in competition with nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl group, resulting in P-C bond cleavage with dibenzyl phosphite formation. The high instability and P-C bond fission make triesters unsuitable prodrug forms of <b>phosphonoformate.</b> A range of chemically stable triesters of phosphonoacetate were synthesised and their bioactivation investigated. Di(benzoyloxymethyl) (methoxycarbonylmethyl) phosphonates degraded to the relevant benzoyloxymethyl (methoxycarbonylmethyl) phosphonate {{in the presence of}} esterase. The enzymatic activation was restricted to the removal of only one protecting group from phosphorus, most likely due to the close proximity of the benzoyloxy ester function to the anionic charge on the diester. However, in similar systems di(4 -alkanoyloxybenzyl) (methoxycarbonylmethyl) phosphonates degraded in the presence of esterase with the loss of both protecting groups on phosphorus to give the monoester, (methoxycarbonylmethyl) phosphonate, via the intermediary of the unstable 4 -hydroxy benzyl esters. The methoxycarbonyl function remained intact. The rate of enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent removal of the protecting groups on phosphorus was dependent {{on the nature of the}} alkanoyl group and was most rapid for the 4 -nbutanoyloxybenzyl and 4 -iso-butanoyloxybenzyl esters of phosphonoacetate.

40|$|A double blind, placebo {{controlled}} {{trial was}} performed in nine sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinics in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to investigate the efficacy of trisodium <b>phosphonoformate</b> (foscarnet) cream in treating recurrent genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The study group comprised 145 male and 85 female patients. Men received 0. 3 % foscarnet cream and women 1 % foscarnet cream for five days. The difference in time to healing between patients receiving foscarnet or placebo was not significant. Fewer patients treated with foscarnet had positive viral cultures after treatment, but {{the difference was not}} significant. The development of new lesions, however, was significantly less common in patients given foscarnet. Though topical foscarnet is a safe drug, no appreciable efficacy in treating recurrent genital HSV infection could be shown...|$|E
40|$|A micromethod for the {{specific}} measurement of hepatitis B viral DNA polymerase in serum is presented, based on the <b>phosphonoformate</b> inhibition assay (J Med Virol 12 : 61 - 70, 1983). In the micromethod, sample volume is reduced to 120 L and the ultracentrifugation step is eliminated. The method allows good discriminationbetween serum infected with hepatitis B virus and uninfected serum. The cutoff value for rate of nucleotide incorporation, based on assays of 41 serum specimens negative for hepatitis B serological mark-ers, was about 15 nU/L (90 th percentile). Serum containing hepatitis B surface and e antigens exhibited rates of phos-phonoformate-inhibitive nucleotide incorporation of 150 (SD 150) nU/L,withan upper 90 th percentilerange of 17 to 667 nU/L (n = 41). The micromethod makes use of commercially available[32 P]dCTP (specificactivity about 7000 kCi/mol) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phosphonoformate</b> (PFA) {{inhibits}} multiplication of {{visna virus}} in sheep choroid plexus cells; a 50 % reduction of virus yield {{was obtained by}} 20 to 80 microM PFA. Morphological changes, such as syncytial formation and cell degeneration, could be reversibly prevented by PFA. Cell growth was not significantly affected at 500 microM PFA, although prolonged treatment with 2 mM PFA did arrest cell growth. Cell-free reverse transcriptase activity primed with various synthetic template-primers was inhibited about 90 % {{in the presence of}} 100 microM PFA. The results from kinetic experiments suggested that reverse transcriptase was utilized early but not late in the infection cycle. A structurally related substance, phosphonoacetate, did not inhibit visna virus multiplication and had no inhibitory effect on reverse transcriptase activity at a concentration of 500 microM...|$|E
40|$|Mutants of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1, {{resistant}} to <b>phosphonoformate</b> (PFA) and phosphonoacetate (PAA), have been selected in cell culture. The PFA-resistant mutant (HSV-PFAr) and the PAA-resistant mutant (HSV-PAAr) were also resistant to PAA and PFA, respectively. This cross-resistance indicates that PFA and PAA interact at the same site. The HSV-PFAr had a decreased susceptibility to vidarabine, but no difference in sensitivity to idoxuridine (5 -iodo- 2 â²-deoxyuridine) was observed {{when compared to the}} wild type. The induced deoxyribonucleic acid polymerases isolated from cells infected with HSV-PFAr and HSV-PAAr were both cross-resistant to inhibition by PFA and PAA. No increased resistance to vidarabine triphosphate could be observed, but the susceptibility to inhibition by pyrophosphate was about two times lower. None of the mutants showed any increased temperature sensitivit...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{trisodium}} salt of phosphonoformic acid (PFA), foscarnet, is an analogue of pyrophosphate that inhibits a {{broad spectrum}} of viruses. A long-recognized limitation of foscarnet has been its very low oral bioavailability, which is due to the ionization of PFA at physiological pH. As a result, in the clinic it can only be administered intravenously. Many prodrug approaches have been investigated to circumvent the issues associated with the bioavailability and permeability of <b>phosphonoformate.</b> Here, we report the synthesis of a series of novel PFA prodrugs, created by incorporation of toxicologically benign amino acids or small peptides to abate the anionic state of the drug. In this work, conjugates of PFA monosalts were esterified by the alcohol side-chain group of serine using Mitsunobu chemistry to create the P-O-C link. These amino acid conjugates are potential substrates for human intestinal peptide transporter (hPepT 1) ...|$|E
