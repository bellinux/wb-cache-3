50|$|The {{way it was}} {{prepared}} {{is related to the}} way houses used to be built in western Finland, that is with the <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> separate from the heating oven. In eastern Finland, where the oven used to be heated every day, it was more common to eat freshly baked bread and to cook various kinds of long-stewed oven foods like the Karelian hot pot.|$|R
50|$|At Tell Hassuna, adobe {{dwellings}} {{built around}} open central courts with fine painted pottery replace earlier levels with crude pottery. Hand axes, sickles, grinding stones, bins, <b>baking</b> <b>ovens</b> and numerous bones of domesticated animals reflect settled agricultural life. Female figurines have {{been related to}} worship and jar burials within which food was placed related to belief in afterlife. The relationship of Hassuna pottery to that of Jericho suggests that village culture was becoming widespread.|$|R
50|$|Eld=fire, huset=the house. This {{building}} is the farm's bakehouse, {{and has a}} wood fired traditional flat top <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> and chimney, although its location, right among the other farm buildings, makes it unlikely that {{it was meant to}} be used as a bakehouse when it was moved to this location.

5000|$|The {{original}} occupations of {{the first}} inhabitants are represented by the buildings now within the museum. Some were building trades, such as carpenters and a stonemason, and probably built their own properties. The plot would be fenced in and a simple cottage with a stove and <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> built. Other buildings might be provided for domestic animals. In time, the buildings would expand {{around the perimeter of}} the plot, enclosing a courtyard.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{processes}} {{which are}} {{taking place in the}} dough during bread baking are influenced first of all by the temperature evolution. The experimental study presented in this paper shows the fact that temperature grows from a fermentation point (~ 32, 3 0 C) to a baking value (~ 98 0 C) in approximate 15 minutes and after this the temperature evolution maintained constant. The studies were realized for a <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> with annular tubes heated with gas...|$|R
50|$|The job may be {{delivered}} to the coating booth or hangers in any fashion, most commonly using either hands or pliers. After passing through the booth, or tank, and getting coated, the workpiece then either goes into a <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> or {{out into the open}} air to allow the paint to cure on the part. In spray coating, many different spray nozzles may be used depending on the desired paint consistency and the shape of the workpiece.|$|R

On the east wall is an early 19th-century cooking fireplace and <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> with wooden Federal style mantel. The oven is behind two wooden doors. The doors have narrow casings with beaded Federal style backbands. There is a small pantry in the northeast corner. The woodshed, on the east, has an earthen floor below the kitchen's floor level.|$|R
25|$|When cooking over a campfire, it is {{possible}} to use old-style lipped cast-iron Dutch <b>ovens</b> as true <b>baking</b> <b>ovens,</b> to prepare biscuits, cakes, breads, pizzas, and even pies. A smaller baking pan can be placed inside the ovens, used and replaced with another as the first batch is completed. It is also possible to stack Dutch ovens on top of each other, conserving the heat that would normally rise from the hot coals on the top. These stacks can be as high as 5 or 6 pots.|$|R

25|$|Barbecuing {{encompasses}} {{four or five}} distinct {{types of}} cooking techniques. The original technique is cooking using smoke at low temperatures—usually around 240–280°F or 115–145°C—and significantly longer cooking times (several hours), known as smoking. Another technique, known as baking, used a masonry <b>oven</b> or <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> that uses convection to cook meats and starches with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time of about an hour. Braising combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a ribbed surface with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Using this technique, cooking occurs at various speeds, starting fast, slowing down, then speeding up again, lasting for a few hours.|$|R
30|$|Assembled FePt {{nanoparticles}} on the HF-treated n-Si (100) substrates (1.0 [*]×[*] 1.0  cm 2) {{were prepared}} by dropping {{a drop of}} FePt solution (FePt nanoparticles dispersed in octane with concentration of 2  mg/mL). The FePt nanoparticle films were first dried at room temperature and then heated to 120  °C for 2  h in a <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> to remove organic solvent completely. In situ external magnetic field was applied during the drop-coating process to form FePt nanoparticle films on Si, as illustrated in Fig.  1 b. Two SmCo permanent magnets were placed horizontally to produce a magnetic field by inserting 1 -cm-high plastic spacer.|$|R
50|$|Four main {{models of}} AGA are {{currently}} in production: two-, three-, four- and five-oven versions, with the four- and five-oven versions wider than the others. The two-oven model has three doors behind which are the burner, roasting oven and simmering oven. The newer three-oven model also includes a <b>baking</b> <b>oven,</b> the four-oven version also has a warming oven and warming plate on the top, and the five-oven has an additional slow-cooking oven. All models have two hotplates — a boiling plate and a simmering plate. The cookers come {{in a range of}} different colours, but the most popular is the original cream.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{porridge}} was {{a staple}} food {{in much of}} Northern Europe and Russia. It was often made from barley, though other grains and yellow peas could be used, depending on local conditions. It was primarily a savoury dish, with meats, root crops, vegetables and herbs added for flavor. Porridge could be cooked in a large metal kettle over hot coals or heated in a cheaper earthenware container by adding hot stones until boiling hot. Until leavened bread and <b>baking</b> <b>ovens</b> became commonplace in Europe, porridge was a typical means of preparing cereal crops for the table.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of modern cereal <b>baking</b> <b>ovens</b> are tunnel ovens with multiple zones, {{each of which}} is individually controlled. A baking profile is set by the oven operator, which describes the target temperatures and air velocities in each of the zones {{along the length of the}} oven. There may be up to ten zones in modern tunnel ovens; it is thus a complex procedure to generate an optimum profile. A computer numerical model was developed to model the baking process and to make predictions of the biscuit temperature, heat flux and moisture content through the bake.

An environmental assessment indicates reduction of circa 43 tonnes in CO 2 emissions per annum. The study also provides a systematic methodology to test low temperature gas-to-gas heat recovery technology for food manufacturing process...|$|R
5000|$|The {{settlement}} {{may have}} begun life as a small short-lived military establishment guarding a crossing of the River Kennet. This was replaced by local circular farming huts around AD 70 and a Roman-style rectangular building fifty years later. Activity involved <b>baking</b> <b>ovens,</b> malting tanks and grinding stones. After another fifty years, this {{was replaced by a}} large two-storeyed winged corridor villa with integral bath suite. This building went through a number of changes over the subsequent centuries, notably a major rebuilding around AD 270. The villa had a number of mosaics and there were detached workshops, barns and a large gatehouse.|$|R
