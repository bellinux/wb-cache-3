40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{maintenance}} concept based on condition monitoring and dynamic maintenance packaging, by showing how to connect the information flow from low-level sensors to high-level operations and planning under uncertainty. Today, condition-based maintenance systems are focused on data collection and custom-made rule based systems for data analysis. In many cases, {{the focus is on}} measuring "everything" without considering how to use the measurements. In addition, the measurements are often noisy and the future is unpredictable which adds a lot of uncertainty. As a consequence, maintenance is often planned in advance and not replanned when new condition data is available. This often reduces the benefits of condition monitoring. The concept is based on the combination of robust, dynamically adapted maintenance optimization and statistical data analysis where the uncertainty is considered. This approach ties together low-level data acquisition and high-level planning and optimization. The concept has been illustrated in a context of rail vehicle maintenance, where measurements of brake pad and <b>pantograph</b> contact <b>strip</b> <b>wear</b> is used to predict the near future condition, and plan the maintenance activities...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the contact}} wire makes {{contact with the}} pantograph, the carbon insert {{on top of the}} <b>pantograph</b> is <b>worn</b> down. The [...] "straight" [...] wire between {{supports}} will cause the contact wire to cross over the whole surface of the pantograph as the train travels around the curve, causing uniform wear and avoiding any notches. On straight track, the contact wire is zigzagged slightly to the left and right of centre at each successive support so that the <b>pantograph</b> <b>wears</b> evenly. The movement of the contact wire across the head of the pantograph is called the 'sweep'.|$|R

5000|$|After {{reaching}} takeoff speed, the tyre of {{the number}} 2 wheel was cut by a metal <b>strip</b> (a <b>wear</b> <b>strip)</b> lying on the runway, which had fallen from the thrust reverser cowl door {{of the number}} 3 engine of a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off from the same runway five minutes previously. This <b>wear</b> <b>strip</b> had been replaced at Tel Aviv, Israel, during a C check on 11 June 2000, and then again at Houston, Texas, on 9 July 2000.

40|$|Wear is the {{phenomenon}} that determines {{the lifetime of}} the collector <b>strips.</b> Since <b>wear</b> is an inevitable effect on pantograph-catenary systems, {{it is necessary to}} determine optimal operating conditions that can mitigate its effects. In this study we have performed a simulation model of the pantograph-overhead conductor rail system which allows the evaluation of the dynamic conditions of the system through the contact force. With these results we have made an evaluation of the quality of current collection, a calculation of the <b>pantograph</b> <b>wear</b> and a definition of the optimal operation conditions of the pantograph-overhead conductor rail system...|$|R

40|$|Wheels, {{brake pads}} and {{pantograph}} carbon strips of modern electric trains are three safety critical elements, which are always subject to {{wear and tear}} during normal running and daily operation. Inspection process of the wheel and brake pad wear is extremely labour intensive and time-consuming, due to their large quantity in each train. Moreover, before the manual inspection {{can be carried out}} from the underframe of the train, it is necessary to shunt the train concerned onto the maintenance pit. Thus additional time is required for shunting logistics due to the limited number of pits in depot. On the other hand, to check the <b>wear</b> on carbon <b>strips,</b> manual gauging is the common practice, which requires access to the train roof. Thus it needs a high-level platform and electrical isolation of the overhead power line prior to the examination. It is again no doubt to be a time-consuming process and causes degradation on the efficiency of the regular maintenance. Therefore, to enhance the productivity, an automatic and integrated Vehicle Monitoring System (VMS) utilising laser assisted image processing technology, which comprises three monitoring systems, namely wheel profile, brake pad and <b>pantograph</b> <b>wear</b> monitoring systems, is introduced in the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) Tai Wai Depot to automatically monitor the condition of wheels, brake pads and pantograph carbon strips of the Ma On Shan 4 -car Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) and measure their respective wear pattern, when the train passes the train washing plant daily. The data obtained not only provides a useful database for condition monitoring 8 maintenance planning of wheels, brake pads and pantographs, it is also able to alarm any premature failure for necessary corrective actions.
