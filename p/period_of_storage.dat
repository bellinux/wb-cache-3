500|$|The dating of The Garden of Earthly Delights is uncertain. Ludwig von Baldass (1917) {{considered}} {{the painting to}} be an early work by Bosch. However, since De Tolnay (1937) consensus among 20th-century art historians placed the work in 1503–1504 or even later. Both early and late datings {{were based on the}} [...] "archaic" [...] treatment of space. Dendrochronology dates the oak of the panels between the years 1460 and 1466, providing an earliest date (terminus post quem) for the work. Wood used for panel paintings during this period customarily underwent a lengthy <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> for seasoning purposes, so the age of the oak might be expected to predate the actual date of the painting by several years. Internal evidence, specifically the depiction of a pineapple (a [...] "New World" [...] fruit), suggests that the painting itself postdates Columbus' voyages to the Americas, between 1492 and 1504. The dendrochronological research brought Vermet to reconsider an early dating and, consequently, to dispute the presence of any [...] "New World" [...] objects, stressing the presence of African ones instead.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} often arises {{about the}} reusability of organic vapor adsorption beds, such as air- purifying respirator cartridges, after <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> without use (airflow). The extremes of practice are: (1) use once and discard or (2) reuse multiple times assuming the protection is still afforded.

Three vapors (ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, and hexane) were individually loaded onto test cartridges using a breathing pump. Extents of loading, times of loading, and vapor concentrations were varied. After selected <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> the cartridges were again challenged with the same vapor concentration. The increases in concentration of a vapor in the effluent air (simulated breaths) from a cartridge immediately upon reuse depended on the <b>storage</b> <b>period,</b> the extent <b>of</b> loading during initial use, the volatility of the vapor, and the water vapor adsorbed, but not much on the vapor concentration...|$|R
