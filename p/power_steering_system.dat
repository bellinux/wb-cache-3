5|$|Several cars {{suffered}} issues {{during the}} second safety car period. Nicki Thiim brought the No. 95 Aston Martin from the LMGTE Pro lead straight to the team's garage with a leaking <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> handing the class lead to its sister No. 99 Aston Martin. Christian Ried in the No. 88 Proton Porsche suffered an engine fire in the second Mulsanne Straight chicane, extending the safety car period as it was tended to. KCMG retained their LMP2 class lead ahead of the TDS Racing car while behind the safety car, while the sole Corvette, No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, and two circulating Aston Martin vehicles were nose to tail in LMGTE Pro, continuing their battle after the safety car period ended. Oliver Gavin's Corvette eventually {{pulled away from the}} rest of the LMGTE Pro field. The Riley Viper relinquished its lead in LMGTE Am to the No. 98 Aston Martin of Paul Dalla Lana and the SMP Ferrari driven by François Perrodo. As the safety car period ended the No. 17 Porsche of Hartley held the race lead, but Albuquerque was in pursuit in the No. 9 Audi, breaking the Le Mans lap record with a time of three minutes and 17.647 seconds. The No. 9 Audi was able to mount a better challenge to the leading Porsche, and René Rast was able to take the race lead after pit stops.|$|E
25|$|The {{two-speed}} Jetaway automatic {{that was}} previously offered {{as an option}} on the smaller engine 88 models was dropped completely {{in favor of the}} GM three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 transmission previously only offered with the larger engines. Also a new GM-designed Variable-Ratio <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> <b>system</b> was introduced as an option.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} Lexus GS came standard with dual front airbags, front driver and passenger knee airbags, {{front and rear}} row side curtain airbags, and front row side torso airbags standard while rear row side torso airbags were optional. An Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) was standard on the V8 model while optional on the V6 model. The radar-based Pre-Collision System (PCS) with a Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system was optional. PCS can automatically apply up to 0.3g of deceleration if the driver does not react to imminent crash warnings. Anti-lock braking, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) are standard on all models. VSC with the electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> can immediately alter steering torque assist during evasive maneuvers.|$|E

50|$|China Automotive has {{partnered with}} Tsinghua University to {{establish}} a <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> research center called Tsinghua Henglong Automobile Steering Research Institute, {{for the purpose of}} developing and testing electronic-controlled <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> use {{electric}} motors {{to provide the}} assistance instead of hydraulic systems. As with hydraulic types, power to the actuator (motor, in this case) {{is controlled by the}} rest of the power-steering system.|$|R
25|$|As {{night fell}} on the circuit, Toyota's lead {{extended}} to over a minute from the two remaining Audi entrants, while the OAK Ligier took over the LMP2 lead and ran away to nearly three minutes over the duelling Race Performance Oreca and Signatech Alpine. LMGTE Pro {{continued to be a}} close battle between Giancarlo Fisichella in the No. 51 Ferrari, Darren Turner's No. 97 Aston Martin, and No. 74 Corvette driven by Richard Westbrook, with the trio following one another nose to tail for a multitude of laps. The second Corvette dropped off the leading pace after problems with the car's air jack system required a lengthy pit stop. The No. 98 and No. 95 Aston Martin vehicles continued to hold sway over the LMGTE Am class, but around midnight Pedro Lamy relinquished the lead the No. 98 car had held for 86 consecutive laps {{when he came to the}} pit lane with smoke from the bonnet as the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> on the car failed. The No. 1 Audi of Kristensen was forced to the garage to replace failed fuel injectors after the race passed half distance, while Lieb Porsche's No. 14 car was forced to return to the pit lane on solely electrical power after suffering a second fuel pressure problem. As Nakajima drove the No. 7 Toyota into its ninth hour in the race lead, the car lost drive shortly after the Arnage corner and came to a stop alongside the barriers. An FIA-mandated piece of monitoring equipment had failed within the car and melted a wiring loom and was not able to be repaired by Nakajima, forcing Toyota to abandon the former race-leading car. The No. 2 Audi became the new leader ahead of the No. 20 Porsche and the recovering No. 1 Audi by three laps.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Toyota had {{to fix a}} {{software}} glitch that caused the Prius' engine to enter [...] "limp" [...] mode with electric-only operation, following 68 stall complaints in the U.S. out of 160,000 worldwide sales. In June 2006, Toyota also recalled about 170,000 Prius models from 2004–2006 due to a faulty intermediate shaft and sliding yoke in the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Prius uses an all-electric A/C {{compressor}} for cooling, {{an industry}} first, and also adds an electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> to further minimize engine belt-driven engine accessories. Combined {{with a smaller}} and lighter NiMH battery, the XW20 is more powerful and more efficient than the XW11. [...] In the U.S., the battery pack of the 2004 Prius is warranted for [...] or 8 years. The warranty for hybrid components in California and the seven Northeastern states that have adopted the stricter California emission control standards is [...] or 10 years.|$|E
5000|$|An {{outgrowth}} of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> is speed sensitive steering, where the steering is heavily assisted {{at low speed}} and lightly assisted at high speed. Auto makers perceive that motorists might need to make large steering inputs while manoeuvering for parking, but not while traveling at high speed. The first vehicle with this feature was the Citroën SM with its Diravi layout, although rather than altering the amount of assistance as in modern <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems,</b> it altered the pressure on a centring cam which made the steering wheel try to [...] "spring" [...] back to the straight-ahead position. Modern speed-sensitive <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> reduce the mechanical or electrical assistance as the vehicle speed increases, giving a more direct feel. This feature is gradually becoming more common.|$|R

50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>{{steering}}</b> {{gives the}} driver an easier {{means by which}} the steering of a car can be accomplished. Modern <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> has almost universally relied on a hydraulic system, although electrical systems are steadily replacing this technology. Mechanical <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> (e.g., Studebaker, 1952) have been invented, but their weight and complexity negate the benefits that they provide.|$|R
2500|$|The year 1969 {{also brought}} a major {{restyling}} to the Electra 225 and other GM B-body and C-body cars with somewhat crisper bodylines than 1965–68 models, but continued {{with the same}} chassis and inner body structure introduced with the 1965 model, however the wheelbase was increased one inch to [...] The 1969s were also the first to offer headrests as standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate, and the steering column with ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel with the transmission in [...] "Park", a feature found on all 1969 GM cars one year before it became a federal safety mandate in 1970.

2500|$|Bill Riley's {{redesigned}} Mk III was simpler in its design, allowing more variety {{for customers}} {{as well as}} a low cost. [...] Although the extreme aerodynamics of the original design were gone, the car was conceived to be fast enough to compete for overall wins. [...] The redesign and eventual construction of the first car took only four months. [...] The chassis featured a steel tube frame with panels made of carbon fiber. [...] Behind the cockpit the engine bay was designed to be large enough to allow for a variety of naturally aspirated engines, mostly the V8s of Ford, Chevrolet, and Oldsmobile that were common amongst IMSA GT privateers. [...] All cars used a 5-speed transmission. [...] The suspension consisted of double wishbones with coil springs attached by a pushrod. [...] A <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> was also part of the standard Mk III.|$|E
2500|$|With the 1988 {{model year}} came a {{completely}} new front and rear suspension with vented disc brakes at all four corners- what Pontiac's engineers had planned for the car to have from the beginning. The front suspension geometry was changed to decrease the scrub radius thus decreasing steering effort without adding a bulky <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system.</b> The camber curve was also much improved, the dampers are moved inside the coil springs, and new sealed bearing/hub units were used in 1988. The rear suspension featured multi-link (two lateral links and one trailing arm) Chapman strut suspension, and the tie-rod related bump steer experienced with the earlier suspension design was fixed. The brakes were also upgraded to [...] vented rotors {{on the front and}} rear with an improved slide caliper design having larger diameter slides. The Fiero Formula (new for 1988) and Fiero GT models also received a rear anti-sway bar to compliment non-progressive rate springs.|$|E
25|$|The F30 is {{the first}} {{generation}} of 3 Series to be powered by a range of turbocharged engines exclusively and electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (replacing the hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> used previously). The F30 also marked the 3 Series' first use of a three-cylinder engine in its 2015 facelift. A new plug-in hybrid F30 model was also introduced in 2016.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>systems</b> {{for cars}} augment steering effort via an actuator, a hydraulic cylinder {{that is part}} of a servo system. These systems have a direct mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the linkage that steers the wheels.
