5|$|The <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1990 and the President would, {{according to the}} altered constitution, be elected by the Soviet people by direct and secret ballot. However, {{the first and only}} Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev, was elected by the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies. In connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union national elections for the office of President never took place. To be elected to the office a person must have been a Soviet citizen and older than thirty-five but younger than sixty-five years. The same person could not be elected president for more than two terms. The <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> the highest state office, and was the most important office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition, eclipsing that of Premier and General Secretary. With the establishment of the Presidency executive power was shared between the President and the Prime Minister. The <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> given broad powers, such as being responsible for negotiating the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers with the Supreme Soviet; the Prime Minister, however, was responsible for managing the nomenklatura and economic matters.|$|E
5|$|Bombay <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the three}} Presidencies of British India; the other two being Madras Presidency, and Bengal Presidency. It was in the centre-west of the Indian subcontinent on the Arabian Sea. It was bordered to the north-west, north, and {{north-east}} by Baluchistan, the British province of Punjab, and the Princely state of Rajputana; to the east by the Princely states of Central India Agency, the Central Provinces, Berar and Hyderabad; and to the south by Madras Presidency and Mysore State. The <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> established in the late 17th century and named after Bombay, the capital city and the island on which it was built. By 1906, the area under the jurisdiction of Bombay Presidency stretched from North Canara in the south to Sindh in the north, encompassing the now-Pakistani province of Sindh, some parts of the present-day state of Gujarat, northwestern part of Karnataka state, the British territory of Aden in Yemen, and the western two-thirds of modern-day Maharashtra.|$|E

5|$|In late 1973, {{following}} {{the sudden death of}} church president Harold B. Lee, Kimball became the twelfth {{president of the}} LDS Church, a position he held until his death, in 1985.

5|$|Amin's {{short-lived}} <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> {{marked by}} controversies {{from beginning to}} end. He came to power by ordering {{the death of his}} predecessor Nur Muhammad Taraki. The revolt against communist rule which had begun under Taraki worsened under Amin, and was a problem that his government was unable to solve. The Soviet Union, which alleged that Amin was an agent of the CIA, intervened in Afghanistan while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated by the Soviets in December 1979 as part of Operation Storm-333, having ruled for slightly longer than three months.|$|E

5|$|Clay, though embittered {{by another}} of his many defeats for the <b>presidency,</b> <b>was</b> appeased by Tyler's {{withdrawal}} from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of Rives, and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket. Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress.|$|E
5|$|During British rule, a Governor was {{the chief}} {{administrative}} and political officer of Bombay. The executive Government of the <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> administered by the Governor. He had the same power and right in the Presidency as the Governor-General of India, and observed the same order and course in their proceedings. Governors of Bombay and Madras Presidencies, who were appointed by the British Crown, {{were the most important}} officials after the Viceroy. Bombay Castle was the official residence of the Governor of Bombay until the 1770s, when it was moved to Parel; a century later, in 1883, it was moved to Malabar Hill.|$|E
5|$|During these events, no gunshots were fired. The {{people did}} not react strongly, which {{according}} to the military, {{was a sign of}} approval. A provisional government was formed, and the <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

5|$|Opinion of the Rivadavia {{government}} was {{divided between the}} two ideologies. For Unitarians like Sarmiento, Rivadavia's <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> a positive experience. He set up a European-staffed university and supported a public education program for rural male children. He also supported theater and opera groups, publishing houses and a museum. These contributions were considered as civilizing influences by the Unitarians, but they upset the Federalist constituency. Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the gauchos were arrested by Rivadavia for vagrancy and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.|$|E
5|$|The Southern African Development Community, a bloc of 15 nations {{including}} Madagascar, {{announced on}} 19 March {{that it would}} not recognize Rajoelina's presidency since the takeover was unconstitutional.

No foreign diplomats attended Rajoelina's investiture; the HAT foreign minister said none had been invited.|$|E
5|$|The main {{achievement}} of Markham's RGS <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> the revival {{at the end}} of the 19th century of British interest in Antarctic exploration, after a 50-year interval. He had strong and determined ideas about how the National Antarctic Expedition should be organised, and fought hard to ensure that it was run primarily as a naval enterprise, under Scott's command. To do this he overcame hostility and opposition from much of the scientific community. In the years following the expedition he continued to champion Scott's career, to the extent of disregarding or disparaging the achievements of other contemporary explorers.|$|E

5|$|Edström {{intended}} to retire following the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, when a successor would be elected. Brundage's rival for the <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> Great Britain's Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 {{and president of}} the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt that the president should be a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to have been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E
5|$|In 1684, Fort St George {{was again}} {{elevated}} in rank {{to become the}} Madras Presidency, with William Gyfford as its first president. During this period, the <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> significantly expanded and reached an extent which continued into the early 19th century. During {{the early years of}} the Madras Presidency, the English were repeatedly attacked by the Mughals, the Marathas and the Nawabs of Golkonda and the Carnatic region. In September 1774, by Pitt's India Act, passed by the Parliament of Great Britain to unify and regulate the administration of the territories of the East India Company, the President of Madras was made subordinate to the Governor-General of India based in Calcutta. In September 1746, Fort St George was captured by the French, who ruled Madras as a part of French India until 1749, when Madras was handed back to the British under the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle of the previous year.|$|E

5|$|In 1822, the Madras Presidency {{underwent}} {{its first}} census, which returned {{a population of}} 13,476,923. A second census conducted between 1836 and 1837 recorded a population of 13,967,395, an increase of only 490,472 over 15 years. The first quinquennial population enumeration took place from 1851 until 1852. It returned a population of 22,031,697. Subsequent enumerations were made in 1851–52, 1856–57, 1861–62 and 1866–67. The population of Madras <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> tallied at 22,857,855, 24,656,509 in 1861–62 and 26,539,052 in 1866–67.

5|$|In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez {{became the}} first elected {{president}} of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 {{and the end of}} Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability {{both on and off the}} pitch. His <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such world-class players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{took office}} on 25 May 2003. Roberto Lavagna, {{credited}} with the economic recovery during Duhalde's <b>presidency,</b> <b>was</b> retained as minister of economy and continued his economic policies. Argentina negotiated a swap of defaulted debt and repaid the International Monetary Fund. The National Institute of Statistics and Census intervened to underestimate growing inflation. Several Supreme Court judges resigned while fearing impeachment, and new justices were appointed. The amnesty for crimes committed during the Dirty War in enforcing the full-stop and due-obedience laws and the presidential pardons were repealed and declared unconstitutional. This led to new trials for the military who served during the 1970s. Argentina increased its integration with other Latin American countries, discontinuing its automatic alignment with the United States dating to the 1990s. The 2005 midterm elections were a victory for Kirchner, and signaled the end of Duhalde's supremacy in Buenos Aires Province.|$|E
