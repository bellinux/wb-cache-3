5|$|In {{response}} to another such theory alleging that her visions {{were caused by}} bovine tuberculosis {{as a result of}} drinking unpasteurized milk, historian Régine Pernoud wrote that if drinking unpasteurized milk could produce such potential benefits for the nation, then the French government should stop mandating the <b>pasteurization</b> of milk.|$|E
5|$|It {{is used in}} {{external}} beam radiotherapy, sterilization of medical supplies and medical waste, radiation treatment of foods for sterilization (cold <b>pasteurization),</b> industrial radiography (e.g. weld integrity radiographs), density measurements (e.g. concrete density measurements), and tank fill height switches. The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust, causing problems with radiation protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, {{and one of the}} worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention of pizza cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of pizza cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher <b>pasteurization</b> temperatures.|$|E
5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash <b>pasteurization</b> in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E
25|$|Many {{commercial}} raw {{pet food}} manufacturers now use High Pressure <b>Pasteurization</b> (HPP), {{a process that}} kills pathogenic bacteria through high-pressure. High Pressure <b>Pasteurization</b> is a USDA-approved food processing technique.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the unsuitability of {{microbiological}} techniques, milk <b>pasteurization</b> efficacy is typically monitored by checking for the presence of alkaline phosphatase, which is denatured by <b>pasteurization.</b> B. tuberculosis, the bacterium that requires the highest temperature to be killed of all milk pathogens is killed at ranges of temperature and time similar to those that denature alkaline phosphatase. For this reason, presence of alkaline phosphatase is an ideal indicator of <b>pasteurization</b> efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Along other {{preventative}} measures <b>pasteurization</b> {{can make}} consumption low moisture foods safe. Care {{should be taken}} when pasteurizing dry food products. The amount of time needed for a proper <b>pasteurization</b> effect is at lower water activities (dry food products have a low water activity) is {{a lot longer than}} for moist products. Instead of making the time longer, also the amount of moist in the product can be controlled to increase the <b>pasteurization</b> effect with a shorter treatment time.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis, {{it was found}} that <b>pasteurization</b> appeared to qualitatively reduce concentrations of vitamins B12 and E, but it did increase concentrations of vitamin A. Given the available literature, {{it was not possible to}} quantitatively measure the effect of <b>pasteurization</b> on vitamins A, B12, and E.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{is not an}} {{important}} source of vitamins B12 or E in the North American diet, so the effects of <b>pasteurization</b> on the adult daily intake of these vitamins is negligible.. However, milk is considered {{an important}} source of vitamin A, and because <b>pasteurization</b> appears to increase vitamin A concentrations in milk, the effect of milk heat treatment on this vitamin is a not a major public health concern. Results of meta-analyses revealed that <b>pasteurization</b> of milk leads to a significant decrease in vitamin C and folate, but milk also is not {{an important source of}} these vitamins. However, we did find a significant decrease in vitamin B2 concentrations after <b>pasteurization.</b> Vitamin B2 is typically found in bovine milk at concentrations of 1.83mg/liter. Because the recommended daily intake for adults is 1.1mg/day, milk consumption greatly contributes to the recommended daily intake of this vitamin. With the exception of B2, <b>pasteurization</b> {{does not appear to be}} a concern in diminishing the nutritive value of milk because milk is often not a primary source of these studied vitamins in the North American diet.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations in feed, and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from <b>pasteurization</b> are likely dependent on the time and temperature of <b>pasteurization</b> conditions. Meta-regression was used to assess the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of <b>pasteurization</b> was positively correlated with folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between <b>pasteurization</b> temperature and vitamin C concentrations. Multivariate analysis of time and temperature revealed a significant negative correlation between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations. These results indicate a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, further research is needed to tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pasteurization</b> of {{milk and}} {{chlorination}} of drinking water destroy the organism.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Bramwell Welch (1825-1903), {{discoverer}} of the <b>pasteurization</b> {{process to}} prevent the fermentation of grape juice.|$|E
25|$|A less conventional, but US FDA–legal, {{alternative}} (typically {{for home}} <b>pasteurization)</b> is to heat milk at 63°C (145°F) for 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} remove {{bacterial}} contamination through post-processing by irradiation {{may reduce the}} fear of mishandling food which could cultivate a cavalier attitude toward hygiene and result in contaminants other than bacteria. However, concerns that the <b>pasteurization</b> of milk would lead to increased contamination of milk were prevalent when mandatory <b>pasteurization</b> was introduced, but these fears never materialized after adoption of this law. Therefore, it is unlikely for irradiation to cause an increase of illness due to nonbacteria-based contamination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pasteurization</b> or {{pasteurisation}} is {{a process}} that kills microbes (mainly bacteria) in food and drink, such as milk, juice, canned food, and others.|$|E
25|$|Microfiltration is {{a process}} that {{partially}} replaces <b>pasteurization</b> and produces milk with fewer microorganisms and longer shelf life without a change in the taste of the milk. In this process, cream is separated from the whey and is pasteurized in the usual way, but the whey is forced through ceramic microfilters that trap 99.9% of microorganisms in the milk (as compared to 99.999% killing of microorganisms in standard HTST <b>pasteurization).</b> The whey then is recombined with the pasteurized cream to reconstitute the original milk composition.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>pasteurization</b> {{has been}} practiced {{for a long}} time, some {{consumers}} contend {{that they should have}} the right to buy and sell unpasteurized milk if they want to.|$|E
25|$|Some older {{references}} {{point to}} one or multiple cycles of heating and cooling (to ambient temperature or below) as either a definition of <b>pasteurization</b> or a general method thereof.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pasteurization</b> of cow's milk {{initially}} destroys {{any potential}} pathogens {{and increases the}} shelf life, but eventually results in spoilage that makes it unsuitable for consumption. This causes it to assume an unpleasant odor, and the milk is deemed non-consumable due to unpleasant taste and {{an increased risk of}} food poisoning. In raw milk, the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, under suitable conditions, ferments the lactose present to lactic acid. The increasing acidity in turn prevents the growth of other organisms, or slows their growth significantly. During <b>pasteurization,</b> however, these lactic acid bacteria are mostly destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Complete {{sterilization}} is {{not always}} required or performed during composting. In some cases, a <b>pasteurization</b> step is not included to allow some beneficial microorganisms {{to remain in the}} growth substrate.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{microbiological}} {{techniques are}} the ultimate measurement of pathogen contamination, but these are costly and time-consuming (24–48 hours), which means that products are able to spoil by the time <b>pasteurization</b> is verified.|$|E
25|$|Solar cookers use {{sunlight}} for cooking, drying and <b>pasteurization.</b> Solar cooking offsets fuel costs, reduces {{demand for}} fuel or firewood, and improves air quality by reducing or removing {{a source of}} smoke.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consumers}} {{also point}} out that government-enforced <b>pasteurization</b> law {{has been used as a}} tool for large business to shut out competition from smaller producers. See the case of the FDA's shut down of Goodflow Juice in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Infantile scurvy {{emerged in}} the late 19th century because {{children}} were being fed pasteurized cow's milk, particularly in the urban upper class. While <b>pasteurization</b> killed bacteria, it also destroyed vitamin C. This was eventually resolved by supplementing with onion juice or cooked potatoes.|$|E
25|$|A process {{similar to}} <b>pasteurization</b> is thermization, which uses lower {{temperatures}} to kill bacteria in milk. It allows a milk product, such as cheese, to retain {{more of the}} original taste, but thermized foods are not considered pasteurized by food regulators.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pasteurization</b> does lead to {{decreased}} {{levels of}} several vitamins, but only approximately 0–10%. Research shows only very slight {{differences in the}} nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk. Raw milk contains very little vitamin D, which is added to processed milk.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2009 review, milkborne disease {{outbreaks}} made up approximately 25% of all {{food and water}} contamination {{disease outbreaks}} in 1938; <b>pasteurization</b> is largely credited for a dramatic decrease in milkborne disease outbreaks, which made up less than 1% {{of food and water}} contamination disease outbreaks by 2005.|$|E
25|$|According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the fecal-oral {{cycle of}} {{transmission}} can be disrupted by cooking food properly, preventing cross-contamination, instituting barriers such as gloves for food workers, instituting health care policies so food industry employees seek treatment {{when they are}} ill, <b>pasteurization</b> of juice or dairy products and proper hand washing requirements.|$|E
25|$|Microwave {{volumetric}} heating (MVH) is {{the newest}} available <b>pasteurization</b> technology. It uses microwaves to heat liquids, suspensions, or semi-solids in a continuous flow. Because MVH delivers energy evenly and deeply into the whole body of a flowing product, it allows for gentler and shorter heating, so that almost all heat-sensitive substances in the milk are preserved.|$|E
25|$|Rothschild {{inherited}} {{his title}} {{at the age}} of 26 following the death of his uncle Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild on 27 August 1937. He sat as a Labour Party peer in the House of Lords, but spoke only twice there during his life (both speeches were in 1946, one about the <b>pasteurization</b> of milk, and another about the situation in Palestine).|$|E
25|$|Commonly sold in 500 mL {{plastic bags}} and in bottles {{in some parts}} like in west. It is still {{customary}} to serve the milk boiled, despite <b>pasteurization.</b> Milk is often buffalo milk. Flavored milk is sold in most convenience stores in waxed cardboard containers. Convenience stores also sell many varieties of milk (such as flavored and ultra-pasteurized) in different sizes, usually in aseptic cartons.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>pasteurization</b> and refrigeration, Busch {{was an early}} adopter of vertical integration, or buying all components of a business. He bought bottling factories, ice-manufacturing plants, stave makers, timberland, coal mines, and a refrigeration company. He also bought railways and bought the rights from Rudolf Diesel to assemble diesel engines in America. The Busch family also acquired hop farms in the area near Cooperstown, New York.|$|E
25|$|In winemaking, {{clarification}} and stabilization are {{the processes}} by which insoluble matter suspended in the wine is removed before bottling. This matter may include dead yeast cells (lees), bacteria, tartrates, proteins, pectins, various tannins and other phenolic compounds, as well as pieces of grape skin, pulp, stems and gums. Clarification and stabilization may involve , filtration, centrifugation, flotation, refrigeration, <b>pasteurization,</b> and/or barrel maturation and racking.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pasteurization</b> is {{the reason}} for milk's {{extended}} shelf life. High-temperature, short-time (HTST) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment (UHT) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as aseptic packaging), it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months.|$|E
25|$|To aid {{digestion}} {{in those}} with lactose intolerance, milk with added bacterial cultures such as Lactobacillus acidophilus ("acidophilus milk") and bifidobacteria ("a/B milk") is available in some areas. Another milk with Lactococcus lactis bacteria cultures ("cultured buttermilk") often is used in cooking to replace the traditional use of naturally soured milk, which has become rare due to the ubiquity of <b>pasteurization,</b> which also kills the naturally occurring Lactococcus bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{ingredients}} are blended in large stainless steel tanks and skim milk is added and adjusted to 60°C. Then, fats, oils and emulsifiers are added. Additional heating and mixing {{may be required}} to get proper consistency. Next, minerals, vitamins, and stabilizing gums are added at various points, depending on their sensitivity to heat. The batch is temporarily stored and then transported by pipelines to <b>pasteurization</b> equipment when mixing is complete.|$|E
