40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that there were two mass extinction events in the Late Permian: one that occurred at the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> (P/T) <b>boundary</b> (251 Ma) and a second, smaller mass extinction that occurred 5 - 8 Myr earlier {{at the end of the}} Guadalupian. Many workers have argued that there is a causal relationship between large-scale volcanic activity and mass extinctions. The major mass extinction event at the P/T boundary coincides with the outpouring of huge quantities of lava that formed the Siberian flood basalt province in Russia. Courtillot et al. [Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 166 (1999) 177 - 195] and Wignall [Earth Sci. Rev. 53 (2001) 1 - 33] suggested that the earlier Late Permian mass extinction coincided with the eruption of the lavas that formed the Emeishan flood basalt (EFB) province in SW China. However, the age of eruption of the EFB lavas is poorly constrained. Using the Sensitive High-Resolution Ion Microprobe to analyze zircons, we have established the age of the Xinjie intrusion, believed to be a feeder to the main phase of EFB volcanism, to be 259 ± 3 Ma. Hence, the formation of the EFB is coincident with a proposed extinction event at 256 - 259 Ma.

50|$|The Lilliput {{effect is}} a term coined in 1993, used to {{describe}} the dramatic reduction in size observed in populations of a taxa which have survived a major extinction event, attributable to a variety of environmental factors. This effect has been documented in numerous “survivor” taxa of such events. In his work, Adam K. Huttenlocker examined fossil records of Moschorhinus kitchingi from before and after the mass extinction demarcating the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary.</b> Specifically, he looked at changes in cranial size and limb bone histology indicating vascular growth patterns.Great size reductions are observed in Triassic Moschorhinus, as compared to their Permian forerunners. Histological evidence shows that Permian and Triassic Moschorhinus skeletons grew at different rates early in life, largely believed to be an effect of the harsher environmental variability of the early Triassic. This less stable environment favored a faster growth and development to reach a minimum body size requirement. Because of the Lilliput effects observed across the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary,</b> both size and stratigraphic stage must be considered when determining the maturity and age (in life) of a specimen.|$|E

40|$|At the {{classical}} Guryul ravine section of Kashmir, the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> (P-T) <b>boundary</b> is located about 3 m above {{the base of}} the Khunamuh Formation. Brookfield et al. (2013) proposed that the deposits straddling the boundary between the Khunamuh Formation and the underlying, Permian Zewan Formation are Siberian Traps-induced seismites overlain by tsunamites. These deposits have been subject to a divergent re-interpretation by Krystyn et al. (2014), who rejected a Siberian-Traps origin. Here, we report the discovery of highly contorted beds {{at the top of a}} 7 m. thick, thin-bedded, light beige nodular lime mudstone, a new lithological unit recorded in the Early Triassic Khunamuh Formation, 120 m above the top of the Zewan Formation. These contorted beds, about 1 m thick, are showing typical earthquake induced soft sediment deformations, similar to the latest Permian in the lower part of the section. This new nodular limestone is of early Spathian age as indicated by our conodont sampling and crops out at the base of a cliff-forming limestone interval named Niti Limestone throughout the Tethys Himalaya area since the 19 th century. It is interesting to note that both latest Permian and early Spathian seismites occur at a marked lithological change, i. e. a shift in the depositional settings. The latest Permian seismite occurs on a delta ramp with mixed quartzose sand, silt and shelly carbonate lenses, storm influenced deposits, followed by an abrupt contact with the overlying deeper, thin- bedded and siliceous clay mud turbidite deposits and rare lime mud lenses. The early Spathian one is intercalated at the top of a distal ramp nodular limestone deposits, just at the change to the shallower thick-bedded Niti limestone. The latest Permian seismic activity coincides with a platform drowning during a transgressive phase and the early Spathian one occurred during a platform uplift, also during a transgressive phase. Both may conceivably have been driven by recurrent phases of syn-sedimentary block faulting of the northern Indian passive margin. In this, we agree with the conclusions of Krystyn et al. (2014) that any relation between the local occurrences of seismites-tsunamites and the eruption of the Siberian traps is unlikely. Yet, we must keep in mind that both coincide also with global shifts in the geochemical, sedimentological, paleontological and climate records...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Mass extinctions {{are among}} the most {{important}} events in the history of life on Earth and understanding their effects on life and the structure of biotic systems is restricted to the fossil record. Comparatively few studies have investigated the effects of mass extinctions on terrestrial ecosystems, where the preservation of fossils is sparser than in the seas. The End-Permian Mass Extinction is the largest mass extinction in Earth history, wiping out approximately 80 % of marine species, with a comparable effect on land. For tetrapod vertebrates the most complete record of their evolution from the middle Permian, across the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> mass extinction <b>boundary</b> and into the Triassic comes primarily from a single place: the Karoo Basin of South Africa. Therefore, what is known about the development and collapse of complex tetrapod ecosystems in the Permian, and the subsequent rebuilding of new systems {{in the wake of the}} mass extinction, is geographically restricted. This Dissertation addresses relatively understudied records of tetrapod evolution and adds geographic complexity to our understanding of mass extinction and recovery. Chapter 1 describes the vertebrate fauna of the Middle Triassic Ntawere Formation of Zambia. The vertebrate assemblage of the Ntawere is one of a handful that can be tied to the Karoo biostratigraphically, and therefore acts as a comparison point in the post-extinction world. I bring together the historical finds of the Ntawere as well as add a number of new occurrences found during field expeditions in 2009, 2011 and 2014, including some of the earliest crocodile and dinosaur-line archosaurs. I recognize a lower and an upper assemblage within the Ntawere. Using new faunal lists I suggest a new biostratigraphic scheme centered on dicynodont and cynodont therapsid taxa shared by fossil assemblages across southern Africa and South America, but to the exclusion of the Karoo Basin. In Chapters 2 and 3 I use a synthesized database of all tetrapod fossils discovered from middle Permian through Middle Triassic rocks in three basins in Zambia and Tanzania to understand the geographic similarity of tetrapod assemblages across the mass extinction boundary. In terms of taxonomic richness, evenness, the relative abundances of higher clades (e. g., Dicynodontia), ecological guild richness, and the relative abundances of ecological guilds I find support for a largely homogeneous fauna spread across southern Pangea during the late Permian. This fauna is fragmented during the mass extinction event and by the Middle Triassic there are high levels of dissimilarity across southern Pangea. In terms of recovery from the mass extinction I find no support for a taxonomic return to Permian levels, but I find variable signals for an ecological recovery. However, the composition of Middle Triassic ecosystems differs significantly from the late Permian, indicating that though a new stability may have been reached, ecosystem structure was itself fundamentally reset by the mass extinction event...|$|R

50|$|The mass {{extinction}} {{at the end}} of the Permian cued the extinction of 80-95% of animal species. Based on models of sediment burial, weathering and oxidation of organic matter, scientists have been able to deduce a gradual decrease in atmospheric oxygen ratios across the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary.</b> It is estimated that oxygen was present as 30% of the atmospheric makeup of the Early Permian, but reduced to just 15% by the Early Triassic. Physiological studies show that this induced hypoxia likely had a negative effect on the potential body sizes of tetrapods of the time. In addition to the transition from hyperoxic to hypoxic conditions, animals of the Early Triassic faced intense seasonal climate changes, reduced ecosystem diversity, and a loss of forested land. These populations were thus very susceptible to effects of environmental variability, as this type of unpredictable environment can result in drastic disturbances to primary plant production. This also resulted in lowered herbivore abundance, which would have had a major influence on predators of the early Triassic, Moschorhinus included.|$|E
50|$|The Fremouw Formation {{preserves}} many tetrapod fossils {{that span}} the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary,</b> which marks the Permo-Triassic mass extinction. Around the world, {{the fossil record}} of many tetrapod groups is absent or very limited in Early Triassic rocks, implying a major decline in diversity after the extinction. The presence {{of many of these}} groups in Middle Triassic strata indicate that long ghost lineages must have extended back into the Early Triassic. Tetrapods such as temnospondyl amphibians, diapsid reptiles, and dicynodont therapsids are common in the Late Permian and seemed to have recovered by the Middle Triassic, but there is little record of their presence in the Early Triassic. All of these tetrapods are present in Early Triassic strata of the Fremouw Formation, suggesting that Antarctica served as a refugium for these animals. During the extinction, global temperatures rose and the supercontinent Pangea moved northward, putting pressure on populations that could not adapt to the warming climate. Antarctica, while much warmer in the Early Triassic than it is today, was cooler than other parts of Gondwana and may have been more hospitable to tetrapod populations. Antarctica's milder climate allowed many groups to take refuge in the region while other populations experienced decline. In the Early Triassic, many Fremouw Formation tetrapods had smaller body sizes than their Permian ancestors, and many were adapted for burrowing. Both of these characteristics are seen as adaptations to Antarctica's greater seasonal variability and protracted day-night cycles.|$|E

40|$|Permo-Triassic {{sections}} at Vyazniki and Gorokhovets {{provide evidence}} on terrestrial events at, or close to, the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary,</b> {{the time of}} the largest ever mass extinction. The sedimentary succession records the overrun of a muddy playa–lacustrine depositional system by major channel belts transporting sand-grade sediments. Biostratigraphy of sections at Vyazniki and Gorokhovets (Zhukov Ravine) shows that this event occurred either {{at the very end of}} the Permian or 8 m above in the sections. The timing and nature of this event, which records increased sediment flux from the Ural Mountains, is closely comparable with that from the Southern Uralian Foreland Basin. The Vyazniki and Gorokhovets sections are 800 km from the mountain front and in a separate depositional basin, which strengthens the case that increased sediment flux from the Urals at the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary</b> is related to devegetation of upland catchments (increasing sediment yield) and a switch toward low-frequency but high-magnitude discharge events (increasing sediment delivery).

40|$|In this thesis, the {{large-scale}} thermohaline circulation in the Late Permian was studied. A steady state circulation {{was obtained by}} running MITgcm with a 2 times 2 degrees spherical-polar grid, and solving the nonlinear equations of motion until an equilibrium state was obtained. The results were compared to some linear theories on the ocean circulation, and a similar model study for a square basin ocean. The goal was to discuss the relevancy of these simplifications to the Late Permian ocean. Additionally, the results were {{discussed in terms of}} some previous numerical and proxy-based studies. The objective was to illustrate how the ocean circulation in this period could have contributed to the anoxic and euxinic conditions observed on the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary,</b> in relation the End Permian extinction, and to explore the uncertainties related to plaeoclimatic studies, both numerical and paleogeological. Such comparison studies can be useful in order to explore the causes for oxygen depletion in the Late Permian ocean, and separate out the causes for local extinction rates. The conditions on <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary</b> are also highly relevant {{in order to understand the}} current climate changes, as rapid increase of atmospheric CO 2 is thought to be the main trigger of the End Permian extinction. It was shown that both the linear models and the square basin case holds some similarities to the Late Permian ocean, but neither is a satisfactory simplification. Regarding the previous numerical and proxy-based studies, it was found that the circulation is highly sensitive to bathymetry, particularly in highly studied areas. Also, localities where anoxic conditions is seen in the proxy data, do not necessarily coincide with areas of stagnation. The results presented in this thesis consists only of a snap shot of the ocean circulation prior to the extinction event. Thus it can not be directly compared to the situation during and after the extinction.

Here we introduce a method for computing confidence intervals for the time or stratigraphic distance separating two extinction pulses in a pulsed extinction event, taking into account the incompleteness of the fossil record. We base our method on a flexible likelihood ratio test framework that is able to test whether the fossil record is consistent with any extinction scenario, whether simultaneous, pulsed, or otherwise. As an illustration, we apply our method to a data set on marine invertebrates from the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary</b> of Meishan, China. Using this data set, we show that the fossil record of ostracodes and that of brachiopods are each consistent with simultaneous extinction, and that these two extinction pulses are separated by 720, 000 to 1. 2 million years with 95 % confidence. With appropriate data, our method could also be applied in other situations, such as tests of origination patterns, coordinated stasis, and recovery after a mass extinction...|$|E
40|$|At {{present the}} Karoo Basin covers {{approximately}} 20 000 km 2. It {{is a large}} intracratonic basin which, from Carboniferous to Jurassic times, was infilled with a succession of sediments ranging from glacial deposits to those deposited in warm, equable conditions. The Beaufort Group forms part of this succession, and was deposited in a terrestrial, river dominated environment. The dominant lithologies exposed in the Estcourt region in the KwaZulu Natal Midlands belong to the lower and middle Beaufort divided by the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary.</b> The Permo-Triassic palaeoenvironment in this region is reconstructed using sedimentary profiles combined with {{the study of the}} fossil remains discovered in the area, including plant, body, and trace fossils. The lower Beaufort sediments in this region belong to the Estcourt Formation, and the Middle Beaufort sediments to the Belmont Formation. The Estcourt Formation is dominated by a succession of alternating sandstones, siltstones and mudstones, which are interpreted as representing sediments deposited in a fluvial-floodplain environment, which can be divided into two sub-environments. The first is dominated by sediments that were deposited by meandering rivers on a semi-arid floodplain, and the second sub-environmen...|$|E
40|$|Geologists and palaeontologists have {{expressed}} mixed {{views about the}} effects of the end-Permian mass extinction on continental habitats and on terrestrial life. Current work suggests that the effects on land were substantial, with massive erosion following the stripping of vegetation, associated with long-term aridification and short-term bursts of warming and acid rain. Wildfires at the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary</b> contributed to the removal of forests and the prolonged absence of forests from the Earth's surface for up to 10 Myr. These physical crises on land impinged on the oceans, suggesting tight interlocking of terrestrial and marine crises. Levels of extinction on land may well have been as high as in the sea, and this is certainly the case for tetrapods. The mass extinction seems to have been less profound for plants and insects, but it is hard at present to disentangle issues of data quality from reductions in abundance and diversity. Several killing agents have been proposed, and of these tetrapods may have succumbed primarily to acid rain, mass wasting, and aridification. Plants may have been more affected by the sudden effects of heating and wildfires, and the crisis for insects has yet to be explored...|$|E
40|$|During the end-Permian mass extinction, marine {{ecosystems}} {{suffered a}} major drop in diversity, which was maintained throughout the Early Triassic until delayed recovery during the Middle Triassic. This depressed {{diversity in the}} Early Triassic correlates with multiple major perturbations to the global carbon cycle, interpreted as either intrinsic ecosystem or external palaeoenvironmental effects. In contrast, the terrestrial record of extinction and recovery is less clear; the effects and magnitude of the end-Permian extinction on non-marine vertebrates are particularly controversial. We use specimen-level data from southern Africa and Russia to investigate the palaeodiversity dynamics of non-marine tetrapods across the <b>Permo-Triassic</b> <b>boundary</b> by analysing sample-standardized generic richness, evenness and relative abundance. In addition, we investigate the potential effects of sampling, geological and taxonomic biases on these data. Our analyses demonstrate that non-marine tetrapods were severely affected by the end-Permian mass extinction, and that these assemblages did not begin to recover until the Middle Triassic. These data are congruent with those from land plants and marine invertebrates. Furthermore, they {{are consistent with the}} idea that unstable low-diversity post-extinction ecosystems were subject to boom–bust cycles, reflected in multiple Early Triassic perturbations of the carbon cycle...|$|E
