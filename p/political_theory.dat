The final chapter outlines Cochrane's own approach, which he situates between liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E

5|$|Alasdair Cochrane (born 31 March 1978) is a British {{political}} theorist and ethicist who {{is currently}} a senior lecturer in <b>political</b> <b>theory</b> in the Department of Politics at the University of Sheffield. He {{is known for his}} work on animal rights from the perspective of <b>political</b> <b>theory,</b> which is the subject of his two books: An Introduction to Animals and <b>Political</b> <b>Theory</b> (2010, Palgrave Macmillan) and Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012, Columbia University Press). He {{is currently working on a}} third book. He is a founding member of the Centre for Animals and Social Justice, a UK-based think tank focussed on furthering the social and political status of nonhuman animals. He joined the Department at Sheffield in 2012, having previously been a faculty member at the Centre for the Study of Human Rights, London School of Economics.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative <b>political</b> <b>theory</b> asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on <b>political</b> <b>theory,</b> he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in <b>political</b> <b>theory.</b> In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in <b>political</b> <b>theory.</b> He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for <b>political</b> <b>theory,</b> and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E

5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal <b>political</b> <b>theory</b> of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal <b>political</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, {{and that the}} book would have benefited from devoting more space to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of justice as it might apply to animals. Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction to Animals and <b>Political</b> <b>Theory</b> {{was one of the first}} books to explore animals from the perspective of <b>political</b> <b>theory,</b> and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
5|$|An Introduction to Animals and <b>Political</b> <b>Theory</b> is a 2010 {{textbook}} by the British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane. It is {{the first}} book in the publisher Palgrave Macmillan's Animal Ethics Series, edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. Cochrane's book examines five schools of political theory—utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism—and their respective relationships with questions concerning animal rights and the political status of (non-human) animals. Cochrane concludes that each tradition has something to offer to these issues, but ultimately presents his own account of interest-based animal rights as preferable to any. His account, though drawing from all examined traditions, builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction to Animals and <b>Political</b> <b>Theory</b> {{was first}} {{published}} in the UK on 13 October 2010 by Palgrave Macmillan in paperback, hardback and eBook formats. It was the first book to appear as part of the Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series, a partnership between Palgrave Macmillan and the Ferrata Mora Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics. The series's general editors are Andrew Linzey and Priscilla N. Cohn. Interdisciplinary in focus, the Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series aims to explore the practical and conceptual challenges posed by animal ethics.|$|E
5|$|In fact, process {{theology}} {{is difficult to}} define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests. John B. Cobb, Jr. is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory. Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist. Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and <b>political</b> <b>theory.</b> In Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age, futurologists Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see {{rising out of the}} participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, Alasdair Cochrane studied {{politics}} at the University of Sheffield and the London School of Economics (LSE). His doctoral thesis, supervised by Cécile Fabre with Paul Kelly acting as an adviser, was entitled Moral obligations to non-humans. He subsequently became a fellow and lecturer at the LSE. During this time, Cochrane published articles in Res Publica, Utilitas and Political Studies presenting aspects of his interest-based theory of animal rights, which is defended in the final chapter of An Introduction to Animals and <b>Political</b> <b>Theory.</b> The book was Cochrane's first, and the political theorist Robert Garner acted as an important discussant during the writing process.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the implicit relationship between {{political science and}} rare events, or so called Black Swans. The purpose is to analyze Black Swan weakness by evaluating the nature of political analysis and <b>political</b> <b>theories.</b> The key to this assessment is {{the analysis of the}} predictive powers of <b>political</b> analysis and <b>theories.</b> This essay claims, on the basis of Karl Poppers historicism critique, that such predictions are impossible. The theoretical foundation for the analysis is divided in one part to the statistical properties of rare events. Here, a distinction is made between known uncertainties and unknown uncertainties. The other part of the theoretical foundation of the analysis is the experimental evidence of empirical psychology. The analysis reveals a Black Swan weakness, both in political analysis and <b>political</b> <b>theories.</b> <b>Political</b> analysis has a great exposure to Black Swan weakness, no matter whether the analyst is a hedgehog or a fox. <b>Political</b> <b>theories</b> have a tendency for post hoc rationalization, and display a weakness in understanding th...|$|R

5|$|The General Court, as the {{legislative}} and judicial bodies, and the Governor, {{as the chief}} executive of the colony, constituted a political system of division of power. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin's <b>political</b> <b>theory</b> to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances in order to minimize the misuse of political power. In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony. The colony was de facto a republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influence—a representative democracy governed on the principles of the Mayflower Compact ("self-rule").|$|E
5|$|The book {{is based}} upon Cochrane's {{doctoral}} thesis, which was completed at the London School of Economics, and builds upon subjects he had discussed in previous publications, including his first book. An Introduction to Animals and <b>Political</b> <b>Theory.</b> It was published by Columbia University Press as the second book in their series Critical Perspectives on Animals, edited by Gary Francione and Gary Steiner. Critics {{from a variety of}} backgrounds responded positively to the book, focussing on how Cochrane had found a middle ground between traditional animal rights philosophy and utilitarianism.|$|E

30|$|Although, {{there are}} {{different}} theoretical approaches to social responsibility including instrumental <b>theories,</b> <b>political</b> <b>theories,</b> integrative theories and ethical theories (Garriga and Mele´, 2004), this study focuses on the legitimacy theory as a plausible explanation for CSR reporting practices.|$|R
5|$|The second theme Garner {{identified}} was {{the divide}} between ideal and nonideal theory, which he understands as a way <b>political</b> <b>theory</b> {{may be used to}} contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves as a challenge to abolitionism, which, Garner fears, both polarises the debate and is unrealistic. The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals. In the course of his review of the book, Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane's second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, which offers a lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.|$|E
5|$|When {{he moved}} to Salisbury, Allen met Thomas Young, a doctor living and {{practicing}} just across the provincial boundary in New York. The doctor, only five years older than Allen, taught the younger Allen {{a great deal about}} philosophy and <b>political</b> <b>theory,</b> while Allen was able to bring to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier. Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book intended to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a Deist. They worked on the manuscript until 1764, when Young moved away from the area, taking the manuscript with him.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and <b>Political</b> <b>Theory,</b> was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
