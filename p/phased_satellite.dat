40|$|Previous {{research}} in satellite constellation designs {{has focused on}} Low Earth Orbit (LEO) communication systems that service a global market of uniform demand. This paper addresses the challenge of designing a hybrid satellite system constellation (e. g., LEO satellites with elliptical orbiting satellites) {{to meet the demands}} of the emerging satellite broadband market. The broadband market model that is developed highlights the highly non-uniform distribution of traffic that future satellite systems must handle. The approach to the problem and the simulation design are discussed. The problem statement is formulated as an optimization problem. Results from techniques such as Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Simulated Annealing (SA) are provided and analyzed. A Pareto front of the set of optimal hybrid satellite system designs that solve the formulated optimization problem is provided. The presented design architecture allows for a <b>phased</b> <b>satellite</b> deployment strategy: a LEO backbone satellite constellation to capture a fraction of the total market demand with additional elliptical satellites to service areas of high and growing demand. ...|$|E

This paper addresses {{the challenge of}} designing a hybrid satellite system constellation to meet the emerging satellite broadband market while enabling a <b>phased</b> <b>satellite</b> deployment strategy. The broadband market model developed in the paper highlights the highly non-uniform distribution of traffic that future satellite systems must handle. The proposed solution employs a LEO backbone satellite constellation to capture {{a fraction of the}} total market demand with additional elliptical satellite constellations to service areas of high and growing demand. By opening up the tradespace to multiple orbital altitudes (Low Earth Orbit, Medium Earth Orbit, and Geosynchronous Orbit) and both circular and elliptical orbits, this paper will search for a lower cost solution to the broadband communication constellation design problem. Lastly, this paper will introduce a novel visualization of the tradespace using convex hulls and conditional Pareto fronts, which enable instant recognition of the impact of design choices on the final design.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of operating tethered payloads in earth orbit will be studied during {{a space shuttle}} flight scheduled for 1992. Tethered systems may exhibit a circular transverse oscillation or skiprope phenomenon due to interaction between the earth's magnetic field and current pulsing through the tether. Effective damping of this skiprope motion depends on rapid and accurate detection of its magnitude and <b>phase.</b> <b>Satellite</b> attitude motion has characteristic oscillations {{as well as many}} other perturbations and therefore the relationship between skiprope parameters and attitude time history is very complex and nonlinear. A space-time neural network (STNN) for filtering satellite rate gyro data is proposed for rapid detection and prediction of skiprope magnitude and phase.

Test calculations were done with experimental data of two known composite structures of the inorganic misfit layer compounds (LaS) 1. 14 NbS 2 and (PbS) 1. 18 TiS 2.

30|$|However, prior, {{during and}} after the major Strombolian explosions (such as the one {{recorded}} on November 27, 2014) satellite VRP data are well above 10  MW, reaching peak values of 15.6  MW 11  days after the cited explosion. Following the ceasing of the Strombolian phase, the volcano has reentered the phreatic phase with the refilling of the water lake (that was replenished by early July 2016), locally accompanied by phreatomagmatic eruptions. During this <b>phase,</b> <b>satellite</b> data processed by MIROVA exhibit very few thermal alerts, whereas ground-based measurements initially were fluctuating around 1  MW, and then progressively decreased toward their minima. The most violent explosion occurred on October 8, 2016, {{and by the end of}} that month some of the detected heat fluxes (both by MODIS and FLIR) reached values above 2  MW. This is coeval with an increase in temperature of the fumarole field of the South Area, which reached values well above 300  °C. It is therefore likely that the above explosion contributed to the resetting of the summit fracture network, enhancing fluid migration and moderately higher heat fluxes within the fumarole field.|$|R

In order to obtain the groundtrack grid dense enough for a proper sampling of the gravitational field, ESA set constraints for a minimum groundtrack repeat period. We studied suitable repeat cycles (resonant orbits) in the vicinity of 16 : 1 resonance; we found that they differ greatly in stability towards small perturbations of the satellite's mean altitude and in temporal evolution of the groundtrack coverage. The results obtained from the usual analytical treatment of orbital resonances were refined by more realistic numerical simulations. Finally, we formulated suggestions that might be useful in GOCE orbit planning...|$|R
40|$|The Australia Centre for Space Engineering Research (ACSER) is {{presently}} investigating {{the design of}} an earth observation Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite mission known as “Garada”, for flood monitoring and other applications using several small satellites flying in formation. In the initial feasibility study <b>phase,</b> <b>satellite</b> orbit design and analysis {{is one of the}} challenges. This paper describes the objectives of the mission and the methods that can be employed for orbit design. The main parameters determining the orbit relate to accessibility revisit requirements and mission lifetime. The requirements and considerations regarding the choice of orbit types and orbital elements for formation configuration designs are presented. Two satellites are the minimum formation; a leading satellite and a following satellite. The satellites fly in approximately 600 km altitude circular orbits. Sun-synchronous and more equatorially inclined orbits are compared. The effect of altitude and satellite ballistic coefficient on orbit lifetime is analysed. The two satellites fly in a “string of pearls ” formation (i. e. in line) with a separation of around 40 km. The satellites use onboard GPS receivers for navigation. Predictions of GPS signal coverage on orbit are presented. Orbit lifetime, revisit frequencies, illumination time and GPS signal coverage are simulated using the Satellite Tool Kit (STK).
