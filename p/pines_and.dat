5|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle {{is a native}} insect species that is known to experience large outbreaks that infest forest groves, and is particularly common in areas with numerous lodgepole <b>pines</b> <b>and</b> fir trees. A large infestation occurred from 1995 through 2003, and the beetle wiped out areas of lodgepole pine in the SNRA, an area historically too cold for outbreaks to occur.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered <b>pines</b> <b>and</b> tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
5|$|SR 243 {{begins at}} SR 74 in the San Jacinto Wilderness near Mountain Center, Riverside County as Idyllwild Road. The highway {{traverses}} north along a winding road through {{the community of}} Idyllwild. SR 243 makes a left turn at the intersection with Circle Drive and continues through Pine Cove. The road continues through the forest past Mount San Jacinto State Park through Twin <b>Pines</b> <b>and</b> the Morongo Indian Reservation before making a few switchbacks and descending {{en route to the}} city of Banning as the Banning Idyllwild Panoramic Highway. The highway continues as San Gorgonio Avenue into the city before making a left onto Lincoln Street and a right onto 8th Street and terminating at a diamond interchange with I-10.|$|E
50|$|The Mount Moriah Wilderness {{lies within}} the Intermountain sagebrush/ponderosa <b>pine</b> {{ecosystem}} <b>and</b> vegetation {{varies with the}} elevation. Pinyon <b>pine</b> <b>and</b> juniper dominate the lower slopes, while aspen, mountain mahogany, white and Douglas fir, limber <b>pine,</b> <b>and</b> bristlecone <b>pine</b> {{are found in the}} upper elevations.|$|R
50|$|The habitat {{consists}} of ponderosa <b>pine</b> forests <b>and</b> mixed woodlands of <b>pine</b> <b>and</b> oak.|$|R
50|$|The forest {{consists}} of white fir, Jeffrey pine, red fir, western white <b>pine,</b> <b>and</b> mountain hemlock.

5|$|With 130,000 {{hectares}} of greenery and over 180,000 palm trees in its Palmeraie, Marrakesh is {{an oasis of}} rich plant variety. Throughout the seasons, fragrant orange, fig, pomegranate and olive trees display their color and fruits in Agdal Garden, Menara Garden and other gardens in the city. The city's gardens feature numerous native plants alongside other species that have been imported {{over the course of}} the centuries, including giant bamboos, yuccas, papyrus, palm trees, banana trees, cypress, philodendrons, rose bushes, bougainvilleas, <b>pines</b> <b>and</b> various kinds of cactus plants.|$|E
5|$|Although Sidney was the {{architect}} of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. At the beginning of his tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude. During Boetcher's tenure Oakwood's most important icons were built: the Earl Chapel and Crematorium, the Warren Chapel Mortuary, the keeper's house, the office lodge, numerous mausolea, and both the 101st Street and 114th Street entrances (including a bridge over the Troy and Boston Railroad on Oakwood's western border to the 101st Street entrance). Boetcher incorporated exceptional landscape design techniques during his tenure; Oakwood developed shifting landscape scenery: some areas are dominated by flowing lawns while others comprise dense foliage. Boetcher brought in rare and foreign plants to help beautify the cemetery, including umbrella <b>pines</b> <b>and</b> Colorado blue spruce.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{appeared}} in four films in 2012, including the critically acclaimed The Place Beyond the <b>Pines</b> <b>and</b> Silver Linings Playbook. His {{performance in the}} latter in particular was widely praised, and earned him nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor, among other awards. Cooper's profile continued to expand as he took on major roles in several successful films—American Hustle (2013), Guardians of the Galaxy, and American Sniper (both in 2014). After receiving Academy Award nominations for American Hustle and American Sniper, he became the tenth actor in history to receive an Academy Award nomination in three consecutive years. Cooper returned to stage work for a 2014 Broadway production of The Elephant Man, where he played the severely deformed Joseph Merrick. His performance drew praise from critics, and earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. None of his 2015 films—Aloha, Burnt, or Joy—performed particularly well at the box office. In 2016, he {{appeared in}} the comedy drama War Dogs that he also co-produced under his and Philips' production company, Joint Effort.|$|E

50|$|Pinus contorta, {{with the}} common names {{lodgepole}} <b>pine</b> <b>and</b> shore <b>pine,</b> <b>and</b> also known as twisted <b>pine,</b> <b>and</b> contorta <b>pine,</b> is a common tree in western North America. It is common near the ocean shore and in dry montane forests to the subalpine, but is rare in lowland rain forests. Like all pines (member species of the genus Pinus), it is an evergreen conifer.|$|R
5|$|It is ectomycorrhizally {{associated}} with several tree species and is symbiotic with them. In Europe, these include hardwood and, less frequently, conifer species. It appears most commonly under oaks, but also under beeches, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, birches, filberts, hornbeams, <b>pines,</b> <b>and</b> spruces. In other areas, A.phalloides {{may also be}} {{associated with}} these trees or with only some species and not others. In coastal California, for example, A.phalloides is associated with coast live oak, {{but not with the}} various coastal pine species, such as Monterey pine. In countries where it has been introduced, it has been restricted to those exotic trees with which it would associate in its natural range. There is, however, evidence of A.phalloides associating with hemlock and with genera of the Myrtaceae: Eucalyptus in Tanzania and Algeria, and Leptospermum and Kunzea in New Zealand. This suggests the species may have invasive potential.|$|E
5|$|On May 31, as McClellan planned an assault, {{his army}} was {{surprised}} by a Confederate attack. Johnston saw that the Union army was split in half by the rain-swollen Chickahominy River and hoped to defeat it in detail at Seven <b>Pines</b> <b>and</b> Fair Oaks. McClellan was unable to command the army personally because of a recurrence of malarial fever, but his subordinates were able to repel the attacks. Nevertheless, McClellan received criticism from Washington for not counterattacking, which some believed could have opened the city of Richmond to capture. Johnston {{was wounded in the}} battle, and General Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia. McClellan spent the next three weeks repositioning his troops and waiting for promised reinforcements, losing valuable time as Lee continued to strengthen Richmond's defenses.|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone <b>pines,</b> <b>and</b> more rarely silver firs.|$|E

50|$|New Mexico's {{mountain}} ranges support {{a wide variety}} of plant life. In the Rocky Mountains, the slopes have forests of Douglas fir, ponderosa <b>pine,</b> <b>and</b> aspen trees at lower elevations. At higher elevations, the forests include Engelmann spruce, firs, Rocky Mountain white <b>pine,</b> <b>and</b> various aspens. Above the timberline of the mountains is alpine tundra. Most other {{mountain ranges}} in New Mexico predominantly include ponderosa <b>pine</b> <b>and</b> Douglas firs.|$|R
50|$|Pinyon <b>pine</b> <b>and</b> Utah juniper {{dominate}} the southern {{slopes of the}} mesa, while ponderosa <b>pine</b> <b>and</b> alligator juniper are more prevalent on northern slopes. Frequently seen are black bear, elk, mule deer, bobcats, and Abert's squirrels.|$|R
5|$|US 113 closely {{parallels}} the railroad west of Friendship to north of its right-in/right-out junction with MD 575 (Worcester Highway), an interchange only {{accessible to the}} northbound U.S. Highway. The route leaves the railroad track and meets MD90 (Ocean City Expressway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange; MD90 connects {{the northern part of}} Ocean City with US50 west of Berlin. US113 continues north to its interchange with the northern end of MD575 and MD589 (Racetrack Road), which leads to Ocean <b>Pines</b> <b>and</b> Ocean Downs, a harness racing track with a slot machine casino. The exit ramp from northbound US113 intersects MD575 a short distance south of its intersection with MD 589, and the southbound ramps connect with West Frontage Road (unsigned MD 575A), which serves St. Martin's Episcopal Church.|$|E
5|$|After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, {{they were}} {{replaced}} about 36million {{years ago by}} eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of {{what would become the}} Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid down on top of the Clarno Strata, the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, saber-toothed tigers, horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata, such as hydrangea, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as <b>pines</b> <b>and</b> many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
