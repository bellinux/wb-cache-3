40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine the modulatory effects of nitric oxide (NO) -releasing compounds on increases in cytosolic ionized calcium ((Ca 2 +) i) and on aggregation of gel-filtered and human platelets induced via diverse agonists. We used various sydnonimines and organic nitrates as donors of NO. Gel-filtered and fura- 2 -loaded platelets were stimulated with ADP, collagen, or thrombin, respectively. Half-maximal inhibiting effects of sydno- nimines on agonist-evoked increases in (Ca 2 +) i were observed between 30 and 1000 nM, while half-maximal inhibiting effects of the compounds on aggregation were between 3 and 500 nM. The compound C 87 - 3754, which is the bioactive metabolite of <b>pirsidomine,</b> was a much stronger inhibitor of increases in (Ca 2 +) i than of platelet aggregation. This was due to an enhanced NO release from this compound exposed to ultraviolet light during Ca 2 + measurement. The organic nitrates isosorbide 5 -mononitrate and nicorandil inhibited both aggregation and increase of cytosolic ionized calcium in stimulated platelets at half-maximal concentrations of approximately 200 nM. The present results also suggest {{that some of the}} inhibitory effects of NO-releasing compounds correspond rather to the presence of the A forms (NO-containing intermediates) than to the presence of free NO...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to compare the relaxing activities of the new sydnonimine C 87 - 3754 with SIN- 1 in arteries and veins of the dog, and to determine whether C 87 - 3754 can prevent endothelium-dependent contractions. Rings of coronary and femoral arteries, and saphenous veins were suspended in organ chambers for the measurement of changes in isometric tension. SIN- 1 and C 87 - 3754 evoked concentration-dependent relaxations in all rings of blood vessels contracted with a submaximal concentration of either prostaglandin F(2 Î±), endothelin- 1, phenylephrine, or norepinephrine. In both arteries and veins, the concentration-relaxation curves to C 87 - 3754 were shifted significantly to the right (by two to three logarithmic units) of that to SIN- 1. The presence of endothelium significantly inhibited the relaxations to SIN- 1 but did not affect those to C 87 - 3754. The treatment of coronary arteries with methylene blue or oxyhemoglobin significantly impaired the relaxations to SIN- 1 and C 87 - 3754. Neither C 87 - 3754 nor its prodrug <b>pirsidomine</b> (CAS 936) affected the membrane potential in coronary arteries. The endothelium-dependent contractions evoked by nitro L-arginine, arachidonic acid, and the calcium ionophore A 23187 in basilar arteries of the dog were inhibited by C 87 - 3754. These {{results indicate that the}} sydnonimine C 87 - 3754 is a dilator of both arterial and venous smooth muscle, and can prevent endothelium-mediated contractions in cerebral arteries of the dog. The inhibition of vascular tone is likely to involve the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, causing enhanced production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the smooth muscle without a change in membrane potential. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
