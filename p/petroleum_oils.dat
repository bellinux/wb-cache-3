40|$|Phenols in our {{environment}} come from various sources. For example, many {{are found in}} the waste waters of industries such as petroleum refineries, glue and resin manufacturers, coal processing, pulp and paper mills, and from the leaching of municipal landfills. Phenol is toxic to fish at a level of 0. 05 mg/l, therefore the removing of phenols from waste water is therefore of great importance. Produced water is the water pumped from aquifers associated with <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> production, gas production or coal bed methane production. Produced water from <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs was produced in huge amounts and it contained several pollutants, such as phenol and <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> droplets. New methods were required to reduce the amounts of toxic pollutants to permissible limits before rejecting this produced water to the environment. The produced water contained the following 4. 5 mg/L phenol, 300 mg/l <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil,</b> Cl- 62 mg/L and pH 6. 0. The effect of addition of <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> on the activity of horseradish peroxidase was determined. It was found that <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> has strong depressing effect on the activity of the horseradish peroxidase at concentrations up to 1 gm/L of <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil.</b> The effects of treating the produced water with enzyme peroxidase extracted from horseradish plant, peroxide (H 2 O 2) and polyethylene glycol have been studied. The horseradish peroxidase–hydrogen peroxide system decreased the amount of phenol present in produced water by 80 %. The most effective concentrations for treating produced water were peroxidase at 2 U/mL and 0. 5 mM hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) at neutral pH...|$|R

2500|$|Sir Robert Robinson {{studied the}} {{chemical}} makeup of natural <b>petroleum</b> <b>oils</b> in great detail, {{and concluded that}} they were mostly far too hydrogen-rich to be a likely product of the decay of plant debris, assuming a dual origin for Earth hydrocarbons.

2500|$|Better lubrication, such as from <b>petroleum</b> <b>oils,</b> reduced {{friction}} losses in mills and factories. [...] Anti-friction bearings were developed using alloy steels and precision machining techniques {{available in the}} last quarter of the 19th century. [...] Anti-friction bearings were widely used on bicycles by the 1880s. [...] Bearings began being used on line shafts in the decades before factory electrification and it was the pre-bearing shafts that were largely responsible for their high power losses, which were commonly 25 to 30% and often as much as 50%.|$|E
