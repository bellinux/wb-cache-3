50|$|Most {{products}} and services provided by the consortium are {{in the field of}} satellite-based mission critical communications, including voice, Internet and Machine-to-Machine (M2M), with emphasis on L band mobile satellite service (MSS) through the Iridium Communications and Inmarsat satellite constellations. Fixed-satellite service (FSS) / VSAT and system integration are also provided in some markets, as well as Inmarsat's Ka-band mobile service known as Global Xpress (GX). One of the group's largest projects currently involves a utility company in Brazil which uses mixed L-Band and terrestrial cellular for redundant high availability mobile <b>Push-to-talk</b> <b>communications.</b>|$|E

However, there are many services, such as downloading the audio files, voice messaging, or <b>push-to-talk</b> <b>communications,</b> where the issue of the codec delay is much less critical. This allows for a whole set of different coding techniques that could be more effective than the conventional short-term frame-based coding techniques.|$|E

Nextel's {{original}} push-to-talk technology {{operates on}} the iDen network, but Qualcomm's Qchat push-to-talk operates on the Evolution-Data Optimized Revision A (EV-DO Rev. A) mobile broadband network. Sprint-Nextel's first Qchat phones were released in June 2008. Both iDen and Qchat handsets are sold under the Nextel brand. On November 29, 2009 Sprint {{issued a statement}} to PhoneNews.com {{that there are no}} new QChat handsets on the product development roadmap, but it will continue supporting its existing QChat subscribers.|$|R
