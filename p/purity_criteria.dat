These specifications are not legally binding but very often serve as a guiding principle, especially in countries where no scientific expert committees have been established.|$|E
50|$|In the 20th century, the {{improvement}} of chemical analysis {{and the development of}} trials to identify the toxic features of substances added to foods led to the replacement of the negative lists by lists of substances allowed to be used for the production and {{the improvement}} of foods. This principle is called a positive listing, and almost all recent legislations are based on it. Positive listing implies that substances meant for human consumption have been tested for their safety, and that they have to meet specified <b>purity</b> <b>criteria</b> prior to their approval by the corresponding authorities. In 1962, the first EU directive (62/2645/EEC) approved 36 colorants, of which 20 were naturally derived and 16 were synthetic. This directive did not list which food products the colorants could or could not be used in. At that time, each member state could designate where certain colors could and could not be used. In Germany, for example, quinoline yellow was allowed in puddings and desserts, but tartrazine was not. The reverse was true in France. This was updated in 1989 with 89/107/EEC, which concerned food additives authorized for use in foodstuffs.|$|E
50|$|One very {{important}} aspect of the remit of the IOC is to draw up and update methods of analysis and standards for olive products with a view to promoting international trade and preventing fraud. To do so, it works very closely with leading chemists from its member countries who contribute their knowledge and expertise. It also cooperates with other international organisations such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) or the Codex Alimentarius Commission in order to bring their testing methods and standards into line with IOC texts. The IOC has two trade standards, one for olive oils and olive pomace oils and the other for table olives. The olive oil standard fixes the names and definitions of the different categories of olive oils and olive pomace oils as well the quality and <b>purity</b> <b>criteria</b> for each grade of product; it specifies testing methods and covers other aspects, such as food additives, contaminants, hygiene, packing, pack fill tolerances and labelling. IOC Members are committed to prohibiting the use of any product names other than those specified in the standard. The table olive standard fixes the names, definitions and requirements for all the different types, styles and trade preparations of table olives.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent developments}} in rational process design and their application in biotechnology for large-scale downstream processes. For implementing an expert system, {{it is necessary to}} divide the separation process in two parts: recovery and purification, because the information and available heuristic knowledge are different in each part. In the case of the recovery process, the implementation of an expert system, called Prot–Ex, only use heuristic rules from literature and human experts. The sequences suggested were tested with a real example and it gave a satisfactory result. For the purification process two criteria have been defined for selecting the optimal sequences, the SSC <b>criterion</b> and the <b>purity</b> <b>criterion.</b> Both criteria were implemented in an expert system, Prot–Ex–Purification. This expert system was validated with experimental examples, in two cases and, the sequences suggested were adequate and valid. However, the sequences suggested by <b>purity</b> <b>criterion</b> have lesser steps than the sequences suggested by SSC <b>criterion</b> and the <b>purity</b> algorithm spends lesser time and computational resources than SSC algorithm, then the use of <b>purity</b> <b>criterion</b> is more recommendable for selection of purification sequences.

30|$|What can {{we learn}} from this experiment? Surprisingly, the {{reconstruction}} system of Baxter and Sagart (2014), which was heavily criticized by Ho (2016) for its lack in vowel purity, seems to evince a much higher purity of vowels then all other popular reconstruction systems for Old Chinese, regardless {{of the number of}} vowels which these systems actually reconstruct. If vowel identity was indeed a valid criterion for the choice of rhyming words in Old Chinese times, this could be seen as strong evidence for the superiority of the reconstruction system by Baxter and Sagart (2014) closely followed by the system of Starostin (1989). Yet, we should be careful with our conclusions, since vowel purity is surely only one factor that may have contributed to Old Chinese rhyming practice, and we cannot be sure how important this factor was. In order to use the vowel <b>purity</b> <b>criterion</b> to favor or disfavor certain reconstruction systems of Old Chinese, more evidence on the universality or the areal prevalence of this principle in rhyming would be required. Since rhyming practice results from the interaction between language, culture, and cognition, more studies on cross-linguistic and cross-cultural rhyming practices would be needed to clearly use external criteria as evidence for or against a given Old Chinese reconstruction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Speaker {{clustering}} is {{an important}} step in multi-speaker detection tasks and its performance directly affects the speaker detection performance. It is observed that the shorter the average length of single-speaker speech segments after segmentation is, the worse performance of the following speaker recognition will be achieved, therefore a reasonable solution to better multi-speaker detection performance is to enlarge the average length of after-segmentation single-speaker speech segments, which is equivalently to cluster as many true same-speaker segments into one as possible. In other words, the average class purity of each speaker segment should be as bigger as possible. Accordingly, a speaker-clustering algorithm based on the class <b>purity</b> <b>criterion</b> is proposed, where a Reference Speaker Model (RSM) scheme is adopted to calculate the distance between speech segments, and the maximal class purity, or equivalently the minimal within-class dispersion, is taken as the criterion. Experiments on the NIST SRE 2006 database showed that, compared with the conventional Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm, for speech segments with average lengths of 2 seconds, 5 seconds and 8 seconds, the proposed algorithm increased the valid class speech length by 2. 7 %, 3. 8 % and 4. 6 %, respectively, and finally the target speaker detection recall rate was increased by 7. 6 %, 6. 2 % and 5. 1 %, respectively.

30|$|We cannot {{directly}} {{test the}} importance of vowel purity for Old Chinese rhyming, as our information regarding Old Chinese vowels relies on reconstructions, and these reconstructions {{may well have been}} proposed with the principle in mind, be it explicitly or intuitively. Whether a given reconstruction system is in strong conflict with the vowel purity principle, on the other hand, can be directly tested by inspecting the actual data. Given the restricted corpus of the Book of Odes, an exhaustive investigation of the conflicting cases is possible, and one could compare all Odes in the corpus in different reconstruction systems, just as we have illustrated for Ode 10 in Table  1. Such a qualitative evaluation has the obvious disadvantage that it would be very time-consuming, both for the experts who carry it out and for the scholars who read the reports. In order to avoid the problems resulting from manual comparisons, we propose a quantitative test that automatically measures the degree by which reconstruction systems deviate from the principle of vowel purity. By modeling Chinese rhyme data from the Book of Odes as a weighted network in which rhyme words serve as the nodes and attested rhyme occurrences in the Book of Odes are modeled as links between the rhyme words, we can not only test how well a given reconstruction system conforms to Ho’s (2016) vowel <b>purity</b> <b>criterion,</b> but we can even compare alternative reconstruction systems directly with each other.|$|R
40|$|Interactive {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} paradigm in image processing. To minimize the number of user interactions (“seeds”) required until the result is correct, the computer should actively query the human for input at the most critical locations, in analogy to active learning. These locations are found by means of suitable uncertainty measures. I propose various such measures for the watershed cut algorithm along with a theoretical analysis {{of some of their}} properties in Chapter 2. Furthermore, real-world images often admit many different segmentations that have nearly the same quality according to the underlying energy function. The diversity of these solutions may be a powerful uncertainty indicator. In Chapter 3 the crucial prerequisite in the context of seeded segmentation with minimum spanning trees (i. e. edge-weighted watersheds) is provided. Specifically, it is shown how to efficiently enumerate the k smallest spanning trees that result in different segmentations. Furthermore, I propose a scheme that allows to partition an image into a previously unknown number of segments, using only minimal supervision in terms of a few must-link and cannot-link annotations. The algorithm presented in Chapter 4 makes no use of regional data terms, learning instead what constitutes a likely boundary between segments. Since boundaries are only implicitly specified through cannot-link constraints, this is a hard and nonconvex latent variable problem. This problem is adressed in a greedy fashion using a randomized decision tree on features associated with interpixel edges. I propose to use a structured <b>purity</b> <b>criterion</b> during tree construction and also show how a backtracking strategy can be used to prevent the greedy search from ending up in poor local optima. The problem of learning a boundary classifier from sparse user annotations is also considered in Chapter 5. Here the problem is mapped to a multiple instance learning task where positive bags consist of paths on a graph that cross a segmentation boundary and negative bags consist of paths inside a user scribble. Multiple instance learning is also the topic of Chapter 6. Here I propose a multiple instance learning algorithm based on randomized decision trees. Experiments on the typical benchmark data sets show that this model’s prediction performance is clearly better than earlier tree based methods, and is only slightly below that of more expensive methods. Finally, a flow graph based computation library is discussed in Chapter 7. The presented library is used as the backend in a interactive learning and segmentation toolkit and supports a rich set of notification mechanisms for the interaction with a graphical user interface. ...|$|R
40|$|Evolution {{of purity}} {{in case of}} factorizable {{interaction}} between an open system and an environment is investigated. We derive a simple expression for purity decrease at the first instants of evolution (when purity is close to unity). We find that purity at very small times is maximal when an initial state of an open system coincides {{with one of the}} eigenstates of the interaction operator, no matter how weak the interaction is. On the other hand it is widely known that in general eigenstates of the interaction are not pointer states. Therefore the procedure of selecting pointer states by purity maximization (known as "purity sieve") should not rely on short-time purity behavior. We propose a modification of the <b>purity</b> sieve <b>criterion</b> which approximately takes into account purity evolution at longer times. As an example of its applicability we recover known results for pointer states of a particle undergoing quantum Brownian motion; we point out that the criterion is not applicable for some other models, however. It is argued that the proposed modified purity sieve may be used for selecting pointer states of a particle undergoing decoherence through collisions.

40|$|The {{relation}} between Bell-CHSH violation and factorization of Hilbert space is considered here. That is, a state which is local {{in the sense}} of the Bell-CHSH inequality under a certain factorization of the underlying Hilbert space can be Bell-CHSH non-local under a different factorization. While this question has been addressed with respect to separability, the relation of the factorization with Bell-CHSH violation has remained hitherto unexplored. We find here, that there is a set containing density matrices which do not exhibit Bell-CHSH violation under any factorization of the Hilbert space brought about by global unitary operations. Using the Cartan decomposition of $ SU(4) $,we characterize the set in terms of a necessary and sufficient criterion based on the spectrum of density matrices. Sufficient conditions are obtained to characterize such density matrices based on their bloch representations. For some classes of density matrices, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived in terms of bloch parameters. Furthermore, an estimation of the volume of such density matrices is achieved in terms of <b>purity.</b> The <b>criterion</b> is applied to some well-known class of states in two qubits. Since, both local filtering and global unitary operations influence Bell-CHSH violation of a state, a comparative study is made between the two operations.

These kinds of evaluation usually assign the best score to the algorithm that produces clusters with high similarity within a cluster and low similarity between clusters. One drawback of using internal criteria in cluster evaluation is the high scores on an internal measure do not truly result in data clustering. Additionally, this evaluation is biased towards algorithms that use the same cluster model. For example model used in k-Means clustering is naturally optimizes object distances, and a distance-based internal criterion will likely misjudge the resulting clustering. Compactness and Separateness, Silhouette value (combination of compactness and separateness) and SSQ (sum of square distance) can be used to assess the quality clustering algorithms based on internal criterion. In external evaluation, clustering results are evaluated based on the known class labels. These types of evaluation methods measure how close the clustering is to the predetermined benchmark classes. We use two main and popular external evaluation metrics including cluster <b>purity</b> and F-measure <b>criteria</b> for experiments.|$|R

It is corrosive to the skin and eyes and should be considered as hazardous to the respiratory tract. As phosphorus from the acid will not add to the total dietary phosphorus content, the use of orthophosphoric acid in animal nutrition is not expected to pose an additional risk for the environment. As orthophosphoric acid is used in food as a preservative, and its function in feed is essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary. It is expected that orthophosphoric acid would have the potential to contribute to the preservation of liquid feeds and sustain the quality of water for drinking. The FEEDAP Panel has reservations about the effectiveness of any preservative, including orthophosphoric acid, in complete feedingstuffs with a typical moisture content of ≤ 12 %...|$|E
40|$|Colour {{additives}} {{were recognized}} {{early days of}} the century. They were used to: restore the colour of processed food, to enhance the appeal of certain foods and for preservation and improvement of appearance of food. Colour additives approved for use in food had been evaluated and given an E-number (signifies approval of additives by European Union(EU)), and as a consequence a list of permitted colours that satisfies the <b>purity</b> <b>criteria</b> was defined and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) was allocated. It was approved that the misuse of colour additives had accumulative effects and leads to chronic disease. This study aimed to determine the types of colours added to traditionally prepared sweets collected from Molid Elnabawi festivals at Khartoum state and to investigate whether the added colours are permitted for use as food additives. 150 different samples of traditionally prepared Halwa Molid were collected from Molid Elnabawi festivals at Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman cities during May 2005 using the mathematical method of sampling which stated that the representative samples equal the square root of the total numbers of samples. The samples were analyzed for identification of colour additives used. The analysis of the samples was carried out according to the qualitative method, using paper chromatography technique. The result of the analysis showed that, only four samples (2. 67 %) contain natural colour, 99 samples (66 %) contain synthetic permitted food colour and 47 samples (31. 33 %) contain unidentified food colour. Therefore these results indicated that there should be strict control by government health authorities for manufacturing and selling such types of sweets and the consumers should be informed of the risks and hazards caused by the unpermitted colour additives...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids of the European Food Safety Authority was {{requested}} to evaluate 56 flavouring substances in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 6, Revision 4, using the Procedure in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1565 / 2000. This revision is made {{due to the}} inclusion of six additional flavouring substances, (-) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 6 -octen- 1 -ol [FL-no: 02. 229], dec- 4 (cis) -enal [FL-no: 05. 137], neral [FL-no: 05. 170], trans- 3, 7 -dimethylocta- 2, 6 -dienal (geranial) [FL-no: 05. 188], trans- 3 -hexenyl formate [FL-no: 09. 562] and cis- 3 -hexenyl 2 -methylbutanoate [FL-no: 09. 854]. None of the substances were considered to have genotoxic potential. The substances were evaluated through a stepwise approach (the Procedure) that integrates information on structure-activity relationships, intake from current uses, toxicological threshold of concern and available data on metabolism and toxicity. The Panel concluded that the 56 substances [FL-no: 02. 125, 02. 138, 02. 152, 02. 170, 02. 175, 02. 176, 02. 195, 02. 201, 02. 222, 02. 229, 02. 234, 05. 061, 05. 082, 05. 137, 05. 143, 05. 170, 05. 174, 05. 188, 05. 203, 05. 217, 05. 218, 05. 220, 05. 226, 08. 074, 08. 100, 08. 102, 09. 341, 09. 368, 09. 377, 09. 562, 09. 567, 09. 569, 09. 572, 09. 575, 09. 612, 09. 638, 09. 640, 09. 643, 09. 672, 09. 673, 09. 674, 09. 831, 09. 838, 09. 854, 09. 855, 09. 871, 09. 872, 09. 884, 09. 885, 09. 897, 09. 898, 09. 928, 09. 937, 09. 938, 09. 939 and 09. 950] do not give rise to safety concern at their levels of dietary intake, estimated {{on the basis of}} the MSDI approach.

40|$|The {{official}} {{regulations for}} {{the control of the}} olive and olive pomace oils of the European Union (EU) and International Olive Oil Council (IOOC) include the determination of fatty acids in order to be applied to several <b>purity</b> <b>criteria.</b> The determination of fatty acids require the preparation of the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) for the subsequent analysis by gas chromatography with good precision and reproducibility. Among the methods used in the laboratories of both the industries and the official institutions looking after the olive oil control, the ones selected were: 1) cold methylation with methanolic potash and 2) hot methylation with sodium methylate followed by acidification with sulphuric acid in methanol and heating. A statistical assessment of the precision characteristics were performed on the determination of fatty acids using both methods by a collaborative trial following the directions included in the AOAC regulation (AOAC 1995). In oils with low acidities, the results obtained for both methylation methods were equivalent. However, the olivepomace oil sample (acidity 15. 5 %) showed significative differences between the fatty acid compositions obtained using both methylation methods. Finally, the methylation with the acidic+basic method did not yield an increase of the trans-isomers of the fatty acids. Los m&# 233;todos oficiales para el control del aceite de oliva y de orujo de oliva de la Uni&# 243;n Europea (UE) y del Comit&# 233; Ole&# 237;cola Internacional (COI) incluyen la determinaci&# 243;n de &# 225;cidos grasos en la aplicaci&# 243;n de varios criterios de pureza. La determinaci&# 243;n de &# 225;cidos grasos requiere la preparaci&# 243;n de los &# 233;steres met&# 237;licos de los &# 225;cidos grasos (FAME) y su posterior an&# 225;lisis mediante cromatograf&# 237;a de gases con una buena repetibilidad y reproducibilidad. Entre los muchos m&# 233;todos usados por los laboratorios de la industria y de los organismos oficiales de control, se seleccionaron los siguientes: 1) metilaci&# 243;n en fr&# 237;o con potasa metan&# 243;lica y 2) metilaci&# 243;n en caliente con metilato s&# 243;dico seguido de acidificaci&# 243;n con &# 225;cido sulf&# 250;rico en metanol y calentamiento. Se realiz&# 243; una evaluaci&# 243;n estad&# 237;stica de la precisi&# 243;n de la composici&# 243;n de &# 225;cidos grasos obtenidos usando ambos m&# 233;todos de metilaci&# 243;n, mediante un estudio colaborativo siguiendo las indicaciones recogidas por la AOAC (AOAC 1995). En aceites con baja acidez, los resultados obtenidos usando ambos m&# 233;todos de metilaci&# 243;n fueron equivalentes. Sin embargo, en la muestra de aceite de orujo crudo de oliva (acidez 15. 5 %) se apreciaron diferencias significativas en la composici&# 243;n de &# 225;cidos grasos obtenidos usando ambos m&# 233;todos. Finalmente, el uso del m&# 233;todo de metilaci&# 243;n en caliente no dio lugar a un aumento de la concentraci&# 243;n de is&# 243;meros trans...|$|E
