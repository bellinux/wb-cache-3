40|$|By {{harvesting}} scattered large trees, {{selective logging}} increases light availability and thereby stimulates growth and crown expansion at early-life stage among remnant trees. We assessed {{the effects of}} logging on total and merchantable bole (i. e., lowest branch at crown base) heights on 952 tropical canopy trees in French Guiana. We observed reductions in both total (mean, - 2. 3 m) and bole (mean, - 2. 0 m) heights {{more than a decade}} after selective logging. Depending on local logging intensity, height reductions resulted in 2 - 13 <b>percent</b> <b>decreases</b> in aboveground tree biomass and 3 - 17 <b>percent</b> <b>decreases</b> in bole volume.

Owing to the effects of Cyclone Dina and several other meteorological factors, the economy of Mauritius suffered significantly in 2002 as a whole.

The biggest hit was in late February 2012, an EF4 tornado hit Harrisburg during the 2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak. The southern part of the city was heavily damaged, with houses and businesses destroyed, many of which were completely leveled. Eight people were killed and 110 were injured by that tornado.

The approach is to introduce the vibration of received video quality into the QoS metric and make the receivers more negative in subscribing higher layers when bandwidth increases.

Simulated experiments on NS- 2 {{have been carried out}} to validate the algorithm. The result shows an improvement of 6. 8 percents increase in received data rate and 6. 0 <b>percents</b> <b>decrease</b> in data loss rate. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the financial impact of sharing a superintendent. Fifteen schools, that shared a superintendent in 1998 – 1999 and were still sharing in a superintendent in 2001 – 2002, were studied. Each of the 15 districts was paired with a district of similar size, resources, and cost grouping that did not share a superintendent. Financial data was obtained from the Annual Financial Report and from the Nebraska State Aid Supplement.

25|$|The {{most common}} forms {{of skin cancer}} in humans, basal and {{squamous}} cell carcinomas, have been strongly linked to UVB exposure. The mechanism by which UVB induces these cancers is well understood—absorption of UVB radiation causes the pyrimidine bases in the DNA molecule to form dimers, resulting in transcription errors when the DNA replicates. These cancers are relatively mild and rarely fatal, although the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma sometimes requires extensive reconstructive surgery. By combining epidemiological data with results of animal studies, scientists have estimated that every one <b>percent</b> <b>decrease</b> in long-term stratospheric ozone would increase the incidence of these cancers by two percent.|$|E

25|$|Brown et al.

However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using ordinary least squares vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 {{percent increase in the}} minimum wage caused a 1 <b>percent</b> <b>decrease</b> in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate.
