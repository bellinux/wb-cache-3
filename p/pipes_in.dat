5|$|In the United States, {{diamonds}} {{have been}} found in Arkansas, Colorado and Montana. In 2004, a startling discovery of a microscopic diamond in the United States led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> a remote part of Montana.|$|E
5|$|The sinkhole's {{collapse}} in Guatemala City's Zona 2 left at least 15 dead, and a further 300 residents' lives were put at risk. Because {{of the role}} played by sewage <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> the sinkhole's collapse, Sam Bonis, along with other geologists, has demanded that the government inspect the sewer system more regularly.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E

5000|$|All copper <b>pipe</b> <b>in</b> Australia are {{referenced}} to their DN (diamètre nominal) number, {{which is the}} closest metric equivalent to a pipe's Imperial size. For example, DN20 is the size for copper pipe with an outside diameter of 19.05 mm or 3/4 inches. Note that <b>pipe</b> sizes <b>in</b> Australia are classified differently than in the United States. In other words, a 3/4" [...] copper <b>pipe</b> <b>in</b> Australia has an actual outside diameter of 3/4" [...] whereas a 3/4" [...] copper <b>pipe</b> <b>in</b> the United States has an actual outside diameter of 7/8". Imperial pipe sizes correspond to their actual outside diameters.|$|R

In 2004, the discovery of a microscopic diamond in the U.S. led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> a remote part of Montana. The Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas is open to the public, and is the only mine in the world where members of the public can dig for diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The chapel's organ has 7,897 <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> 135 {{ranks and}} 109 stops. It was {{designed}} by Ernest M. Skinner and installed in 1928. Skinner invented the contra fagotto stop for the Princeton chapel organ {{in response to a}} request by Princeton's director of music. In 1990 the organ was dismantled and shipped to England for a major restoration by Mander Organs. Thomas Trotter gave the re-opening recital on the restored organ in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} May 1965 and NTNF {{planned to use}} {{as much of the}} mining company Kings Bay's {{facilities}} as they could. NTNF was allowed to use buildings as needed for free. In exchange, NTNF maintained the entire village and paid insurance on the buildings they used. Movable property used by NTNF was bought for a moderate price. NTNF had to build several new buildings in addition to utilities such as power cables and water, sewer and heating pipes. The new pipes had to be installed after the previous pipes, installed in 1956, had been subject to frost burst. Instead of building the <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> a culvert, they were instead placed in wooded boxes above ground. During the summer of 1965, 65 people were working on construction, although it fell to between 40 and 45 during the winter. The following winter, only five people overwintered.|$|E

The citizens proceeds to burn the guns Peter had made with the <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the town square, but as the final gun in thrown onto the pile, hundreds of newly spawned Octopus-Stewies begin to destroy the city, with the townspeople unable to protect themselves from the mutants. As the family walks away, oblivious to the town's destruction, they decide to continue to a Carvel factory in Framingham.|$|E
5|$|The dragon motif is {{repeated}} in the radial coffers of the caisson and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre. The Imperial dragon is accompanied by {{the symbol of the}} Empress, the Chinese phoenix (Fèng huáng), sometimes called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese. This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but most prominently in relief as part of the grills above false balconies that once screened organ <b>pipes.</b> <b>In</b> addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre. The highly decorated proscenium arch and safety curtain maintain the Chinese design influence.|$|E

25|$|Copper and {{aluminium}} {{are used}} as heat sinks and heat <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> electronic cooling applications. A heat sink is a passive component that cools semiconductor and optoelectronic devices by dissipating heat into the surrounding air. Heat sinks have temperatures higher than their surrounding environments so that heat can be transferred into the air by convection, radiation, and conduction.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} taxation revenue from existing and potential mines in the area, the six square mile Municipal Corporation of the Township of Teck was formed with Wellington J.

25|$|Some {{time before}} 1799 the siren {{was invented by}} the Scottish natural philosopher (physicist) John Robison. Robison's sirens were used as musical instruments; specifically, they powered some of the <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> an organ. Robison's siren {{consisted}} of a stopcock that opened and closed a pneumatic tube. The stopcock was apparently driven by the rotation of a wheel.|$|E

The cup may be filled to the line without any fluid passing into the <b>pipe</b> <b>in</b> the center of the cup. However, when the amount of fluid exceeds this fill line, fluid will overflow into the <b>pipe</b> <b>in</b> the center of the cup. Due to the drag that molecules exert on one another, the cup will be emptied.|$|R

25|$|In 1952, {{the concept}} of {{installing}} perforated <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> dams was introduced to control water levels at the Northeastern Wildlife Conference as a solution for problem beaver ponds. In 1963, Laramie reported that the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department had successfully installed and maintained beaver <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> 46 dams. In 1978, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation began designing and testing various culvert protection devices, of which the T-culvert guard was {{the most effective and}} cost-beneficial. In 1992, Clemson University developed the Clemson Beaver Pond Leveler, a device that prevented beavers from damming areas of concern by directing water through existing dams using a strategically designed pipe system. Over the years, these designs have been modified and improved in order to address flow problems that occur in a variety of different landscapes. The most recent innovations in flow devices combine fencing techniques which exclude beaver with pipe systems which deceive beaver.|$|E
25|$|Plans for the 2006 {{improvements}} to the park included installing new pumps and <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the rest rooms, water taxi landings and surrounding docks, and installing wireless internet access hubs.|$|E
25|$|Robert Hope-Jones {{and others}} {{designed}} many {{new kinds of}} <b>pipes</b> <b>in</b> an effort to create colorful sounds for the theatre organ.

Important new stops invented or refined by Hope-Jones included the Tibia Clausa, Tibia Plena, and the Diaphone.|$|E
