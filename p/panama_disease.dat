The Victoria continued sailing westward, commanded by Juan Sebastián Elcano, and managed to return to Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain in 1522.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Publications {{are often}} used {{as a measure of}} success in {{research}} work. Chagas disease occurs in Central and Southern America. However, during the past years, the disease has been occurring outside Latin America due to migration from endemic zones. This article describes a bibliometric review of the literature on Chagas disease research indexed in PubMed during a 70 -year period. METHODS: Medline was used via the PubMed online service of the U. S. National Library of Medicine from 1940 to 2009. The search strategy was: Chagas disease [MeSH] OR Trypanosoma cruzi [MeSH]. RESULTS: A total of 13, 989 references were retrieved. The number of publications increased steadily over time from 1, 361 (1940 - 1969) to 5, 430 (2000 - 2009) (coefficient of determination for linear fit, R²= 0. 910). Eight journals contained 25 % of the Chagas disease literature. Of the publications, 64. 2 % came from endemic countries. Brazil was the predominant country (37 %), followed by the United States (17. 6 %) and Argentina (14 %). The ranking in production changed when the number of publications was normalized by estimated cases of Chagas <b>disease</b> (<b>Panama</b> and Uruguay), population (Argentina and Uruguay), and gross domestic product (Bolivia and Brazil). CONCLUSIONS: Several Latin American countries, where the prevalence of T. cruzi infection was not very high, were the main producers of the Chagas disease literature, after adjusting for economic and population indexes. The countries with more estimated cases of Chagas disease produced less research on Chagas disease than some developed countries...|$|R

Aging is the main risk factor associated with AD. Drug discovery based on nutraceutical molecules for prevention and treatment of AD is a growing topic. In this sense, carotenoids are phytochemicals present mainly in fruits and vegetables with reported benefits for human health. In this research, the anti-amyloidogenic activity of three carotenoids, cryptocapsin, cryptocapsin- 5, 6 -epoxide, and zeaxanthin, was assessed. Cryptocapsin showed the highest bioactivity, while cryptocapsin- 5, 6 -epoxide and zeaxanthin exhibited similar activity on anti-aggregation assays. Molecular modeling analysis revealed that the evaluated carotenoids might follow two mechanisms for inhibiting Aβ aggregation: by preventing the formation of the fibril and through disruption of the Aβ aggregates. Our studies provided evidence that cryptocapsin, cryptocapsin- 5, 6 -epoxide, and zeaxanthin have anti-amyloidogenic potential and could be used for prevention and treatment of AD.
