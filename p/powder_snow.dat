25|$|The largest {{avalanches}} form turbulent suspension currents {{known as}} <b>powder</b> <b>snow</b> avalanches or mixed avalanches. These {{consist of a}} powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can form from any type of snow or initiation mechanism, but usually occur with fresh dry powder.|$|E
25|$|When a Chinook {{comes in}} when an Arctic air mass is holding steady over the coast, the {{tropical}} dampness brought in suddenly cools, penetrating the frozen air and coming down in volumes of <b>powder</b> <b>snow,</b> sometimes to sea level. Snowfalls {{and the cold}} spells that spawned them only last a few days during a Chinook; as the warm Chinooks blow from the southwest, they push back east the cold Arctic air. The snow melts quickly and is gone within a week.|$|E

50|$|Snow becomes {{suitable}} for packing when it approaches its melting point and becomes moist and compact. Making a snowman of <b>powdered</b> <b>snow</b> is difficult since {{it will not}} stick to itself, and if the temperature of packing snow drops, it will form an unusable denser form of <b>powdered</b> <b>snow</b> called crust. Thus, {{a good time to}} build a snowman may be the next warm afternoon directly following a snowfall with a sufficient amount of snow. Using more compact snow allows {{for the construction of a}} large snowball by simply rolling it until it grows to the desired size. If the snowball reaches the bottom of the grass it may pick up traces of grass, gravel or dirt.|$|R
25|$|An {{avalanche}} (also {{called a}} snowslide) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical {{failure in the}} snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a <b>powder</b> <b>snow</b> avalanche, which {{is a type of}} gravity current.|$|E
25|$|When a slab {{avalanche}} forms, {{the slab}} disintegrates into increasingly smaller fragments {{as the snow}} travels downhill. If the fragments become small enough the outer layer of the avalanche, called a saltation layer, takes {{on the characteristics of}} a fluid. When sufficiently fine particles are present they can become airborne and, given a sufficient quantity of airborne snow, this portion of the avalanche can become separated from the bulk of the avalanche and travel a greater distance as a <b>powder</b> <b>snow</b> avalanche. Scientific studies using radar, following the 1999 Galtür avalanche disaster, confirmed the hypothesis that a saltation layer forms between the surface and the airborne components of an avalanche, which can also separate from the bulk of the avalanche.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>powder</b> <b>snow</b> avalanches, wet snow avalanches are a low velocity suspension {{of snow and}} water, with the flow confined to the track surface (McClung, first edition 1999, page 108). The low speed of travel {{is due to the}} friction between the sliding surface of the track and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~10–40km/h), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density. The body of the flow of a wet snow avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed, and often scored, ground in the avalanche track. Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snow packs that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The isothermal characteristic of wet snow avalanches has led to the secondary term of isothermal slides found in the literature (for example in Daffern, 1999, page 93). At temperate latitudes wet snow avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles {{at the end of the}} winter season, when there is significant daytime warming.|$|E

50|$|Types of snow can be {{designated}} by the shape of its flakes, description of how it is falling, and by how it collects on the ground. A blizzard and snow storm indicate heavy snowfalls over a large area, snow squalls give heavy snowfalls over narrow bands, while flurries are used for the lightest snowfall. Types which fall {{in the form of}} a ball, rather than a flake, are known as graupel, with sleet and snow grains as types of graupel. Once on the ground, snow can be categorized as powdery when fluffy, granular when it begins the cycle of melting and refreezing, and crud or eventually ice once it packs down into a dense drift after multiple melting and refreezing cycles. When <b>powdering,</b> <b>snow</b> drifts with the wind or ground blizzard, sometimes to the depth of several metres. After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.|$|R

The suite uses electroluminescent wire to capture the art style of the film.

5000|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>powder</b> (or <b>snow</b> sugar) is a non-melting form of {{icing sugar}} usually {{consisting}} of dextrose, starch and anti-binding agents, useful for retaining its structure when dusted onto cakes or pastries that require refrigeration.
